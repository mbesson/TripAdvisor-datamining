I go on holiday every year and often use budget hostels and hotels. This is the worse place both me and my partner have ever experienced in both service and the place itself. When we first arrived at the hostel, rather than being treated like adult paying customers, we were treated like children given a long list of rules that we had to adhere to. Fresh bed linen was charged as extra and we had to make our own beds ourselves before bed time. The rooms themselves could only be described as resembling something I imagine a prison for the criminally insane would look like. They were depressing and no effort had been made to make this place look welcoming and comfortable. The coffee table we had in our room, I have actually seen used in hospitals. The communal showers were smelly and dirty and I actually could not bring myself to use them. The shower curtains looked like they had never been clean and were not even put up properly so there was no chance of any privacy while showering. I made a complaint about how disgusting the showers where and all I got was excuses saying it was the time of day and the cleaners had not been around, I was told that there were nicer showers upstairs of the hostel which I was welcome to use in the morning. After a very uncomfortable night, I then had to change my own bed and put the linen in these big bins in the hallway which also resembled something I imagine they provide in prisons. I did use the upstair showers as the ones downstairs where still filthy. This shower however was little better the only good thing I can say about the shower is that It had a door so privacy was given, which had to be left ajar as the light was not turning on. It did look like it had never been cleaned, it smelled disgusting. The shower, the floor and the sink were all filthy. The drain was blocked so while I was trying to have a quick wash dirty smelly water was building up around my feet. When I made a complaint I felt that the businesses opinion is if you do not like it, then do not stay rather than taking on what I had said and doing something about it, like cleaning the showers and fixing the things that were not working. Breakfast was also not included. I had stayed in 3 hotels including this one during my stay in Berlin and looked at about 5 or more others when looking for places to stay and for service, cleanliness, price, and the place itself it is the worst I have seen. the two other hotels I stayed at were both cheaper and nicer rooms and a much better service. In the other places i stayed a lovely breakfast was served at no extra cost, the rooms were welcoming and comfortable and the service was friendly and really helpful. This place is a total rip off, and I really suggest trying anywhere else but here. I am not a fussy customer, I understand when you get a budget hotel your not going to be staying in the height of luxury but when you are paying less in so many other places in berlin for somewhere ten times better. I really do feel for anyone who ends here. Its better then sleeping on the streets but that is about it. I would give this place 0 out of 10.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOnly for those who don't need privacy or comfort\u201d", "Author": "marisacrowley", "ReviewID": "UR80909401", "Content": "We stayed at HostelxBerger only when our other accommodations fell through and we were desperate for a bed. These are pretty much the only circumstances under which I would stay there in the future as well. We first had a six-bed room, then a 16-bed room. Though they do give you fresh linens upon arrival, the mattresses and pillows looked disgusting and I hardly felt comfortable putting my clean linens over them. The shared bathrooms were always hot and stuffy, and not always clean, and the showers had no dressing area and had curtains too small for the doorway - meaning that you and all of the other people showering have no privacy whatsoever. There is a kitchen with fridge, stove, pots, pans, etc. which is nice, but it was always crowded and the fridge stuffed with everyone's leftover food - gross. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, but extremely slow since they only have one person doing everything at once. The common area is always loud, and while there is free internet, it for some reason didn't work on our computer (a few others had the same problem). If you plan to party in Berlin and just need a place to crash, this will do, but if you want any privacy or comfort in your accommodations, I would not recommend this hostel.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cAscetic hostel in great location\u201d", "Author": "ezrock", "ReviewID": "UR47499534", "Content": "Our double room had three beds. There was only a few small shelves and two lockers in the room: no lights for reading, just two fluorescent lights and one of them was burnt out. The \"double bed\" was actually two singles pushed together and in the middle there was a hard part. I can't really recommend this to couples if you never know what you're going to get. Friends told me their double actually had a good double bed and some 50s decoration. The room itself was tidy, not dirty. We didn't use the common areas but toilets and showers were also very clean. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We canceled two nights and went to a friend's place because the room was so ascetic. Location is superb but in the summer time you barely see any locals because this is the hottest touristic spot for backpackers right now. It is easy to see why: clubs, bars and cheap restaurants in every corner. In October it seemed the hostel was almost empty.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot clean but good location\u201d", "Author": "dantri", "ReviewID": "UR17235658", "Content": "Our room was right at the front of the hostel.
