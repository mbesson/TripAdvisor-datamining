This was one of the quietest rooms I've ever stayed in. It's hard to believe the hustle and bustle of a big city is right outside your room. The hotel is also small, so there was never a long wait for front desk service, or for elevators. It was a very short walk, with no hills, from the BART station, and close to almost everything we wanted to see and do. Don't bother with a car in San Francisco!! It is a terrific city for walking, and take busses, Muni, and cabs when you need to. We love Cafe de la Presse, across the street, for a very \"Parisian\" feeling breakfast, and Starbucks is right there too. Chinatown starts next door, and Union Square is a five minute walk away. Of course, we liked the \"Green\" aspect of the hotel too. Since I was traveling alone with my teenage son, it was quite a bonus to be able to go downstairs for a glass of Napa's finest, for a little adult break, while still in the same hotel. This would probably not be available in other hotels of this size. We did encounter a few problems with viewing pay per view movies and playing the free DVDs available, but my son was won over by the free treat that came along with the service, and they did try to remedy the problem. Also note that many hotels in this area (of the same star rating) are slightly cheaper, but are typically older, with thinner walls and no central air, so you have to open up a window to the noise of the city. Some of them are on very busy, congested streets, or have difficulty keeping the less charming aspects of the city (homeless, beggars) away from their front doors. We were able to walk in the area well past dark and feel very secure. So, for these reasons, I would say this was almost a four-star experience.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Eco-friendly Hotel.

It was a busy time, and we were probably a bit naive, but they should probably warn people that it will take a while. I assume an hour was way longer than normal as when they realised how long it actually took they waived the parking fee. I think the moral is to ditch the car in San Francisco!

The hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t huge, about 10 stories with 10 or so rooms on each floor, but large enough to not to feel cramped which can happen with some boutique hotels. The location between Union Square and China Town is convenient and provided easy access to the cable car down to the Warf. The rooms are a bit on small side but well-appointed and comfortable. The 1st room we were given had a sliding bathroom door which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to close completely and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily provide full privacy. The room was still fine for us but we were adjacent to a family with young, very upset, screaming children. After waiting it out it died down so we thought the worst was over. The next morning it continued again and we decided to change rooms and the hotel was very accommodating to this request. We were moved to a room on the top floor which we liked very much. This one was a corner room with a very large 5 piece bathroom. I imagine all rooms in this hotel have their own unique floor plan. The staff at the Orchard Garden is very friendly and helpful. Being in town for fleet week was a fluke on our end since this was just a loosely planned quick trip for us to get out of town. But it made the public transportation a nightmare. We planned to take busses, cable cars, etc., around town but the waits, especially from the Warf, were just too long to waste our time on. We waited for a muni bus for about 30 minutes only to have it wave to us as it passed by because it was too full by the time it got to our stop (happened twice). So to get around town we ended up using mainly town cars because they were easier to flag down and cabs were few and far between and always full. Not sure if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always this bad, but it was our experience over this weekend. Up bush there is a small market to get some snacks if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like getting them from the mini bar. There is also another small market at Bush and Kearny. We ate brunch at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de la Presse across the street one morning and it was very good. We ate at the hotel twice, once for breakfast and once for room service dinner. Both meals were good and I feel the food was better than average as far as hotel restaurants go. We ate in the Warf and in Union square, but nothing really worth mentioning. For our last meal we walked down about 1 \u00c2\u00bd blocks down bush on the left, and found several restaurants tucked into an alley. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the name of the one we chose, but the food was good.

Then we had problems with the safe, maintenance guy was called up and he wasted over 30 mins trying to sort the safe out, despite us saying that we had decided not to use it (selective hearing obviously or just plain stupid). World's strangest coffee maker at Orchard Garden (comes with no off switch). You have to disconnect at mains to switch it off and the thing leaked everywhere (it was our second coffee maker and the maid who delivered it did not speak good english, so could not explain the workings of the machine properly).

I especially liked the comments about the hotel being quiet since we've encountered noisy hotels quite often in our travels. The hotel definitely met expectations for location, noise level (which was amazing considering the location in the city), and quality of hotel (very nice). We did not eat at the restaurant, so we can't comment on it's quality. The room was adequately sized for a family of four and the beds were comfortable. We had notified the hotel of a feather allergy and our need for feather free bedding at the time of reservation, as well as the day before arrival, but the room had down bedding when we checked in. The hotel did get the bedding changed out quickly and without inconvenience to us, but considering our multiple notifications of the need for down free bedding we expected the room to be ready at check-in. The doorman/concierge we had our first night was very helpful in making restaurant recommendations and the one we went to did not disappoint. Our only issue with this hotel was parking. Although the rate was very high (as with most SF hotels), we knew the rate in advance and had no issues with cost. Our problem was the length of time it took to get our car when we wanted to use it. The hotel parking is offsite and valet ONLY. This means you need to call the front desk to request your car. The timeline was always given as 15 minutes, so we could at least plan ahead to time our call based on the time we wanted to leave. However, one morning we waited over an hour for our vehicle. We sat in the tiny lobby area with our two young children for almost 60 minutes (we didn't come down to the lobby until 10 minutes after requesting our car). It was very frustrating and an impact on our activities for the day. Ultimately it was confusion as to which car the parking attendant was looking for that caused the delay, but the hotel did nothing for us. I expected to be reimbursed for part or all of the daily parking fee, but was given no monetary credit for our inconvenience. I realize that it was an unusual delay, but ultimately the hotel should have taken responsibility and offered us something for our troubles. Overall a great choice, but would think twice about staying if you need to have your car in a timely manner.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood location with very comfortable beds\u201d", "Author": "Amy P", "ReviewID": "UR117770553", "Content": "All I really expected from Orchard Garden Hotel was a place to sleep...it met and exceeded my expectations.

Fisherman's Wharf is very busy and touristy - even though you'll want to visit, not necessarily where you want to sleep every night for several days. One of the tipping points was that for our 4-night stay, the Orchard Garden offered the \"Only in San Francisco Package\" - Including 2 City Passes and breakfast buffet for two - booked on their website. The City passes actually saved us a lot of money over that 4 days - the 2 adults in our party got free admission to the deYoung Museum and the California Academy of Sciences (both wonderful and highly recommended), as well as our cable car ride. We only had to pay for the 2 kids. For breakfast at the hotel, 2 of us ate the buffet included in our package, and the other 2 ordered off the menu. The hotel was walkable to Union Square, to the Ferry building and we walked home from a Giants game. My teenage son was impressed with the hotel's commitment to the environment.

As for more specific, I agree with others that they are rather stingy with the breakfast and would recommended getting out in the neighborhood instead.

Since I'm a priority club member I normally stay at the Mark or the Intercontinental, and mix it up with the W. But this past weekend my friend and I were on an abbreviated schedule where we were going to arrive late in the city and then leave early the next morning, so we just wanted a place to crash for the night on as little money as possible without sacrificing cleanliness, comfort and convenience. Expedia had a deal on the Orchard Garden for $111.75, and very positive reviews, so we booked it. What a find! First off, you really can't beat the location -- at the foot of Chinatown, it is literally walking distance to the Financial District and Union Square. For everywhere else, do take advantage of the valet parking even though it's $40.00, the doormen and valet were absolutely wonderful -- they immediately unloaded the car for us when we were checking in, and whisked the car away -- only to have to turn around and bring it right back when my friend and I decided to drive down to the wharf instead of getting drenched in the rain. But they didn't mind and never lost their cool or grins (which were genuine & not plastic!). In fact, the customer service was the best that I've had in any of the hotels in the city, bar none. From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, they were all warm and welcoming and extremely helpful. As for the room, it was immaculate and tastefully decorated, and had all the similar amenities that you would find at the Mark or the W. The only issue was that the \"view\" was of a large messy dumpster -- but so what, once the drapes were drawn we forgot all about it. The beds were extremely comfortable, and yes all of the eco-touches are commendable. But like other reviewers I found the toilet annoying -- the handle was hard to flush, and the flow was too weak to do a proper job. I have a low flow toilet at home, but it still does a nice job, so it must be the brand. Oh well, a minor blip in otherwise a very satisfying stay. At the cheapie rate breakfast wasn't included - but Cafe de la Presse is directly across the street, as is a Starbucks, and then there are plenty of dim sum places right around the corner -- so it wasn't missed.

Grade: A- (very good), but bordering, close to a B+ Let's get to the review: HOTEL: A very nice small, boutique-ish hotel that is literally at the foot of Chinatown on Bush St... steps from the Chinatown gate (Grant Ave). It is very convenient to obviously Chinatown, Financial District, shopping, and easy walking to Union Square & Market St. The staff was great, from front desk to porters and cleaning staff ... always greeting us with an acknowledgment and a smile, anywhere in the hotel. An A+ for the staff. The lobby is minimal, as expected for this type/size hotel. Upon entering, you are greeted with a warm front desk welcome, and to the right, a split with entry-way to their in-house restaurant, which we did not try (too many other options in SF!). After check-in, we walked a corridor (with decorative, metal perforations to see into the restaurant) to the elevator (qty 2). First impressions: clean, well-kept hotel. Additionally, this is a \"Green hotel\" ... we like that too. ROOM: Our room was very nice. Decor was very light in tone, saturated by neutral beech/blond colors in the wood for headboard, credenza/desk, nightstands, and some muted greens (in comforter/duvet). Very safe decor, maybe a bit too monotone. Comfortable Queen bed with bonus of a comfy couch (seats 3, and probably pull-out for extra people) in a sitting area by the window. View = alley & back of other buildings ...and we did hear the much-dreaded garbage-truck-pick-up in the evening (no biggie... if in the AM, might have been a minus). Fairly standard accoutrements of flat-TV on wall, mini-fridge, pay-for-snacks/drinks, in-room safe, and robes. TV is not movable, so viewing from the couch was a strain, at best. Bathroom was good sized, and very clean with basic toiletries. Some minor minuses that brought our grade down a tad: the toiletries were very small, so tubes of shampoo, body wash were barely enough for one person, let alone two. Additionally, pressing the lever for the toilet felt like a harder push than normal, and it was not a very powerful flush either. OTHER: The hotel goes \"green\" by offering recycling baskets (total of 3) for trash, as well as presumably a low-flow toilet. Again, we had to press the toilet handle hard (felt like it was lifting a bucket) to create the pressure, thus a weak flush. More obvious in their \"green\" effort was the requirement to place the room key in a slot by the entrance to initiate the electricity = European style. If you leave the room and take the key, lights go out, except for a bedside lamp and the alarm-clock. Works for us! SUMMARY: Yes, we would recommend this hotel for a nice, warm, friendly, comfortable stay in SF. It is convenient, stylish enough and very clean. We liked the sister property, Orchard Hotel, a tad more, but not that big a difference. Very good hotels ! Happy Hotel-ing !!

This area was a great place to explore the art and crafts at the flea market and outdoor skating rink, as well as the farmer's market and the great shops across the street at the Ferry Building on Saturday. Union Square was also just minutes away by foot. However, the Orchard Garden Hotel offered a less commercial reprieve from some of the other neighborhoods in the area, with some cute cafes (ok, and a Starbucks right across the street) and relative quiet. Rooms were simple and small, but clean. The bed was very comfortable. The staff at the hotel seemed quite friendly and accommodating, upgrading our room to one with a view of the neighborhood.

The cleaning is done with green, non toxic products, and the place is VERY clean, without those obnoxious smells or the toxic feel that other places have. I particularly love the light, both coming from the windows as well as from the very well place and pleasing lamps, and the feel of the materials chosen for the bedding. And find the bathrooms very pleasant, both aesthetically as well practically (with details such as a make-up mirror, that greatly helps when I have to take off my glasses!), all spotlessly clean. This time it was even better than before: as returning costumers, and honoring the special occasion, they offered us a room upgrade and a complimentary bottle of wine! Located right by the gate of Chinatown, this hotel is just the best place to walk out and go shopping, sightseeing, or to go to a conference or meeting, as we have done before. The back and interior rooms are very quiet, with very good light, and some even have views of Chinatown. The front rooms (we had one only this time) are also quiet, large, spacious and very comfortable, the kind of comfort that we value: soft and pleasant materials, non toxic environment and pleasing aesthetics, wide windows, good light, nice materials for curtains and armchairs. And the great quality of all the supportive technology: flatscreen TV, plenty of plugs for all our computer stuff, wireless internet, etc. Only good things to say about their service, that was very attentive to our needs and always friendly and present. They were able to accommodate our needs for an early check in, and were very quick to respond to any further requests we had, In previous stays, we have tried their excellent cocktails at their bar and loved them (they use these exquisite organic vodkas and juices as ingredients), and had good meals at their restaurant. We particularly recommend their happy hour deals, as the food is good and the drinks are amazing. This time we just went out and back many times, enjoying the many attractions of the city.

When I did more research, I discovered in the \"specials\" section of their website that they offer a discounted rate of $149 for a superior king room when you book three consecutive nights (\"San Francisco Triple Play\" special valid through 8/31). When I clicked on this special and attempted to book my stay, however, it only offered me the room at the regular rate of $213 a night, $64 more a night! Assuming this was just an error with the website, I called the reservations desk. They couldn't explain why I couldn't book at that rate either so they transferred me directly to the hotel. The hotel staff politely explained that this rate has blackouts, and that I must have been trying to book during the blackout. The special didn't mention blackouts, and I pointed this out. The special is worded plainly and said that if space was available, the offer was valid through 8/31. No fine print, etc.- I was very careful to pay attention. Long story short, they admitted that this is used to entice customers during times of low vacancy and that the rate is only available arbitrarily, i.e., there may only be one room available at this rate on a particular date. I'm upset because it is extremely deceptive to say that a promotion is available until a certain date if space is available (which it was), and then not honor it. I asked if they would honor their special, but they said that they weren't willing to and that the higher, regular rate is the best they could do. Bottom line is that they advertise specials to interest you, then try to charge way more. As a result, I'll go elsewhere...don't waste your time trying to use one of their specials or discounts.

We had wine and a salami and cheese plate that was very tasty. The past reviews have already said it all; conformable beds, great shampoo, friendly staff, best location for walking the city. One thing I was happy to find out about in these reviews, and I'd like to state again, was the parking. We drove here from the Central Coast. So we had a car to deal with. Parking is expensive in the city. It is $40 per night at this hotel, which is typical. We used a previous reviewers advice and parked around the corner at the St. Mary's parking garage on Kerney and California. Friday night was $32, then it was only $7 for Sat. So you can save some cash with that option. Overall, we loved this location.

Bu hey, if none of these issues matter to you, then it is a great place to stay! My husband and I stayed at the Orchard (not Orchard Garden) a few years back. We were exited to return to the hotel and got a great deal at the Orchard Garden. The problems started after resting a few hours in the room: inadequate ventilation and poor air quality. First, the windows are plugged (presumably according to California law) and there is a tiny vent underneath the window, but this is not nearly enough for fresh air. I complained about the air quality and was advised that it could be adjusted. I asked \"how,\" and soon realized she was talking about lowering the temperature in the room. I still do not understand how making it colder would make the air quality better...... The ventilation is so poor that the gets humid and uncomfortable even with the air condition on after two normal showers. Frankly: it was unpleasant. Second, there is a sliding door to the bathroom. It is thin and doesn't close all the way. Hence, there is NO bathroom privacy! Third, the air condition system is set up so that the air circulates in both rooms, thus resulting in the smells from the bathroom spreading in both rooms. So, unless you are comfortable sharing bathroom smells and noises with you partner, this hotel is not for you.

Our stay was for a total of 4 nights and we managed to get a last minute rate, otherwise it would have been at least $50 more per night. The hotel is virtually brand new and is maintained very well. The decor is simple and tasteful without being pretentious. The beds were comfortable if a little on the soft side and the pillows are large plump. We had a very restful sleep after our 14 hour trip on Christmas Day from Australia and were amazed how quiet the rooms were with the walls well insulated and the door meeting flush to keep out the corridor noises. Even though we were here for leisure, this hotel would be also be ideal for the business traveller particularly when you discover the complimentary wireless internet. The negatives were probably the hotel front desk. Although being generally friendly they probably weren't the most helpful or professional I've seen. I was kept waiting while some of the staff were having a personal conversation and I did see a staff member having his dinner behind the counter. Fortunately with the free wireless I was able to find out for myself all I needed to know. Housekeeping on the other hand was EXCELLENT and very professional. Not only were our beds turned down on returning each day but when we went out to dinner, we returned to find once again the sheets were opened for us at the corner in preparation for going to bed.

The restaurants outside of the restaurant are great, and read like an international guide (Irish, French, Thai, Hawaiian, Chinese, Italian, etc.). A few bars close. Two Starbucks, close. - The rooms are smartly designed. The place is environmentally friendly -- you have to plug your room card in to turn on the lights -- and very comfortable. They aren't elegant like the Fairmont or Hopkins, but the clean design and nice color scheme reflects the environmental nature of the hotel. The design of the room uses space well (the television is mounted high above the desk area = smart), and the bathrooms are nice. The bed is super comfortable, and so was the desk area. - The staff is super friendly. Other than not getting an early check in (remember, boutique hotel, small staff), they were more than accommodating to all of my requests, watched my car full of my things while the valet came, brought my bags up when I did get in, and even made an extra trip right away when they accidentally brought the wrong bag. Trusted them with some expensive things, and they didn't go missing. - I didn't get nickel and dimed. The WiFi was free. The business center is free for prints, one time.

Back at the Orchard Garden, they eventually agreed to refund the last 2 nights accomodation which I accepted and promptly moved to the Marriott. For what we initially paid for the room the Orchard Garden initially gave us, this was NOT value for money. Yes we did accomodate the room, no we didn't stay long enough to sleep there.

Happily, this hotel is practically brand-new and well-maintained. Everything seemed to work properly. The lights work in an European fashion--a card-activated light system to reduce wasted electricity. The water pressure in the showerhead was strong. There was both a safe and mini-fridge. The bedding offered a restful sleep. As with most urban hotels, parking can be bothersome and expensive. Luckily, the Stockton-Sutter garage is across the street and offered secure and relatively cheaper parking than the alternative. There are several coffee shops and restaurants nearby.

Some cool air appeared to be coming from the vent, accompanied by considerable fan noise, but clearly not enough to do any good.

We ate breakfast a couple of mornings, and had one evening meal - food in 'Roots' was very good. Location was excellent - just a few strides from the ChinaTown Gate. We walked a lot and had no problem finding our way around. Did also use various transport - cable cars (just for the experience), buses, trams etc - transport system is excellent. On our first full day we took a 5 hour city tour with Dylan's City Tours. There were just 13 of us in a small tour bus, and Dylan is such a great guy we felt like we were travelling with a family friend - highly recommended. We also took another tour to Carmel and Monterey with Great Pacific Tours. Once again a small tour bus with just 11 passengers and a lovely tour guide, Mary. This tour includes lunch in Carmel which was in a lovely restaurant and saved us wasting our limited time looking for somewhere to eat. Also gave us an opportunity to chat with fellow travellers. Most memorable thing we did ourselves was probably Alcatraz - definitely not to be missed, but in line with comments I have seen from previous reviewers book before you travel. We pre-booked and when we visited Alcatraz there were signs up saying sold out for next 5 days. A previous reviewer refers to a 50's diner which didn't suit them - this was probably Lori's and we loved it. I'm a sucker for all the old music and enjoyed feeding the jukeboxes, but more to the point the food and the service were excellent. We much preferred it to Sear's which is highly recommended but which we found to be dark although the food was good.

We also loved the Italian district around Washington Square, North Beach where there are lots of great places to eat.

It just has that perfect balance of everything: nice clean tasteful boutique hotel that isn't too big nor too small, fantastic location that's close to transit (walkable from BART which was a huge plus for getting from and to the airport) and restaurants/cafes/bars that's not in an overly busy noisy area. I wouldn't have wanted to stay at any of the hotels within a block or 2 of Union Square. The only kind of traveler it wouldn't suit would be the kind that could only feel comfortable in a large chain hotel. One of the things we really appreciated was the free Wi-fi at our rooms. I think an earlier reviewer of this hotel suggested booking directly with the hotel to get better rooms. I think that reviewer may be correct. We booked about 2 1/2 months in advance through Expedia and we got the smallest room at possibly the worst location and we didn't pay any less than others. We checked in mid-afternoon so it wasn't like we got the last room available. Still, the room wasn't too small and we were happy because it was very clean and well-appointed. The bathroom was quite large with nice bath products. We were right beside the housekeeping room (anyone accessing the housekeeping room could be heard) and we had no view with little natural light but even still, it wasn't too bad at all - we didn't spend that much time in the room! As for the staff, they were great anytime we needed them. One night time concierge recommended a fantastic restaurant to us that was closeby: E & O Trading Company. It was so good we went there twice! I recommend the lamb, the satay appetizer plate and the Russian River Pinot Noir! Reservations are recommended at least a few hours in advance if going on the weekend. Speaking of restaurants, we also ate at Trademark that was located on a lane way that was just north of Bush and west of Kearney (or was it east of Kearney?). That laneway had about 5 restaurants all in a row and it gets top marks for atmosphere. It reminded me of some dining experiences in France. Go there for pretty good food and fabulous atmosphere but then also go to E & O for super tasty food. Another eatery that was good was across the street called Cafe de la Presse. It's good for brunch. For brunch, one of the daytime concierges recommended Sears and also a diner that started with \"L\" I can't remember but we went there and they were just touristy 50's American style diners which didn't suit us but I'm sure many people would like that type of place. A friend who lives outside San Francisco took us to the top of Macy's where The Cheesecake Company is located. It's a super busy restaurant with a vast menu. Even though it's in Macy's, it's open until late, accessible by a private elevator. We only had dessert there - cheesecake - so I can't comment on the food but the portions were large and it draws such a huge crowd it must be pretty good or it could be just another tourist attraction? The night time view off the terrace was the best part and I recommend it for the view. One tip if taking the Powell-Hyde cable car or any cable car for that matter. Don't try to get on at the first or last stop as there will be too many people queuing to hop on. You could wait over 40 minutes to get on as the conductor won't let too many people get on at once. Walk to the next stop where there will be much fewer people waiting. You'll get on right away! We were waiting at Powell and Market to get on where there were over 100 people forming a queue and we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to get on. I discreetly asked the conductor if I could just walk to the next stop and he discreetly said yes. We did and got on right away! Oh another nice thing about the hotel...we left our luggage there after check out for an hour and when we retrieved our bags the doorman/porter told us the maid noticed I left my ipod on the dock in the room! I really appreciated their honesty. My husband would have been pretty upset with me if I had lost it! Anyway, my husband and I had a really great time in San Francisco (first visit for both of us). It's such a pretty city and even with the many tourists it attracts, it didn't feel too crowded or too busy. The Orchard Garden Hotel definitely added to our stay - who wants a bad hotel at a bad location? Go book it.

They offered to arrange a wheelchair for me and also offered to handle any arrangements that I needed. The staff are incredible! They are professional and extremely helpful! The beds were very cozy and the room was clean and very nicely decorated. I enjoyed the energy conservation and think that more hotels should offer this. They also have evening turn down service which was nice. I can't say much about the view, it was a view of other buildings and the street but you know, the noise was non existant. I read a lot of reviews about noise being such a problem in many of area hotels. This was not a problem at all, I was never troubled by noise. The only down side of the hotel is the honor bar in the rooms. It's a small broken refrigerator that has different types of very over priced drinks. Example, a can of soda is $4.00. Who wants to pay 4 bucks for a hot can of soda? There was a display in my room that was supposed to have snacks (over priced as well) but it was empty. When I brought it to the staffs attention, they advised me that they were in the middle of finding a new vendor to handle their honor bar service which was why they weren't working and items were missing. That's not a problem except that they don't even have vending machines! So if you want a drink, you either have to bring in your own or order from the restaurant. That was a bit of a drag for such a nice hotel. I think they need to just get rid of the honor bar completely and add some vending machines to this hotel. It's certainly not a service to a customer to charge them $4 for a hot can of coke.

The room was HUGE for the city. Spacious, clean, beautiful -- great flatscreen TV and DVD player, beautiful granite bathroom, ridiculously comfortable beds and linens, and a powerful shower with hot water for days. My only very minor complaint about the room is that the mini-fridge is one of those sensor-type minibars, so you can't store perishable food you might purchase on your own. We stayed for 3 nights, and on our second night, we unfortunately had some obnoxious neighbors... at 11pm they were playing guitar, singing, banging on bongos and burning incense! (I'm an extremely light sleeper, and the room was VERY quiet -- no street noise, and even these loud neighbors were a somewhat muffled noise.) I called the desk, especially because the incense was bothering me... and they took it very seriously. They didn't merely call the room and ask them to be quiet, they sent up a team of security... the noise immediately stopped, as well as the odor. The next day, I checked to see if the same people would be in the room next to me, and they were -- however, the desk told me there had been a note made in the computer about the incense and noise, and that the people had been firmly warned and they would be asked to leave immediately if I had any more problems. As someone who is a frequent business traveler, I'm kind of used to being sometimes blown off by the front desk, but the Orchard Garden took my complaints seriously. The next night, there were no problems whatsoever. The only overall negative is that we really didn't like the hotel's restaurant \"Roots.\" Food was mediocre, overpriced, not great service.

We could not have asked for a better location - the area is safe and quiet, and is centrally located within walking distance of the Piers, Union Square, and many other tourist and business sections of town. It is also very close to several different cable car lines, which makes getting around the city easy and quick. The hotel room itself was amazing - the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in! (and we've been in a lot of hotels in the US and abroad). The sheets and comforters made it feel like we were curling up in a cloud every night, which was very nice after long days of meetings and/or sightseeing. The room looked out onto the street with a great view but was still very quiet, and we never heard people in the neighboring rooms, so sleeping was easy. The hotel is \"green\" and has wonderful environmentally-themed decor and stylish recycling receptacles in the room, which we greatly appreciated. The flat-screen TV was awesome, as was the DVD player in the room and free DVDs available at the front desk - we recommend \"Escape from Alcatraz.\" Front-desk staff was friendly, and the hotel was very willing to accomodate several of our special requests. There's also a roof-top terrace with a wonderful view.

Perhaps the front desk has improved because of TA complaints but we had excellent, prompt customer service. Front desk guys were friendly and helpful. They also rushed to assist us in hailing cabs, carrying luggage etc. We were also pleased to not see hardly an homeless people and so were not badgered or made to feel unsafe during our five night stay. According to many reviews of other SF hotels this is a chronic problem. So we're not sure what to attribute it to- apparently the mayor is asking people not to give the homeless handouts so that they will avail themselves of existing services or perhaps the hotel's location was better- between Chinatown and Union Square. Someone else complained about the mattresses being uncomfortable- we thought they were quite comfy- kind of a firm foam rather than box springs but not too firm. Linens were excellent quality- seemed to be all cotton with high thread count. Climate control was good and the room could be made cool enough at night to enjoy the down duvets. Our \"superior\" room with two double beds facing the front of the hotel was quite roomy but another room facing the back with a king bed was quite small. We heard almost no noise from other guests over five nights but the king bed to the rear reported some noise issues. Street noises were also minimal in our 7th floor room. Bar service was nice and we enjoyed the free appetizers with drinks which seemed quite pricey but are probably standard for big city hotels. The dinner menu looked good but I have a fear of most hotel dining... so often mediocre. We ate breakfast one morning across the street at Cafe de la Presse- a really cute fake French place. The atmosphere was great and would definitely go there again. Breakfast was tasty although an order of toast tasted kind of old or stale.. Espresso drinks were acceptable but not great. We also ate dinner one night up the hill on Bush St at Bar Crudo. High quality ingredients and pretty good but not great unless you are a fan of sashimi.. We thought it was going to be Italian and so were disappointed in the mostly raw seafood menu. A seafood chowder was creamy and good except for cubes of lardo swimming in it. Would be improved by being plainer and less exotic. Had alot of disappointing dining experiences despite reading Zagat and SF Chronicle Best Of. RW Apple steered us wrong on the Tadich Grill- very poor food but nice atmosphere and private booths. Maybe we should have asked the hotel staff for suggestions but we didn't. Our best meals were at the Ferry Bldg. Slanted Door (Vietnamese) is excellent but very busy and expect a wait even with reservations. Also, as you face the ferry bldg, the taqueria in the bldg immediately to the left was quite tasty for lunch. Miette Bakery at the Ferry Bldg had divine pastries- bring some of their packaged cookies home as a gifts. My only minor criticism of the hotel was the daily maid service which was adequate but marginal despite leaving a good tip each day. No eye for detail- so the hotel management might want to consider hiring more females- not to be sexist.. but the maid service was marginal as I say.. kept things clean but not nicely straightened up. Would we stay here again? Yes, if a good rate was available. We had also considered the 480 which had a good expedia rate.

It took several phone calls and two visits from the staff downstairs and in the end it still didn't work.

It was kind of annoying that if the whole hotel's pay per view movies were down - and no one working that night knew. It seems that someone ought to know as opposed to taking an hour to figure it out - we definitely would have made some other plans. Also, we used the valet service and had an early flight. Since they said there was a closing time on the valet (2AM) we figured there was an opening time and wanted to make sure we'd be able to get our car at 630AM in the morning. so we called downstairs to find out and again took about an hour to confirm we'd be able to get our car out in the AM.

The rooftop garden looked quite pleasant and they encourage people to visit it and take a drink or food up there if they wish to. The breakfast buffet in the hotel was okay but not outstanding. We had drinks in the bar during happy hour and complimentary appetizers which were actually quite tasty. The drinks are expensive but with the appetizers, overall it was fine - we were interested in a light dinner and as it turned out we didn't need to go out anywhere to eat after that.

Sometimes you arrive and the hotel looks completely different from what you thought you had booked. The rooms were clean and tidy, very spacious, I liked the quirky sliding doors for the bathrooms, which as the room was spacious too. The view from the room was of the building next door, but as I booked the hotel early through Expedia at a discounted rate, that is probably why. This didn't bother us as we were more interested in getting out and about in San Francisco. I also liked the green approach that the hotel had, there were different sections in the bin for paper and plastics, we always recycle at home, why not when on holiday. The staff were all very friendly, greeting you as you came and left the hotel, offering maps and advice on what to see and getting around. There is free wi-fi, which was available in the lobby area. We visited the roof garden but it was getting quite late at night so didn't stay up there too long. The location is great, on the doorstep from China Town and only a few blocks from Union square and the main shopping area. It is a bit of a trek to the Fisherman's Wharf area, if you don't fancy the walk, you can get a muni pass that allows you to use the old fashioned trams (which is a must) and the buses that are frequent but do get busy.

Two attractions led us there. One, we stayed at the Orchard Hotel up the street, which is it's 'parent hotel', several years ago which was rated #1 at the time on tripadvisor and two, the Orchard Garden claimed to be the first 'green' hotel in California. For me, that counts and being an architect, I was curious to find out how this was achieved. Also, with the popularity of the Orchard and the time that has passed since we were last there, the rates at the Orchard were somewhat higher than at this new hotel. First, the location. It's close to the parent hotel, being on Bush St. and literally two doors down from the Chinatown Gate on Grant. That puts the hotel about 2 1/2 blocks from Union Square. Having stayed at a few hotels in the area, I would have to say this is a particularly good location as it is quiet being away from the tourist madness and cable cars of Powell St. yet close enough to find good places to eat and of course shop. Plus the street front itself is not congested with tourists. The hotel itself is quite tastefully done with interiors designed in a contemporary style with light coloured wood panelling and flooring. It was very clean throughout. The Ground Floor has the reception area, business centre (two computers), a small windowless exercise room with 3 machines, elevator lobby (2 elevators), but is largely occupied by the Roots restaurant which is also where the complimentary breakfast buffet is served (more on that later). We arrived early and staff were more than happy to check our luggage and called us when the room was ready. They provide to the room the SF Chronicle and at the front desk, the Wall St. Journal. We landed the top, 10th floor with a view down to Grant Street and adjacent towers, but not much else. The room however was very nice, but not large by any means. Again in light coloured finishes, there was a useful, long built-in shelf along the flat screen TV wall which also incorporated several drawers and the mini bar. The TV selection also included high def channels. Internet connection is wireless and free. There were two queen beds with nice bedding and appointments. There was also enough room for an armchair. The bathroom was quite nice, using a space saving sliding door, and was adequately lit. Toiletries included Aveda shampoo and Thymes conditioners and lotions which come in biodegradeable containers. Towels were nice cotton towels, but I thought should have been bamboo if \"green\" was the intent. All in all, a very comfortable room, but maybe not quite as well appointed as the rooms in it's parent, the Orchard Hotel. The 'green' aspects of the hotel don't jump out at you and perhaps that's how it should be. However other than sourcing building materials from the region, using some recycled materials and minimizing landfill debris, there are few unique aspects of the hotel that make it green. It's no Federal Building, a new very green building near Civic Centre, but then hotels don't really lend themselves well to being truely green without spending alot of money on which it would be very difficult to realize a profitable return. And as it turns out, on the LEED scale of rating green buildings, it just barely qualifies. Finally, the complimentary breakfast. Nothing to write home about and perhaps for me the least impressive/most disappointing 'feature' of the hotel. While the fare was certainly adequate, the choice, variety and inventiveness was quite pedestrian, especially given the effort made to make this a sustainable hotel I would have expected the breakfast to be more interesting. There's the regular juices and coffee. One selection of cold cut (ham) and sliced cheese, some fresh fruit, usually watermelon and cantaloupe, baked goods like bagels, sliced bread, small muffins and I think small croissants, although they were akin to those you might find in a supermarket. Cereal and hard boiled eggs pretty much rounded it out. The plates provided were rather small, perhaps limiting the take one might have. It was pretty much the same every day during our 4 days there. We did not have dinner here. Perhaps I'm dwelling too much on the breakfast and it is certainly not a deal breaker for this hotel. We had a very enjoyable stay here and would definitely recommend anyone to seriously consider the Orchard Garden. We would definitely come back here, but not because it's 'green'.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDecent Hotel; Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Squads", "ReviewID": "UR19570873", "Content": "I thought this was an above average hotel in a fantastic location.

Be sure to grab Starbucks (across the street, on both corners) and take it to the roof-top garden in the morning. Visit the bar in the hotel restaurant (Roots) and have a fantastic free appetizer (garlic fries) during happy hour (4:30-7:00 p.m.). Avoid the pseudo-french cafe directly across the street though - $$$, so-so food, and poor service. Close to Chinatown, Union Square, North Beach, cable cars, BART, Embarcadero, etc. We ate in North Beach every night (walked) and had outstanding meals (try Franchino's) and really great gelato. The walk to North Beach from the Orchard is about 15-20 minutes (Bush to Kearney to Columbus) or about a $5 cab fare. Recommend the evening tour of Alcatraz too - even if you've been on the standard day tour, check out the evening version...special presentations, less crowded, city lights - it's awesome! HornBlower on Pier 33 is the only way to go ($30 per ticket) - and about $6 cab fare. Walk the Bay Area Ridge Trail through the Presidio (free). A great urban trail that winds through forested and historic sections of the park, and culminates with amazing ocean views from the battery bluffs, and a trip across the Golden Gate bridge.

Thus the size of the most rooms must be quite large (estimated at 350-400 sqft). There is a nice patio area on the top floor with some good views of the city. Free wireless. An encounter that illustrates the helpful service at this hotel: On our last night we fancied going out for a burger. It had to be a burger, nothing else would do! It was quite late and we spotted whom we assumed to be the bar manager having a chat to one of his collegues outside the front of the hotel. We asked about the best place to get a burger considering it was quite late. His sugestions were useful. However given that it was getting on he offered to rustle up a good burger for us in the hotel restaurant if we did not want to chance being too late. This was nice as the hotel restaurant is not realy aimed at the quick burger and fries market! Nevertheless, we had an extreemly nice burger and a glass of wine in the elegant surroundings of the hotel restaurant and with excellent and helpfull service. It is little things like that that make me want to return. A case study in good customer service. The location is probably the best base for exploring the city.

Always with a smile on their faces. The room itself was cozy. Not small. It was enough room for my husband and myself. We also requested to be away from the noise and got a room that didn't have that great of a view, but since we didn't plan on staying in the hotel room for htat long, this did not matter much to us at all. The bathroom was a nice size as well. One thing that both my husband and I were really impressed with was the hotel's move to being \"green\". My husband has a knack for forgetting to turn off lights as he leaves a room, so the 'lightswitch' that can only be activated by hotel key was a nice touch. This comes in really handy for two reasons: it helps conserve energy by being able to control all the lights with one switch, but it also helps you to always remember where your room key is, and allows you to 'turn off' your lights as you leave the room for the day. <-- GREAT FEATURE My husband and I were not impressed with the prices of the minibar, but they are usually always expensive. We also didn't use the the room service or restaurant, again fo rthe prices. We had Subway Sandwiches form across the street because they were selling footlong sandwiches for 5 dollars.

Upon our arrival, we were quite favorably impressed with the room. Our room was actually large for San Francisco, and it was quite clean and lovely. The first thing that distressed me about the hotel was the fact that other than one Clif bar, I found that none of the mini-bar snacks were organic. We have stayed in green hotels and inns all around the US and Europe, and this lack of organic food was a big surprise to me. The hotel's restaurant also says nothing about organic foods on its menu, although they note that they use sustainable fish and hormone-free meats. We did eat dinner with them anyway and the food was quite delicious, but I was disappointed that it wasn't what I consider really \"green.\" Now here comes the bad part. When we checked out (after a one night stay) we found out that the parking for one night was $38.00 + $5.32 tax. I live in a city that has very high parking fees, but this seemed excessive. Whatever -- it's just play money on vacation anyway. But we found out, after arriving at the airport, they gave us the wrong car!!!!!!! Another guest had rented an identical car and they gave us his. Our car was still sitting there with a $2000 painting in the back. I called the hotel and spoke to a young man there who seemed to try and put the blame on me (didn't you notice it was the wrong car?). He never apologized, and asked me how I wanted to pay for the shipping of my painting. What? I said I didn't think I should have to pay -- so they shipped it at their cost, but it came damaged because it was packed so carelessly. He told me the manager would call me to let me know that everything was taken care of, but, of course, I never got a call back. There's more. A few days later, I found a charge for over $100 on our credit card. My husband called the hotel and they said they had no record of this charge, but agreed it was incorrect. The charge was supposed to be $43.32 for the (overpriced) parking, and the operations manager said they would refund us the parking fee (since they gave us the wrong car!!). Big mix up. Today I checked the card to make sure they had given us the refund. Oh my. They not only didn't refund us that %100+, they charged us another parking fee! Gee whiz, now they are just dipping into our funds any time they feel like it!

The property is impeccably clean, and the overall green-yellow color scheme is as soothing as it is sophisticated. The personnel were generally very helpful with everything with the exception of a single minor maintenance request that has never been attended to, eve n despite an extra reminder. There is a tiny fitness room with just a couple of machines, a business center and a hugely overrated \"roof garden\" which is basically of no use because of cast iron furniture - try to seat in one of these chairs for two minutes in fall and have your butt frozen, or for a change have it roasted after two minutes in summer. My room 1005 - top floor king - was spacious and light. The bed, mattress and linens were wonderful and the two-layer bath robe - from a local company \"Telegraph Hill\" - was easily the best I had ever worn. The bathroom was quite large, with a full bath and vanity mirrors. There was a room safe, a tea/coffee maker, HDTV unit, DVD player and an ipod docking station (=alarm clock) in the room. The air conditioning unit was effective and not noisy at all. My reservation included a complimentary breakfast - unfortunately, the same selection five mornings in a row. Valet parking was $32 + tax. There are just two specific concerns that I would like to bring my fellow travelers' attention to as they may be quite annoying. Firstly, their room access cards deactivate each time you use them to access business center. You have to trot to the front desk to have your card reprogrammed after each visit to the business center. Another - and potentially quite embarrassing - concern is the sliding bathroom door. Not only can it not be locked from the inside, there is a 2 1/2-in gap around the whole door panel opening into the rest of the room. Bearing in mind how exciting all those bathroom sounds - and smells - can be, I strongly doubt this solution was correct...

We were visiting San Francisco on our 20th anniversary, had done all my homework and picked the Orchard Garden basically because of the Trip Advisors reviews. I was given room 305, and when we entered the room we saw this horrible brick wall facing our only window. You can take a look at it in photo attached. To see the room was a big disappointment, and would of never imagined from a Hotel of this category and cost. Exaggerating a bit, we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell night from day. We booked a Value Pack, where you pay 2 nights and receive the 3rd night at 50 % off. If this was the reason for the brick wall, I would have paid happily the 3 nights at full price. I mentioned this to the front desk (Jim I think) and he said that the Hotel was full and maybe the next day he could change us. Nothing happened. The breakfast was pretty lousy. Neither hot food nor scrambled egg, which is a must for me. This might seem silly but they have very small plates, and the bread simply doesn\u00c2\u00b4t fit in them. You could see in the other tables the bread just lying in the table, which is not very hygienic. The mini bar had a system that warned you that if something was taken out for more than 20 seconds, it would charge you. Also if you put some of your own beverage it would also charge you. I found this somewhat aggressive and not customer friendly. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem a crime to put the soda you brought from outside to cool a bit in the mini-bar, especially considering the price they charge you in the mini-bar.
