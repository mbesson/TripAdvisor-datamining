The hotel has two sides and look at the street, which is some pleasant or apartment block which is not pleasant to the eye. I remark that I presented. I have not intervened the next day because I was very busy but the hotel staff did not even bother to offer me another room. Our room was number 405 and I do not recommend it. Rooms are small but tastefully furnished with clean linen and a decent bathroom. Towels in the bathroom are pretty worn out and I think it's time to replace them. I was very confused to be safe in the room with the key opens the card ... and what is that safe ????? Fortunately we had no problems. The hotel is generally very clean regardless of the wear of carpets ... Breakfast was decent, something for everyone but it certainly does not correspond to a four star hotel.

What I was particularly fascinated helt center that owns the hotel. I suggest everyone to afford a suite, sauna, Turkish bath and massage oil.

The reception/desk staff is professional, the room was very clean, maid service was prompt and efficient; the restaurant staff was incredible; friendly, well organized, kept everything well stocked on the breakfast buffet and the food was excellent. We ate breakfast every morning from the buffet and had a wide variety in which to choose; we dined in the hotel restaurant on three occasions and each meal was above average. The hotel location is ideal, as the tram is a mere 5 minute walk from the hotel and Sultanahmet is about an 8 minute tram ride. The Turkish bath, sauna and massage area in the hotel is top-notch and something we would highly recommend. It was very clean and once again, the staff was professional and couldn't have been more kind. We were given a Bosphorous tour, compliments of the hotel, and it was one of the highlights of our trip. As an extra excursion, we booked tickets through the hotel to see a service of Whirling Dervishes and the performance met my expectations, while my husband was a little less impressed, though glad to have had the experience. Initially, we were sceptical about booking this hotel, because the price was so reasonable and because the location isn't in the heart of the tourist area. The hotel is located in the district of \"Lalali\", in the Bazaar quarter, but the immediate area surrounding Yigitalp is a commercial business zone and while it's quite busy during the day, the evenings become quiet as the businesses close. We considered this a plus, as we were allowed nights of uniterrupted sleep. Also, I had my hair cut in the hotel salon and again, the service was impressive, the rates comparable to what I would pay at home and I loved the cut. I really can't say anything negative about our hotel stay, it was a pleasant surprise. After a long day of site seeing, it was always so nice to get back to our clean home away from home in the evening. This was our first trip to Istanbul and we had an incredible time.

Our room was on the top floor, we took the lift as far as it went, then had to climb the stairs to the last floor. Our room was in the eves and not suitable for somebody over six foot in height, which I am. The views from the bedroom window were breath taking, once you stood on a chair and reached the window sill. We made the mistake of leaving the window slightly open one evening, only to find that the rain poured in, luckily it damaged nothing of ours, but did pour over the hotel's badly positioned television set. If going to Istanbul for good restaurants and nightlife, I would pick a hotel in the Takism area, which comes to life at night with plenty to do, If you only want the sights and an early night this hotel is perfect. Area is very safe and a pleasure to walk in and is very handy for all transport, and the train to and from the Airport.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "merseyside england", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "alsilverfox", "ReviewID": "UR34756419", "Content": "This hotel Is Ideal for Itsl location About 5 minuteswalk to the tram stop were you can get the tram to visit all the sights within a10 minute tram ride without having to change trams the hotel was spotless and all the staff were very pleasant if you book direct with the hotel they send up to your room a basket of fruit and complimantry drinks and also they give you a free excursion plus they pick you up from and take you back to the airport", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bradford", "Title": "\u201cexcellent\u201d", "Author": "haqqaani", "ReviewID": "UR29370869", "Content": "i went to this hotel between the dates 27th april to 3rd may 2009. i booked a room for three of us. we had two single beds and an extra matress. i paid \u00c2\u00a384.00p for the room per night for three of us. i stayed in room 111. taxi from the aiport is about 15-20 minutes drive, costing around 25 turkish leira (TL). which is around \u00c2\u00a313, this depends on the time you travel. like in the uk taxi tariffs change. in turkey after 11pm and before 6am...i think this hotel is located 10 minutes walking distance from the grand bazaar and about 20 minutes from the blue mosque, haga sophia, topkapi palace. my advice if your going to travel in a taxi, then always get the taxi driver to put on the cab-meter. if the taxi driver is not prepared to use his meter then there are plenty that will do. its cheaper this way. turkish people are happy to rip you off. haga sopia, blue mosque, and the topkapi palace are located together. a taxi from yigitalp to here is around 6 turkish leira. the spice bazaar is around 10 minute walk from the blue mosque. do not use the excursion deals to these places. i paid 105 euros to see these places when i can have done it for half the price and half the time. yigitalp hotel: was excellent. very clean, very efficient. it is as the photos show. the staff are polite and very helpfull. the bath rooms and rooms are cleaned every day. the bathroom was excellent, the shower was brilliant. with instant hot water. we asked for an iron, it appeared within minutes of our call. one major down fall, the staff, other than the ones in reception, dont speak english. so when you ring housekeepiing, room service its like talking to a brick wall. i truly felt like at home at this hotel. and for the price i paid i would recommend it to my british friends. there is an internet room, which u can use for 1 euro for half an hour.there is spa room on the bottom floor. very expensive and not worth the price. you can negotiate the prices i only paid 10 TL for the jacuzzi. however there are plenty of hotels in the very heart of the old city. which is around the blue mosque, haga sophia. yigitalp is atleast 20-30 minute walk from there, a touch far really. beacuase on a night we had to taxi it to the blue mosque for a bit of night life, reatuarants, etc. if i went back i would definately go back to this hotel, but i would prefer to be alot closer to the blue mosque area of the old city. everything is near by and better night life. i hope that helps folks. happy hols", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Islamabad", "Title": "\u201cVery Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Nilli", "ReviewID": "UR25422751", "Content": "Any one planning to go to Istanbul must stay at Yigitalp.very comfortable place.the staff is so kind and helpful.i stayed there for 7 nights and my experience was very good.i had no problem at all.i was staying as single.every toursit attraction is at the walking distance the tram way is so near.The breakfast was very good with so much variety and the food at restraunt was very nice also.over all very nice and economical place.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "IntlTrainer", "ReviewID": "UR24443472", "Content": "I am the international trainer for my company and I was looking for a reasonable hotel book a training meeting for customers.

My room was adequate size with a mini bar - I like to buy my own snacks and put them in the refrigerator. The bathroom was very clean. The bed was rather hard - I prefer a soft bed. The room was also hot at times so I had to open the window. I didn't have the heater on so that was a little odd. I was on the 5th floor. I sent my laundry out and it came back fine. Not much variety of English TV stations - only the BBC. The hotel has a spa in the basement as well as a beauty salon. Again, everything is clean and reasonable. The breakfast buffet was adequate but if you stay longer than a few days, it could be boring for some people. I was happy with it. I had the free dinner and the food was fine although the service was not so good. The reception desk staff were extremely helpful and very accommodating. No problems with my bill. The local phone calls can be expensive however direct calls to the US were reasonable. The neighborhood is an area of wholesale home textile shops. There are other shops as well but lots of textile shops. The tram is a couple of blocks away and it will take you directly to the tourist area of Sultanamet.

Myself & my wife went to Istanbul for her birthday and though it would a good idea to stay in a hotel which is central and value for money. They charged EUR75 per night. Though the hotel is categorised as a four star hotel it does not have the standard of even a low end 3 star hotels. The Istanbul Yigitalp Hotel staff especially reception are horrible and very confrontational. We arrived a bit early in the morning and we told that we had prior booking. One of the staff at the reception told us we can only check in after 10:00 am. So we waited in the lounge. By around 10:30 no one even bothered to tell us that a room was ready. But a group of people (about 8) who came after us checked into their rooms before us. At 11:00am I thought I would check with the reception and he said there were rooms available. A bell boy took our luggage to a room. To our disappointment it was a small room with two single beds. We had actually paid and booked a non smoking double bed room a month ago. I rang the manager in the lobby and he said that there were no other rooms. But after I complained he said I can have another room. The bell boy took us to this room and it was small and it stank very badly of smoke. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even stand the smell. The manager was so rude and he said that there was no other room so we had to spend the 1st night in the single bed room. The other thing was that even before we checked in the manager tried to sell so many site-seeing tours even though I was not interested in them. The following day we went to the reception and told that we had booked a non smoking double bedroom but we had been given a room with two single beds. Then they tried to cover it up by saying that is was Easter and a busy time and that they will see what they can do for us and that it will be as a favour. They were very confrontational and not apologised to us even once for the inconvenience caused. This is not a four star hotel as it lacks basic tea making facilities, even two star B & B\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have these facilities. Other facilities in the room did not even match a 3 star category, like there was a loud noise coming from the heater, which needed repair.
