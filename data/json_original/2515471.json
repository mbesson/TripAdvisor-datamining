The two queen beds and sofa bed gave everyone plenty of sleeping room while the daily hot breakfasts and evening meals were wonderful and really helped with our budget. The pool was nice and clean and the housekeeping staff was AMAZING! Every employee we encountered was pleasant, friendly, knowledgeable, and every one of them greeted us - in the hall, in the dining room, at the desk - they all greeted us and wished us a good day/night! The room was comfortable and quiet even though there were several families with small children at the hotel during our stay. The fitness center, game room, and outdoor bbq and firepit were great amenities. The only \"complaint\" I have was in regard to an evening fire alarm which went off... while we were all standing outside in the parking lot, no one from the hotel came out to let us know it was a false alarm and we could go back inside. We were practically the last family standing outside in our jammies waiting for the \"all clear\" which never came. Aside from that small oversight though, it was a wonderful stay and I HIGHLY recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in the San Diego area. It was convenient to Old Town and not too far from the \"downtown\" area or the airport.

I addressed the cleanliness issue to the front desk and I fairness, she offered to transfer us to a different room but since it was past 11 PM and having cleaned the bathroom door, disinfected all the lateral surface including toilet bowl, door knobs, light switches, and tv remote control, I just asked to have the linens/pillowcases changed and provide more hangers. Well, it took me a phone call, 1 trip to the front desk, and my husband to take a trip again to the front desk before we get a clean set of linens and more hangers.....a total of over 1 hour.

The room layout is the most idiotic thing I have ever seen. Our room had two bedrooms with one bathroom that is only accessible through the master room. VERY inconvenient for anyone sleeping in there, it was so annoying. Housekeeping rarely ever did anything to our room and would never refill or replace anything.

All I can say is that we loved this place. The customer service is just outstanding. By the time we finished our stay we got to know just about every member of the staff and several of the maintenance folks. They were all top notch. Here are just a few examples of how they took care of us: - For stays over a month they provide free parking. We were just under that, but they still provided it - for 2 cars. - When we got there our room did not have the separate bedroom but was more of a suite. We really needed the separate bedroom for our jet lagged kids. They moved us right away no problem. - We needed a network cable that would reach our bedroom so we could let the kids sleep in the other room. Until they could make a wire long enough for us (the next day) they provided a wireless router in the interim to make sure we were happy. - There was a Southern California power outage one night that shut the city down. The management handled it great. They just extended the complimentary dinner hours and complimentary open bar until they ran out of stuff and cranked up the grill and started grilling all their burgers and dogs for the guests. It was like a big party! - Even with the power outage, the maintenance guys came right away and changed the battery in our beeping smoke alarm. In summary, we loved it and we will stay there any time we are back in town. It's one of the best deals I've ever found for a place with a separate bedroom which is a necessity with napping kids.

Also, we did get a nice suggestion via phone from the front desk almost as soon as we walked in the door of our room, that we needed to keep our grandsons a bit quieter- but that only occured once, so perhaps the walls are a bit thin.

The location is great, it is close to 2 major highways and pretty much can get to all major attractions within 10-20 mins. Check in was fast. Front desk staff was great, they greet you every time they see you and they are always there to help. We requested a room on a higher floor and away from the pool based on the reviews by other travellers. The room we had was quite until there was 1 or 2 nights that we believe there was another guest staying in the room next to us. We can hear his/her alarm clock and TV, so we found out the sound proof wasn't that great, but it was at the acceptable level. Housekeeping needs quite a bit of improvement. They kept forgetting to replenish supplies that we used up such as tissue papers, shampoo, dishwasher detergent etc. We have to keep calling the front desk to restock those items. The front desk was very good in following up to make sure we do get what we requested. Also, the timing of doing the housekeeping is pretty strange. There was one afternoon we returned to the hotel early, around 3pm, and found out our room has not been cleaned/serviced. I though usually housekeeping would have been done in the morning. I guess maybe not the case with this hotel. We used the kitchen in the room to cook supper for some of the nights, but the cooktop was really really slow, which took much longer to cook than an average conventional stove. Also, there was a bit inconvenient as the building with the hotel rooms does not connect with the main building (lobby/braskfast area). When we were there the weather was a bit chilly especially in the monring and in the evening, so we need to put on jackets even just heading to the main building for breakfast and hospitality, The complimentary breakfast and the hospitality during the weekdays evening were great, given they are free.

We stayed in one of the two-room suites with the bunk beds. We were surprised and pleased to find that the bunk beds were very sturdy. There was no wireless internet in the room, but the cable connection was in a convenient place that could be used at the desk or on the couch. This was also the first hotel we've stayed at where our room had been prepared as feather-free in advance. Every other time, we have had to wait for housekeeping to be called and make the change. However, we stayed multiple days and the successive housekeeping visits changed the room back to feathered pillows which was frustrating. The only other complaint we had was that our fourth floor room was under an a/c unit or something else that made quite a loud, constant vibration sound in the kitchen/family area. However, since the noise could not be heard in either bedroom, we did not ask to be moved. The hotel just down the road from Old Town and within an easy 10 minute drive to Sea World. It's a good choice for travelers wanting to go to either site. We will definitely stay there the next time we are in the area.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fontana, California", "Title": "\u201cSoccer tournament\u201d", "Author": "david y", "ReviewID": "UR121100216", "Content": "I stayed there this weekend for a soccer tournament with my family and my Dad.

The hotel staff offered to cook our pizza in the restaurant\u2019s oven for us, definitely going above and beyond. Unfortunately this hotel charges a daily $13 parking fee, which we really didn\u2019t understand, considering the location is not located in a downtown area where parking fees are expected. Another slight negative is that the lobby area is in a separate building, requiring you to go outside to go to breakfast, etc (a very short walk outside as the buildings practically join).

The only other thing was that what they said was a \"crib\" was actually a play pen / pack n' play. It was too hard for our baby to sleep on so we took the blanket from the 2nd bed, folded it on top and put the crib sheet on top of that. Much better and baby slept fine. The bed itself tended to be noisy. Never slept on a hotel bed that creeked before but the bed itself was ok and you couldn't actually feel the springs in the mattress so I'm guessing it was the box spring that was noisy. Staff during breakfast were always friendly and greeted you. Breakfast was a hot buffet which was nice. Always had 2 egg options, breakfast meat, tatters, fruit, cereal, oatmeal, can make waffles, juices, coffee, etc. It was nice because if you have older kids, they have smaller tables and chairs for kids to sit on in their own little area by a tv that always played a children's movie. They offered light dinners every night but we only ate there the first night - chicken nacho's, not bad. Pool area was small but it was nice that they had a tiny wadding pool for kids. The \"spa\" they mention is actually just a small jaccuzi type thing outside. They have a small games room with arcades too. Best thing about this place was it's location.

It had two separate bedrooms and two full bathrooms plus a fully equipped kitchen with modern appliances, including a dishwasher! Each bedroom and the sitting/dining area had its own TV, ample closet spaces and bathroom amenities (including hairdryers in each room) with great showers. One bedroom had a king bed, the other had two queen beds and the sofa in the sitting/dining area folded out into another bed. It was perfect for the five of us! The place has a lovely pool and a jacuzzi tub - great for tiring out the kids and ensuring a good night's sleep. The breakfast room was a very pleasant space, with a play area for smaller folk. Served buffet style, the food selection is more than adequate - cereals (including oatmeal), yogurt, fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage, breads, AND two waffle irons which cooked up the fluffiest waffles ever! All this was rounded up with a good selection of condiments and trimmings, tea, and coffee. What a deal! Again, just what we needed to get our group ready for our treks around the zoo. The Residence Inn does not have a restaurant on its premises; however, with its location on Hotel Circle South, restaurants were available in other locations along the strip of hotels. Better yet, it is an easy drive to Old Town San Diego where restaurants and shopping abound. Really, it was an easy drive from the hotel to most San Diego attractions and destinations.

The free continental breakfast each morning was also a nice addition. The hotel was quiet and clean. Our children loved having their own room with bunk beds.

I was hoping for free weights, but that is okay. We loved the fire pits and sat around them in the evening. Other patrons of the hotel were very friendly. Only downside, was the cleaning of the room. It just happened that each time they came to clean our room we had just got done swimming and were in the middle of getting dressed. The ladies weren't very happy that we wouldn't give them access to our room until we were ready to vacate. Oh, and parking...$13/day - not too high in comparison with other hotels you can stay at in the area. However, you had to use your room key to access the parking lot.

Pro : -Staff was really good. We wanted to get extra towels for the room, they got it to us in a hurry. We also asked for a hairdryer since the one in our room was not available, a staff brought it to us in less than 5 minutes. Courtesy call was nice to insure that we received what we asked for. I could not find any fault with the staff... better than most 4 star rated hotels we've stayed at. - Room was quiet. We were afraid to stay near the railroads like last time, so we chose this area to be at. It was pretty quiet, with the exception of some running from the lobby. There was some sort of basketball tournament in the area, and the hotel was filled with teenagers. But this didn't detract from how quiet the room was. - Another wonderful kitchenette. Bathroom was clean, bed nicely done. The only thing was the sink area.. right under the sink, there is a faux cabinet that it looks like someone tried to yank out before. No biggy, just don't touch it. We mentioned it to the staff up front. - Breakfast was very nice. More food than we could expect. Baby liked the scramble eggs. Good enough for baby, good enough for us. Con : There wasn't many things we can nitpick... but here are some - The sign is tiny. Residence inn is next to the Extended Stay. All the other hotels were easily visible, but this sign was tiny. - Pillow was a bit hard. This is more of a personal preference than anything, but still, the pillow was hard for me. No big deal, I don't really find it a fault of the hotel though. I just use some of the extra towels as pillows. - Parking stated $13 on one brochure when you check in. On the Map brochure of the hotel it says $10. Nevertheless paying for parking is blah. It's nice to have in and out privileges, but to pay extra for this is blah. Summary : We would stay here again.

During the first couple weeks of the stay the hotel was completing a massive renovation.

Being a returning guest, the renovation brought much needed changes. The rooms now have updated stainless steel appliances, new carpet, wall coverings, furniture, beds, and the best addition, Flat Panel TVs. Wireless internet in all of the rooms would be nice, but they do provide a patch cable for access to the free internet in every room. The hotel also has many other great features that added to the stay. The breakfast is real food every morning (not just pastries and coffee). Make sure to get down stairs early on the weekend or you will be eating with a crowd of other guests. Make sure to try out the waffle maker, best waffle you will ever eat. Dinner with dessert was served Monday-Thursday. A couple times they served soup on back to back nights (almost asked the staff if I could make a waffle), but the free beer (not the watery stuff, brews like Shocktop, Stella, and Long Hammer on tap) and wine more than made up for the soup. If you have the time, I recommend that you take the time for the manager night activities on Thursday night, whether it is Karaoke, Poker, Bingo, or Smores on the fire pit, the hotel staff always makes sure the activity is fun and there is the potential for Marriott points to be won by the guests...Also, if you like to Grille, they have two that are available for guests. You just have to request use and they will supply the gas, spatulas, and even light it up for you. The hotel is also within walking distance to Old Towne San Diego and 15-20 minute drive to downtown or the attractions. I recommend that you check out the Cosmopolitan for a dressier dinner (best food in Old Town) or hit up Fred's or Cafe Coyote for the drinks and above average Mexican food. Just expect a long wait if going out on Taco Tuesday... Overall, the stay was the most fun I have had on a business trip in a long time. Every single person on the staff was courteous, professional and would also engage in casual conversations (often needed when out of town for a long period of time with the same 3 people).

They are upgrading the rooms throughout Spring 2011. The renovations did not impact me except that the contractors were using a number of parking spaces. The gym was closed during my stay, but they offer use of a nearby gym. Location: Hotel Circle South is a strip of hotels/motels. There's nothing interesting within walking distance and there isn't much of a view. You will need a car. On the other hand, the freeway is very convenient and the area is a short drive to Sea World, Old Town, Balboa Park/Zoo, shopping, and the airport. Downtown and La Jolla are also quite close. Check-in: Very quick; received early check-in without a problem (I arrived around 2 PM, not very early). Rooms: the 2-queen 1-BR suite is a generous size. The bedroom is crowded, with 2 queen-sized beds, but there is room for luggage; with the living room area, the whole suite is comfortable. The room was clean although it showed a little age (I was in an unrenovated room). In-room wired internet was free. It didn't work when I first arrived, but they had it fixed fairly promptly. The big problem was sound isolation. Although the bedroom door does a good job of blocking hallway noise, you can hear neighbors above and through the shared wall. Even a simple phone conversation is pretty clear. I've stayed in hotels with thinner walls, but not many. Unfortunately, there's not much the hotel management can do. They can only ask people to quite down if security can hear them from the hall and you can hear through the the shared wall better than through the two doors between the hall and the bedroom. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. I can't report on the HVAC. I didn't need heat or AC while I was there (not unusual for San Diego). The renovations will update the technology (TVs, clock radio), decor, and kitchens (the photos of new rooms look nice). I don't think they're going to fix the thin walls. Breakfast: fairly standard fare: cereal, bagels, bread, eggs, breakfast meat, potatoes, make-your-own waffles. Hot food was mostly warm. I was pleasantly surprised by the selection of Tazo teas. Manager's Reception: I did not eat the snacks, but like with the teas, was pleasantly surprised by the selection of beer on tap. Parking: $10/day as advertised. From what I found, this is standard in the area. I knew I was going to pay it, but it's fairly disingenuous to charge for it when it's not really an option. There is no public transportation within easy walking distance. I understand the need to make a profit, but this is akin to charging for sheets. Pool: I did not try the pool or hot tub. Overall, this isn't a bad choice if you 1) need space for family, 2) have a car, and 3) can sleep through anything. If you're a light sleeper (like me), traveling alone, I would recommend something else.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "mexico", "Title": "\u201cLocation good but filthy and worn out\u201d", "Author": "AHS68", "ReviewID": "UR92352606", "Content": "This Hotel is located near two main Malls in San Diego, we are regular guests at Residence Inn in the US and this one was the worst we've stayed.

What can I say? I like free breakfast and having my own kitchen regardless of whether I end up using it or not. I used my rewards points for my stay, but also checked the online pricing, which was overall reasonable. Be advised that parking is $10 per night with in/out privileges. This isn't overall too bad price-wise as compared to staying in the Gaslamp Quarter, but if you were to stay a few miles down the 8, up the 5 or up the 163 parking would be free. I had a few complaints about this particular hotel: 1. My front stove burner did not work and a coffee carafe was slightly broken 2. The layout of the hotel is slightly confusing 3. There was only wired internet and no wifi. 4. I had to pay for parking As usual with Residence Inns, there is a business center and a workout room, as well as a basketball and a BBQ area. This hotel did have a larger pool area than usual with one large pool and two smaller pools. There is also a pantry area where you can buy some more groceries if you need to. This hotel seemed very family friendly (probably because its in Hotel Circle where most of the families go). There was a hotel reception (with free beer/wine) in the evenings, however, the snacks were all gone when I got there and there was a good 15 more minutes. Breakfast was good for a free breakfast with more than average hot items. There were biscuits and gravy, french toast, 4 do it yourself waffle stations, sausages, 2 types of scrambled eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, sliced melon, grapefruit, cottage cheese, bagels/pastries/toast, and lots of beverage options (juice, coffee, hot cocoa, tea, soda and including the more unusual horchata and orange bang fountain drinks). The breakfast area was very crowded and the staff was on-task keeping the food replenished. I will say that it was quite a zoo even though the dining area was sufficiently large. The hotel was smart enough to be situated a bit closer to the hill and thus away from the freeway, so there was no noise. The room was nice and the bed firm and unmemorable (which is a good thing). Location-wise it can't be beat: close to downtown, balboa park, the zoo, gaslamp, sea world and Mission Bay. It is also very close to shopping at Fashion Valley and Mission Valley. The staff was nice, but did not allow me to extend my checkout time (which knocks them down one rating).

With a separate bedroom and full kitchens in the rooms, it's like having a condo with hotel amenities. Our 4yo goes to bed around 8pm and this way, I can stay up and watch TV, work online, hang out with the Husband, whatever, and not worry about waking up the child. Day one we spent checking in and exploring the hotel and surrounding area. The grocery store is one exit away and is near several fast-casual restaurants.. our favorite being Pei-Wei for kid-and parent-friendly Asian food. The hotel is also one exit (the other way) from historic Old Town San Diego with tons of shopping, restaurants, and the Old Town Trolley for tours. Day two we went to the San Diego Zoo... all of 10 minutes away with traffic. Day three we went to the Birch Aquarium and La Jolla Beach\u2026 again, about 10 minutes away. Days four and five we went to Sea World, 2 exits away on the way there, 1 exit away on the way home. Day six we drove down to Coronado Island and spent the day on the beach\u2026 about 15 min away. Every night we were home by 4-ish and spent some time in the pool. They say the pool is heated, but it feels like it\u2019s heated by the sun, since by late afternoon the water\u2019s pretty cool\u2026 and we only used the baby pool. We didn\u2019t try the adult pool. (there were kids in there too, just better swimmers than mine). We also didn\u2019t try the hot tub, but it looked inviting.

We chose the hotel for its price ($140/night during a holiday weekend), its proximity to Sea World and Balboa Park, and because it's a suite-style hotel. We've stayed at Residence Inns previously, and this particular location didn't disappoint. The best thing about the hotel are the rooms and the lobby area. The kitchen was very clean, fully stocked with utensils and dishes and glassware. The TV sizes and the Internet connection were excellent. The beds were pretty comfortable, although the bedroom was pretty cramped in size. The bathroom and vanity area were clean. The complimentary shampoo/conditioner/shower gel were of good quality. Our children loved the pool area. The temperature of the water was very cold, but it didn't deter most guests from jumping in. The pool towels were very threadbare, and the pool furniture was pretty dirty. They were minor irritants, however. The lobby is very large, with the standard adjacent dining area. This location has a cute kids' area with kid size stools and tables, and a TV for the kids to watch. The complimentary breakfast was not very good, compared to the other Residence Inn locations we've previously visited. The scrambled eggs were inedible, and the fruit didn't appear to be very fresh. However, there's always cereal/bagels/oatmeal as go-to choices, which helps keeps vacation costs down. The staff in the breakfast area wasn't very customer-service oriented, as I observed a few eye rolls in response to other guests' simple requests. The front desk staff, however, was very friendly and helpful. Check in was a breeze. We also requested towels for our room, and they were delivered to our room literally within minutes. The front desk then followed up with a phone call to see if the towels had been delivered. Our room also wasn't cleaned while we were gone during the day, but a quick phone call to the front desk to request housekeeping to visit while we were headed out for dinner led to a thorough room cleaning during the hour we were gone. Again, another follow-up call from the front desk when we returned to ask if we were satisfied with the service. This is what we'd expect from a luxury hotel, so it was a nice touch. Finally, we were surprised by the parking fee ($14/night). We gladly paid a parking fee at our hotel on the beach, a few days earlier, as that's understandable. But at a hotel on Hotel Row? The fee's a transparent attempt to nickel and dime the guests, and was not appreciated.

Also, the location is not close to down town, shopping, restaurants, etc. It's only walking distance to other hotels. For everything else, you need to drive. It's about 20 minutes from down town San Diego. Here's what we experienced at the Hotel Circle South location: - Air conditioner was VERY loud and had to be turned off when we were sleeping. - I was unable to bath our children in a tub full of water because the plug wouldn't \"plug\" the tub drain. We called to the front desk, they were unhelpful. - There was no dish cloth, no \"Do Not Disturb\", no dish soap and the wine opener was broken. I asked house keeping to deliver these items--they didn't. - The shower curtain liner is cut crooked with scissors and it's too short and doesn't reach the tub. Each day I had to mop up the bathroom floor. - I asked for another floor mat for the bathroom, a new box of tissue, a new paper towel roll and a different flavour of coffee (there were two bags of the same flavour) but didn't receive any of it. - The door in the bedroom didn't stay closed as the hinges were sagging. When we lifted the door on the handle side, then it would latch. - The dishes in the hotel's dining room are plastic/paper. This does not jive with the hotel's efforts for the environment (re. the note in the bathroom about conserving on water and not laundering the towels each day). They do not have food/bar service except for breakfast and the occasional BBQ with frozen burgers/hot dogs. Gross. And last but not least I have tried to call House keeping twice to ask about a lost item and no one has called me back, despite assurances by the front desk that my messages will be returned. It's been about 5 days since my last message. Also, I the photos on the web site aren't the photos of this location. The pool, lobby, dining room and I believe the front entry are all taken of another hotel. I don't make a habit of thrashing good reputations, but this hotel was the pitts!

We enjoyed the pool, hot tub and the free breakfast was better than expected. They also had nightly receptions on weekdays, where they served drinks and a light meal. Housekeeping was inconsistent, being there at 9am some days and 3pm on others, which would have been ok, but if you weren't ready for them exactly when they came, they skipped you for the day. We had 2 days without housekeeping, because one time we were still showering in the morning and the other day, getting ready for a dinner reservation when they came by and they never came back. There was only 1 elevator from the 5th floor down to the main floor and it was out of service for a day and a half, and one of the entrance parking gates was broken the entire trip, which was an inconvenience, especially since we were charged for parking. Hotel charged $10 a night for parking, which was a money grab by them pure and simple. They should not charge for parking. Some people avoided it by parking in the few spots on the driveway leading up to the hotel, which created some traffic problems and royally ticked off those of us who were paying for parking.

Very friendly & helpful staff-eating area & cleaning staff always smiling & asking if you need anything. Our King suite was spotless & cleaned every day. They even did cute things with the towels (not towel animals) Stayed in Rm 307. View of the parking lot-who cares? I don't spend my days looking out the window. No matter where you stay in the hotel you will see either a parking lot or the pool area. A couple of problems-stained bathtub-appears to be water stains & also marks from rubber tub mat but no big deal. It was clean if not attractive looking & they can't be expected to replace everything that has a scratch or stain or ding right away. Do you replace everything in your home pronto if that happens? Me neither. Walls are VERY thin but I was only bothered by it one evening and it wasn't past 8pm. There seemed to be a party going on next door and they were playing a guitar. Never heard anything above or below us though. You hear people in the hallway outside your suite but doors closing & people talking don't really bother me. Unless you are the only person living in your house you hear these noises all the time anyway. The door separating the bedroom & living area wouldn't close since the bed was in the way! A quick call to the front desk & they came to move the bed over-problem solved! Also, every time we flushed the toilet, it made a strange sort of bell ringing noise. Not sure if it was audible to the people in the next suite or not. We didn't call to complain about it, though. If we had, I'm sure it would have been looked into. Plenty of storage in suite-a closet in bedroom & a closet next to entrance with an extra pillow, sheet set & blanket. Iron & ironing board & hair dryer. Dishwasher, 2 burner stovetop, fridge & microwave appear to be dated but we only used the fridge. There are also dishes, cutlery, pots, bowls, various utensils, and coffeemaker. You may not be able to cook Thanksgiving dinner for 20 but if you're a couple with a kid or 2, you will manage. If you plan to cook, I advise you to size up the kitchen & everything in it & plan your meals accordingly before heading to a grocery store. There is a store within a 10-15 min walk where you can buy liquor, beer, wine, toiletries, sunscreen, snackfoods, ready to eat foods, microwaveable food, books, magazines, lotto. There is breakfast every day which I think is from 7-9am or around there. The first day we were here the meat was corned beef hash but it was sausage for the rest of our stay. There was also scrambled eggs, cubed potatoes, biscuits, gravy, bagels, french toast, toast, waffles, various cereals, canteloupe & melon chunks, sliced peaches, cream cheese, jams, coffee, tea, milk, juices, soft drinks. A microwave nearby might be nice as the food can cool off quickly with everyone opening & closing the various containers. It can get quite busy during breakfast. There is plenty of seating & there are some free san diego union-tribune & USA Today newspapers available. From Mon-Thurs they have some food laid out from 5:30-7pm. On Monday there was fries, mac & cheese, chicken nuggets, mini corn dogs, salad, Tuesday it was nachos, refried beans, some sort of bean mix, I think, a tomato/onion/green pepper mixture, sour cream, salad, not sure what else, if anything, on Wednesday it was garlic bread, penne with alfredo sauce, penne with alfredo sauce & chicken, salad, parm cheese, on Thursday there was grilled hamburgers with ALL the fixings laid out, brown beans, potato chips, salad. During these evening they also had free wine & free Bud light draft beer although people were tipping the alcohol server. The cofee, tea, juices, milk & soft drinks were also available during these times. There are laundry facilities, a pool, 2 jacuzzis, a fitness room, a business area with 2 computers where you could access the internet, drinking fountains near the fitness room. The pool area is nice with tables & chairs outside should you want to eat. There is also a firebowl or whatever it's called outside which you can sit in front of. There are 2 large grills outside if you would like to BBQ your own food. We bought a couple of gallons of bottled water for $1.99 each at the store down the road as we didn't like the taste of the tap water at all. There are probably about 6 or 7 restaurants within a 15 minute walk but they seem to keep weird/irregular hours. A restaurant called Ricky's which is very close by is closed on Mondays & Tuesdays for renovations & we couldn't find a place open past 7pm other than the Tickled Trout. We ate there one night & it was okay-nothing special, that's for sure. It was very loud & they had Karaoke that night. The Fashion Valley Mall is a 25 min walk (at a very brisk pace) away. They have many great stores (check the web for a listing of them). A shopper's dream! There is a golf course across the road. There is a transit station next to the mall where you can get buses & light rail transit. The #14 bus runs along hotel circle south but I wouldn't rely on the times listed on the website. They def aren't accurate. Take a book/mag & some water to the bus stop with you. OR (this is sneaky I know but tip the driver a $1 to relieve your conscience) if the Old Town Trolley shuttle shows up before the bus which is usually the case, tell him you want to take the tour & they stop at the other hotels for passenger pickups along the way & then head to Old Town Park where the tour starts. Instead of taking the tour walk over to the Old Town transit center & get a bus or train to wherever you need to go. One of the drivers mentioned that the transit system company doesn't want the trolley drivers picking up 'their' passengers but the trolley drivers know the buses don't arrive as scheduled & they feel bad for the confused people waiting for the bus. I think if you act helpless & say you've been waiting a long time for the bus & really need to get to the old town transit centre, they might let you on the trolley. Tip them, though. Otherwise just walk to the Fashion Valley transit centre which will take 25-30 mins. We actually did pay for & go on the tour a couple of days later & it was a lot of fun. (1 day tour is $36) It's 2 hrs long but they have different stops along the way where you can get off & spend some time before getting on the next trolley that comes along. They come by designated stops every 1/2 hr. You can get off at the Midway, Seaport Village, Horton Plaza, Marriott Conv Centre, WH Davis House, Coronado, the Zoo & Balboa Park. We paid for the 2 day tour ($50)because we knew we would want to spend time at several stops. Coronado was my favorite. We went for a walk on the sandy beach which was so nice. We also walked around the town for a while. If you go to the zoo, take your own bottled water! A small bottle of water is $2.99 plus tax! I don't think they search your bags there. For a bottle of water and a tasteless burger & fries, I paid $12. If you go to Sea World, you can try bringing your own water. They do search your bags there & the sign says you can't bring coolers, thermoses, drinks & food in with you. I brought a tote bag and buried 2 bottles of water under my wallet & camera. It's fun to sit in the 'soak zones' at Sea World but you will get wet. Don't buy a rain poncho in the park (they cost $8). Pick one up at a dollar store or bring a towel with you. The prices of food seem a little more reasonable at Sea World compared with the zoo. At the zoo you get beer in a plastic cup for $6 & change...at Sea World it's in one of those aluminum sort of bottles for $5. I think so, anyway. I didn't drink but my significant other did. There is a bakery at Sea World with some great treats and the prices aren't too bad. There are also lots of other stands where you can buy various types of food and plenty of gift shops. The 'helicopter' ride at the Wild Arctic exhibit area is a lot of fun. We ordered pizza one night from the Florencia's menu that was on the table. We ordered the Giant pizza with 3 toppings and it cost $18 and change. It was really good. I wouldn't have minded trying some of the other selections. Local calls are .75 per call from the hotel. Parking is $10 a day. Some people seemed to park outside the gates along the driveway that led to the hotel. I don't know if they parked there overnight or if they were just 'guests of guests'.

I travel often and try to stay exclusively at Marriott properties since I am a Silver member and enjoy getting the Continental frequent flyer miles. I had a great rate (using AAA discount) for a one-bedroom suite (with 2 queen beds) - $152/night - not including $10/day parking fee which I think is outrageous since you have no other parking options). The rooms at this Residence Inn could be updated but suited our purpose which was to have reasonably-priced and comfortable accomodations close to the sights in San Diego (max. 10-15 minute, easy drive to Coronado Island, the Zoo, Sea World, downtown San Diego and Old Town). We were also a 5-minute drive to a very upscale mall with every store imaginable, a large movie theatre, and several restaurants. The hotel is along a road off of whch several hotels sit but there are no good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and a car is a necessity. I rented a GPS from Avis (a Garmin Nuvi) and this was an invaluable resource for getting around the City. I highly recommend you invest in one or rent one if you are not familiar with the area. In terms of quality, I recently stayed at a newly-renovated Residence Inn in Chicago (near the Magnificent Mile) which was beautiful - very modern and chic. This facility cannot compare to that one in terms of furnishings, bedding, bathroom fixtures, etc. My arrival at this hotel was a bit bumpy. We arrived approx. an hour after the check-in time (which is 4:00) and our room was still not ready. After waiting approx. 30 minutes, I was given a room. We drove to the parking gate (you have to use your card to access the parking areas) and neither card worked. I returned to the reception area and was told the cards were working, but the cards were reactivated. Again, the cards did not work. As I was returning to the reception area, the manager was on her way outside to make sure the keys were working. To her credit, since I was very aggravated by this time, she helped carry our luggage into the room. Just after she left the room, I looked into the bedroom and realized we were placed in a suite with one king bed instead of two queen beds which is what I reserved. So, for the 4th or 5th time, I returned to the reception area and spoke to one of the agents (not the manager) who informed me that no other rooms were available that evening and we would have to stay in the room at least one night until another room became available. I asked to speak to the manager, the same woman who helped me previously and she was able to locate a kids suite for us to stay in (a two bedroom suite - one room with a king bed and the other with twin beds). We were able to stay in that room for the entire 5 days at the rate for the one-bedroom suite and the parking fee was waived. We had no other problems the remainder of our stay. The room was comfortable and clean and had everything we needed for our stay. My only complaint is that there is no door separating the sink area of the bathroom (which is located outside of the toilet and tub/shower) from the master bedroom. Therefore, you would disturb people sleeping in the master bedroom if you were using the sink. Also, even though we were in a kids suite, there was only one bathroom. Also, the heating unit in the kids' bedroom was loud at times. The pool area is wonderful and my 5-year old had a great time using it and the hot tub - as did many other families despite the chilly weather. I also used the laundry facilities which were clean and convenient - free detergent is available at the reception area. Breakfast is included with your stay which wasn't the best I have had at a Residence Inn, but had enough options that we are all satisfied (eggs, breakfast meat, potatoes, biscuits and sausage gravy, pancakes or french toast, cereals, fruit, yogurt, etc.). The reception area, which is clean and very large, also has a room with pool tables and an air hockey table; and two computers that are free to use.

My first impression was that the hotel and our room was clean, bright and new. Our room was a 2 bedroom king with a kid's suite. The website advertises the kid's suite with bunk beds, but ours came with two separate twin beds. This actually worked out better since our children were probably too young for a bunk bed setup. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and dishware. The stove top was missing the knobs for the burners. We didn't use the stove so it wasn't an issue (I assumed the knobs were somewhere in the drawers). The living area and masterbed room and bathroom were comfortable and again clean--which being new parents with toddlers was a great concern and major consideration on choosing a hotel for our first summer vacation. The second concern I had was how quiet the rooms are at nite--I'm a light sleeper and having 2 toddlers getting woken up by noise means no one would get any sleep. Luckily, even though you can definitely hear loud voices or pitter patter or feet running around, I think that since most of the guests were families traveling with kids there was hardly any commotion I hear after 10 or 11 o'clock when families are probably passed out. The hotel had a toddler pool (1 foot deep, ~10ft diameter), a main pool and a spa. We didn't use the hotel pool, but many guests did. The laundry facilities were modern which even uses low water front loader washing machines. The gameroom had pool tables, air hockey, foosball and few arcade games. There was a second gameroom which was small and not well air conditioned that had some older arcade games. The best features of the hotel were the complimentary hot buffet breakfast and the evening \"dinner\". The breakfast always had hot eggs (one basic scrambled and the other a variation like hame and cheese or spinach and mushroom etc), sausage or bacon, hot potatoes or beans, oatmeal, pancakes/waffles, several types of cereals and breads and variety of hot and cold drinks (milk, juice, coffee). The selection was great. At nite, the hotel had things like bbq hot dogs and hamburgers or spaghetti and meatballs. The dinners weren't 5 course meals, but great for something quick after a long day at Sea World or the Zoo and you can relax and eat by the pool. Overall the Residence Inn met my expectations on cleanliness, amenities, and staff professionalism. The only negative I can think of is that the buffet breakfasts can be crowded (I heard the weekends can be crazy) but the staff did a good job keeping up during our stay.

We had to drive to find someplace to eat and stumbled upon a satisfying King's Seafood in a nearby strip mall. True, there was a place called Ricky's, an older diner about a five to ten minute walk from the hotel.

It is too bad some of the living/kitchen area was not used instead for the bedroom area. The one big negative, which is mentioned in other reviews, is the lack of adequate soundproofing in the room.

The bed, though, was very comfortable, as I have found all of the Residence Inn beds to be.

I grew acustomed to the seperate and quiet bungalow style rooms that the older hotels offer, kinda gives you an at home feeling, well this hotel doesn't offer that style of rooms or feeling, it's one of those drag your bags for what seems like forever to an elevator down the hall and around the corner type feels, and with a family of four, plan on making trips. The rooms are very nice, full kitchen, and this hotel isn't short on amenities very nice pool, even though they say the pool is heated it isn't, anyone with small kids the wading pool is an excellent idea, the full breakfast is great, great staff. FREE internet NOW(used to cost 10 bucks a day) my only other gripes are the $10.00 bucks a day for parking. I could possibly see that if it was an open or shared parking lot, but it's a HOTEL ONLY private parking lot, so 10 bucks a day and anywhere from $180.00 bucks and up a night for a room,( i'm not a greedy or cheap person, paying that much i think that reflects that, there are plenty $60-$80 hotels all around this place) one would think the small amenities like the internet access (since they mostly cater to the business traveler) and DEFINITELY A NECESSITY LIKE PARKING YOUR CAR would be included, and last but not least the A/C. I don't know about all of you who reads this but to me A/C is a comfort, and it definitely helps me sleep better, well the selling point of most hotels is \"come on in,and get a good quiet nights rest\", well i don't know if this is a designer's flaw, or a marketing plot to keep their light bill down, but the main A/C operator(the one usually hidden in closets that you can't see or hear) well at this hotel it's located in the wall at the very foot of your bed(yes in the bedroom) so it's very disruptive and almost impossible to sleep with, therfore you will turn it off to go to sleep, thus resulting in lower operation, thus lower light bill (you be the judge) and you can hear the TV and people faintly talking in the next room over,but these are my only few disappointments. Now with this you may call be a whiner but i would like it if they transition like the other hi-end hotels and go to the nice flat plasma TV's. I would stay here again because i'm a long time fan, but i would first check for an older location near by first, the A/C is a real disappointment. Seaworld, zoo, downtown, and great restaurants are very close by making it a plus for location.

However, with 4 free nights from our Marriott Rewards Visa (for a 2 bedroom suite w/bunkbeds @ over $300/night), my wife and I couldn't resist another attempt. After spending 4 days in Los Angeles, we drove down to San Diego and checked in. That went smoothly, and the manager, Tom (I believe) was very accomodating. We did request a room that was on an upper floor and facing outward toward the parking lot, since the noise from the pool kept us awake last summer (all rooms either face inward toward the pool or outward). When we entered our upstairs room, we were immediately greeted with a horrible smell. It smelled like something from the beach had died there! Since the room was warm, we thought that the air conditioning would remedy this problem, so we unpacked our 8 suitcases. Upon our return from a day of fun the following day, the smell again overtook us. Long story short... they had maintenance come up on 3 different occasions (once, the maintenance worker stuck a \"STICK UP\" behind our TV), and finally admitted that they were having problems with a drain in the building. Even the hallways smelled. In fairness to the hotel staff, they did, however, offer to move us, but with so much luggage already unpacked, we suffered through it. As far as the rest of the hotel, the breakfast was fine, as usual. Belgian waffles, eggs, pastries, oatmeal, fruit, etc... The manager's reception Mon. - Thurs. was okay, too. Nachos one night, burgers/dogs another, Mexican one night, and fettucine/salad, as well. This allowed us to save some money, and they had mac and cheese for the kids. Housekeeping did an okay job, all of the employees were very friendly, the pool was nice and this year, our plan to cut down on the noise from the paper-thin walls worked (stay on the 4th floor if you can - that way, you only have neighbors below you). Overall, it is a very family-oriented hotel.

I booked two nights on a Friday and Saturday. I had heard, from reading other reviews, the walls are paper thin. I also heard that fast food is not an easy find. Well, it's true. The walls are very thin, and finding fast food was a chore. Not one night passed without hearing sounds of people talking in neighboring rooms. In the living room, I could hear the family next door talking and watching T.V. In the bedroom I could hear the people on the other side of the wall talking and watching T.V. The loudest noises, however, came from the outside hallway (mostly kids running up and down the halls) and the window, which faced the pool. I was on the third floor, but it didn't help much. The noise from the pool echoed into my room all day and up until 9 p.m. or so in the evening. As for sleeping in, it didn't happen in this hotel. I tried both mornings, and woke each day at 7 a.m. to the sound of slamming doors or kids running up and down the hallway. In some strange way, it reminded me of Disney Land, just outside my front door! On the plus side, the King bed was extremely comfortable! It's just too bad the noise was so loud. In spite of all the noise, the room was nice and the occupants of the hotel all seemed friendly and family oriented. This is definitely a place for married couples with kids. I felt safe my entire stay. As for food, it's hard to find unless you plan on taking in a sit-down meal. Check-in time is at 4 p.m. I arrived my first day at 3 p.m. Unfortunately, my room was not ready, and I was told I would have to come back later. I drove around looking for something to eat but couldn't find anything of the fast-food variety anywhere near the hotel. I drove past the local mall, down a few side streets, and eventually found a Wendy\u2019s. The problem is, it was about 15 minutes away from the room, and with traffic congestion somewhat prevalent in the Hotel Circle area, it took me a while to get there and get back. One bit of advice: bring your own food. It's cheaper and you'll thank yourself later. Also, there is no room service, etc., so if you get a late night craving, you\u2019re on your own. Overall, the hotel was decent. It's loud and parking at $10 a night seemed high, but the people were nice enough. Also, the elevators in this building are very slow! Slow to arrive, slow to open the doors. I couldn\u2019t believe how long I had to wait. Use the stairs if you\u2019re in a rush. It's a good workout and you won't have to wait around five minutes for the elevator to pick you up! One final comment. It would be nice if the hotel had more parking spots for guests of hotel guests. There are only about 7 total spots in front of the hotel. A business associate stopped by one evening to visit me and had to wait 30 minutes to find a parking spot. Parking in the back for hotel guests is pretty abundant, but you must have a room card to park there, along with a hotel parking pass to display in your window.

This Residence Inn is nestled up against the hillside, off of the main road, enough so that we didn't hear any traffic noise whatsoever. Our first impressions were good considering the talk of the general Hotel Circle area and it being situated right next to 1-8 weren't very positive. However, it turned out we were in a great location in terms of getting to and from Old Town (which we loved!), Sea World, beach, banks, shopping, restaurants, etc. and we felt safe. We rented a car, which is necessary IMHO, so getting out and around wasn't an issue. We found it very easy to navigate our way around this area and San Diego in general. The front desk here was very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. Even printing out directions to any place we wanted to go. We arrived very early so our room was not ready...Not a problem. The front desk staff still checked us in, took our luggage, and gave us pool keys so we could enjoy the amenities. Nice pool and game rooms for the kids. Our requests for an upper level room overlooking the pool was granted. Our room was immaculate! Full kitchen w/ all the bells and whistles. Our maid even loaded our dishwasher for us one day, which I never expected! The beds were comfortable to us also. Note: the walls are thin and you can hear (somewhat faintly) conversations. The complimentary daily buffet breakfast and early evening snack and drink social was really good and a nice touch! I would recommend you get down to the lobby before 8:00 AM as the breakfast rush hits about then and the buffet lines are long and tables can become scarce. We are early risers so it wasn't an issue for us to get up a bit earlier to avoid the hubub. It was booked FULL with families & children of all ages when we were there and the pool also became packed by 3:00 PM every day. The pool area has a wading pool which is perfect for toddlers, an average size 4 1/2 ft deep main pool plus hottub. Our teens enjoyed it as we visited w/ other families around the pool during the evening socials. We did hang out one day on Coronado Island at the Hotel Del Coronado, which is beyond fabulous!! Get directions and go visit to take in the beauty of this area for great shopping, restaurants and beautiful beaches. We also highly recommend a visit and tour of Old Town. Literally, this area is 5 minutes away from the Residence Inn Hotel. We ate our way through there- the first night at El Agave (which is wonderful mexican cuisine), toured the Historic Whaley House and shopped. Very fun and interesting so don't miss this place since it's close by! Residence Inn-Mission Valley Sea World is an ideal place for families with young children to stay at.

Also near some decent malls. not too far from other major San Diego areas ( coronado island, La Jolla, petco park etc all within a reasonable car ride) Generally good for what it is but not worth the rates ( AAA rate of 249 plus that 10 bucks a night parking fee) Other were paying higher (319, etc) The whole hotel circle area is considered more reasonable and family freindly but for that money an extrea hundred a night might easily get you to a much nicer area if the budget allows.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5392591", "Content": "We just stayed one night at the Residence Inn San Diego Mission Valley/Sea World Area, June 24-25, 2006.

What a great place to stay. We had a one-bedroom on the first floor. There is a complete kitchen with a full size refrigerator, two-burner stove, microwave and dishwasher. Pots, pans, plates, glasses, utensils, paper towels, pot holders, toaster, coffee maker and anything else you could think of to cook with was included. There was a small table with two chairs, coffee and complimentary microwave popcorn. We saw a note explaining that if we wanted, we could call the hotel in advance and give them our grocery list. For no additional charge, they would shop and then leave the items in our unit for us when we got there. We did not take advantage of this service, but thought it was a nice touch. The living room also has a full pull out sofa, large television and desk. The bedroom was small, but adequate. King size bed, large television, dresser, vanity area, large closet and shower/tub combo with toilet. Few amenities: soap and shampoo. The carpet and floors were all spotless. The windows in both rooms open partly for security. We left our windows open for breezes in the evening. The hotel has a business center with computers, a well equipped gym, two game rooms with arcade games, ping pong table, pool table and foos ball. There are two large bar-b-ques outside with tools. There is a large swimming pool with plenty of lounge chairs. There is a one foot baby pool and a hot jacuzzi. Plenty of pool towels are available. There is no valet parking or bell service, but there are large bell carts available. To enter or exit the hotel anywhere you must use your card key for security. Ample first floor parking on the exterior of the hotel. Complimentary breakfast seven days a week and hot food in the evening Mon to Thurs. There were scrambled eggs, pancakes, make your own waffles, sausages and potatoes. Cereals, yogurts, bagels, fruit, and plenty of other cold items available as well. The staff was so nice and accomodating. There is also a program where you can stay and play. For $30 on the day of check out, you can stay until 4pm in your room. We would not hesitate for one second to stay here again. The location is close to Sea World and all attractions, but you defniitely need a car. No restaurant on property. Hotel has small food and gift shop.

The previous postee was not kidding when she said they clean up your spills before you can say, \"boo\". My toddler spilled and they were there in a jiffy, they refilled our coffee and rushed over with more napkins when I was feeding my other child. They were on top of things and so nice. They made us feel so welcome. The food was very good but I was dissapointed there was no gravy for the bisquits. There is quite a selection though and chocolate milk for kids is quite a treat when you can take an extra one to put in the fridge in your room for later. The nightly manager dinner was nice too but we only made it one night. They had corn dogs one night with potato salad and green salad and drinks and then the second night was mac and cheese but we didnt make it back in time from seaworld and shopping. It can really help with the budget though if you have more than one kid! The arcade was nice but not free. The pool looked nice but we didnt have much time. There were some kids in there but not too many to make it look unwelcoming. The rooms-the bed was more comfy than the embassy suites in anaheim but not what I would call super comfy. The room was dark enough for us to sleep in and the doors did not creak to wake the kids when someone used the restroom which was nice. The room was VERY clean, the bathroom was great and the kitchen was the perfect size. We watched a movie one night (free HBO)and hung out and the living room area was not crowded (it's smaller than the picture appears). It was very relaxing to be in a clean, safe hotel with no traffic noise. We would stay again. The ONLY negative-narrow parking for big pickup trucks or SUVs and parking lot set up hard to get luggage to car since parking lot in back is up hill. If you have a compact car you can park closer and it should be fine. The parking anywhere in a big city is tight so what can we expect?

The suite was bright and fresh with ample room for cooking. Both the bed and the sofabed were comfortable, the bed exceptionally so, and for any sofabed to be comfortable is unheard of. Having fresh colors in the room truly made a difference from the same-ole'-blah-drab of most motel rooms - made it still restful, but a little more lively. The room was incredibly quiet - the motel is set back farther against the mountain from the road than most other of the motels there, and is quite soundly constructed. The only noise we ever heard was due to a funny indiosyncracy - when one first turns on the TV's they are set at a high volume and need to be turned down immediately. Other than that, all was silent, and drapes plenty dark enough to allow jet lag adjustment. I don't usually resort to caps, but the breakfast was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Here's what you get every morning, in a big, lovely, open, spacious dining area: soft scrambled eggs, seasoned potato cubes, either bacon or corned beef hash or sausage, toasty golden waffles you make yourself, a bunch of cereals and pastries and fresh fruit and muffins and english muffins and bagels, white and chocolate milk, several juices and pops, and a new thing for me - Japanese breakfast in the form of sticky white rice, miso and tofu and green onion broth to pour over the rice, and sprinkles you can choose to add of sesame or seaweed or shrimp. Plus, the extremely friendly and courteous staff roam around with refills of coffee in the most pleasant manner. Ah, yes, the staff. They were unfailiingly great! All were friendly, warm, knowledgeable, courteous, helpful and informative. When I couldn't find the breakfast room initially, they took me there. When I got cold and needed a blanket, it was there probably literally within one minute of my phone request. When someone spilled some orange juice, three staff appeared to clean it up and it was gone as quiickly as you could say \"splat.\" When I stopped the room service guy to ask about dinner, his English was admittedly spotty, but he made good eye contact, had a truly warm smile, and finally just directed me to ask the front desk, which was fine due to his good manner. And for glbt travelers, the quiet presence of queer staff was extra-nice. The only problem we had during the whole stay was that our key cards somehow got demagnetized a few times and the front desk folks were absolutely fine with us needing to have them re-keyed. The location is great, but this place stands head and shoulders above other Hotel Circle places we have stayed. It is very convenient for getting everywhere. Also, on Mon-Thurs, they have an early evening buffet, which means if you're staying during the week you get not only breakfast but dinner if you want it, and are there at the right time, which sure cuts down on the cost of meals out if that's of significance. It was \"May Grey\" for us, so did not try the pool or hot tub, but I expect these would also be topnotch. It was extra-nice to have a very tall showerhead that actually splashed over me instead of against me. I didn't try out the gymn or the kids' game room, but both looked good. And they had ping-pong! I couldn't resist that - it was great. And outside, basketball and volleyball courts. All in all, I think this was one of the most relaxing places I've ever stayed. No worries and a ton of amenities, all supported by superb staff. The only reason I didn't rate it \"excellent\" was just that it wasn't a sixty-star place - but then, it doesn't mean to be, and it is far more a place I want to stay because of that.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cJust Fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "ttchamps", "ReviewID": "UR5014080", "Content": "Very nice place.

Most of the hotels are set back far enough from the freeway that it isn't even noticed. Although, on the north side, I did notice one of the hotels next to the freeway. We stayed five nights and got the one bedroom king with a sofa sleeper in the living area for 2 adults and 3 little ones. I requested a room on the top floor and got it, although it turned out that we were across from the elevator. The good thing is the 2 kids didn't even notice any noise traffic as they were knock out tired! We slept on the sofa one night and noticed noise traffic only once. We had also put a little barricade of sandals, towels, whatever at the bottom of the entrance door to keep the noise at a minimum. The room was clean and the maid service was excellent. The king mattress was a little stiff than we were use too, but after the first night we were ok. Thin walls?? We didn't even notice our neighbors until our last night when the kid was yelling at his dad for one short moment. Unless, we were lucky and had no neighbors...All I can say for thin walls is that most hotel walls are not sound proof and you're going to hear some noise. I actually started worrying (a little :) before we arrived about the thins walls from all of the previous reviews, but was pleasantly surprised that we did not experience it. As long as we are respectful and try not to make to much noise and keep the kids from jumping on the floor too much.. Directions to all of the nearby parks and places were on the back of the card that held our room keys which was very convenient. The swimming pool was a little cold, but the kids didn't seem to mind. The breakfast was ok with plenty to eat, just gotta find that table to sit at....
