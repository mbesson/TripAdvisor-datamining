Our room faced the street, but virtually all of the street noise was blocked. They served a generous breakfast in very pleasant surroundings.

I stayed for a week and it was a perfect base to visit Rome. Staff speaks good English, rooms are small but nicely appointed and soundproof. In my first night I stayed at a room at the first floor: the view was partially obstructed by the hotel front sign and the bathroom had a foul odor coming out of the pipes. The following day I got a room on the 3rd floor and voil\u00e0, problems solved (even the carpet smelled better). The aircon tends to be too warm and it is hard to set the temperature you want. Pretty nice breakfast: no breakfast fried meats, which I think are disgusting anyway - much healthier options instead. Limited TV channels but the free WiFi more than makes up for it. Stendhal is not a luxury hotel, but it is quite stylish, especially the common areas. I booked my room through hotels.com with a promo code and got a 100 euro daily rate, which I think was pretty fair. Last but not least, I must mention the fact that, having to catch a red-eye flight home I had to leave at 4 am; Marco, who was in charge of the check-out, ran to the kitchen to fetch me some breakfast to go and handed it to me with a smile - very attentive of him.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chihuahua", "Title": "\u201cGood Service, Excellent location, Small Rooms\u201d", "Author": "LCQL", "ReviewID": "UR125948408", "Content": "We spent a week at Stendhal Hotel and we found it very well located, a few steps from the metro station, nice little restaurants and lounge bars around, waking distance from Spanish Plaza and Fontana di Trevi.

The hotel is cosy and most of the staff are friendly, but there was an unpleasant incident upon arrival: I had asked for a room with twin beds, since sleeping with my oversized teenage son in the same bed deranges my sleep too much (he moves a lot and takes up all the space). This request had simply been ignored and we were given a small room with a really small double bed. I complained but they had no other available rooms for the first 2 nights, so I had to endure 2 very bad nights indeed. On the 3rd day we were finally given a room with 2 beds; this room was much better and bigger than the first one. But it took a lot of insistence on my part and I didn't like it that they had just ignored my request to start with. The hotel is very well situated indeed, right in the middle of Rome, a short stroll away from Piazza di Spagna, Via Veneto and so many other attractions. Also very close to the Barberini subway entrance. Visiting the whole of Rome was a breeze given the location of the hotel. However, if you're expecting a 4-star level breakfast, you will be disappointed: the cereals are poor and the bread is white and tasteless. There were a couple of tiny little not-completely-white breadrolls on the table each morning, but every day I had to ask for more because we don't like the snow-white bread they serve, and every day they only brought one or two of the darker ones. We even had to resort to taking the leftover breadrolls from other tables after the people who hadn't eaten them left! On top of that, it was impossible to get chilled milk for the muesli. Every single day the milk was at lukewarm room temperature, even though I specifically asked for it to be taken from the fridge. After a while I understood they don't even put it in the fridge! So the daily breakfast was quite a bad experience. But apart from the breakfast problem, the hotel is recommendable, for its location and pleasant bourgeois atmosphere.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cHotel during England Rugby weekend and snow!!!`\u201d", "Author": "SAA26", "ReviewID": "UR124531591", "Content": "Hi- 8 of us stayed at the hotel and had a brilliant time.

Overall a great hotel in a central location, less than 5 minutes walk from the spanish steps, trevi fountain and 100 metres from a metro stop for ease of transfer to and from the airport. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the owners and staff at the hotel for a wonderful and enjoyable stay. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again if i'm lucky enough to visit Rome again.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cFemale Flying Solo - What a Secure Yet Scenic Experience Stendhal Is!\u201d", "Author": "doncaster", "ReviewID": "UR99971653", "Content": "Last I visited Rome, I was a young lass on the cusp of 20 and I can remember having to memorise terms like 'il gabinetto' for toilet and lots of finger pointing at food items as the Italians then spoke no English. This time, as a female executive from Australia-Pacific, I memorised a few common Italian words off youtube and was plesantly surprised when Seruj from the front desk greeted me in impeccable English. Everything you see depicted on the Hotel Stendhal's website is as what the reality is. For my week-long stay, key on my list of priorities was a safe and secure place that I could spend 6 nights in decent, boutique surroundings that resorts around Asia spoil you with. My double bed (queen-sized) was so comfortable, turning in at night was actually a highlight! I am a terribly light sleeper, blame it on 2 kids under 6, and sleep with earplugs, but I swear, my room in the back of the hotel was so silent, I spent many evenings enjoying the breeze drifting in from my shuttered windows flung wide open to enjoy the white noise of sirens and roosting birds that now is but a memory of Rome. The room is indeed small but comfortable and immaculately put together (particularly appreciated the bathtub). If you like the gentrified baroque/ country look you see on the website, the guests, it appears, are equally discreet like the surroundings. The rooms beside me were occupied but apart from whispered comings and goings, everyone was civilised and genteel, mostly the 30-50 something set. And the best part - the hotel was a stone's throw away to where my daily meetings were in the gregorian university 30 steps away from Trevi Fountain. In 3-4 minutes flat, I'm there, and that was such a luxury, enjoying Rome and its glorious attractions all a stone's throw from my nightly base. I ventured too to the Spanish Stairs, (love the cavernous underground MacDonald's there - who'd have imagined, Macker's comfort food after too much pasta and pizza), and the Pantheon is but about an easy 10-minutes stroll. I particularly appreciated the free wireless access, broadband streaming was fine most days that I stayed in to do work, but room service (was shockingly high - 30 euros for a pizza!) I hightailed it to the many cafes that are a mere 30-second walk from Stendhal. Kudos too to the service from the suave Seru,j, (Indian from Maldives), I loved the global feel of present-day Italy with Anglo-Indian tour guides and Turkish vendors and mainland Chinese souvenir sellers. Reminded me just of multiracial Singapore and multicultural Melbourne :) Thanks too to the fabulous waiter, (sorry didn't get your name, was it Fabio?), at breakfast every morning who knew exactly what this madame wanted - orange jiuce and a perfectly made cappucino in the serene and elegant breakfast rooms reminiscent of a bygone era - what a perfect start to the day!

So all my research effectively went out the window. The hotel that my parents were offered as an alternative was a 15 minute walk away and further away from the central area. It was also up a slope with was difficult for my mum who has mobility issues. In fairness to the Stendhal Hotel, they were polite and courteous about the situation. The hotel they offered was of a similar standard. They offered my parents a free upgrade should they stay there again.

The staff was extremely professional, and because we stayed 7 nights, we got to know everyone a bit better. They were terrific with suggestions, particularly Luceo, who knew every amazing small church that we would have missed otherwise. He's into architecture and loves giving historical information about Rome. Fabrizio, manager?, is the man you need to know for reservations. He really takes note of your personal needs/requests and makes it happen. There are 2 Andreas, each very knowledgeable about different parts of the city. They were always interested in OUR opinion of a particular restaurant. Breakfast was a real treat - 5 star - in a beautiful, cozy dining room or library, which turned into the bar in the evening. The hotel is SMALL, but extremely well designed. Compact, yet room for everything. Smart closets, beautiful baths. None of the interior photos on the website do the bathrooms justice. If there is a problem, someone is there within two minutes - truly!! (If you are a tall or large person, this place is not for you! And we only saw one child. Some teenagers, but mostly couples or business people.) The location was very central for all that we wanted, for a first trip to Rome. Close to Via Veneto, Spanish Steps, luxury shopping near Via Condotti, tourbus stops one block away. We walked mostly, because many sights are closer than you realize. The only cabs we were in were spotless, open and the drivers tended to speak enough English.

The rooms may be a bit small, but then in a city like Rome you spend very little time in them. The fantastic location has one drawback in that that those rooms on the street front may be a bit noisy. The long shuttered windows plus the airconditioning means that some of the street noise can be overcome, but for me it was a case of\" throw open the shutters\", lean out over the French style balcony and marvel at the fountain at the end of the street and the passing parade of Romans....as they say \"when in Rome\"etc...! Included in the rate was a continental breakfast served in the tiny, classically furnished lounge-breakfast room. Nothing tiny about the breakfast though . It included eggs, pastries, fruit, cereal, cold meats and cheeses and the best coffee I had in Rome , ever so elegantly served in a sparkling silver pot and with hot frothy milk. Everything about the Hotel Stendhal sparkles. No dingey halls here, no clanking ,unreliable elevators. Everything shows the benefit of the modern renovation throughout and the whole is kept spotlessly clean by a team of housemaids wearing neat uniforms complete with fresh , starched white aprons.

He rang my cruise company and suggested, then organised , for them to pick me up for the transfer to the ship at a nearby hotel instead of at the airport. This not only saved me countless Euros for the taxi ride, but it allowed me to enjoy a relaxed and leisurely start to the day.

This hotel was nice and a good value for the room rate. While it was not one of my favorite hotels of the several we stayed at as we traveled through Europe, it's definitely recommendable. What we liked: BATHROOM: The bathroom was very nicely appointed in marble with a fantastic shower. The shower head was the best we had in all of Europe (good pressure and it had an actual temperature gauge for the water...in Celsius if you can do the conversion in your head). ROOM SIZE: The room size was a bit bigger than average for Europe. Still smaller than most American hotels, but a good size for Europe. BREAKFAST ROOM: The breakfast room was comfortable and the service was satisfactory. The selection of food was good as well with eggs, fruits, meats and cheeses. I liked that each table in the room also had a basket of rolls and pastries. What could have been better: ELEVATOR: One can't complain too much about the size of elevators in Europe. For the most part they are a luxury to have in any building (which you'll find out as you take stairs through every museum in Europe) and when they are available they are almost with out exception small. My main complaint about the elevator is that it was, for lack of a better word, dodgy. Several times we would get on the elevator, we'd press the button to our floor, and...nothing happened. The door would open again and we'd press our floor a second time and it would finally do what it was supposed to do. VIA DEL TRITTONE: The street the hotel is on looks somewhat blighted. Now, we never felt unsafe in any part of Rome we visited, even late at night, it's just that the street looked a bit dirty and some of the buildings were in disrepair. Additionally, the street is fairly busy and while the windows and shutters keep it quiet and dark, there would be no possibility for keeping the windows open for fresh air. However, the location is pretty good overall. You're not far from the Spanish Steps and the Metro Barberini. ROOM CARPET: The carpet in the room could use at least a good deep cleaning if not complete replacement. It wasn't disgusting, but it had been worn and stained over time. OVERALL... We would recommend the hotel, however, whenever we go back to Rome, we'd like to stay closer to the Pantheon.

We had room 625 on the top floor towards the back and therefore no street noise at all. We actually slept with the window slightly open. The bathroom was nearly the size of the room and was done very nice and seemed brandnew. A heated towel rack was a nice extra. Breakfast served downstairs in the bar / reading room area was excellent and plentiful served by uniformed waiters and the hot beverages came in typically grand hotel silver. The buffet had scrambled eggs, cheese, salami and ham as well as different kind of cereal and fresh fruit. The breadbasket contained rolls, croissants and danishes and you were also able to order fresh juices. The only negative was, that the free computer in the reading room either did not work at all or was painfully slow. So don't count on checking emails, but enjoy Rome instaed.

To add insult to injury, the paperwork we had been given at check detailed charges relating to a superior room and not the standard room we had been allocated. When we queried this with the same member of staff he simply said that there wasn't a superior room vacant but he would try and get us a transfer the next day. At no point did he apologise and in fact his manner was extremely arrogant and rude throughout our dealings with him. When I challenged him about being charged the higher price he said he would give us a (very measly!)reduction for the first night but we would be charged the superior rate once we transferred room the next day. The following day we were allocated a different room but this meant we had to leave our bags at breakfast time and they would be moved to a different room while we out. This meant that we couldn't really unpack our first night and to some extent the afternoon and evening were tainted by our annoyance at feeling like we were being taken for a ride by the hotel.

This was our sixth trip to Rome and we normally stay at the Intercontinental, but the price in High season finally forced us to change. So after hours of searching I booked the Stendhal. We arrived early a.m. around 10 and were given our rooms by noon, which I thought was great. Man at the desk was very friendly. Here are my thoughts. Pro's... Perfect location for walking around Rome Spotlessly clean common areas and rooms the fastest roomservice I have ever experienced The front desk aside the staff was as friendly and helpful as I have ever experienced. Good value for the location and time of year Con's Trying to get suggestions for Dinner seemed a little like pulling teeth. I was given one suggestion Mario's (which was great) the entire week, the rest were all my idea. When we were not able to get into one of my choices they seemed incapable of any other options. One night I was told 40 min. before my supposed reservation that we couldnt get in, \"sorry\" click The rooms looked exactly as they do on the website but.... were a bit smaller than I thought they would be, and we didnt have enough closet space for 2 people for the week which made the room even more crowded. We also never saw the slippers and robes nor did we get the promised night time turn down unless you asked. Which they did gladly. All in all I was pleased with my stay. I wouldnt hesitate to refer the hotel as long as you have some knowledge of the city. The area makes this a 4 star, the rest I'm not sure I could agree makes this a 4star.

It was a cheap taxi fare to the train station, which I wish we'd known on the way there so we could have avoided lugging heavy suitcases up those metro stairs! We had a room with a private balcony which we put to good use each evening for a cocktail before we headed out for dinner. Once the french doors were closed it was quiet as can be in the room, which was surprising given how busy the street was. The staff surprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne delivered to our room one evening for our anniversary, which was a very nice touch. The room was smallish, but well appointed and comfortable. It was a little more pricey than we usually spend, but worth it.

The breakfast was very good, with eggs, pastries, croissants, etc. The best meal we had nearby was at Ciao Bella, left out of the hotel then left again on via Veneto, then left into a small alley. It has the same menu as the more touristy restaurant on via Veneto but a competely different ambiance. We thought Tullios was way overpriced for what you got.

Also for a 4 star hotel we didn't receive many of the extras you typically get, such as slippers, bathrobes etc. In addition there was no where to go in the hotel except for your room - they say they have a bar but it is hardly what I would call a hotel bar and we never saw a soul in there the 3 nights we were there.

We appreciated the presence of the bar in the late afternoon for restorative drinks after long days of touring. The desk clerks were helpful in recommending restaurants in the area. We tried three, two of which we could recommend: Tullio and Osteria Romano. The other recommendation given to us--Nautilus--was definitely NOT somewhere we would recommend. It appeared that only other clients of Stendahl were there the night we ate there. I can understand why-- a dark basement with dirty carpet and a menu that was completely uninspired. Skip that one!
