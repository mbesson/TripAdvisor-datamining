The impressive restaurant/ dinig room is on the top floor which gives panaroramic views of the city in all directions. Choice was impressive from a buffet style set-up. with full English breakfast, fruit, cold meats, cereals, fruit juices etc. The hotel's location was also a strong point. Just three stops on the train from the airport into Sants station, out through the maix exit and the hotel was about fifty metres across the square. At 23 storeys high, it would be hard to miss. Using the three day travel pass we were able to travel from the metro station in Sants staton to all of the main attractions and the Barcelona Tour Bus also had a stop at the side of the station. Slight disappointment was the lack of wi-fi access although an ethernet cable connection was available in the room.

I initially booked with this hotel due to the numerous reviews saying how great it was. I am now left feelling confused as to which hotel the reviews were talking about? Standing adjacent to the Barcelona Sants station, The Gran Hotel Torre is a 20 minute train trip from the Airport and this, along with the panoramic views of Barcelona from the top floor restaurant, are really the only good points for this hotel. Regarding the restaurant, I do not advise eating there as it is very expensive and the food is terrible. included in the price of any bill is a 50 % markup for enjoying the view. I would also not advise opting for any breakfast options as what is provided is very basic; the coffee was truly awful and the \"fresh\" orange juice probably was...a week before. A better and cheaper option for an evening meal is the Las Arenas stadium just a short walk from the hotel, where you can enjoy a cheap meal in any of the restaurants which circle the roof of the arena. This is also a great location for viewing the magic fountains. For breakfast I would opt for the Mauri cafe only a short metro ride from the hotel: www.pasteleriasmauri.com I stayed on the 12th floor and while the hotel, for the most part, was clean and the rooms tidy there were none of the extras you would expect from a 4 star hotel. The audio / visual system was decades old (not a flat screen or ipod player in sight). I would also expect a wifi service in a modern hotel but I was not informed of any such service upon arrival. All the fittings and fixtures were really worn and the marble flooring was very stained / mouldy in parts. My lasting impression of this hotel is that it is very tired and is in desperate need of an overhaul. The staff, in their favour, were very pleasant and courteous, but no measure of charm could hide the lack of investment in this hotel. I think the good reviews of this hotel in no way truly reflect its current state, services or surroundings. The plaza in front of the hotel is part building site / skater park and the noise emanating from the station / traffic is unwelcome for a relaxing break. I suppose if your purpose is to go to Barcelona for a business trip (a quick in and out job on the cheap) then this place would be ok for one night.

First and foremost, kudos to the staff. All were friendly, knowledgeable, efficient, kind and spoke good English. When there was a question regarding the extra charge for a third person in my room, they charged me the lower of the Expedia price on my paperwork versus their standard rate:) They really could not have been agreeable and accommodating. I would like to give special recognition to one of the bellmen, Tomas Sevilla. He is a true gem! He is the PERFECT example of an employee who will go above and beyond for the comfort of the guest. For example, I asked him where I could buy \"bubble wrap\" to protect a bottle in my luggage for the trip back to the US. He offered to bring some to me from his home...which he did. And, he would not accept any payment for the wrap. He was so plesant, kind, and helpful and always had a smile on his face! I would also like to commend Luis of the reception desk staff who helped me tremendously and without hesitation when I had an issue with my room on my final stay at the hotel. Now on to the hotel itself. I stayed there with family (two rooms) three times over the course of two-plus weeks between trips around Spain and to Rome. I am SO glad I chose this hotel. Not only was it a nice hotel to start out in, it was especially nice to come back to each time we returned from traveling. It was BY FAR the best hotel we stayed in during our two week trip. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are large by European standards, especially the bathrooms. All rooms have refrigerators and safes at no charge as well as flat screen TVs. The beds are large, though a bit hard (I found this to be the case throughout Spain and in Rome as well) and you will not want for sufficient pillows. Slippers and bathrobes are provided for extra comfort. The location, while not in the center of town, is extremely convenient with both a Metro stop (Sants Estacion) and the main train station (Sants) within a few minutes walk. Both the Metro and trains are easy to navigate and make traveling within and away from Barcelona a piece of cake! There is a supermarket adjacent to the hotel and a little bakery where one can pick up a quick breakfast treat before heading out for the day. Nearby there is a great little semi \"hole in the wall\" restaurant - wish I could recall the name - that has free wi-fi. (The hotel only gives 30 minutes each day free; but you can check email for free in their business center which is a really nice service). The restaurant is a couple of doors down from the small supermarket located up the street from Sants Metro station. The staff will know where this small supermarket is. The paella is awesome, as are the mussels...and everything else...and the servings are HUGE! We did not eat at the hotel or have drinks so I cannot say anything about that service. I guess the only non-positive thing I would say is that it costs to use the very small pool and gym (6 Euro I seem to recall). But, that's probably a small price to pay for such a great hotel. I could go on and on about this hotel but the bottom line is that I would stay there again and again and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone traveling to the wonderful city of Barcelona.

We arrived quite earlier and the check-in is not ready. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, when we asked if there is any place we can go. We were advised turn right and walk on the main street, just about 10- 15 minutes walk, we arrived at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya,( is a museum of Catalan visual art). It's the most pleasant and magnificent place, you can climb up the stair to the top of the building, you have a overview of the whole Barcelona. One thing need to be careful, is some gypsi kids trying to steal from you. Actually, On the way back, the police is running after two kids passing us. It's rather funny. About the room, Its a standard room for two, We stayed on the tenth floor, the room is huge and have a really nice bed. The bathroom and toliet is seperated as well. I am really enjoy watching the Spanish TV too. It is very clean. The air conditioning worked well. There is a convenience store nearby and there is chemist in the train station (2 mins walk). We had lunch at a caffe on the main road on the right side of the hotel. There is a seafood resturant about 5-8 mins walk. Hotel staff told us that. Its a lovely place. I really enjoyed their fish. It's about 20-30 mins walk to their main shopping centre. (Sorry I forget the name, ask the hotel staff ) there are two metro station next to the hotel.

The metro station at Sants station connects directly with most of the major tourist sights. We stayed twice on our Spanish holiday \u2013 once in a loft room (19th floor) and then, as a rare treat, in a suite (17th floor). Both rooms were very spacious and offered great views over the city. In fact, the suite provided views across 3 directions. The king beds were incredibly comfortable and the rooms spacious, clean and well appointed, including good air-con. Staff were consistently very helpful and multi-lingual. Check-in and check-out was swift on each occasion. We didn\u2019t use the leisure facilities (\u20ac6 extra per person). Breakfasts offered a wide range of hot and cold, savoury and sweet options, all good quality. Being on the top (i.e. 23rd) floor, views from the restaurant were stunning. While not essential to our rating of the hotel and room, it is worth noting that the one underwhelming feature for us concerned eating in the area at night. There is not much choice on offer. Staff recommended one restaurant in the area for traditional Spanish food (Casa Martelo). While it appears to have some good reviews on TripAdvisor, we found it to be pretty average and easily overshadowed by other restaurants we were to try later on our holiday. We also ate in the hotel\u2019s Visual restaurant on our last night, as part of an inclusive package we booked with the suite. We were pretty frustrated about miscommunication between hotel bookings and the restaurant (why does this happen in so many places?). We arrived, were given one set of menus, then had to ask our waitress what we could eat as part of our package, faced a bit of a wait while discussions took place with the head waiter, then had our menus summarily whisked from us: we were instead to eat from the chef\u2019s Tasting Menu, which bizarrely was not even mentioned to us when we first arrived in the restaurant. To be fair, the waiting staff then took care to explain each course of the tasting menu to us. All courses were designed to represent some feature of Barcelona and looked impressive.

We were really glad to see it after we got off the train from the airport (only about 3 stops away). There was a wheelchair ramp at the front of the building that made it much easier to get our luggage to the door where a young man from the hotel met us with a cart for our luggage. The subway is also located in the train station. There are restaurants on all sides of the hotel and in the train station so finding a place to eat was easy. There is also a grocery store called something like Hypomarcat located directly beneath the hotel and you access it outside on either side of the hotel building. When you first enter the store you find yourself in a department store of sorts with clothes, children's toys, etc. and you have to walk to the back of the store and take an escalator down to the large grocery market where we bought cokes, snacks and items for breakfast. As stated in other reviews,, the room was spacious and had an excellent view. The bathroom was quite large and had separate rooms for the toilet (with bidet) and shower. It had a large bathtube and vanity area with marble. It was all in marble and quite large and very nice as for as bathrooms go. The bed was large but hard with nice pillows. The room was very clean and had a flat screen television and disc player. The stereo was a large boom box. It had nice looking bookshelves as well. The lighting did not have a soft glow like in the picture but was satisfactory. Coffee was available in the room. Also, there was a small refrigerator where we kept cokes after some rearranging of the various items contained within for sale. Each floor has its own ice machine which is supposed to dispense ice automatically when the ice bucket is placed in the front opening. However the ice buckets provided in the rooms are too short to be detected by the sensor. You must place your hand above and behind the bucket to cause the ice to come out. We had some problems with this until we figured out the sensor could not detect the ice bucket. If you want to do the hop-on/hop-off bus tour of the city you can walk through the train station and get to it easily. The tickets are purchased on the bus itself, even though a sign on the ticket office where the bus stops says they can be purchased inside the train station. We found the hotel staff to be very courteous and helpful. They all spoke fluent English and were quite easily understood. We had no problems checking in or out of the hotel We were in Barcelona to take a cruise. Taxis are located outside the hotel's front door and it cost 17 Euros to get to our ship at the port. From what we could tell, it would have been quite a walk from the nearest hotel to the ship. Overall, our experience with this hotel was very good.

After finally getting on the train we then had to endure buskers making an unholy racket and trying to sell cds. My wife rides trains all the time and said it was the most horrendous journey of her life. Needless to say we returned to the airport by taxi which was far quicker and was worth all of the 25 euros.

From then on had to go to the loo using my mobile phone light.

I booked through their website and as advertised, got free wifi internet for my iPad and iPhone the whole stay. The staff had been great. We arrived late from Paris and our room was ready. Check-in was so easy, the front desk assistance was very pleasant and assisting. To book tickets for our visit to Sagrada Familia I had to use the Business Centre where we were told we had 15 minutes free but when the computer I was using froze they let me use another one and let me print the tickets for no fee at all. The whole time the Business Centre staff member provided tips of where to go and what to order. It was like coming home to long lost relatives who want you to enjoy their city! It was fantastic. The rooms are very big (well, of course in comparison to Paris, which is unfair!) and we were given a room on the 21st floor with great views of the Camp Nou and the city and in the afternoons, dramatic sunset views. We reported that two lamps were not working when we arrived and went out for dinner. When we returned both were lit up - working! The rooms were cleaned everyday and the bathroom was always tidied up. I always appreciate it when hotels provide free bottled water for guests and Gran Hotel Torre gives you 3 bottles instead of just 2! Need ice? There is a dispenser just along the corridor available 24/7. We stayed 4 nights and it was sort of sad to leave - like leaving home. The beds were comfortable and we had restful sleep all throughout. Sometimes there would be noise coming from the corridor but that is not the fault of the hotel but guests who have had too much wine. And when we checked out it was also a breeze - like they understand you have to be on your way.... The hotel provides welcome drinks to all guests though I cannot rate it since we had no time to do that. There is a restaurant at the penthouse that boasts great views but with the abundance of great places to eat in Barcelona we opted out of overspending on westernized-style (read: cute and overpriced!) and enjoyed the many other restaurants in the area. Same with breakfast - we suggest you go out and enjoy what the city has to offer. There are plenty of restaurants close by that offer coffee, omelets, croissants for less than 10 euros. The Barcelona Sants station is right next door so if you are arriving by AVE or regional trains into Barcelona then it is your best bet for your stay. Local buses and the subway lines (Tarragona Station, we found to be more convenient then Sants Station) are within walking distance. If arriving from the airport and you have tons of luggage - or just lazy like us, take a cab and it would cost no more than 25 euros counting the tip and one euro cost per luggage piece. Arrive in style and enjoy!

We found the hotel to be extremely convenient and nice. We took the train from the airport. Depending on what terminal your flight is on...you may need to take a courtesy airport shuttle to the other terminal where you can get on the train. We bought a ten trip card pass (which more than one person can use) for about 8 euros...pretty cheap!! There are other options...I can't remember the name of it...but there's also some shuttle...you pay per person. We thought this would be a better way to get to know the city and, of course, it's MUCH cheaper! After you buy the pass from either the automated machine, which is very easy to use plus there's an employee that stands by to assist you, or the teller, you insert the card into the machine and the gate opens and you just walk to the other side. Make sure you ask for a map! For a map of the metro (which is different), you just get it at one of the metro stations. We bought one card w/ten trips (which can be used for BOTH train and metro) and my fiance would put the card into the machine, I would go through, and he would just insert it again and go through it himself. The train is pretty nice...we're from the Miami and the trains here aren't nearly as nice. They are air-conditioned w/plenty of seats and racks to put your luggage. To get to this hotel, you get off at Placa de Sants (I think it's referred to as Sants for short). There's a screen that tells you the next stop and you will also hear announces about the stops. Once at the Sants station, just go out through the doors and you will see a tall building to the right...that's the hotel! Check-in was quick and easy. We were given a corner room (#818)..which was amazing! We had two different views of the city. We didn't eat at the restaurant in the hotel...you really have to make a reservation for that and they were simply booked. The hotel staff was very helpful. I talked to the staff/security often during our staff...asked for restaurant recommendations and information about certain attractions. There's also a small convenient store around the corner from the hotel and an ATM, too. We forgot to pack a converter and we just couldn't find a store that sold them...so we finally asked the hotel staff to point us to a store. Instead, the lady gave us a converter free of charge! We had to sign something just saying we took it and we have to return it when we check-out, but it beats looking for one when we needed one ASAP. About our room, I can't remember what the name of the layout is...but it was basically a queen bed...LOTS of closet/storage space. The bathroom was roomy...double sink...there's a tub and a shower. We ate at two restaurants close to the hotel...one hotel staff recommended Restaurante Zaravtz. We went very late and thought it might be closed, but there were about 3-4 parties there...not bad. It's about a block from the hotel..on the corner of Elisi and Rector Triado. We had steak and duck...the food was amazing and reasonably priced! We also ate at Tapa Tapa...it's right next to the mall at the Espanya metro station. You could walk there...we did! We also loved this place...food was pretty good. You might also want to go inside the mall...even if you're not too crazy about shopping...go all the way to the top and see the view of the city from there! Remember, take the metro/train. It's cheap. We found it to be safe...we didn't have any close calls and we also didn't witness any suspicious activity.

These are located on the 2nd floor. The more expensive the room the higher in the tower you climb. :) The room was clean. I liked the bathroom. It had a good size and it was equiped with everything you needed. The bed had a matress a little hard for my taste and also, since our room was on the 2nd floor we heard the outside noise. The hotel is closed to the central station so there is a big traffic in the area. But this is also a good \"feature\" since you are close to the metro and busses. The hotel staff is very nice. They offered us cocktails on our arrival. I had 2 things that I didn't liked: our room was smaller than other similar rooms for the same price. For ex: our room didn't had a terrace and the bathroom was smaller than another similar room and had only one sink. And the second thing: they don't have \"things\" to stop the room door from closing with a lot of noise. I can't explain better, sorry.

We chose this hotel primarily because of its close proximity to the Sants railway station for our early morning train back to Barcelona airport. We were so pleased that walking time (with luggage) from the reception of the hotel to the platform for the RENFE train to the airport was less than 5 minutes. The hotel staff were very friendly, spoke excellent English, check in and out was very efficient and quick. Hotel rooms were lovely, spacious and modern - although my husband would make comment that the TV was the older large CRT rather than the newer flatscreens that you find in most modern 4* hotels, however, in my opinion TV technology is not an issue when on holiday. The bathroom is large and decorated with beautiful marble; 2 sinks, bathtub and shower, toilet and bidet. However, there was a bit of grime/rust build up around the shower screen grouting which I feel could have been cleaned up a little better. The only other small negative that I found with our room was that our kingsize bed mattress was a little on the hard side (I like a firm bed but felt that this mattress was on the rock side of firm). Although with that being said, we both slept well and were not bothered by any outside or traffic noise given that the location is in a busy area at the main railway station with high volumes of traffic. However, the best and main aspect of this hotel is its view.....wow!! Our room was on the 14th floor and we had such a wonderful view over the city of Barcelona. As has been mentioned in previous reviews, the hotel is not within walking distance to La Rambla nor is it in the heart of the city, but given it's location and height, the hotel has a prime view overlooking these areas, which is very special. We did not eat in the Visual restaurant on the 23rd floor but we visited it to see the dinner menu (menu was wonderful but not what we were after that evening - wanted something with more of an authentic Spanish feel for our last night), but the view alone from the restaurant was amazing and definitely worth a look. In the hotel's Business Centre we were able to use the internet for 5 minutes to check in for our flights and print out our boarding passes, all for free. Really valuable service which was very worthwhile (saved us over an hour at the airport). There is cable internet access in bedrooms and WIFI in reception areas. We used the WIFI in the reception/lounge area on our phone, but only the first 15 minutes was free which we didn't know, until the connection kicked us off after 15 minutes. Not too much of a problem, but if we had known we wouldn't have wasted valuable minutes web browsing. The Sants metro (underground) stop/station is directly across the street from the hotel where you can travel very easily, quickly and cheaply to any part of Barcelona city - I strongly recommend purchasing the T10 ticket if you plan on using the metro a number of times during your stay. The hotel is a 10 minute walk away from Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya, which is a lively, bustling area at night, especially weekends, with such a wonderful atmosphere. Here you will find Las Arenas (very large impressive shopping complex, just newly opened, with lots of highstreet and designer shops, cinema, restaurants and a stunning roof top view, built on the site of the old bullring). Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya also hosts the Venetian Towers which lead to a beautiful walk up to the Font m\u00e0gica de Montju\u00efc - this was without doubt our favourite area and memories of Barcelona. The magic water fountain is a must-see at night - although the area can become exceptionally busy, it is lovely to walk a little further on up to the amazing Palau Nacional, which is fabulously lit up and offers a less crowded viewing of Font m\u00e0gica de Montju\u00efc, and a truly remarkable (and romantic!) night view over the Barcelona skyline - what a fantastic experience! All this within walking distance of the hotel - you couldn't ask for better! Word of warning for any travel in Barcelona - beware of very clever pick pockets!! On the train from the airport to Barcelona at the very start of our holiday, my purse was pick pocketed from my handbag (which was actually in my hand luggage case which i was sitting on!) by a young couple (in their 30's) very smartly dressed, definitely not the scruffy Artful Dodger characters that I was initially looking out for. Thanks to a previous tip review I had read on TripAdvisor, I was alert and on the look out for pickpockets, so I noticed that the man had a coat hung over his arm, while the woman was being distracting with her over-affection towards him. Thankfully I caught on to what had happened and I shouted to my husband (standing on the opposite side of the carriage) that my purse had been stolen - the guy dropped my purse and moved into another train carriage to find the next poor victim.

But everything was so well preserved and clean, that i felt very comfortable like home! The breakfast was amazing...you drink your coffee and see all Barcelona from the 23rd floor! The croissants were better than those i had in the hotel i stayed in Paris, there were eggs, potatoes, cheese, chorizos and traditional ham, spanish omeletes, freshly baked bread, fruit, cheesecake, yogurt...excellent! We issued a T-10 card that gives you 10 routes by metro. The metro and train station are next to the hotel! The centre was 4 metro stops away, i found it very convenient. Also, the Montjuic sites (the magic fountain, the National Gallery museum, the spanish village, etc) were 10-15 minutes walk. There was also a nice cinema-mall next to the Miro park where you could do some shopping. From the airport if you want to take the train, you must first take the airport inner-bus that takes you from terminal 1 to terminal 2 (maybe the other way around, can't remember for sure) where the train station is.

She even enquired whether we would require a late check-out. Hotel is right next to a metro and there is a consistent availability of taxis outside the hotel which makes travelling on public transport easy. The hotel is along part of the open-top city discover route and this makes it convenient to hop onto said bus for a tour of Barcelona. There were numerous eating outlets surrounding the hotel and for those seeking quick easy meals, there is no lack. The Visual restaurant on the top floor of the hotel serves Catalan cuisine with a gorgeous vista overlooking the city. Food - value for money, given the view on a glorious clear spring evening. The room was well presented and the copious amount of space allocated to the bathroom/shower and vanity was a huge welcoming change. As I did not booked the room via the hotel's website (through tripadvisor), no free wi fi service was offered. This was a pity, given that the hotel had come up with the goods except for this one small matter (free wi fi is certainly a draw card and essential element of any hotel's standard facility offerings). Any travellers who avail to the Executive Room would not be disappointed and the appointments within the room and hotel are very commendable and there is a touch of style to the hotel.

However on the positive side - check in was quick, the rooms were lovely - I loved the walk in shower and I loved that when I took a shower the mirror would heat up leaving some of it steam-free (I wonder if this is a Spanish thing as I also had this in Madrid?) its a great feature and the bath was lovely aswell. The breakfast was great! Its served up on the 23rd floor so you get fantastic views over Barcelona while you eat breakfast. Breakfast itself was also lovely and had the full spread: pastries, cereal, hot cooked food, cheeses, meats, fruit etc. - there is no-where nearby to the hotel for breakfast so I would recommend taking the breakfast option here. For culture I recommend that everyone goes to the Sagrada Familia and if you have time to the Casa Batllo - both built by Antoni Gaudi I'd done some very brief research on him before I went out and I really enjoyed visiting these places.

The hotel is located right outside the train station which is ideal after a good few hours traveling! We booked our hotel through hotels.com and were slightly worried that the best rooms may be saved for those booking direct with the hotel. So we were very pleasantly surprised to find that we had been given a room on the 18th floor which had incredible 180 views out towards Mount Tibidabo. We had booked an executive room and were more than happy with the size and the amenities provided. All expected toiletries were provided and the hair dryer was brilliant. There was plenty of storage space and the bathroom was lovely, with a separate cubicle for the toilet and another for the shower. The service from the staff was fantastic. We had to call down and ask for milk for the complimentary teas and coffees in the room as we had run out and they were up within 5 minutes to deliver it. We also managed to lock our safe and forgot the code we used. The security guard was up straight away to sort it out for us. The staff never hung around expecting a tip, which was really nice not to feel hassled. During our stay, it was St George's day, which in Barcelona is similar to Valentine\u2019s Day. The streets are covered with stalls selling roses and books. On our return to the room that evening, the staff had scattered rose petals from the door to the bed, where there was a heart shape made with petals and a paper scroll which had the story of St George\u2019s day. It was a lovely touch. The hotel also provided us with a free bottle of champagne during our stay, as we got engaged while there. This was a lovely gesture and not at all expected. We paid just over \u00a3110 per night for our room, without breakfast, and found it to be really good value for money. As mentioned above, there is free tea and coffee in the room, which a lot of hotels in Barcelona do not seem to offer, and the safe was also free. The food prices in the Eclectik bar were reasonable and we ate there on our arrival and on departure for ease. The room service menu and prices are the same as that of the Eclectik bar. We did not eat in the Visual restaurant but if the food in the bar is anything to go by, I'm sure it would be fantastic. There is a supermarket under the hotel which we used to buy breakfast, water, bottles of wine etc. for our room. This was obviously a cheaper option to drinking and eating out constantly. We had wine each night in our room at the little table and chairs in the room and just enjoyed the fantastic view. The hotel is located a few stops on the metro away from the main centre, La Rambla, but we did not find this to be a problem. If anything, it worked out to be a benefit. The room was very quiet, apart from a few sirens but they did not prevent us from sleeping. I\u2019ve previously stayed in the centre of Barcelona and the noise was terrible. There are thick curtains provided which ensure the room is dark for sleeping. We slept right through the nights without being woken by anything so have no complaints in the sleep quality department! The metro is available opposite the hotel or from the train station. We bought a T10 card at the airport and just shared it and would buy another from the metro station when it ran out. The metro is fantastic, with trains running around every 3 minutes. The card cost us just under 8 euros each and is a very economical way to travel the city. Overall, we had a fantastic stay at the hotel and definitely plan to return next year.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice view, Nice Room, Nice staff and good location.\u201d", "Author": "huishan_ong", "ReviewID": "UR106043775", "Content": "My husband chose this hotel for our honeymoon after reading the reviews from tripadvisor.

We had a room on the 10th floor which was really nice. One small thing that was a bit of a pain was the toiletries. On the first day we opened up the small bar of soap to use to wash our hands after going to the loo. The next day after returning from our day out the soap had vanished and they hadn't replaced it or any of the other tioletries. we phoned reception and they immediately brought some to our room so they were very quick to respond. To be sure, i would say take your own stuff. There was also a bit of dust and fluff at the bottom of the wardrobe but honestly that was all i could find wrong with the room. We didn't eat breakfast at this hotel as we had read the reviews from others but there are plenty of places within 100 metres where you can get breakfast. We used the cafe in the station. One place i must mention for food and drink in the evening is Casa Martelo. A really stylish bar serving great tapas and food and also a huge selection of bottled beers. It is within 3 minutes walk in Calle Numancia which is a main road off of the square in front of the hotel, in fact we could see it from our room! (room 1006). Another place we ate in was just around the block called Zarautz.. It is a tapas bar and quite authentic. We read a review saying that the staff were very friendly and helpful but when we went there we found the staff very unapproachable, not rude but just a bit standoffish. They serve great tapas most of which priced at \u20ac1.50 and they are all along the bar. Each one has a cocktail stick in it so you take a plate, help yourself to what you want and leave the coktail stick on your plate. They calculate what you have eaten by the number of sticks left!

A bonus point, is that there is a supermarket directly underneath the hotel too. When we arrived at the hotel, we managed to check in straight away and our rooms were lovely. We were on the 5th floor, and the rooms were clean and spacious. Bathroom is one fo the best I've seen. There's a bath with a shower mixer, toilet, bidet, and a seperate walk in shower, plus 2 sinks and mirror! The staffs were always willing to help, we ordered room services for tea and we also asked the receptionist to help us get some info on tours/ attractions and places to eat, which they managed to bring to our rooms.

We were dissapointed with the restaurant in the hotel. The view from the top was great and the wine was very nice however the food for a 5 star restaurant was dissapointing. We were advised they would cater for vegetarians but when we asked there was not much choice and furthermore there not much effort in trying to accomodate which was unfortunate for a 5 star restaurant. The food overall wasnt very good, and the mains were served cold. The dessert was amazing and on the house as they had not provided the best service, but on another trip to barcelona i would not go again. Very VERY overpriced for an OK meal...

Great location close to the station which is perfect for those who want practicality, convenience and comfort. Probably one of the most convenient and fast options to get to the comfort of a hotel after arriving at the airport - simply take the train from the airport, walk out 50 meters across a nice safe open plaza and there it is towering over you. No threat of pickpockets or being conspicuous as a tourist dragging a suitcase when there are hundreds other doing the same around you :-). Having registered for the free eClub hotel reward system, I was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to an executive suite with a great view on two sides - a corner room on one of the higher rooms are absolutely fabulous. A bottle of Cava and choice of snacks followed right after. The complimentary wired internet due to this upgrade (no wifi in the room) was very welcome after I had been paying through my nose for the same privilege at other expensive hotels during my trip. The view from the room was so great that one night I slept with the huge window on both sides completely open with a full moon outside. Since this was a small pit stop for two days after a long business trip, I appreciated the opportunity to relax in the hotel, but the convenience of having the train, subway and the tourist bus stops all a short walk away. While I had bought a 10 strip subway card (also used on the train) I ended up utilizing the get-on, get-off tourist bus (29Euros) for 2 days mostly. The tourist bus also ended up being a good choice for the time I wanted to get up to the Olympic stadium which is not served by a subway stop. There was also a cafeteria and a large super-market right beside the hotel. Bought some very good wine and variety of ham and cheese samplers for one of the evenings I didn't wan to venture out. There are of course multiple choices for coffee and food in the train station right next door if you don't feel like spending the big bucks at the top floor restaurant or taking advantage of the coffee and tea material in the room. For those of you savvy enough to travel only with the essential money and identification through the tourist sights of Barcelona, there is a safe in the room to keep the rest of the valuables. Yes, I did come across the dreaded pickpockets and thieves of Barcelona when the girl standing in front of me in one line was deprived of her wallet. I tried to prevent it, but then that is another story... Overall, excellent stay at the hotel.

The metro in Barcelona is superb and cheap too with a T-10 ticket providing 10 trips(metro or bus) for less than 10 Euros. The hotel is next to Sants estacio station which is ideal for the airport and the city. Couldn't be better, honestly. There isn't the noise that the hotels based right in the middle of the city experience. You can be on Las Ramblas from your door of your room within 15 minutes via the metro, i'd say. The city boils over with things to do. You can't go wrong. Just buy yourself a Lonely Planets travel guide and you can't go wrong. My room on the tenth floor was modern, spacious and stylish with a king size bed. Various treats were provided to an Expo member(see their site) which gave a 'wanted' feeling. The restaurant on the 23rd floor has wonderful views and i found that the food was excellent and good value considering its quality. Breakfast in the same restaurant was also well presented, hot and provided a great energy provider for my days' exploits. The staff were friendly and helpful especially Valentina in reception, Catherine, Gerald Cuthbert and Subrina in the restaurant and Pedra and Rita in the Lounge bar. I felt relaxed here as well as cared for. What more could you want. Four nights wasn't enough and i shall be returning for sure. And to this hotel for sure.

The front desk staff was helpful upon checking in--they advised us to take the nearby metro line into the city. They convinced us to upgrade to a slightly better room, but it was difficult to see what we were getting for the extra $30 other than moving up a few floors maybe. The platform bed was comfortable but they had cheap pillows that reminded me of hospital pillows or the ones you throw away on the plane. The room was a little dirty upon checking in. The one bright spot was the room service--good food from the rooftop restaurant. We were very much looking forward to using the pool but they closed over an hour early (on a Saturday night??). Finally the front desk staff the next morning was not as chipper. They were angy at me for trying to take a cart to my room to remove my own bags.

Breakfast is a very comprehensive buffet, covering almost any taste, with the added bonus of being served on the 23rd floor, with windows at all sides, so each morning you can choose a different seat and take a different view of the beatiful city below. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the staff polite and accomodating. The location is very good. Within walking range from a variety of sites.

And in a third direction you can walk to the Port. Or for those less wanting to walk, the Barcelona Bus Turistic stops at Estacio de Sants and has a very regular hop-on hop-off service that seems to produce a bus every 5 minutes. On the downside, the hotel is typical of large chains, with a number of extra charges. The WiFi is free, but only for the first 15 minutes, then you get charged. The Fitness Centre is free, but there is a daily charge per person for the Spa.

Being the main station, it is better equipped than any metro station for people overloaded with luggage - escalators and lifts everywhere, no carrying heavy suitcases upstairs and no long walks through tunnels. The area around is quiet with a few decent restaurants and seems safe enough. And it is right on the main routes for the Metro, the tourist bus and the regular buses. The hotel itself is of a high standard, with helpful, English-speaking staff, and the upper rooms have amazing views across the city to the Sagrada Familia and other landmarks all the way around to the coast. I thought I had tried every option for Barcelona airport. The airport hotels are too far from the city and not actually that close to the airport, most of them are located in an industrial estate.

I am happy to say that nothing of that happened to me in the five days of work and touring in Barcelona. And it was a very enjoyable experience for my wife and I, with this Hotel being a contributing factor. The best location for touring Barcelona would probably be the Plaza Catalunya aka Placa Catalunya. That's where tour buses congregate and where two pedestrian walkways (one being La Ramblas) run parallel to each other. But because there are so many people, it can be very confusing for first-timers. The Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya is next to Barcelona-Sants station and this is a central interchange with the added benefit of being wide open once you step out of the station. This means that there are no dark alleyways to the Hotel where muggers may hide. I stayed a total of five days, broken up by a visit to Lisbon where I had another meeting. For the five days, I had two different suites and was pleasantly surprised. There was a large living area and a sizeable dining table with space for six. There was a Nespresso coffee machine with six coffee pods of varying strengths. There was also an extra WC in the living room, which proved specially convenient. The masterbedroom had two king beds. And being at the corner, there was a spectacular view of the city. I asked for and got two different corners so I had an even better view. The sea/city view is more colourful. The bathroom was sizeable, double sink as reviewers have noted and with a ledge so toiletries stay dry. Being at the corner, the bathroom was very bright. It's somehow very pleasant to walk into a naturally-lit bathroom when one wakes up. There was plenty of wardrobe space. Both times, the iron was supposed to be available only upon request but it was in the wardrobe. The slippers were hidden away in the bath robes and should be better located. Breakfast was expensive at 12 euros and for two, that works out to 24 so we skipped that and ate outside. There is a good local cafe (we were the only non-locals) up the street, about 1 o'clock position from the door. It's a bar and the breakfast of ham sandwiches and coffee came up to less than 6 euros. More than the amenities was the service recovery. I had two problems in the very first hour of checking in. First, I had a problem with the Nespresso machine. The milk foaming nozzle was not properly cleaned. I tried at least 10 times and the water that came out (I wanted tea) had gunk. To the credit of the hotel, my machine was changed. Then, the wifi failed to work. It was frustrating because my PDA had malfunctioned so I needed the wifi. That took a while with the service staff coming up needlessly as it was clear to me that the problem was in the network. I had told him, I was in Barcelona for an Internet conference so I knew the source of the problem. It took the next day to get that sorted out. The service seems spotty. Perhaps because it is a busy hotel. During my entire stay, apart from the very first day when I checked in late at 6.30, there was always one or two guests at the reception. On my second stay, I had chocolates; they were absent in the first suite. At departure, although the concierge had been helpful before, he could see that I was struggling with three bags. Instead, all he did was wave and say \"goodbye\".

We had expressed a preference via Lastminute for a room on a high floor with a nice view when we arrived the Receptonist tried to sell us an upgrade to an executive room from our standard room which we declined and were allocated room 304 on the third floor it appeared to be the only room with a balcony but with a view of the next door hotel. After two nights of hearing what sounded like water each night outside our room window and wind I expressed my concern to Demian on night reception who immediately offered us an uograde to an executive room. We obviously took up his offer as we could not sleep properly and the next six nights at the hotel were excellent. It was suggested that the noise we heard was from the Hotel fountains. We flew into and out of Barcelona in between the BA airline strikes and when our return flight was delayed Demian on night reception and all the staff in the Business Centre went above and beyond the call of duty to help us resolve the unexpected cancellation and change to our return flight. The staff all spoke good english and were most helpful. Pros; The executive rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Lots of lifts so no hanging around or having to bundle in with other guests. Sants Estacio Metro is also a Renfe station which gives access to all the main tourist attractions and the Airport and is just across the road from the hotel. The station is large and also has three toilets, McDonalds and shops. There is a large supermarket/hypermarket literally 30 seconds as you turn left out of the hotel. You can stock up on water and food if you want to avoid eating out all the time as we found the price of food even fastfood a bit dear at times. There is also a local Spanish Fast Food Outlet called Pan and Co just across the road from the hotel. If you need to get some water or nibbles late up to 11pm there is a nice little shop in Berlin Road run by some asian guys which isn't a rip off shop and are friendly. Cons Not all the rooms give a comfortable nights sleep - avoid room 304 (maybe the whole of the third floor) unless you sleep like a log and want a balcony with a very limited view . There tends to be a lot of noise from wind not sure if it was the time we went or if it's peculiar to this hotel.

The city view is more expressive when viewing from an even number room (exp. 1910, 2114). Food in the hotels restaurant and lounge are quite pricey.

The staff were very attentive and friendly, the buffet breakfast on the 23rd floor was really nice and the views from here were spectacular. We upgraded our room to an executive room, for an extra 12 Euros per night per room, which I though was good value and worth doing, as these rooms were on higher floors, were bigger and had little things like robes, slippers and tea and coffee etc. There was also an ice maker right outside our room. The room had air-con and was spotlessly clean and the maid cleaned every day. I can't fault it! Things you must see in Barcelona - the magic fountains (Friday and Saturday evenings in winter. Wrap up warm as whilst during the day we were in jeans and t-shirts, by evening it got a bit chilly especially when sitting watching the fountains performing. We also enjoyed going up to the top of Christopher Columbus's column ( there's a lift inside the column). La Sagrada Familia church is breathtaking, the cable cars going up to Montjuic were fun. I wasn't overly impressed with Parc Guel but I know many people who say they've enjoyed going. Port Vell (harbour) is worth a visit, it's a great walk when it's sunny. Be at the cathedral at 12noon on a Sunday to watch the dancing in the square next to the catheral- take some small change for the dancers collection plates. We found lots of nice places to eat - the best were a small restaurant called Xandor which I think was near the Place of Angels Metro stop. Here we had the best paella and great service, in authentic surroundings - there were many small restaurants around this area so worth heading in this direction on an evening. We also enjoyed La Dolce Hirminia (not sure of spelling) which was near the Equinanaona Metro stop. Wine carafes were cheap and the food was very good and very well presented - it does get very busy though, so be prepared to queue a little.

Satelite TV but only CNN and the German version of MTV but it played alot of English speaking American reality shows which were quite funny. The spa was nice but you have to pay 6 euros, it would have been nice if it was included. You can pay the 6 euros and use it as much as you like that day, come and go etc. I didn;'t eat breakfast, so can't comment on that, the main railway station is across the street, so easy to get breakfast there much cheaper. We did use the restaurant on the top of the hotel, food was nice but cost 100 euros all together for 3 course and a bottle of wine. Great views but lacking in atmosphere. The staff were great, no complaints there at all. We used the underground alot as it was over the road and is very cheap and easy to use. Either a blue line which goes across the city or a green line that goes up and down. The staff at the hotel explain alot on how to get around and give you all the maps you need. Personally, i had high expectations from Barcelona, but was not that impressed, a big city with lots of shopping and not much else to look at. The Guadi buildings are great and the Guell parc, other than that just shopping and walking about. we found it hard to find a decent restaurant, found one in Las Ramblas called the Attic, i recommend this for the value and food, really good, it is upstairs so you have to look up and is on the left hand side as you walk down Las Ramblas. Camp Nou is worth a visit too if you are into football. On the whole a great value hotel if you don't mind catching the local transport. i would recommend it but Barcelona for me was not so good, i have been to better cities. I do understand though it is horses for courses and just wasn't my cup of tea. Too big, not enough good restaurants that were easy to find and not enough historical sites, perhaps i missed something? a haven for shoppers though.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spartanburg, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Location So-so\u201d", "Author": "scmommy8", "ReviewID": "UR47280184", "Content": "We chose this hotel b/c it looked like a really nice place to stay in Barcelona. It was a very nice hotel, however, not as nice as we would have thought for the price. We got upgraded to a superior room when we got there, which was nice, although the best part was the view! We were on the 21st floor and had great views of the city and Tibidabo. The service at the hotel was good - everyone was very helpful. The first 15 minutes of internet is free, but you have to pay after that and it is pretty expensive, not to mention I had a horrible time even connecting. I couldn't connect at all in our room and the service was so-so in the lobby. The biggest con of the hotel was the location - let me clarify though b/c it depends on what you are looking for. The hotel is basically in the business district. It is right by the train station and one of the main Metro stations (Sants Estacio) which makes getting places easy, but if you are looking to walk everywhere without using some sort of public transit, then it is more difficult. We love to walk and would have preferred to have been in an area more centrally located, like closer to the water. Next time we definitely would stay in a different location. We had breakfast in the hotel - it was kind pricey, 12 Euro/person - but a very good breakfast. Both hot and cold items and quite a spread, plus it in served in the restaurant on the top floor with great 360 degree views of the city. I would definitely suggest breakfast, it is worth it. Although there are minibars in the rooms, there is a huge grocery store (more like a Walmart) underneath the hotel where we went and got drinks/snacks for our room - a much cheaper option. They were great about letting us check in early, and keeping our bags until we were ready to catch our flight out. Overall, it was a nice hotel, just not as great as we thought it would be. Again, I would suggest staying somewhere more centrally located.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cDecent location, easy to find, good service\u201d", "Author": "maltman77", "ReviewID": "UR47184929", "Content": "This hotel is in a nice location for access to the metro.

The hotel I stayed in on 26 September 2009 was filled with very unhelpful and lying staff members and we were given a room that had seen much better days. Let alone the dirty underwear that a previous guest had left in the room and that housekeeping had over looked and the awful stench of some aerosol that was sprayed to cover the nicotine smell in this non-smoking room. Lets start with the unhelpfull staff. We came in around 3 PM. This is in my opinions a rather normal time, we indicated before hand we would be there at 3 PM and the hotel had not given us a warning that check in would be later. After identifying ourselves to the friendly but rather unprofessional check in guy (Jes\u00fas and he resembled Manuel of Fawlty Towers in more than one way) it took 10 minutes to sort out our reservation because (as they told me) I had swapped my first name and last name and this meant a total melt down of the reservation system. Finally he found my name and told us the room wasn\u2019t ready, because it was being cleaned, but would be ready in 45 minutes (we were standing there already for almost 15 minutes). Being an experienced traveler I knew that 45 minutes could mean 1 hour. So I asked him with a sense of humor if those 45 minutes were US minutes or Spanish minutes. I know Spaniards are not well know for their sense of humor and of course my joke was taken very seriously. My mistake. Anyway, he invited us to \u201ctake a chair with arms rests around the corner\u201d. We politely refused and waited in from of his desk. Just to make clear we wanted to go to our room. After 20 minutes the front office manager (called Montse) came to us and she invited us to go to the bar. I refused politely again, because the bar was a row of \u201cchairs with armrests\u201d and because walking away would mean a longer delay for certain. She informed us also that we were lucky because the room was ready 10 minutes early (in my language only 35 minutes late). After the 35 minutes nothing happened. After asking it would take another 15 minutes. After 15 minutes it would take another 10 minutes and so on. In the meanwhile I asked what was happening. It then became clear that they had sold their suites with a lazy late check out to 4 PM and that suites only were available after 4 PM. At check in we were told it was being cleaned and now we were told the room was still sold (sold double in fact). At 4 PM two guest came down to check out. Right next to me. In a very, very quiet hotel they were the only ones to check out within the past hour. The checked out of their suite. Our suite. So at 4PM the room still had to be cleaned. I mentioned this to the front office manager Montse and she told me I was wrong. That the room was still being cleaned (for an hour now) \" because it is such a bif room\". Obviously Montse was lying as Jes\u00fas was lying. She made it worse by informing me that she had called me that morning on my cell phone to tell me that the room would be ready late. Having my Blackberry phone with me this was a lie: I had no missed calls. I showed her my phone to prove it and she shrugged an insisted that she had called me. So that was lie number 3. Nevermind. As to the room: damaged furniture, peeled of walls and cubboards and nasty smells of nicotine in this non-smoking room. We received a small card with apologies and 1 (one) small piece of cake. Again an insult. The fact there was dirty underwear in the room made my irritation into humor. What a waste of space this hotel is and what a waste of people Montse en the poor Jes\u00far (being ordered to lie) are. We tried this hotel only on the basis of the very nice reviews on Tripadvisor and never go here again. We will go back to Arts or Meridien next time. For you readers: do yourself a favor and avoid this dump of a hotel with incompetent staff. Even if the price is low (I now know why) views are (indeed) to die for. I rather die somewhere else.

It's directly outside Sants train station, and a short walk down Tarragona ave to Montjuic and the Magic Fountain. Coupled with a travel card for the trains, it's perfect for travelling on lines 3 and 5 for some of the major attractions, and the direct Renfe train to/from the airport (which only costs approx 3 euros as opposed to the 30 euro taxi...). It's also one of the easiest hotels to see in Barcelona - visible from a lot of the higher viewpoints in the city, even from your plane if you fly in from the North (it's the building with the big blue Sony light on a spire on top). It's in a fairly quiet part of the city, so we heard no noise in our 6th floor room, even with the Merce festival happening all over the city. The location gives it some great views - our room sadly didnt have one, but that didnt stop us sitting on the 22nd floor watching the firework display at the end of the Merce festival out of the window, which was awesome. Ice machines are a problem, with 4 out of the 5 we tried not working, but I'm not that big of an ice fan so I dont hold it against them. The staff are extremely good - friendly, multi-lingual and very helpful, and the bar is reasonably priced. We didnt eat at the top floor \"Visual\" restaurant, but we did explore it and it looks very nice. The rooms are immaculately clean, comfortable, large and well equipped, with the exception of the TV which only has local TV, plus 2 English news channels and the German MTV - again though, I didnt come to Barcelona to watch TV so that wasnt an issue.

Our superior room was on the 21st floor, giving great views over Barcelona. Bed was huge and very comfortable. Bathroom also big (double sinks) and had a great power shower (very welcome when returning from the heat of the city streets and the metro). Location was great for getting from the airport by Renfe train to the busy Sants Station (where we nearly got pickpocketed by a smooth operator who \u201caccidentally\u201d dropped his sunglasses in front of me while boarding the metro, then began to scrabble on the floor at my feet: fortunately I did not trip over him as he clearly hoped, so that he could \u201chelp\u201d me while robbing me.

The reception desk, while far from glossy, is manned by a great, helpful staff. The restaurant on the top floor is worth at least one visit for dinner, slightly pricey but very atmospheric and with panoramic views. As regards the buffet breakfast, it can be hit or miss as the hot food often goes cold before new supplies arrive.

I booked two superior rooms and had it upgraded to executive rooms short before my stay. The only difference between superior and executive is that the executive rooms are on the upper floors (I think 18 to 22). I had to pay \u20ac 12,00 per room per night for the upgrade and I found this acceptable because the higher your room is, the more spectacular the views are. They gave us two corner rooms on the 21st floor and I think we had the most magnificent view we have ever had in a hotel. We could even see the magic fountains on Plaza Espagna from our room and this was great. Breakfast is \u20ac 12,00 if you book it when checking in. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is very nice, with seperate toilet / bidet and a spacious shower. They also have a bath. I think the rooms have been refursbished not too long ago. Everything looked nice. However, soms small things need to be repaired (a broken lamp, a broken shelf in the shower and the airco in one of the rooms didn't work properly). Minor things that are not acceptable in a five star hotel, but in my opinion acceptable in a four star hotel. Although I think management could improve there service if they would check these things regularly. In one of the rooms we had a coffee tray with coffee, tea and a water cooker. In the other room there was no coffee tray and I had to ask for this two times and after that we only got a water cooker, soms coffee and one cup. Not a complete tray with tea, milk and two cups. Apperantly it was too difficult for the staff to understand that every room should have a complete tray. One room also had no slippers and no extra pillows. The other room had no floor towel. I think that, even in a four star hotel, these amenities should be present in every room. Housekeeping was also not perfect. The floors were not spotless clean and in the bath tub we found some hairs. After all, I think the hotel is nice, the staff is very polite (but not always professional) and the hotel and the rooms look nice. I think the most important reason to book this hotel is for its fabulous views. Therefor I would advise to book an executive room. The hotel is close to Sants Station so that's very comfortable traveling from and to the airport. Trains leave every half our and the journey takes about 25 minutes. Please beware of pickpockets.

The Gran Torre Catalunya is just that and at around 90 Euros a night for the two of us, it proved to be excellent value. We booked 2 nights directly with the hotel via their website, on a room only basis. I emailed the hotel to find out if they could surprise my girlfriend and they were most happy to arrange for a small cake and a card to be given to her free of charge! When we arrived at the hotel we were given a choice of 2 rooms: one on the 5th floor and one on the 7th floor. We chose the 7th floor room as it was much bigger and offered a better view of the city. Although it was a smoking room, it did not smell of tobacco at all, so I think that they perfume it well when cleaning. I thoroughly recommend breakfast on the 19th floor as it has everything that you can imagine (hot items like bacon and sausage, cereals, cold meats, smoked salmon and even torta Espanyola) plus it offers a great opportunity to take spectacular camera shots of the city. You can get a cheaper rate if you book it via the reception staff. It may still seem expensive, but if you eat enough at breakfast time then you can skip lunch and have some tapas at dinner time. For tapas the best place to go is \"Ciudad Condal\"-2 mins walk from Plaza Catalunya Metro stop. It has amazing tapas and friendly staff and it is always busy! We made use of the sauna and swimming pool facilities at a cost of 6 euros each. These were fine although the swimming pool and gym are very small, so it makes for an intimate experience with other couples. If you feel like relaxing after a long day of sight-seeing then I recommend the experience as it is open until around 10pm. The hotel staff were all genuinely friendly and engaging and asked us about our stay, during the check-out process. They even took care of our bags whilst we went out to do sight-seeing on our last day. I noticed that the restaurant staff on the 19th floor were not wearing name badges and I think that these would be useful for them to be identifiable to guests. We would strongly recommend this hotel to all travellers as it is very affordable luxury, and it is only about 4 metro stops away from the centre. It has magnificent views of the city, and friendly, helpful staff. As others have said, It is also very easy to get to from the airport. Some advice about safety in Barcelona: It is better to keep all your Euros and bank cards in the room's safety box and only carry the money that you will be needing on the day, as pickpocketing is rife here. We did not carry a wallet or purse and kept our money in several pockets.

Let me begin with the only real drawback this hotel had: Location. Barcelona is a massive, sprawling city, and unfortunately for the hotel, while it is extremely convenient to Sants Station (which allows you to take a train from the airport to the hotel), it's quite a walk to the historical areas of the city and from most of the nice shops / restaurants. Yes, there is a metro stop very close by which makes traveling to those areas pretty convenient, but since we were only in Barcelona for a couple of days, we wish that we had been a little closer to the \"action\" -- maybe on a street like Gran Via. Also, the area around the hotel looks largely residential and primarily as if it were built in the 1960's-1970's, not as nice in aesthetic appeal as the streets in the more \"touristy\" parts of Barcelona. Also, I'm not positive, but I believe that the metro stops running around 2:00 AM on weeknights (which is still early in Spain), so if you wanted to enjoy Barcelona's nightlife in a spot that's distant from the hotel, you'd likely need to get a taxi back. That being said, our overall stay at this hotel was excellent. The room decor was basic, slightly modern I suppose. The bathroom was very nice, with two sinks, a fog/steam resistant mirror, and a shower that had great pressure. The room had an ironing board and you could request an iron, if needed. We didn't watch tv really, but I did see that there were 4-5 English speaking stations (which was the most of any hotel we stayed at during our trip). Also, there was a mini-fridge in the room (complete with Cava!). We were on the 11th floor with a nice view of the Montjuic area...we did see the room next to ours, which was a corner room with double the amount of windows and therefore a phenomenal view --- if available, request one of the corner rooms for a truly outstanding view. The breakfast service that the hotel provides on the 23rd floor restaurant was great (and is discounted to 12 Euros per person, rather than 16 Euros, at the hotel's front desk upon check in), offering good food and great, panoramic views of the city. Dinner at the restaurant (named Visual) in the evening was also very nice and enjoyable. Finally, the one thing I was most impressed with at this hotel was the level of service by the staff. Our check-in was flawless and extremely informative (given a map of the city and some basic directions to key sites / metro stations, details on the best deals on the metro, details of the hotel's services, etc.), and upon check out the receptionist even sold us postage for our postcards and said that she would take care of stamping & mailing them out. Also, I was able to use the business center free of charge to check my email and log in to our airline site to print our boarding passes for our flight out of Barcelona at the end of our trip -- again, great service. For the great value (booked on Expedia at $102 per night) and impeccable level of service, I'm not sure that you could find many better hotels in Barcelona (despite the slightly distanced location from the best sights).", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "durham", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel and city break\u201d", "Author": "discopants73", "ReviewID": "UR31925080", "Content": "Just returned from a 5 day stay At Barca.Had a great time,room was clean ,spacious and walk in shower was the most powerful I have ever used.Room was on the 15th floor and the views were great.Restaurant meals are really good and being on the 23rd floor the views of the city at night were spectacular.Staff did all they could to make your stay pleasurable and were very helpful.We read the reviews on Barcelona before we travelled and felt a tad apprehensive about all the stories of pickpockets and the like but have to say we never once felt intimidated or encountered any problems.We made use of the metro sytsem buying a T10 ticket for 6-8 euros and you can reach any area in 10 to 15 minutes from the hotel.All in all we had a great time and fully recommend the hotel.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel just one 5 minute train ride from central Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "liamneary", "ReviewID": "UR31832446", "Content": "The hotel was perfect for our week-long stay.

We called, and they did their best to find us another similar room, which they did 4 floors down. That was also lovely, except the internet connection didn't work. When we told them this, they sent the bellhop to try to fix it. Yes, the bellhop. Once he finally believed me that it was not a problem with my computer, they collectively shrugged that there was nothing they could do since it was a weekend.

The bathroom was amazing... double sinks, bidet, large shower and tub with excellent water pressure, always a much appreciated amenity. The spa area is small but pleasant, worth the 6 Euro price, and the business center has fast net access and free printing.

The supermarket next door has good selection, we grabbed a few items of late night drinks or snacks, and the refridgerator in room has space to keep your perishables. If you are concerned about the location being too far from Las Ramblas, don't be. The hotel is directly across from Estacio Sants, through which run the Green and Blue metro lines. Las Ramblas is 5 stops away, about a 5-6 minute ride. Estacio Sants also provides easy access to and from El Prat airport via the train, about a 30min ride for 2.50 Euros. Pick up a T-10 ticket for metro rides, good value and its transferable. Hotel is also about a 10 min walk from the Montjuic magic fountains, a show that should not be missed. Catch the last one of the day, it looks best when it's dark. As far as entertainment, the whole city is within your reach via the metro. Ramblas is the big draw at night, great fun to just stroll along, eat some tapas, stop for some wine or cava and people-watch at an outdoor cage. Placa Reall is especially fun for an afternoon bite. The Barri Gotic is a great maze of narrow streets and a myriad of shops, great fun to wander. We mainly stuck to small cafes for our meals, but did have a nice dinner at Attic, about halfway up Ramblas, which I would recommend. If you are trying to save money or just get tired of eating ham on crusty bread, try one of the kebab shops.

During that day we had the very unfortunate pleasure of losing our travel wallets with all of ur passports, VIsa's etc. Getting to the airport, i call the Hotel and speak to the frontdesk who tell me that someone had called the hotel and told the staff that they had found it. At that time the hotel still had our bags but proceeded to tell this good samaritan that we had already left and that they should merely take it to their nearest police station. The person's contact details were not taken, the area in which he was making the call from was not noted, so I ran around Barcelona from one police station to the next trying to find this person. The hotel made no real effort to assist and after missing our flight back home, I was trying to make several calls back to the hotel to get some more information or assistance from any of the scarce managers.

We also booked it through a well-known uk cashback site and got an additional 7 and a half percent off!! I think it worked out about \u00a372 per night in the end,then,reading other reviews we decided to upgrade to an executive room,and paid a little more. Had a poor experience initially with Expedia who wanted to charge me \u00a315 because I had changed my booking to an executive room!! I politely pointed out that i would upgrade when I arrived in that case,at which point they wisely dropped the charge!! I say \"luxurious \" in my title,obviously this is a 4 star hotel,so don't take that too literally,but there is a nice air of comfort to the room,for the money,I think the lovely light wood panels and matching wooden furniture units create this. If you get an executive room,you get tea and coffee making facilities,which you don't get with a Standard room,I think. I also think that you don't get a bath robe with a standard room,but it says in the hotel brochure that you can request one. Soundproofing was one of the best bits,as this is a very busy city,but apart fom the usual police sirens,nothing to complain about.

Even better go and get yourself some orange juice and ensaimadas from the supermarket and eat in your room (there is also a cafe at the supermarket). I have to make allowances for the fact that we ordered it too late (they still very kindly let us have it though! )and the scrambled egg was in a pool of water and the bacon and sausages bore NO resemblance to food usually supplied in a traditional english breakfast-bacon was very thin and greasy more like ham,and sausages oozed with red oil.(think tapas) ps i love tapas but this was a Spanish version of an english meal-didn't work. I know that makes me a whingeing pom-you are right. Sorry,but I had to warn you!! Also tried the hotel RESTAURANT-they have a japanese chef (first time i have tried this type of food) and it was very \"nouvelle cuisine\"-tiny,tiny portions,not for those who like a reasonably sized plate of food,and was quite expensive, (\u00a3110 euros for two), though lovely views at night.

We booked through lastminute.com, which was about \u00a3100 cheaper per person than rival websites, with flights! When we arrived we jumped straight on the Train from Barcelona Airport, got a free train ticket to town, Jumped off at Sants walked out the door, debated about which way the hotel would be...but looked up and there it was...Couldnt have been simpler! When we arrived at the hotel the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. They upgraded our room free of charge, and so we were on the 12 floor. The porter took our bags up, and was very pleasant when explaining to us how things worked in the room, and also pointed out some of the views from our window, which was amazing (even if only of a busy city!) We wanted to watch the Champions League football whilst there (only on the TV) so we asked at the man at the front desk of any local bars that would show it. He searched the internet for us, and found a nice little Irish bar right next to 'La sagrada familia'. we had to get the metro there, but that wasnt too hard being on te door step of one! He also recommended a lovely little restaurant for a Tapas, and it was so reasonably priced too, although we didnt ake advantage of this till the following day. We walked absolutely everywhere, it was about a 30min walk into town, but the weather was amazing, and I never once felt unsafe. You get to see so much more when you're not crammed on a metro... We also took in the tour of the Camp Nou (Nou Camp!) Again we walked here from the hotel. It saved on the metro fair, and is good exercise! It took us 20mins. And was worth the walk for any football fan out there. We werent disappointed. The shop just near the hotel is also good for stocking up on refreshments, and over half the price of the hotel minibar it is worth it. Also, there are so many sights within easy distance of the Hotel, like the Olympic Village. Have a look at your travel book, and see whats around! Wherever you go, you will always see the hotel so you'll never get lost!! It towers above everything else, and at night you will see the neon sign on the roof! It was always fun to spot! All in all, the hotel was great. I regret not heading upto the hotel restaurant on the top floor, but we were just so busy with everything else that we just didnt have time. But I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good base to explore Barcelona, far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas to let you see that its not just a tourist destination. It has so much more to offer. On the way back to the Airport, ask a little man at the gate how to get to the Airport (act like a tourist)...they'll normal give you a free ticket again...saves 3 Euros!!! (every little helps!!) Extra Tip: (If you get the chance and you like books...The Shadow of the Wind, Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n, It is set in post- Spanish Civil War Barcelona, and mentions many of the places you may visit as a tourist...probably more of a chicks novel, but nevertheless an interesting read about a fascinating city...Barcelona!)", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cIt deserves 5 stars not 4!\u201d", "Author": "Kaiser_Amir", "ReviewID": "UR18994447", "Content": "Stayed at Torre Catalunya from July 7th til July the 13th. Had a wonderful vacation. To sum things up: the hotel was great and Barcelona is a fantastic city! \"Torre Catalunya\" can easily be reached by train from the airport. Its just three stops away and takes 30 minutes to get there. Once you are on the train platform at the airport just ask the guide standing next to ticket machines how can you get to the \"Sants Estacio\" and he'll show you which train you should take. He will also buy a ticket from the ticket machines for you if you can't do it yourself, even though they work in different languages, including english. So, you get off at \"Sants Estacio\" and once you're there you can't really miss the hotel since its such giant tower that its visible from most places in Barcelona. When we checked in at the \"Torre Catalunya\" they wanted to give us a room on the 3rd floor (or 4th I can't remember exactly). I asked for a higher floor and they gave us a room on the 6th floor, explaining other \"Standard rooms\" are fully occupied and if we want something on higher floors we have to pay extra for \"Executive suite\". We didn't, so we stayed at the 6th floor. I can honestly say that this room was one of the best ones I've ever had in a hotel. It was clean, spacious, had nice modern furnitures, a safe-box, a great air conditioner, a big flat screen tv and a stereo with cd player. Another thing which impressed me was the bathroom which was simply GIANT! The only minor problem with our room was that since it was on the 6th floor and facing the main street where they were doing some construction work it would get a bit noisy. But, this didn't bother us too much since they would start working after 9 o'clock while we would get up at 8. So, it wasn't as if we couldn't get the sleep we needed. At night, when we would return to the room the workers had left and everything was just fine. Now, apart from the great room, the best thing about this hotel is, without a doubt, its BREAKFAST! I'm not a big eater and I don't go on vacation to eat, but the breakfast at this hotel really impressed me. It is served on the top floor (21st) and from there you have a panoramic view of the city which is simply AMAZING! Its such a delight to sit next to the window while eating breakfast and having the entire city at your feet. The breakfast's menu was fantastic as well. It had EVERYTHING from sausages, bacon, scrambled egg to smoked salmon, cereals, etc. And they kept bringing more even we the closing time (10:30am) was nearing. The staff were very nice and kind. I broke a glass frame with a picture in it in our room and offered to pay for it, but they said it was no problem and refused to take money. Now, before booking the hotel, I was a bit worried by reviewes about the hotel's location. I read that some people said it was not centrally located. True! It's not, but its not a problem either. You have the \"Sants Estacio\" metro station in front of the hotel. From there you have a DIRECT LINE to Las Ramblas or \"Catalunya\" (city center). Just the the metro (green line) in the direction of \"Canyelles\" and if you want to go to Las Ramblas, then get off at \"Drassanes\". If you want to go to city center, then get off at \"Catalunya\". Either way, its a 15-20 minutes ride. You can buy a ticket for 4 days which is 10 euros from what I remember and its valid for metro, bus, tram, etc. for 4 days! A single trip ticket costs 1,60 euros. I used the internet at the hotel, down in the \"Business lounge\" and paid 3 euros for 30 minutes, while in the city center it costs 1,10 euros. Now, a few tips about Barcelona: 1- Not many people speak english! I'm not talking about the hotel staff. They speak good english. I'm talking about the people on the street! This can cause problems. It did for us and a lot of other tourists when we wanted to go back to the airport at the end of our Barcelona visit. Here is what happened: All monitors clearly said that the train leaving from platform 9 will go to the airport. So, we went to platform 9 where loads of other tourists were waiting. Just to make sure, I asked a local women if the train goes to the airport and she barely understood what I asked and finally just nodded her head saying \"Aeroporto, aeroporto\". Except that the train leaving from platform 9 NEVER reached the airport! Luckily for us, after the 3rd stop, we realized that it was the wrong train (a local man on the train also confirmed it) and hopped out with some other tourists. However, many other tourists just went on and I really feel for them, because I imagine some of them might have lost their flights. We on the other hand took a cab to the airport which costs us 25 euros, but we split the cost with an english man who was in the same situation as us. 2- Definitely go and visit \"Tibidabo mountain\". I know that almost all guides rate \"Sagrada Familia\" as the top attraction in Barcelona, but I liked Tibidabo best. The views from up there are BREATHTAKING and the way up with \"Funicular\" and the \"Blue tram\" is also great. 3- Avoid going to the \"Sagrada Familia\" at mid-day. I had a friend who did this and he told me he spent 6 HOURS there for going up and coming down. I went there around 18:00 (the last elevator goes up at 19:00) and I stood in the line for just 15 minutes. It took me around one hour and a half to see the whole thing. 4- If you like sunday shopping, then go \"Maremagnum\" shopping mall. Its pretty much the only shopping center open on Sunday. Just take the metro, the green line, and get off at the \"Drassanes\" station. 5- Parc Guell and the Ciutadella Park MUST also be on your visit list. If you have questions about the hotel, just send me a message.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "norwich", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Torre Catalunya!\u201d", "Author": "charlotte0884", "ReviewID": "UR18572215", "Content": "Have just got back from a 5 night stay at this brilliant hotel. As previous reviews mentioned the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. As soon as we checked in they had a map out showing us where we were located and pointed out the things that we should see! When we checked in I was slightly disappointed that we were given a room on the 3rd floor (especially when the reviews had been marvelling about the spetacular views) When we requested a room higher up we where told it would be an extra 12 euros per night between us. So we decided to upgrade and got a lovely room on the 18th floor with an amazing view over barcelona. Apparently any room above the 11th floor encounters the extra 12 euro a night, so if you want a great view be prepared to pay the extra! The room itself was immaculate and very stylish. It had everything you could need including mini-bar, huge t.v, tea making facilities, hairdryer, loads of storage space, a safe and loads more! The bathroom was amazing with two sinks, a large bath and then a seperate walk in shower and a separate toilet! Plus all the toiletries you could think of! I cannot comment on the hotels othere facilities as we only really slept there as there is so much to see and do in barcelona.Don't be put of by the fact that there is not outdoor pool as for no extra cost you can use the hotels next door rooftop pool for no extra cost plus they provide you with towels. Although the hotel is situated slightly outside the city centre an excellant metro sevice gets you there in 10 mins! The metro station is located two mins walk from hotel. We used the metro for all our journeys as it was cheap and efficient. The T10 ticket provides you with 10 journeys for 7 euros and you can use the ticket between yourself and whoever your travelling with. And unlike the london underground the tubes are air conditioned and feel a lot safer! We were often on the tube at midnight and never encountered any problems. Also close to the hotel is barcelona's main train station where you can travel all over spain and the best bit is that you can travel to and from the airport. We booked the hotel and flight ourself so did not get tranfers included so we got the train to and from the hotel and it cost peanuts! You can actually use your t10 ticket for this journey so it cost not even two pound each for our return journey!

If you stay at this hotel it is definately worth getting some t-10 tickets (10 journeys for 7.20 euros) for the metro system. There is a direct train from the airport to sants station which is right next to the hotel, and this journey is covered by your t-10 ticket. The station is on more than one metro line and although it is slightly out of the centre of town it is no trouble to use the air conditioned metro system to go a few stops to get to other areas. The bus turistic was also worthwhile although rather steep at 20 euros a day or 26 for 2 days but it is a very thorough hop on hop off system and it takes at least a day to go around all the 3 routes which the ticket covers.

Daniel at reception checked us in and he was very polite, informative and gave us a map and highlighted all the main attractions of the city. We were a bit disappointed when we found out that the pool was part of the spa therefore to use its facilities it came at a cost of 6 euros, which wasn't highlighted when the booking was made. The plus side to this was that the hotel around the corner Epox Hotel had an outdoor pool on the roof, free of charge to Torre Catalyuna guests. This was great as we could sunbathe and use the pool with the benefits of a spa in the hotel, even though we had to pay for it. We did use the spa which I would recommend as it was lovely and great to relax for a couple of hours after a days of city sightseeing. We took a Barcelona sightseeing bus which was behind the train station and we also spent a day at the beach which is about 25 mins by metro. Las Ramblas by metro is also about 15 mins away. For a short stay in Barcelona and if you looking to do a variety of things I thought the location was ideal. In general the area is relatively quiet, but there are quite a few major building works going on in the area. We were woken up one morning by some works, but on the whole it didn't affect our stay in the hotel. There are also a handful of restaurants in the area. Rooms were clean, spacious and modern.

In addition, we figured that trying a different hotel might give us a new and improved look at Barcelona. We found the Hotel Gran Torre Catalunya on Expedia and reserved 8 days there, at a price of approx. $275/night. I read various reviews on TripAdvisor, and felt comfortable paying this amount of money in advance (as required by Expedia) given the very good reports. We left NYC and flew overnight, arriving on a Tuesday morning. The hotel staff was quite accomodating, quickly finding a superior room on the 18th floor (the top floor for this room type), even though we were at least 2 hours before check-in time. When we arrived at the room itself, it was clean and comfortable. The view was astounding from the 18th floor (see pictures); also, this was a corner room, giving a view toward the east and south. The bed was large (i.e., two twin beds together) and very comfortable. The television was the largest that we've ever had in Europe, measuring about 32\" widescreen. Also, the bathroom was very spacious with 2 sinks, a tub, separate shower, and a separate room for the toilet/bidet. My only issue was that the floors were marble with minimal carpeting on each side of the bed. Subsequently, the floor was cool, making it uncomfortable to walk without shoes for much time. There is a safe in the closet and a refrigerator/mini bar in a cabinet. Also, the A/C is excellent with individual controls in the room. Overall, the room was really worth every penny paid. The rest of the hotel was also equally impressive. The lobby was nicely decorated with easy access to the various areas of importance. There are 5 fast-moving elevators, which means that there is never any significant wait to get up or down when you want. We checked out the restaurant which is on the penthouse floor; the view is great, but the prices are noteworthy as well. There is also a spa/gym in the basement. If you want to workout, the exercise room is free for guests; it is sparsely equipped with several nautilus type machines (3), a few aerobic machines (3), and some dumbbells. It could use some mirrors and better a/c. If you want the spa/pool, you need to pay 6 euros and then you have full access. There is also a locker room to change and clean up after a swim or workout. For a hotel gym, it was reasonable, although I've seen much better. Housekeeping was very good, coming whenever we left the room (either in the AM or afternoon). The staff was always courteous and spoke English to us proficiently and courteously, even though my Spanish is limited (and my Catalan is essentially zero). When one of the bathroom light bulbs went out, the staff responded appropriately and quickly (i.e., it was replaced within 30 minutes by maintenance). Some of the reviews commented on the distance from the main attractions (i.e., Sagrada Familia, la Rambla, etc.). Yes, this hotel is a good distance away, requiring the Metro to get to these various tourist attractions. However, the area is quite busy and safe with a railroad/Metro station about 1 block away. In addition, there are plenty of small restaurants and shops very close by, in several different directions from the hotel. We prefer to stay in areas away from the tourists and closer to the locals, since this gives us a chance to see how the residents of the city live and interact. Also, it is generally cheaper, since you don't get treated like a tourist with overpriced goods and services. Overall, the Hotel Gran Torre Catalunya was a great find and more than met our expectations.

Barcelona is a fantastic city and one I would certainly like to return to with husband and kids in tow. As stated in previous reviews the journey from the airport into Sants estacio is free, (they give you the ticket as you get to the train barrier and then again at Sants for your return) very quick (3 stops away)and easy. The hotel is right by the station but make sure you come out of the right exit! Very straightforward check-in with polite and informative staff. We had taken the advice from reviewers and booked an executive room and were on the 17th floor with the great views everyone talks about. Bathroom was great with bath, separate shower and double sinks - bath robes and slippers are provided too. My only slight critism (and really only when looking hard) was that the air con was not very powerful and the room could be very hot when you first come in despite it only being May. We made use of the free safe after reading and hearing from friends about the risk of pickpockets and this was good advice, though we felt entirely safe throughout our stay. The locals are friendly and helpful and the metro system is a joy - simple to use, cheap (buy the 10 tickets at the station machines and share), and gets you to anywhere you would want. However, we had booked the tourist bus additionally and this was probably easier to reach the admission free Gaudi park and generally get your bearings - again better to buy on line. There appear to be two separate companies and we had booked with the seemingly less well known, Barcelona tours,(orange buses rather than multi-coloured) after some initial difficulties finding the stop near the hotel (turn right as you leave the hotel), this seemed like a good company which takes you close to all the main sights and if you don't want to go into some of the Gaudi buildings you can at least see the outside from the bus which are amazing. However, we did go inside the cathedral, which is good value for money, I think. We also visited the Picasso museum and if you are an art lover it is a lovely place to go - the building is beautiful and there are many of his works. Nearby the museum is the area to find various tapas and also the Gothic church. Eating wise there is so much choice - I would recommend Los Caracoles but get there early (7.30) as it is as busy as the equally famous 5 Cats in Place Real. The snails are fab and then spit roast chicken to name only a couple of the choices but the atmosphere seems very authentic. If you are seated downstairs, make sure you go to the toilet as the place is much larger than you expect and has some very interesting decoration and twists and turns, so I nearly got lost! We also pre-booked a dinner and flamenco show, (just off la Ramblas) which was an excellent recommendation by the hotel staff, who also booked on our behalf,. 60 euros for both a wonderful and extensive buffet, including drinks, paella and various seafood and salad dishes. The falamenco took my breath away and as it is a fairly small venue it feels intimate and not too touristy - in fact there were many Spanish and few British except for us. We had the breakfast at the hotel on the final morning - which had a vast choices, fantastic views and service, and was very convenient for our midday departure. All in all, I would highly recommend a trip to Barcelona, any sort of group (shame even the hen weekends have got here , though not too overwhelming).

There is a locals bar/restaurant just 5 mins walk from the hotel(either full menu or tapas, which we had) if you're too tired to head back into town. The food was nice but the place is brightly lit (so not the place for a romantic evening!). We didn't have dinner at the hotel but the breakfast was excellent. I thought at first it was expensive, but the selection was amazing and all really fresh. Transport links from the hotel are good with the train station so close, with the metro, which is frequent and clean. There is also a taxi rank outside the station - and they are not too expensive for heading into town at night (approx \u20ac7).

The bar provides a cheaper option with pizza, pasta and a really good burger on offer. Being a city centre hotel there is no outside space to relax in but there is a park next to the hotel.

The metro can take you to barcelona in either 3 or 5 stops (5-8 minutes) depending where you get off on las ramblas, as well as many other places. We also used the spa, which has a small pool and gym, with 2 saunas and a steam room was 6 euros each.

You cannot miss the 23 storey new hotel building as you exit the station It has a massive SONY radio aerial on the roof. The hotel is very new so the owners may have built it to be ready for the extra visitors when the new high speed train from Madrid arrives. That is the reason for the building work at the station. We visited in Nov 07 and the work did not affect us at all. Terrific cheap buffet in the station restaurant which we used prior to departing on the way home. We booked flights via EasyJet and the hotel via \u2018eXcape with us\u2019 which gave us a good deal for four nights. However, I tried for hours on the internet to seek a phone number for the hotel so I could ring and make sure our booking was on their system (which I always do). Reading the other reviews I came across the fact that the old 6 storey Expo hotel next door was in the same group. Typed in expo hotels and voila! - a telephone number - which is [--]. The website is \u2018expogrupo.com\u2019 (and they own the fabulous Mare Nostrum resort in Tenerife). When we arrived all the reception staff spoke excellent English and very really helpful. We had booked a standard room because the eXcape site did not give the option of a superior room. Reception told us standard rooms are up to floor 9, and superior room floors 10-16. Floors 17-22 are more expensive and I think some are suites. We chose floor 16 with panoramic views and paid 8 euros each per night extra, which matched what others were offering on the web. Other reviews are accurate re the excellent facilities and restaurants so I will not repeat them here but instead give a little feedback on the city. Barcelona is very much bigger than we envisaged but if you like walking you can see so much. We walked in to the centre by different routes every day and in the evening came home by taxi for \u00a35. There are three open topped bus tour routes, which if you did them all back to back would take a whole day. However they are worth it especially the two day \u2018hop-on, hop-off\u2019 ticket which we used. There is a lot to see so get a cheap guide book and plan your visit. Sagrada Familia is architecturally, simply stunning. The maritime museum shows how Spain was able to navigate the world centuries ago. There is a model of the Armada\u2019s flagship - what must have been an awesome sight coming across the English Channel. Regarding security, If you are sensible Barcelona is no more dangerous than London, Manchester, Leeds etc. I wear Rohan or Meyer trousers both of which have zipped security pockets inside a front pocket, where I keep some money for the day. I have sewn an internal security pocket (\u00a33 John Lewis) inside the waist band where I keep passports and remainder of euros for the holiday. My wife always wears her Eagle Creek secure handbag across her shoulder with zips closed. Any self respecting pickpocket will go for the back pocket wallets and the open handbags which are in abundance. Some people simply do not think - until it is too late and the wallet or purse has gone. The hotel was always a nice place to return to in the evening, for a drink or meal in the bar or a nice relaxing bath. For Barcelona, we recommend the Gran Hotel Torre Cataluna. Hope this is helpful.

Whilst central (it's right by the main train station (Sants) in Barcelona) and about a 10 minute walk to Placa Espana and a few stops on the metro to Sagrada Familia or Las Ramblas, it is not within walking distance to the main touristy area. However, if you don't mind travelling a bit then this is a nice hotel. An added plus is that one of the \"tourist tour\" buses stops near the hotel (but get to the bus stop early as that gets busy - goodness knows what it's like at peak times in the summer months!) Back to the hotel. Upon arrival, we were greated by a friendly welcome and given some useful information about the area and where to get food etc. Note that if you're not booked in for breakfast but want to be, it's cheaper to sign up for breakfasts when you check in than turning up each morning at breakfast. We were disappointed to learn that to use the gym/spa etc we would have to pay locally. This was not mentioned on the website we booked with, nor on the hotel website. Had we known this, this could have influenced our decision to stay there. We had paid for an executive room and had a nice room on the 12th floor. We couldn't really fault the room at all - clean, well presented and modern. Tea and Coffee etc were provided (an added plus in Europe!) and the shower/bathroom was to die for. Perhaps a small grumble was the lack of a proper second pillow for each of us (there was a large cushion) but this may have been able to be resolved by a quick call to housekeeping (we were too lazy to bother!). We weren't too adventurous on our first night, and went to the top floor hotel restaurant for dinner. Whilst expensive, the food was good (although of the \"no vegetables with main meals\" variety) and the views spectacular. Service was excellent until we wanted to pay. We would recommend this for a special occasion. Breakfast in the morning was what others on this site have described - plenty of variety to suit all tastes, possibly expensive (but convenient) however as previously stated, the hot food was cold. However, service was good and everything was replaced quickly. The view from that floor in the daytime is also good. Even if you decide not to go for breakfast/dinner, definitely wander on up to admire the view from that floor. A good feature of the hotel is that you don't have to pay for internet access for the first 5 minutes of use. This means you can use the computers to check in for free. In the end, we didn't use the spa facilities (I objected to paying extra for them), but they seemed ok. The gym was quite small (as was the pool) but everything appeared to be in order. Generally we have no substantive complaints about this hotel. Service was good. The location was convenient (the metro is literally across the road from the hotel) and we could travel to everywhere we wanted too without any problems.

We stayed on the 10th floor. The free breakfast was insanely good: a ginormous buffet with tons of everything: all kinds of juices, pastries, meats, coffee, cereal, yadda, yadda and vegetarian friendly. And the view from the restaurant is gorgeous, just make sure to get there early and grab a window seat and a free paper!).

You have to stick your key in the inside light switch to make it turn on (odd, esp since we arrived at night and had no clue), so get an extra key if you have to hang out alone with and wish to have lights on. There are a bunch of English channels, mostly news and sports. The hotel staff was exceptionally polite and very helpful too.

Our room was situated on the twelfth floor and afforded beautiful views of the city and surrounding mountains- a bonus over more centrally located accommodation. Whilst not detracting from our own experience, the building work outside (including some work at night!) would deter us from recommending this hotel to light sleepers. Also, whilst the hotel caters well for people on business and couples, the lack of hotel based activities may not make it an ideal choice for families with young children. That said, with so much to do in Barcelona itself, this shouldn\u2019t be too much of a deterrent! We found the staff to be friendly, polite and hard working. All of the staff we encountered spoke good English, and whilst the hotel did seem fairly quiet at the time of our visit, credit should still be given the very efficient room service. For couples, we would highly recommend the restaurant at the top of the hotel, which affords panoramic views of the city and serves delicious food. A note of caution, however, as it does come at a cost!

The location was fine - we knew it was a little way out of the centre but with the proximity of Sants station and the metro it was fine. We also knew there was building work nearby so knew there might be some building noise. Barcelona was very busy, due to various conferences etc and The Police concert on 27 Sept which we went to (and fabulous it was too!). It meant the first night was expensive (260 Euros) but the following nights were about 160 euros per night. To add insult to injury the hotel charges 6 Euros per person per visit to the Spa, which might not be much but it\u2019s the principle\u2026. Our first problem was they didn\u2019t have our reservation when we arrived, despite using a well known website and paying in full in advance, after about 20 mins at the reception desk this was resolved and they \u201cfound\u201d our reservation. The next problem was with internet access as my husband wanted to make an internet conference call on the Friday. He was advised wireless connection would work in our room but when it didn\u2019t he contacted Reception and was told wireless only worked on the first two floors of the hotel. They didn\u2019t send anyone for about 45 mins by which time he\u2019d missed the start of his call\u2026 Later on that day we couldn\u2019t get access to the internet again and that time had to wait for over an hour for anyone to come to our room. On check out we had to argue our case to get them to wave their connection charge. On the Friday night we wanted a relatively early night following a day\u2019s sight seeing and we were kept awake by noisy neighbours \u201cpartying\u201d in the corridor from about 3am until 7am. We called reception and they sent someone to speak to the other guests. The noise was partly as the room doors don\u2019t have a slow close mechanism and therefore are quite noisy when they close and also the floors are marble \u2013 both in the corridors and rooms, so you can hear everyone walking around as well as not having soft furnishings to absorb some of the noise. After such a disturbed night the hotel staff agreed to move us to a much higher floor and they did so the following morning and in fact we were also given a room upgrade, so they handled that complaint well. To be honest we were so tired we\u2019d have checked out and gone elsewhere if it wasn\u2019t for the fact our four nights were already paid for. Check out on the Sunday was also very slow. Perhaps we suffered from a particularly busy time for the hotel and they certainly didn\u2019t have enough staff to deal with guests although they did try to resolve problems.

After reading other travellers reviews we were aware that there was some building work going on outside and the general advice was to ask for a room as high as possible, not only for the views but because of the noise! When we arrived we were told that we had only booked and paid for a standard room which would only get us a room as high as the 6th floor, however we were given the option to upgrade an extra 12 euro's a night upto 15 floor (I think), then extra 24 euro's upto 20 floor then even more to get higher and a suite. We opted for an extra 12 euro's to get a room on the 15 floor. We were a little early checking in so left our cases and hopped on a tourist bus, when we returned we were delighted to find that the kind receptionist had given us a double bed executive room on the 20th floor with the most amazing views! and we couldn't hear the building work. Just remember to be kind and considerate when asking and you might be as lucky as us! the room was always left clean with complimentary chocolates every day. The bed was huge and really comfortable and the room had the TV sound linked into the bathroom. Our package included breakfast and we'd certainly recommend you try and get breakfast included as it was an extra 20 euros each a day otherwise. The breakfast selection was huge and of good quality including a health section with a fresh smoothie every morning. You are able help yourself to as much as you like including smoked salmon, pastries, traditional english, continential. Even chilled bottles of bubbly are on ice. Recommend you treat yourself to a session in the spa for only 6 euro's each. the hydro massages in the pool are just what you need after a day walking in the city! All the staff that we came into contact with always had a smile. As the hotel is in the financial district we used the metro to visit all the other parts of the city. We recommend you buy a T10 ticket from the ticket machines in the stations, it's only 6.90 euro's, we brought ourselves a couple, great value for money as we could also use this to get to and from the airport. Be careful your not ripped off when visiting The Rambles, best to eat and drink just off one of the side street as you can pay as much as 7 euros for a pint of beer! steer clear of Mickys.

What an amazing place! It had everything - culture, great food and wine, amazing shopping, friendly people, lovely weather, fantastic beaches(so close to city) and a brilliant transport system(so easy to get around). Stayed at the Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya after checking out reviews on Trip Advisor and other websites. Booked hotel through hotels.com. Paid \u20ac580 for an executive room for 5 nights. (I only booked a week in advance) It was right opposite Sants Station and only 5 stops on metro into the Ramblas (Drassanes station). As I mentioned, we were in an executive room. Standard room was obviously cheaper but having read the reviews which mentioned that there was building work going on at the station and that the executive rooms were higher up with less noise I booked the executive room. There was indeed building work going on at station and while you could kind of hear it early in the morning, it didn't disturb us or put us off. Our room was very large and as many reviews mention - the bathroom is amazing. I want the bathroom in my house to look like that! Marbled floors thoughout the room and the bathroom was marbled from floor to ceiling. There were his and her sinks, lovely bath with shower but then there was separate glass door in bathroom leading to toilet and bidet and then another seperate glass door leading to large shower room! Bathroom had phone and speakers in ceiling with whatever was on TV coming though to bathroom. Also great toiletries left in bathroom. Apart from the usual shampoo/conditioner/shower gel/ shower cap there was also a dental kit, shaving kit and comb!!!!! The bedroom had all you would need - including a CD player (so remember to bring CD's with you!), large TV, minibar and Tea and Coffee making facilites and internet access. The air-conditioning and black-out curtains were also greatly appreciated!! There is a safe in the room. I thought I read in some reviews that you had to pay a daily rate for the safe - you don't. The hotel itself is lovely. We were checked in promptly. The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. On the first night we booked dinner in the restaurant on the 24th floor!!! What amazing views. Such an atmosphere. Free bottle of Cava if you eat between 8pm and 8-30pm. In Spain dinner is usually eaten a lot later than at home! The dinner was an experience in itself. Service fantastic. We both had 3 course dinner with one glass of the nicest red wine I have ever tasted and coffee too! The bill came to \u20ac130 which is steep but it was a lovely experience and atmosphere for our first night in Barcelona. Complimentary olives, aperatif and bread were served with the dinner. The menu might not be to everybodys liking. Found it difficult to choose a starter and in the end chose Rose Canneloni with turnip and mushroom consomm\u00e9!!! It was actually rose petals inside canneloni style shavings of turnip in a clear mushroom soup!!!! The most bizarre thing I have ever eaten in my life. My mother had mushroom risotto with quail which was lovely. We both had the seabass for maincourse but don't expect any carbohydrates with that. It said served with green beans and mussles. I'd say there was one green bean on the plate sliced into the tiniest strips and 3 tiny mussles on the plate!!!!! I would say go up and check the restaurant and menu out and deside for yourself. Nice chilled out bar on the top floor too. Breakfast was not included in our room price. Couldn't find a deal on net for this hotel with breakfast included. Breakfast was I think \u20ac16 euro per person. As other reviewers said - you can grab breakfast in cafe across the road at cafe in station. We actually got cereal, milk, yoghurts and pastries at supermarket next door and had in our room!!! There is a spa in hotel as well as pool, sauna, steam room, gym and computers with internet access at \u20ac3.20 for half an hour (or 10 minutes is free!) downstairs in basement. There is a daily rate of \u20ac6 if you want to use the pool/sauna/steam room and obviously spa treatments are seperate. Would defintiely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay in this hotel if I visit Barcelona again (which hopefully will be again soon! Had such a great time in this city. I know people have mentioned pick pocketers and wallets being stolen but I have to say I felt totally safe in Barcelona and didn't see any eveidence of this. Everybody is so relaxed in this city. There seems to be no trafffic, no rushing for trains or the underground and people wait for the green man even when the road is clear as far as you can see!!!!!! Anyone interested in great shopping - here are some great places: There is a shopping centre down at the bottom of the Ramblas near Aquarium and Imax called Magnummare and the L'Illa shopping centre is great too and is located on Avinguda Diagonal - metro to Maria Cristina station and 10 min walk down to centre or get tram(check out all the food places on the lower level), Roca Outlet Village(www.larocavillage.com) is great too for some designer bargains - you can get return bus for \u20ac10 (hotel can organise it......it's around 50 minutes outside Barcelona), We got train and courtesy bus from station to the village, also check out Passeig de Gracia, Placa Catalunya and Av. Portal d'Angel for some great shops. Beach is great and there are some nice places to eat and Casino as well. Get off at Barceloneta or Ciutadella i Vila Olimpica stops on Metro. Some great restaurants serving Spanish food but also ate some great Japanese food at an all you can eat carousel buffet (\u20ac13.90 p.p at Japanese Restaurant on Gran Via De Les Corts (very close to hotel) and some amazing arabaic food at arabaic restaurant downstairs in L'Illa shopping centre. If you go to Barcelona in warm season make sure you go up to Tibadabo. It's high above city with a great church with statue of Jesus with arms outstretched looking down over whole city and Mediteranean. There is also a great theme park up there too with lots of rides that let you look down over the whole city. Amazing. To get there you need to get metro to Catalunya, then train to Av. Tibidabo and then tram and cable car up. The views are unbelievable! Great atmosphere up there too. As you can see, I absolutely loved Barcelona. I haven't mentioned the art museums etc as my mother who accompanied me is not interested in them whatso ever!!!! I will hopefully return again soon and check them out for myself. I have visited the Dali museum north of Barcelona which is a day trip you can do. Well worth a visit. I was there on school tour many years ago and it really got me interested in art.

However, one will have to take the subway to Placa de Catalunya or a taxi to a nearby transfer point at Francesc Marcia-Diagonal in order to take the Red Line. The breakfast is a buffet style with lots of food; the smoke salmon is even better than what we have in the cruise ship which we have just left. The magnificent view of Barcelona one can enjoy during breakfast is beyond comparison. The staff is polite and friendly. The bellboy is particularly helpful. He explained the various switches of the room when he delivered our luggage to us. The hotel should have been a very good hotel but for the work site situated right in front of it. We arrived the hotel after leaving the cruise ship early in the morning and arrived at the hotel some time after 9 a.m.. Despite my request to have a room at a higher floor, the girl at the front desk said I could only check into a room on the 3rd floor immediately, or I would have to wait until 12 noon, the regular check in/out time. for another room on the 8th floor. There was also a condition that I would not be able to change my room once I had checked into the 3rd floor room. Since I have only 2 days in Barcelona, I wanted to settle down as soon as possible so that I could start my sightseeing earlier, I decided to accept the 3rd floor room and was fully prepared to take this as a room without a view. However, we had overlooked one thing or had we been alerted at all, i.e. it faced the worksite in front of the hotel. At 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, workmen started talking loudly outside the worksite and heavy machines were clanking up and it was just impossible to continue with our sleep. We did not negotiate with the hotel for a change of room because we would have to get up at 3 a.m. to catch a flight home on the second morning. I wonder whether the hotel will allow us to change our room even if we asked. Another problem is the partition between the bathroom and the living area. Part of the partition is made of translucent glass. When I had to use the bathroom during the night, light came out through the glass partition and shone directly on the face of my wife and this woke her up. I cannot understand the rational of using the glass partition nor its location. If the designer wanted something translucent to create an ambient or what not, he should, say, use a translucent glass door, which faced the closet.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "midlands", "Title": "\u201cVery friendly\u201d", "Author": "Gupta7", "ReviewID": "UR7723328", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for anniversary for 3 nights.

The bathroom it self was large with separate shower area and a bath . The views from the room were excellent . the hotel is 23 stories high so if you can get a room on a higher floor the views are good. The hotel was clean and service was responsive. There were a few irritants though - there wasn't a double bed in the room rather two single ones ( good size though), there was a slight seepage problem in the bathroom and water collected at a particular point on the floor. And although there was a coffee making tray available in the room, they do not replenish the items in the tray. So you got to use them economically to make them last the duration of the stay.

The room was just gorgeous, marble floors and bathroom, topped up minibar, fab view! It really was a dream for us, we felt so posh! Would recommend definetely! Again as with other reviews, get a travel pass(barcelona card), as you don't have to keep paying to get around, it just gets u everywhere! If you do get this card when you book your holiday, and you have to collect it, you can only get it from the tourisme in barcelona town, or the airport. don't try and get it on a bank holiday day at 3 in the afternoon, it won't happen! get the card straight away at the airport, so you don't have to spend money getting to the tourist building! you also get a discount book for many things, so it may be better to wait till you get that before pre-booking! Also, went to flamenco dancing show at Flamenco's. also fantastic! In a lovely setting, courtyard not far from hotel. Barcelona stadium also a good day out!

Had booked this hotel on the basis of many very strong reviews here on Tripadvisor. Location - hotel occupies the south side of Placa dela Paisos Catalana. The main train station Sants Estacion is on the west side of the square (the pick-up/drop-off for Ryanair's Reus coaches). The hotel is an Ideal base for exploring Barcelona, just a few minutes on the Metro from the hustle and bustle of Rambla. A number of the main Barcelona attractions are within easy walking distance of the hotel including the Placa d'Espana. Reception - Dario and Jennifer were professional and very welcoming while Miquel looked after the bags (if you arrive early or are departing late the hotel will hold your bags). Had booked a standard room with \"American Breakfast\" included. Reception advised standard room was on 6th floor but offered an upgrade to a superior room on 17th floor for Eur12 a night extra. A no brainer. The superior room was huge with a magnificent view southwards towards Palau Nacional and Montjuic. King bed, separate soft seating area, desk, two coffee tables and chairs. The bathroom was bigger than many hotel rooms I have been in. Complementary tea/coffee, large TV in-room safe and mini-bar (prices reasonable eg. Eur5 for quarter bottle of wine). The room was spotless, cleaned every day with a turn down service in the evening. Breakfast Room/Dining Room - Restaurant Visual on the 23rd floor with panoramic view of the city. A friendly greeting from Kelly every morning. Buffet breakfast was a feast, Cava included - and when in Spain :-). Can't comment on the hot food as did not partake but juices, cereals, fresh fruits, cold cheese/meats/smoked salmon platters and breads were in plentiful supply and the coffee was excellent. Food piers were patrolled and replenished frequently. Breakfast by 8:30am to avoid the rush and for window seating. We had A-La-Carte dinner in the restaurant on one night. Apparently very popular with couples at weekends so reservations are necessary particularly if you want a window table. There is a local food and wine tasting menu on offer for Eur40 a head which seemed to be drawing a lot of interest at other tables. We opted for local specialities. 4 courses, a bottle of wine and some Grappa for me, for Eur90, including tip. The food, presentation and service was excellent however hearty appetities may need a pre-dinner burger and fries in the nearby MacD's. Worth noting the range of wines on the list in the Eur12-20 bracket. Didn't use the spa or fitness room. Large supermarket in building below hotel. Overall, hotel worthy of 4* rating and excellent value-for-money. Would highly recommend. Downside - Placa dela Paisos Catalana is currently a building site. The square is the subject of major rejuvination works and Bob-the-Builder looks set to be on-site for some months yet. Many potential guests may be put off by the works, construction noise at 7am on weekdays etc. Personally, it did not interfere at all with our enjoyment of the hotel. If you exit the hotel and turn right onto Tarragona, the Metro station is 100 meters down the street so you can avoid the whole Sants Estacion area.", "Date": "March 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "n ireland", "Title": "\u201cfantastic\u201d", "Author": "kickingkingNIreland", "ReviewID": "UR7231201", "Content": "We have just returned after spending six nights at The Gran Torre.

ROOM - We opted for an executive room, as the site we booked it through offered this as only 10euro more than a standard. The room was beautiful, with modern furniture, electrical equipment (TV/cd player) to a high standard. It was exactly how the pictures described. The bathroom in particular was gorgeous, set out in marble with a double sink. The jet showers were fantastic, and all was remarkably clean. Of a weekend of 4 days, we spent many mornings resting in the room as it was of such high standard and so relaxing. I would advise to request a room as high up as possible, as the views are breathtaking. We were on the 16th floor of 23 and could see a great deal of Barcelona, including the Nou Camp stadium. However, if you dont get a great room, when you go up for breakfast/evening meal, you can get a 360 view of the whole city. HOTEL - We had the buffet breakfast every morning. Plenty of cold foods (cereal/fruit/ham etc) and toast, but not too much in the way of cooked foods. However, there was some sausage, egg, bacon. Didnt stay for evening meal as was quite expensive so cant comment. Mini bar v expensive as always, but room service relatively inexpensive. Hotel lobby, reception beautiful. You pay 6euros for the use of gym/sauna/steam room/pool so this is good value as it is all very beauftil, but be careful as opening hours are restricted. Particularly if you are only staying for a short weekend as we did, find out the opening hours as soon as possible, as we didnt get chance to go in because we left it last minute and it was closed. Masssages are offered at 32euro half hour and 57euro full hour. Not that much cheaper than England. All staff speak good english we found and were very friendly, allowing us to check out late for no extra fee. LOCATION - Takes about 40minutes to walk into the heart of town (Ramblas) but the metro is very accessible, as the hotel is 200m from Sants Station. There are buses aswell, but I would say that it is easier to get the metro. Around a 30 minute walk to the Nou Camp stadium, or again you can get a train. This was perfect for us as we visited Barcelona to go to both the Nou Camp and into town. However, could be a little out of the way if the football is not of great importance to you. Overall, although not quite a 5* hotel, this is definitely a sound 4* hotel. All was modern and clean and met all expectations.

We were apparantly allocated a room on the 5th floor (I suppose they say this to everyone lol) and were asked if we would like to upgrade to a higher floor for an extra 10 euros per night. We were offered a room on the 19th floor, we upgraded. The views we had over the city were worth every euro! The room was excellent, spacious, modern and very well kept as was the bathroom. The bathroom had a huge bath, seperate toilet area, twin marble sink and a brilliant power shower in a large marble enclosure. Loved the shower! The bed was kingsize whilst the room had the extra's you would associate with a 4* hotel. Mini bar (very reasonable prices), complimentary drinks, in room safe (six digit coded), tv, phone and so on. No complaints at all with the room or any aspect to do with the hotel. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis. The foods available for breakfast were varied and well presented on the 23rd floor which provide super views over Barcelona. There is a lounge bar on the ground floor that provides you with the 1st drink of your stay free, a nice touch. Food is also available, which was of a good quality. On the lower floor there is a spa area with additional beauty treatments including massages if you desire. Obviously, these are for an additional fee. The hotel is a little way of La Rambla and other tourist attractions but believe me this is not a problem when you have a public travel set up as good as Barcelona. Sants station is right next door, metro stops are plentiful, buses are available, taxi's are cheap and last but not least the fantastic BUS TOURISTICO! We paid for a two day ticket that cost 22 euro's each. If you want to get around the sights, use the bus touristico it's great. If you fancy a stroll, you can be at La Rambla in 30 minutes. A final point about Barcelona, football lovers get yourself to the Camp Nou and do the stadium and museum tour and if you can get to a match. Fantastic. Tourists, do not miss the Sagrada Familia!

I have to say, the staff at this hotel are the best I've ever encountered and went out of their way to assisst in any way that they could (one porter actually walked off into the city and came back in a taxi for us to use). Also, the restaurant on the 23rd floor is magnificent, and again, the views are quite simply spectacular. Initially, I was a bit worried about the hotels location, and wondered whether it would be too far out from the main attractions. I needn't have been concerned. There is a Metro station located about 200 yards from the hotel entrance (Sants Estacio) and it's less than ten minutes to The Ramblas (about 4 or 5 short stops). The underground rail network is astonishingly efficient and so we waited no more than two minutes (literally) for a train to arrive. And, at just over one Euro per trip it is extremely good value for money. However, if you're wary about travelling on the underground (you needn't be) then there are thousands of taxi's around the city and you'll wait no more than a couple of minutes outside the hotel. The city is tremendous, with a vibrant atmosphere and there is almost too much to do. This hotel is located in a very quiet district and so you'lll be far away enough to avoid the hustle and bustle, but close enough to access it within minutes.

My overall impression of the hotel was A*. We stayed in a standard room which we were very pleased with. It was very clean and spacious with a lovely bathroom. Everything was there that we needed for a break in Barcelona. Our room was situated on the 10th floor and although facing the Expo hotel we still had a nice view of the park which is situated close to the hotel. I didn't feel that the view was a problem at all as other people have stated and we never experienced any excess noise due to traffic or other people staying at the hotel. Although the hotel was further out of the center of Barcelona it is situated right next to Barcelona Sants station, which is the city's main train station. From here you can get the metro, train and buses into and around the city or further afield. We took advantage of the 2-day Bus Turistic pass which is the tourist bus that takes you all around the city on three different routes where you can hop on and off the bus. It is value for money at 22 euros for an unlimited two day use. One of the routes also picks up at the Barcelona Sants station and you can hop between the routes. Also if you are coming from Barcelona Airport there is a train or bus service that runs to Barcelona Sants at very good rates, although it isn't too far by taxi either. The only downfall on location is there aren't many bars and restaurants around the area where the hotel is. This wasn't a problem for us as we still ventured in to the center on an evening and also used the hotel amenities which were excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona, the staff were both helpful and accomodating throughout our stay, our room was clean and spacious, location is brilliant if you want to see both Barcelona and further and it is excellent value for money for the standard of hotel that you receive.", "Date": "May 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWould stay elsewhere....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5037894", "Content": "We booked the Torre Catalunya for 3 nights in early May having read the reviews here in TripAdvisor. It's certainly nice to see your hotel right in front of you after arriving in Barcelona Sants station, especially after a long days travelling. And, as other posters already said, because of its location beside the station, it is ideal for getting around Barcelona or for day trips to regions around Barcelona. However, it is away from the main tourist areas around La Ramblas so we found ourselves making the trek in and out to our hotel to these areas at least twice a day which became cumbersome. If I was to go again, I think I would book somewhere closer to La Ramblas where you could stroll back late at night and wake up in the morning and be in the middle of all the action again. The hotel itself was clean and the staff were friendly. On checking in, I asked for a room high up but the only room available was on the 3rd floor. The room was large and clean. The bathroom was again clean with plenty of space. But our 'double bed' was two single beds pushed together..and I hate that. Our room had absolutely no view. In fact, our balcony had a wall around it with spikes on top that almost made us feel we were locked in! But I must emphasis that we were unlucky with our room. But if you get a room on the 3rd floor facing the Hotel Expo this is what you'll get. The restaurant on the 23rd floor is outstanding.

There is a chap with a goatee beard who works as a porter there who went to great lengths to ensure we got to see everything we wanted to in Barcelona, providing us with maps and discussing timeframes of certain locations. We didn't use the spa facilities but they seemed excellent and we were disappointed in the end we weren't staying a bit longer to give them a go. Breakfast was superb and the relatively expensive cost was offset by the sensational panoramic view of Barcelona you get while tucking into your morning pastry. The bathroom was great, the only complaint being the shower which although sunk into the floor did seem to be designed for people 5ft and under! The room was a little noisy too, although this is to be expected in such a large hotel. The people next to us seemed to enjoy dragging the chairs in the room backwards and forwards but I suppose the likelihood of this happening again is fairly slim. Otherwise the stay was great. The hotels location, a minute walk from Barcelona-Sants, is perfect for exploring the city. The metro station is two stops from the Nou Camp and around 5 stops from Las Ramblas, and Passeig de Gracia and Barceloneta are nearby as well.

It is ideal for getting the metro to anywhere in the city. If you get a T-10 it works out very cheap and you can hop on and off when you need. It took us 5-10 minutes to get to Las Rambles and anywhere else. The metro feels safe and is incredibly efficient (Britain could learn a thing or two) and it runs until at least midnight. We were allocated a non-smoking room on the 10th floor with a double bed. The room was lovely with a big marble bathroom and it even speakers in the bathroom. Don't use the mini bar, go next door to the 'hipermercat' and get wine, beer and snacks for a fraction of the price. The breakfast was good if not a bit disorganised and there didn't seem to be enough tables for the number of guests that they accomodate. We didn't use the restaurant at night as we were on a budget and wanted to venture out but when we asked the staff for recommendations they weren't too forthcoming. I would suggest using the timeout guide as they seemed to have it spot on. Make reservations at Octubre early! We ate in Tapa Tapa (english menu that was a god send as I was terrified of ordered rabbit or squid) and a few other little places we came across. The best by far was Les Quinze Nits on Placa Reial for quality and price, although the queue was huge when it opened at 8.30 we were seated in 5 mintues. It was 40 euros for both of us to have starers, mains and dessert, a litre of wine and mineral water. Also there is a place just round the corner called Crema Canela (or something like that) that is yummy! Try the superchocolate dessert it's amazing. There seemed to be some nice places down by the Fountains which are 10 minutes from the hotel but we didn't end up eating down there. The hotel looks further from the centre on a map than it actually is. For the price and convience of the metro and bus station it was a good choice. We didn't have time to use the spa so I can't comment on that. The staff were friendly enough and spoke English but I felt that you had to push for information or help and having worked in a 2/3* hotel for 4 years they certainly could have tried harder in view of their 4* rating. The one incident that did hugely annoy me was that on our final day we were due to leave at 6.45am, 15 minutes before the start of breakfast and although we had paid for it we were told by reception that they could not get us even a glass of juice or water let alone anything to eat and that we should buy breakfast from elsewhere.

There is a supermarket just outside the hotel also which is good for your daily supplies like bottled water, naranja, snacks etc. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, only because it was quite pricy for our budget but the view is lovely from the top floor. Also the spa in the hotel costs $6 euros per person and is well worth it after a long day site seeing. The hotel rooms either face inland with the mountain view or outwards with the sea view. We got the one facing inland with the mountain view which was nice but if you are to put in a request for a room then opt for the sea view as this is nicer. In terms of places to eat, we basically ate fast food during the day and had a decent meal in the evening. Good restaurants are, i) Pizza Marzano on Las Ramblas (equivalent to Pizza Express in UK both in terms of food and price), ii) Restaurante Chino Internacional on C. Fernando just off Las Ramblas (decor is run of the mill but the food and service are both very good), iii) La Fonda on Escudellers just off Placa Reial near Las Ramblas (good atmosphere, food was OK) iv) Baha Beach Club on the coast near the Olympic Port (we had lunch there and the food and view were good). The place to avoid is the Attic on Las Ramblas. From the outside the Attic looks very inviting and we were snarred by this complete tourist trap. They only offered the wine list and had no drinks menu (probably to hide the high prices) and offered us bread rolls which were rock hard and then put them on the bill at 1.45 Euros each.

Sitges can be reached by train from Sants Estacio train station in 45 minutes and the return ticket is 4.80 Euros. Monserrat is good for the view from the mountains. Make sure therefore to go there on a good sunny day. Trains go from Placa Espanyal every hour and take approx. 1hour. We did the return train and all the funiculars package for 18.40 Euros each. There is also another package including dinner at $30 Euros but we found a cafe there which did a decent lunch for approx. $6 Euros each. There is a desk at the Placa Espanyal train station dedicated for visitors to Monserrat, they will explain you the various prices and also help you with the tickets purchase and get you onto the right platform for the train so no need to worry about pre-planning this trip.

I know from reading past reviews on the web some of the floors were due for a refit which was evident when we explored some of the lower floors. But it was clear that our floor and many others had been renovated to an excellent standard but do check with the hotel before you book. Overall, very very good if your looking for something a little special on your weekend away in Barcelona.

We stayed for a week around New Year's; paid $123/night for an executive room but were upgraded to a suite. It had a great lineup of amenities (two flat TVs and minibars, bathtub and shower with a heated mirror in the bathroom, stylish interior with leather upholstery, night chocolates etc.) and manificent views. Service was laudable even if inconsistent at times. The hotel is not right in the center but is quite conveniently located anyway. In-room internet is not free (10 euros+tax per 24 hours) - it wasn't promised to be included in the price but in this hotel range it really should be. There's so much to see and do in Barcelona but be prepared to be treated to a noticeable lack of organization and service. Absolutely nothing was organized for the New Year's eve (there were like 10,000 people waiting in Placa Catalunya and we didn't even know when the midnight was) and even the decorative lights were turned off at 1AM (night illumination of buildings goes off even earlier, starting already at 10PM, which is irritating and just perfectly pointless). Some sights have erratic hours about which you will not be able to get to know at the 'tourist info' centers and at most sights you will be charged an easy 10-15 euros then handed a boring subjective audio guide lacking any actual information. Many restaurants were closed for a solid 2-3 weeks around Christmas. (Now how stupid is that?) We walked around Montjuic for over an hour looking for Poble Espanyol because there were no signs posted anywhere. And then we were conveniently ripped off on our way to the airport - the taxi driver turned on the higher fare (it was Monday mid-day) and declined to explain why.

Never had I thought that Barcelona would be the place to give your heart - whether it is to the city or another person. Last weekend I gave mine to both. My boyfriend and I checked into the Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya on Friday 16th December for a weekend getaway. Despite lastminute not delivering their promise of upgarding us to an executive suite, the hotel ensured we still got our suite on the 18th floor, and even allowed us to check in two hours before the given time. Our room (1817) overlooked some of the most beautiful aspects of the city, and being 18 floors up we witnessed some of the most wonderful views as the sunlight hit different parts of buildings at different times of the day. At night we could see the Magic Fountain in the distance, along with the port, the Olympic Stadium and the Christopher Columbus statue. The room itself was luxurious, although not as big as I had perhaps expected. A CD player, mini-bar, robes and slippers, heated mirror in the bathroom which didn't steam up when the shower was on, chocolates on the pillows and a doorbell to the room were all little extras that led us to feeling that extra bit special and pampered. The restaurant in the hotel is situated on the 23rd floor, with amazing panoramic views of the city. The breakfast is wonderful and with the ability to eat as much as you like, it definitely sets you up for the day. However we were unable to eat there during the evening as there wasn't a vegetarian option. The lounge bar is also a lovely place to stop for a drink before you embark upon the city, and is by no means expensive. The city itself offers something different depending on what you want from it. It's the sort of city that is very sure of itself and doesn't need to try to win you over... it simply does. Must see sites include Camp Nou Stadium tour, the Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas (but watch out for over priced restaurants), the Harbour and the open top tour bus which is freezing in December but gives you a much wider perspective on the varying elements the city has to offer. But the most wondrous, magical, romantic surprise of the weekend was the Magic Fountatin which is situated next to the Espanol metro station. Buzzing with activity and noise, the avenue leading up to the magic fountain is decorated with tens of fountains lining the road. The fountain itself is a multitude of colours and is choreograophed to music. This to me was by far the most romantic experience of my life, the sheer force of the water and the occasion making it difficult to fight back the tears. All in all I would recommend Barcelona to everyone as there is something to satisfy all tastes and needs. There is certainly plenty for us to do when we return and I am sure we will visit some old favourites too.", "Date": "December 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North West UK", "Title": "\u201cLook no further - stay here!!\u201d", "Author": "NorthWestUKDayo", "ReviewID": "UR4250957", "Content": "We found this hotel via trip advisor. We where not dissappointed, it is simply a great hotel with very friendly staff and great facilities. Rooms are excellent and well appointed as you would expect from a 4 star hotel. We paid 65 Euro a night for a double room which was an absolute bargain. To relax, have a drink or meal from the 23rd floor restaurant - views are breathtaking over the whole of Barcelona, especially at sunset. My only very minor gripe, the pool area looks great but the water is not heated, so for us was too cold to use. The location is perfect for the excellent Barcelona metro system, with the Sants-Estacio trian station within 200 metres of the front door. (A useful tip to save you some walking, directly opposite the entrance of the hotel, next to the Panns restaurant is an Elevator to the metro. Once you have bought your 3/5/7 day all in metro & bus pass (12 Euro for the 3 day pass) from the tourist info at the station, just use this elevator. It will save your legs as they will certainly be used exploring the rest of Barcelona). As for sights around Barcelona, the Nou Camp is impressive, as is the Ramblas, the Port area and the great variety of restaurants and bars. We thought the Sagarda Familia was a waste of money, 8 Euros each to go in, and with all the building works - you may as well view it from the outside (it is an impressive building). You can also see it from the Hotel viewing deck. I had heard comments before about pick pockets etc in Barcelona, I would say don't be alarmed just be sensible with your property and keep your wits about you.
