After that happend we waited forever! And he kept making excuses to keep us from going down to wait on the street.

Great boutique-like hotel steps away from all the attractions in the old city, including the restaurants, attractions and entertainment.

The only potential downside is noise from the Newyorican Salsa club downstairs which can really get going and stay going until well into the wee hours, but you are in the Caribbean, right? So just enjoy it, and request an inside room if you want to stay as quiet as possible. The inside rooms have windows that open up into the lobby are, so it won't be like you are not able to get any light or anything. There are a great assortment of restaurants, bars, and shopping just walking out the door and down any of the main streets nearby. The hotel's entrance itself is located in a small street between two of the larger streets, but it is relatively easy to find, just remember to look above the Newyorican (where all the music is coming from!). The main downside to this property is the parking situation, which if you have a car can be a little tricky. But it's no worse than anywhere else in old San Juan.

The location in the heart of the Old San Juan is perfect, the rooms (we stayed in two: 403 and 203) are beautiful--small, but comfortable and charmingly decorated--and the staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful. With all these advantages, the price is very reasonable and hard to beat. The building, a former convent, is gorgeous, with high ceilings, antique, eclectic furniture, and paintings and photographs by local artists. On the first floor of the building is a great salsa bar (http://www.nuyoricancafepr.com/), which--yes, does make a lot of noise on some nights (on the hotel's website, the expected noise level is indicated as you choose the room). A little about the rooms we had: Room 403 on the fourth floor (there is no elevator), with access to a shared patio, has views of the Franciscan Chapel across the street, the Parliament Building, the San Cristobal Fort, and rooftops of the Old San Juan. The cafe downstairs did get somewhat loud, but it did not really bother us by the second night. This room is small, simple--but comfortable, and the beautiful shutters for the door to the patio and the window really make it charming. We stayed in room 203 for only one night. Again, the room is clean, comfortable (and larger than 403), with a view of the Franciscan Chapel and very high ceilings. The water pressure was a little low, but there was plenty of hot water--and, really, it did not bother us. That night the cafe was quiet,and we had no problem with noise at all. I missed having the patio--but the room was $40 cheaper than 403. I recommend the hotel wholeheartedly. It is unique, very convenient, and a bargain. I think, for us, staying here set the right tone for experiencing and enjoying Old San Juan. We loved exploring the old town--all of its major landmarks are only a short and picturesque walk away (it's easy to be adventurous and spontaneous, when everything is happening all around you). Many great restaurants are very close by: I highly recommend Bodega Chic on Calle Cristo and Aguaviva, Dragonfly, and Cafe Parrot on Fortaleza. For great coffee and breakfast, Caficultura on Plaza Col\u00c3\u00b3n was our favorite find. Da House is a great hotel. I came to San Juan for a conference in Caribe Hilton and am so glad I did not stay there--Hilton is a gorgeous hotel, but it looks and feels generic, and you'd have to taxi everywhere.

We were on the third floor (four total floors), but because of the open design of the building, noise really echos through all floors. The rooms ending in \"01 - 201, 301, 401\" are tiny rooms, right by the stairs, and both side walls are open to the skylights that lead to the lobby below so you hear a lot of lobby noise (maids moving furniture to clean in the morning, people walking around and talking, flip flops up the stairs, etc). The shower is teeny tiny, and in our room, you couldn't even close it all the way due to a missing door piece. They gave us minimal towels (two bath towels, one hand towel, and one wash cloth) and only do maid service if you request it. No shampoo, conditioner, paper or pen, cups or ice bucket.

It's a shame but as the title suggests, it could've been so much more. First thing, we were fortunate to even get a room in Old San Juan during President's Day weekend. But through another online site, we were able to book the last room available. Whether it was the last, unwanted room or a good one that was overlooked, we'll never know. But we were thankful. And considering the price of this hotel versus all the others, there are no complaints there. The hotel itself is fantastically located right in the heart of OSJ. Shops and restaurants galore; everywhere you step. A couple of plazas, overnight parking, the cruise port, and attractions are all very, very close. The hotel is listed on San Francisco St however the entrance is on a side street and not obvious. To enter you buzz the front desk and then walk up a couple flights of stairs. So BEWARE! If you are not physically fit and/or struggles with climbing stairs, I'd advise looking elsewhere. I saw a lady struggling with her luggage up to the 3rd floor and she was gasping for air. I never saw or was told of an elevator option so just know this ahead of time. Inside though, it was appealing. The main lobby is quiant but has some comfy seating areas. Nothing really to do there other than relax or wait for coming or going. The attendants at the front desk were all young and maybe part of the artsy crowd. They all \"seemed\" new to working with this hotel. However they were acccommodating nonetheless. Our room was on the 4th floor and the main windows overlooked the pub below. (eh hem...cough, cough...I'll get to that in a second). There was also a door to a balcony with a little table and although we didn't use it, the setting was very nice. Also, one flight of stairs outside our door led to the rooftop, which as others have mentioned contains a few seating areas and a hot tub. Again, we didn't use this area but it's a fantastic spot to enjoy wine or just relax and listen to the sounds of OSJ. Too bad we were in such a rush to get to our other destinations that we had to attend. The room itself was nice. Not much to it but it had a comfortable feel. Had a bit of a old, yet good, feel to it, if that makes sense. The shower was sizeable enough. Unfortunately, the hot and cold adjustments were hard to figure out. I think it just took a long time for the heat to make it's way to the room so by the time it made it to it's outlet, our patience ran out and we had turned the nozzle the wrong way trying to figure out what was hot, what was cold. Regardless, it eventually worked so not biggie. The toilet, however, was an annoyance. The dang thing would not flush. I'd even taken a bucket of water and dropped it in from 5 feet up hoping the pressure would knock loose whatever was clogging it up. That almost always works. Not here. So eventually I had to do the unpleasant task of grabbing a plunger from the front desk and walking back with it in my hand. The plunger worked one time but even with a clear toilet, it still wouldn't flush. So we eventually just said the heck with it. The front desk attendant said it probably came from a couple that had a huge blowup the week before, but that didn't really help it flush during our stay. Now, we recognize that this hotel is in heart of the liveliness. We expect to hear music and cars and people and birds and city life. What we DIDN'T expect was to be blasted til at least 3 in the morning with loud music just below our window. Well, let me back up. We DID expect it because right after I signed the credit card to pay for our room, the front desk attendant said \"if you need earplugs, come back to the front desk.\" Excuse me? Do you think you could give us a courtesy warning BEFORE we paid? I mean I know our room options were limited at that stage, but still, you could let us know how tough it was for people not used to the all-night gala to sleep through. Wow! Was this loud. When it was time to sleep, I decided to leave the windows open so that the music would be so loud that when I finally shut the windows, it'd seem like we were sleeping in the country. That slightly worked, but fact is this was just too much for us. I love the city life but this room was simply too close to the loudness for us to truly enjoy the location and a good night's sleep. So BEWARE! You have now been warned NOT to get a room overlooking the side street below. Whether the other interior rooms got the same distraction is unknown to me. Okay, that is it. That is the main complaint that brought it down for us. Too bad though. I liked everything else enough. But it's just the lack of warning that really peeved us. And I'm not even sure \"peeved\" is the right word. Just disappointing I suppose. However, you might be looking for this exact setup so if so, you'll enjoy it all.

As luck might have it I got to see three different rooms. I personally loved the view of San Francisco St and would recommend it as opposed to the side view of Callejon De La Capilla which is pretty noisy and not as interesting. For the first three nights I was in my original room, then the Ac stopped working, it was insanely late when I got back to the hotel, the receptionist checked to see if I was turning it on correctly and offered to move me to another room for the night, so I stayed at another room facing the side street, and be warned that Nueyorican Cafe gets loud. The next day the new receptionist offered me a new room, a free upgrade to a larger room that is the only one that faces the bay, it was room 408 and I loved it. The only downside was the bathroom door did not allow for the pitch blackness of Sylvia Kahn, where I had slept on my first nigt after 4 hours of driving and no sleep (those shutters are godlike) I had a tendency do disappear all day, and was happy to come back to fresh towels and a made bed! They do have a bit of a hummidity issue but I am positive this is highly caused by the climate, and there are a few paint choices that would fix his but the quality of the paint needed would create new issues like chalky residue. The lobby and terrace are gorgeous, the building itself is great and I was in love. There is no elevator or room service, but the Nueyorican cafe will deliver until 2am and their food is absolutely delicious. Aw far as the comments on lack of television I think if you want a holiday in experience like you are in Florida well, go to Florida and stay at the holiday in then. This island is fun and the weather is perfect and when you are on vacation in what is basically another country with similar currency the appeal is not to slump on a bed to eat potato chips and watch jersey shore reruns.

I constantly heard the door buzzing, the music from the salsa club, people in the lobby in the hallway etc. I could not sleep or relax at times. The place was decorated with so much charm, it is a shame that the hotel doesn't actively fix any of the noise problems. They could have people use a key system or a key code system for the outside door, they could serve coffee in the lobby as an extra bonus, they could provide some sort of pulley to help travelers carry luggage up the stairs.

Up until the last day, we had enjoyed our experience at the hotel but on the last full day that we stayed in the hotel, we had $100 stolen from our hotel room and were treated very rudely when we tried to address the issue with the managerial staff. In the interest of fairness, let me describe the good and bad. The good: - The hotel is very pretty and ideally located in the old part of San Juan mere blocks away from some of the best sights, restaurants and bar - Our room was super cute and well maintained. Although it was small and there was a lot of ambient noise and club music from the bars downstairs, this was honestly described on the hotel website and so we felt like we got what we expected - At $280 for three nights (including tax), we felt like this was a good bargain for its location - Front desk staff were generally kind and helpful with city suggestions The bad: - On the last full day, while my wife and I were walking around the city, $100 in cash was stolen from her tote bag that was left on the night stand. This is the first time that this has ever happened to either one of us and the unique circumstances of the loss made us almost certain that this was not an error on our part. Before leaving the hotel in the morning, my wife had asked me how much of the $160 in cash that she had with her at the time she thought that I should bring with her while walking around the city. I suggested she bring $60 and I then watched her return $100 into her tote bag on top of the night stand. When we returned to our room six hours later, our used towels had been replaced with clean towels and we were unable to find the $100 in her tote bag. We searched all over the room and through all of our luggage and were unable to find this $100. I suppose it is possible that she somehow misplaced this money, but I consider this highly unlikely given that I had directly observed her replacing the $100 into her tote bag. - When we raised this issue with the front desk staff, I was told to expect a return call from the manager and did not receive a call back from the manager for five days. At this point, I called and politely asked to speak with the manager who - once I'd explained the situation - told me that she had called me five times in the last few days (I had not received any phone call) and rudely disputed my claim and said that it was impossible that one of her staff had taken the money. She offered to speak with the owner of the hotel who offered us a $100 credit towards a subsequent stay at the hotel but refused to refund us $100 and refused to further investigate the issue. As you might understand, we were pretty upset and did not intend to return to the hotel to stay there again in the future and declined this offer. This is the first time that something like this has ever happened to my wife or I and it left us with a really bad taste in our mouth. We will certainly not be staying at this hotel in the future and would suggest that other travelers avoid it as well.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Spot in OSJ\u201d", "Author": "DaveVA08", "ReviewID": "UR104391139", "Content": "We chose Da House for our one night stay prior to our cruise leaving out of San Juan.

You can park on the street for free, if you can find a spot which we eventually did. There are some parking garages around as well, but I'd recommend checking into the best ones in advance by emailing Da House, because some try to charge a ridiculous amount and I understand there are reasonably priced options. Our visit began with a very friendly greeting from Luzmar at the front desk. She was very enthusiastic and helpful in recommending places to eat, things to see, etc. Our room was not ready when we arrived around 3:30 or 4. So, we left our luggage with the front desk and explored Old San Juan for a while. We also observed that the rooms get cleaned quite late.

Our room was very basic and we liked the decor. The doors to the Juliet balcony opened to the open air which was great. We could see San Cristobal from our room. The biggest downside of the room was the bathroom. The shower had very low water pressure. The bed was not very comfortable, although every place we stayed in Puerto Rico had a hard mattress so not sure that that's out of the ordinary for the area. Yes it is very loud, even on the 4th floor! The first night we joined the party. It was lots of fun to experience the live salsa band and watch some very talented salsa dancers.

Surprisingly, we were able to sleep through the noise because we were so exhausted by the end of our busy days.

Traveling to a city like San Juan doesn't exactly scream 10 hour sleep to me...

If it's a little loud for you, bring earplugs - it's that easy. We were on the third floor, room 311 (because I heeded the warnings in many reviews that it was a loud location). Although we could hear the music through the vents coming from the bar, it wasn't outrageous where we were (and we were on the side of the hotel where the bar is). It's clean, in an absolutely awesome location - you walk all over Old San Juan from here, and the staff were all attentive and helpful. My only negative comment about the room is that it seemed as though it was missing a shower door because the water would flood the bathroom. Nothing a few towels couldn't absorb, but still a little odd. A note to future patrons - travel light - otherwise, you'll be lugging your bags up a number of flight of stairs (no lift/elevator)...it's still worth the struggle up though. Also, there's the most amazing breakfast just a few blocks from the hotel called La Bombonera. Yes, it's a diner (it was founded in 1902)!

We really liked this hotel! I have a hard time understanding why someone who needs a hotel with many amenities would book a very inexpensive hotel in an old city without thoroughly researching it. If you are considering staying at Da House, read a number of the reviews here on Trip Advisor and you should be able to easily tell if this hotel is for you. It is certainly not for everyone, but for less than half the cost of many other rooms in the city, it can be a great choice! LOCATION: The location of the hotel is great...it is close to many, many great bars and restaurants and popular sites such as the forts. We stayed out late and did not feel unsafe in the area at all. ROOMS: The rooms were clean and comfortable. They were not especially large, but were more than adequate for our needs and what I would expect staying in a city hotel. We also enjoyed the art by local artists. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is no shampoo, lotion, etc. in the bathrooms, so you'll have to bring that with you or purchase it at the many stores in the area around the hotel. There is definitely noise at night, but at least in our room (304) it was about the same level as if someone had a tv on which I can fall asleep to...especially after a long day of walking around the city! HOTEL STAFF: The staff were friendly and helpful. They had no issue holding our bags until check in with no charge and called cabs for us to take us to the airport after checkout so we wouldn't have to wait on the street. Check in and check out were quick and painless. GENERAL HOTEL: As other reviewers have mentioned, there is no elevator and no bell boy so you'll have to bring your luggage up the stairs yourself. As we travel light, this was not a problem for us at all. We enjoyed the rooftop area. It is open 24 hours and the hotel staff told us that we could bring any beer, wine, etc. up there to enjoy. The jacuzzi is just a jacuzzi, not a hot tub, so it's a little chilly to use late at night. Overall, this hotel is clean, comfortable and in a great location in Old San Juan. If you're looking just for a clean, convenient, reasonably priced place to sleep each night, then this is definitely the hotel for you. If you are looking for room service and someone to carry your luggage, then you will need to spend more money and stay somewhere else.

No transportation is needed from this hotel. You are literally walking distance away from charming shops and wonderful restaurants. The hotel itself was very nicely decorated, with a plethra of local art displayed. The style, although fairly sophisticated and \"bohemian\", was a bit cold for my taste.

It was truly a place to sleep and not much else--this worked out well for us, but not for the traveler who enjoys their lounge time. The real issue was the leak coming from the shower, which caused a very unpleasant mold odor. We did our best to air the room out, but there wasn't much circulation considering how open everything is. Upon checkout, we informed a young man at the desk. Somehow, I doubt any action was taken towards repairs, based on his look of disinterest.

It's gorgeous with it's floors and artwork. We never dreamed we'd be able to stay in a boutique-like hotel, but with it being so affordable we hopped at the chance. We were not disappointed. It's very centralized in Old San Juan, within walking distance of everything. La Bombonera and Cafe Mallorca are a few steps away. In addition there's a Supermax (grocery) and Walgreens only a couple blocks away too. The staff was very friendly, welcoming, and helpful. As with all older buildings there are quirks. For instance, we had an issue with having hot water in our room one of the nights. We were offered multiple choices of rooms and jumped at the chance to check them all out. Ultimately our stay was split between room 303 and 406. Each room had it's advantages. I loved 303 for the ability to look out over the street. 406 looked out over the alley but the room was larger in size. Being able to open the wooden doors/windows to the streets, listening the the \"buzz\" outside was awesome. The hotel is secure and you must buzz in everytime you arrive. This isn't a problem because there is a staff member 24 hours ready to buzz you in. Reading the reviews we were concerned about noise. Yes, there is noise and the loudness varies from day to day depending on the activities happening around the hotel. However, we had no problems sleeping. If it's a huge concern I'd recommend using earplugs or turning on the bathroom fan, which would help drown out the noise if need be. The Nuyorican Cafe is in the same building and you can catch some Improv, Salsa music, or rock music, depending on the day of week. Sometimes there's a cover, other days there isn't. And if there is a cover, it's $5. The Nuyorican allowed us to go out without having to go far and we felt safe and secure given we were next door to our hotel. In addition we saw 98% locals dancing the night away. A few more notes: There's free internet hookup in the rooms along with a computer in the lobby if need. Be aware there are no televisions and the only thing they supply are bath towels and bar soap. Looking back on our stay we couldn't have been happier.

That should have been an omen. Our room was an interior room, about 11 x 12, with a tiny, and very grim bathroom. It had two windows which had opaque glass, and if openned, looked across a light well into other rooms. There was no closet but a rod complete with 4 hangers. Privacy was not an option because the bathroom door didn't stay shut. The shower was plastic, about 24-30\" square, and made shaving one's legs virtually impossible. We saw maids daily ...in the hall, at least. Our trash was picked up and we were given clean towels around 4 in the afternoon but our room was never thoroughly cleaned. The bed was perfectly acceptible however, the noise from the salsa club was unbearable from 10 to 2-4 am. The door buzzer from the street was audible in each room and was going all night. Drunken loud voices, shouting, giggling and screaming went on inside the hotel until all hours. We actally got some reprieve by playing a cd on our computer our last night when ear plugs were not sufficient.

We stayed one night on either end of our trip to St. Lucia. There was no way to get to St. Lucia from our home without a layover in San Juan. The first night was a Friday night so I was a bit worried about the noise. We were in room 303. The window faces the street not the alley. The alley is where the music comes from. Room 303 is also at the end of the hall not by the stairs which I could see could be loud. Honestly, we had no issue. I am a light sleeper. I tend to wear ear plugs every night anyway since the hubby snores but if it was really loud even with ear plugs I would have been woken up. The room is basic but comfortable and clean. A desk with a chair, a double bed and a chair to sit and read in. The bathroom is small. My husband is 6 foot 3 and he had some issues with the shower head being really low. Nothing he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experienced before. I had some issues with the knobs of the shower hitting my rear. The shower head is a rain fall so can not really move it. It needs to be moved away from the wall just a bit. No tub just a shower. No elevator. None of this was an issue for us but people need to be aware. Our major complaint had nothing to do with the hotel itself but the fact that no taxi drivers seemed to know where it is located. Thankfully after two taxi trips we knew our way around town and could give directions. Be sure you have directions and the phone number with you since my experience is that you will have to use them. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. They stored our luggage for a nominal fee. We loved the art and wish we could afford to take some with us. We went to the roof top deck our first night and it appeared like a nice place to hang out. We never did have the opportunity. If we make it back to San Juan I am sure we stay at Da House again. It fit our needs for a layover hotel without being by the airport. I would say people tend to come into the hotel really late. We had to get up one morning to catch a flight and as we were leaving people were just coming back from their night on the town. Again not an issue for us but could be for some.

We were in room 407; which was a long way to carry 4 heavy suitcases (no elevators), but we're in excellent shape, so while it did not bother us, it may be a problem for some. The room had a balcony shared with one other room, but we didn't use it; the jacuzzi is on the rooftop, not outside anyone's room. The art throught the hotel was beautiful; all local artists as well. The decor in general was awsome. I am not your \"Holiday Inn\" type of traveler; I actually will not stay in chain hotels because they offer no diversity. The bed was super comfortable, and it was nice not having a distracting tv in the room. The rooftop jacuzzi didn't get warm; the water was pretty cold; and that's my only complaint. We went in while the sun was still out, so the temp wasn't a problem then. It also changes colors at night, and when we wanted to go in after our late dinner, that's when we realized how cold the water was! The staff did not charge us to hold our bags (others claim they were charged), and we dropped them off at 9am and explored until 3pm. Checkout was fast and easy, and they even called us a cab. There were 2 great resturants on each end of the alley (yes, the hotel is in an alley). One was Asada Grill ( I believe) directly outside the hotel's front door; we ate lunch there, it was delish, the skirt steak and shrimp is the way to go (about $50 with mojitos, for lunch)...and at the other end, Marmalade. The food at Marmalade was pricy (about $225 for the two of us, without alcohol), but it was worth every penny...their service is another story (horrible), but I think it was pretty much because we had a bad waitress. I WILL most definetly be staying at Da House on my future visits to San Juan because of the great location (3 block WALK, with HEAVY LUGGAGE from the cruise ships...not too bad), also it's in the middle of Old San Juan.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Old San Juan to hear two nights of Techno noise/music. Partying, yelling, cursing (and at least 1 fight) started around 7PM, and continued to 4 AM. Some drunken girl was practicing her F-curses above the din for 30-60 minutes the first night in the early hours of the morning. Then the clean-up guys banged chairs and tables out in the alley until 4:30. Peace and quiet until 6AM, when someone fired up a pressure washer to clean (various liquid substances from the night before?) from the alley. When we asked for a different room for the second night, they said they were all booked up, and gave us earplugs. One floor walk-up to the lobby, and then one or more floors to the rooms. If you plan to stay there prior to a cruise as we did, think about humping all your suitcases up and down by yourselves. The Ugly Upon check-in, the guy behind the counter took our information, including credit card, but then wanted us to sign a completely blank credit card receipt. He explained that, since Da Hotel fancies themselves as part hotel, part art gallery, they wanted something for security, should a guest choose to steal or deface the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153art\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the room. Upon check-out, after inspecting the room, they would tear up the blank card pressing. I offered to sign if they wrote down something like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153$250 refundable damage deposit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but he refused. As we were getting ready to walk out, he said that there was another alternative. We could leave one of our passports in the hotel safe. Since this is a standard practice in Europe, we agreed. At the end, we had about 1 hour between check-out time and the time we needed to get a cab to our cruise ship. They insisted on $5.00 to hold our bags for that time, which we had no choice but to pay. P.S.: They never checked the room before returning my passport. Despite the comments about noise, we chose Da House for its location and price. We decided to take a chance after another traveler on TripAdvisor commented that the music was loud, but he liked it. We were anticipating Caribbean music, but boy were we wrong! Try putting on some Techno music with the pulsing bass for one night at home until 4:30, and see whether you can sleep. If you can, and can live with the other issues above, or want to be one of the drunks making noise outside the windows, this might be your kind of place. Oh, and the art? My wife is a professional artist. Neither she nor I were impressed with anything we saw anywhere in Da House. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve posted a couple pictures of the priceless treasures in our room. You know, the ones that would have required our signing a blank credit card receipt! Two restaurants in the area bear mentioning. Around the block from Da House is Caf\u00c3\u00a9 San Juan.

Negative is the lack of elevator, and the steps are steep:). Since it is an art gallery, the desk clerk placed a sizeable hold on our credit card -- just in case we took something.

Usually you can get that at a hotel; we did learn where his band would be playing that week (despite the fact that we wouldn't be in San Juan long. But anyway.) For the price, this was a good hotel if you are planning to stay in San Juan. But, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, you MUST give 30 days notice or they will try to charge you a $100 cancellation fee. We had planned to stay here the last night of our trip too, but had a change of plans. We called, giving more than the standard 24 hours notice and Juanra (Manager/owner??) insisted we had to pay $100. He said this was normal at any hotel. Right. I'm no small-town girl. And, we had a change in our itinerary and also had to cancel at a hotel in Condado Beach and they didn't bat an eye. I told him that was ridiculous-he bargained down to $50. I told him that was ridiculous-I bargained down to $25 when I told him we had already stayed at the hotel one night. Finally, when I asked him how I could be guaranteed the final $25 agreement (which I still thought was ridiculous, but I was ready to get off the phone and back to my vacation) he got accusatory and said I didn't trust him, blah, blah, blah. I just wanted a confirmation number. I won't say he hung up on me, maybe we got disconnected (I was calling from the south part of the island) but the phone disconnected us.

Also, for breakfast there is a great place right around the corner called Mallorca. There are also so many great art galleries close by and we just had such a great time walking around and being centrally located. There is also a great club downstairs called the Nuyorican Cafe that has live music and gives you a taste of the local flavor.

Once we located it, we were so pleased and excited about our choice. I would say the style is eclectic contemporary with Old World charm. The beds are comfortable, appealing and pretty with crisp white linens and original artwork of local puerto rican artists.

We loved the hot tub on the rooftop that had a nice view of the city and the fort. We spent late afternoon up there and shared a bottle of wine. (Sidenote about the wine: They have wine lists for room service on the bedside, but when we ordered on at the reception desk they only had one bottle - it was a good one, so we took it. But, then they had no glasses. Then, they had no corkscrew! At first, the receptionist told us to go to the restaurant across the alley and ask them to open it, but when I told her that was weird and uncomfortable, one of the cleaning people helped us at went and got it opened for us. They also rounded up some silly plastic wine cups which did the job. Anyway, problem solved. And when we checked out the next day I saw they had a new crate of wine glasses from our homestate glass manufacturer, Libbey Glass.) Everything they say about the noise is TRUE. It is HORRIBLE, and if you want to sleep anytime before 3 am you should buy or bring really good earplugs (I recommend the silicon kind you can get at Walgreens at the Plaza del Armas.)

Da House is a beautiful hotel in an absolutely perfect location for walking/exploring one of the most colorful \"old\" cities you will ever visit. The staff are all very friendly and the hotel is kept clean. The rooms are simply lovely. We booked a 4th floor room (#404). The windows opened wide to a spectacular view over rooftops toward San Cristobal, the Capitol, and the sea. Now, this is a \"bohemain\" hotel in every sense of the word. If you like interesting people and interesting sites without the typical traveler \"attitude\" you get in resorts ... this is the place for you. HOWEVER, and UNDERSTAND ... The hotel sits directly above the Neuyorican Cafe, a busy restaraunt, and across the narrow alley from a hole-in-the-wall food/beer joint that is constantly occupied by locals during the day and deluged by students at night (cheapest beer in the city). Once the clock strikes 10pm, the noise ratchets up to a decibel level that is other worldly. There is simply no words to convey HOW LOUD IT REALLY IS ... and, please note ... I had done my research and made sure to bring ear plugs. Again, we were on the fourth floor on an outside room. It is possible that the inner rooms, not overlooking the alley may have been quieter. The noise is so overwhelming that you can \"feel\" the music through the floor, the bed, and the pillows. The music doesn't abate until 4am - EVERY night of the week. If street performers with drums and trumpets decide to add to the festivities in the alley, the decibel level increases to a point that renders ear plugs completely ineffective. Add to this the constant noise of the city and you have a very colorful stay. We absolutely loved it. Bring ear plugs, sleeping pills, and enough cash to get yourself loaded every night and you will sleep through the chaos. Food. The location is unbelievable and rests within a five minute walk from dozens of excellent restaurants. I travel for food first and enjoyed the best meal I have ever eaten anywhere at a restaurant located at the opposite end of the alley called Marmalade. Aquaviva is excellent. Cafe Berlin is must for a fabulous Sunday brunch. And, be sure to stop by Maria's for a terrifically simple taco, pina colada, and visit with the proprietor.

Living on a somewhat busier street in Chicago, I thought I would be (somewhat) immune to the noise. It was tolerable, but LOUD. We stayed in a room on the top floor, facing the Callejon de la Capilla, the narrow, brick-paved alleyway containing the Nuyorican Cafe entrance and chinchorro (hole-in-the-wall bar) where people congregated and socialized all night or prior to entering the Nuyorican. The best way to explain staying at Da House on a weekend is like throwing a party for 200+ of your closest personal friends, with music and conversation flowing at high decibels\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was fun, but all you want to do is graciously go to sleep. You can put up with the noise, because of course, it is your party. I must say that the price and location couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. The staff was extremely personable and helpful (with the exception of the gentleman who approached us while having drinks in the alleyway and told us he owned the hotel as well as the chair that a friend was sitting on and proceeded to take the chair and bring it to his table, even though there were other unoccupied chairs available). The accommodations, albeit small, were fine for our needs and our room did not have a television, if that is important. We decided that if we ever came back to Old San Juan we would probably stay at Da House, knowing what we know now. (Even on the fourth floor, the music and conversation floated upward.) We would be leery of the wake up call though, as we never received one as requested. Luckily we set our cell phone alarm clock. Also, make sure to check out the rooftop deck with great city views and hot tub!", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cExceeded our expectations\u201d", "Author": "rrader", "ReviewID": "UR13644641", "Content": "Da House is 25 steps down the Callejon de Capilla (Alley of the Church) from the Calle de San Francisco. There are four brick steps into the entryway, through an interesting, double hinged heavy door. A small, blue sign is on the outside and another sign just inside the doorway assures you that you are in the correct location. If you room is on the fourth floor, you have now 74 more steps to take to your room. These are not that difficult to manage (this from a 61 year old male). We arrived late on a Friday night with four couples, all well traveled, some Spanish speakers, all dancers and all going on a cruise after our stay in Old San Juan. One other couple came in the next day. Juanra is one of the owners of Da House and had the staff well prepared for our arrival as there were not one, but several, young, strong people to lug our heavy bags up the stairs for us. Sebastian, in particular, moved very quickly and laughed the whole time he was helping us all out. Juanra even hooked us up with a young lady named Mariella (whose sister Noelia works the desk) and Raphel, a third year law student, for a one hour Salsa lesson at the Nuyorican Cafe (also owned by the Da House and occupying the first floor next to the Da House entrance). We all slipped into the Nuyorican that night to hear the Caborican band with a conga player--named Juarna!! His wife plays keyboards for this excellent band. Everyone there was much younger than we, mostly PRs, and they could not have been friendlier or more fun. The place was packed and we were tired, so we left at 12:30 and slept until the dog's barking woke us up. There is a place called Yerta's which is about a half block down to the right on Calle de San Francisco which serves expresso, granola with yogurt and fruit, eggs and bacon, fresh squeezed orange juice, etc., hardly any of which is over three dollars. If you exit Da House, turn left, go the 25 steps to CSJ and go left for a half a block, you come to the Cafe Mallorca. There you can have a tostado with various fillings in a pressed pastry and powdered sugar for $1.75. Continue down CSJ, about six stores and on the right side of the street is La Bombonera, featured by Rachel Ray and incredible pastries. There is a really nice restaurant called Cafe Puerto Rico at the Christopher Columbus square. All these places are within two blocks of Da House. Saturday night there was a special show in support of Brazilian arts at the Nuyorican, so we sat in the alley, drank $1.75 beers from the small bar located there and had a ball watching all the people. The performers used the second floor lobbby of Da House as a changing room. They were obviously thrilled with the nights efforts as they held a cast party in that marble tiled, vaulted lobby, just below our room, until two in the morning. And Sunday morning, there was a \"Hog Run\" of Harleys traversing CSF past our church and on up to the church across from El Convento (five blocks) for services there. You should have heard those magnificent engines roaring in the narrow street bouncing off those buildings. Wow!! Now, that having been said, this is not the Howard Johnson, Motel Eight or Holiday Inn. There are no TV's (why would you want one?) and the rooms are all unique with featured PR artists in each with beautiful art everywhere. All the baths are different and the decor individual. This is in a city with dogs, garbage trucks, honking horns, incredible music, dancing, laughing and smiling. Isn't that why you came here? Remember, the beds are comfortable, the pillows soft, the weather warm, the breezes cool, the people delightful. We will definitely go back to our newest friends in San Juan.

We stayed one Friday night prior to a cruise. We were originally supposed to fly in during the afternoon, but the flights changed until 9pm or so. I knew from reading reviews that it might be confusing to locate, and I'm glad I emailed for specific directions, because at that hour of the evening, it was difficult to find, and the cab driver didn't have a clue. They really could stand to put a better sign out front, and/or a sign inside the first floor, because you don't know for sure if you're in someone's house or not! We had a room on the 4th floor facing the walking alley which is where the entrance is and where the salsa bar entrance is. We honestly weren't too bothered by the noise-what actually bothered us more was the next morning when the street cleaners started hosing the street down at 7am. That woke us up. The bathroom was probably my biggest issue-it was pretty small, though decorative-I now know that I like the looks of those pretty bowl sinks that sit on top of the vanity, but realize they're worthless as far as not splashing water. I'd neglected to bring shampoo, and they had one of those soap/shampoo/conditioner dispensers set up in the shower, but it didn't contain anything. The location is great for exploring OSJ. They'll hold your luggage for $5 after checking out too. People were nice and offered to take luggage upstairs for us, but we handled it ourselves.

We really loved the location and the building and artwork, the staff, but there's no way to get around it's noise issue. Our cab knew exactly where it was and dropped us off at the end of the street. The entrance is down a small side street, with a little sign next to the door. The lobby is on the second floor, so we were not really sure if it was the right place, but the artwork made me feel like this was it. There is no elevator, but the staff offered to help us take our luggage up the stairs. We were on the fourth floor and loved our room. It was small and sparse, but so cute! I loved the shutters on the windows. We were told at check in that we had a great view of the government building, ocean and fort.....well it looked out over all the rooftops, although we could see the fort. It was still very quaint and it does remind me of the European pensions that we've stayed in. Also, having a car in Old San Juan is a real detriment...there is no place to go with it. Parking is impossible and the streets are already jammed with cars. Da House is in a great location for everything. We dropped off our luggage and immediately set out exploring. Everything is within walking distance of the hotel....good food, sightseeing, interesting people, great music! We had a fabulous time. We'd been traveling since 5am, so we finally went back to the room to go to bed....knowing it would be tough to sleep, because of the great music coming from below our window. People were sitting outside talking and laughing...having a wonderful time. I kept wishing that I had the energy to join them downstairs, but we were exhausted. We were so tired we slept, but not well. I can still hear the music and the laughing! Sound really travels at night! Overall, we really enjoyed it and we would stay here again for a few days, because we loved the flavor of the place.

There is no lobby, nor is there anyone on duty. The steps were held together with duct tape. There was construction dust and rubble throughout. Our room was only barely habitable. Although it was more expensive than many in the main hotel, there was no TV, phone, internet, nor in-room art, as advertised. The bathroom was somewhat more cramped than an airline lavatory. Anyone over 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21225\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or so would have to sit on the toilet sideways with their knees in the hall.

We went to the main hotel to get more toilet paper. While there, we asked for a wakeup call on our last morning via cell phone and asked for them to arrange for a taxi to take us to the airport. They did not call us, nor did they call a cab. The person in charge of the guest house, Luzmar, was rude and argumentative, although Pedro was kind and did get us the toilet paper.
