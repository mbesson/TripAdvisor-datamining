The reviews I had read previous to me booking, were dead on. The only negative at all, was the size of the standard rooms. We were upgraded so the room we had was above average size for Rome standards. They're very tiny, but lovely. Then again, how much time do you spend in your room while in Rome?? I can't say enough about the staff and the service we received - it was exceptional. Besides being on a cruise ship, there aren't that many hotels I've been to in the past the offered the same service. The hotel rooms are relatively small (as are most in Rome), but very lovely, with a very cozy decor. It's not cheap, but hotels which are dumps, sell for very little less. The breakfast was called continental but this was the best by far I have ever had. Good variety and great service again. The location of the hotel is perfect!!! You step out of the front door, hang a right and just walk. You're in the main area of Rome, all the shopping is right there and you can reach the Spanish Steps. Great to just hang out. The variety of the restaurants nearby is great. Will definitely go back here in the future. Also, you're a 2 minute walk to the underground metro....sooo easy to use and will take you anywhere...we were at the Vatican in less than 20 minutes, including a short walk.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hilden, Germany", "Title": "\u201cVery nice base for a trip to Rome!\u201d", "Author": "Inga27", "ReviewID": "UR127822482", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights at River Palace Hotel in March and had a great stay.

We had never been to Rome before and after reading reports were a wee bit apprehensive. We landed in Rome around 20.30 on Sunday 18th Mar and caught a taxi at the airport to the hotel no complaints but taxi kept the meter on level 2 all the way in even although we were only 100 yards out of the boundary. Arrived at the hotel 21.40 check in spot on and shown to the room 102 and were also shown the quirky lift set up. As most other reports have said the rooms are not the largest in the world but did have the basics of hair dryer and fridge with mini bar. Bathroom could have been a bit bigger but was ample. We went down to the bar to finish off their happy hour and were surprised to see the area full of my countrymen who had been at the rugby still there (Celtic tops and Kilts and Rugby don't go together). Breakfast was of good quality with the usual choices of yoghurt and fruit along with pastries etc, you could also have a hot breakfast with scrambled eggs / boiled eggs ,bacon, sausages potato cakes(hash browns) along with tea coffee and juice. Reception were very helpful in advising how to get to where we were going each day. There is a tram stop 100 yards from the hotel and the metro is about 30 yards further. We never bothered with getting different passes and the Vatican is 2 stops away in 1 direction with Spanish Steps 1 stop in the other. The Metro system is easy to follow and costs 1 Euro per journey within 75 minutes which makes everything well within reach. We did not encounter any problems with pocket dippers but were always on the alert for them. There are a few places to eat along the street from the hotel and even the standard Burger King but go a 5 minute walk through the Piazza and there are more places to eat. The walk from the hotel to any of the sites is easy to do with I would say an exception of the Colloseum which I would do by Metro.

We paid a little extra for an upgrade to a superior room, which was very comfortable, with a bit more space for relaxing and keeping bags. Two things made River Palace stand out. Firstly was the excellent included breakfast. It had the full range of hot and cold foods, including eggs, bacon, cooked mushrooms, smoked salmon etc. It was so filling we rarely felt like lunch! We have had some great breakfast buffets, but this one stood out. The other really enjoyable thing was the half price happy hour between 6 and 10 pm. We rarely drink cocktails, but enjoyed one or two each night. A very nice way to relax after a full day and there is so much to see in Rome, every day is a full day. The only slight niggles we had were that the plumbing needed a bit of work, as the shower head was droopy and the sink and bath drains were both very slow.

We stayed for four nights in a deluxe room and had a fantastic time. The bed was very large and very comfortable, the pillows were amazing! The rooms and the hotel in general were kept spotless at all times. The breakfast in the hotel was extensive-there really was something for everyone from cooked food to meats, cheeses, cereals and pastries. The bar at night time has happy hour between 6pm and 10pm. We tried some of the cocktails-very strong but the sex on the beach was lovely. The hotel is in a prime location. We walked from the hotel to the Vatican in 15 minutes, the Spanish steps in 15 minutes and the Trevi Fountain in 20 minutes. Piazza del Popolo and Via del Corso are within 3 minutes walk of the hotel so for shopping and food its perfect. There is a restaurant on the same side of the street as the hotel, if you come out of the hotel and turn right its beside the pharmacy. The food was absolutely delicious, extremely cheap and the staff were very friendly. I would definitely recommend you eat here at least once! While in Rome, I was robbed on the metro between Barberini and Republica. The carriage was excessively packed with people and when I got separated from my partner someone saw this as an opportunity to pick-pocket. Unfortunately on our second last day, they stole 450euro-everything we had. I went back to the hotel to report this and to be honest, the staff were not in any way helpful. I understand that in Rome this is a regular occurance but where I am from its not so common and I was very upset. The receptionist told me to go to the 'carabineri' in the sqaure nearby and report to them. When I did, they sent me to a police station which was closed. Back to the carabineri who couldnt speak english and they then sent us on a wild goose chase for a police station. After 4 and a half hours of walking around rome on a saturday night we found that no one was willing to help us; not the hotel, not the carabineri and not the police. The next morning I reported it again to the hotel and the told me to speak to the police, even though I had already told them of the ordeal the night before. I do think that the hotel could have done more for us in this upsetting situtation. I know pick-pocketing is rampant in Rome but when it happens to you, and on such a large scale, you expect alot more from people than what we had. The only negative thing I can say about the hotel is that the staff were not helpful when I was in this situation. Please at all times keep your hand on your handbag, even if it is at the front of you. Also split your money up between the group because they are so good at what they do.

It's really just a few steps from Piazza del Popolo as well as from the underground station (it's very good if you do not take a taxi from Termini station). As it's quite near the city center so you can easily walk to mostly all sightseeing attractions in Rome. The hotel itself is quite nice if you are lucky and have a good room. In this case you'll be able to rank it \"excellent\". Unfortunately we were not as lucky as we hoped and I can give only 3 points - not very bad but not very good/good. Pros: -the staff is very friendly and helpful. But there were 2 guys at receprtion (I suppose they were very busy at that moment on the phone) who did not answer our \"bye\". It happened only once so not a tragedy at all. -breakfast is VERY-VERY good and generous! It exceeded our expectations. Fresh fruits (pineapple, kiwi, sweet melon..), selection of cheese, antipasty, ham, eggs ........Even champange ;-) -two PCs with free Internet access (in the lobby) are really helpful for those who did not take their notebooks (we did not). It was good to check-in for our flight in advance and to get our boarding passes printed -the bar is very nice and it was almost full every evening. From 6 to 10 p.m. you can enjoy your drink with 50% discount. -safe, fridge, nicely decorated room's walls and marble in a bathroom -again location - the hotel is not far from the city center and it can be easily found Cons: -TINY room! Our standart room was so tiny that it was more like a dog house but not a room in a 4* hotel. It was just impossible to move around the room for two people, only this way - one is sitting on the bed, the other is doing smth (e.g. getting dressed in the morning). -The same about the bathroom. You should better ask balance-masters for a piece of advice before you tried to enter the bathroom together or use your towel (after shower) in it. - every day at any time (and at night as you can guess) we were lucky enough to enjoy the noise of plumbing system. As soon as someone (above) flashed the toilet ot took shower we heard real roaring. Thanks God I took ear muffs - after the first night without them I had to use them every night to sleep well. - every evening we were again \"happy\" to enjoy some strange smell from the street (our windows overlooked the backyard) like smoke. It was very unpleasant. We tried to use conditioning but - as soon as it was switched on there was smell of cigarette smoke. I guess some guests smoked in their rooms but somehow (the cond-n system is old enough in my opinion) we felt it. We did not complain about that because we had been told the hotel is full. -weird lift system. First you need to go up to the 1st floor then walk to anouther lift and go up again. It's not good when you are tired or have luggage etc. Moreover the second lift can be used only for 2-2.5 people at the same time, it's very small If my friends may happen to have the same room and face the same troubles (and they may because it's unpredictable which room you'll have) I can not recommend them to stay at this hotel.

The person at the reception was extremely helpful, spoke perfect English, booked our return cab and printed our boarding passes. The bedroom was a bit small, but very manageable. Bathroom very nice with marble everywhere. Some chips on the bathtub and the showerhead. Otherwise perfectly clean, with all the right things at disposal: wardrobe with drawers and hangers, safe, free wifi, minibar and snacks. The hairdryer turned off a bit randomly, and a free bottle of water every day would be good. Overall a bit dated, but has some charm to it.

We had to wait until 7.30pm but were invited to have a drink in the bar whilst we waited. We thought this was really kind until we found that we had been charged for them on our check out bill (refunded when we asked but shouldnt have had to) We did feel a little miffed when we asked for a late check out ourselves but were refused unless we paid 50 euros. The hotel just maintained that our late check in was due to a\" technical problem\" so not their fault LOCATION - Great location very close to a large square which links to a major shopping street. We never felt the need to use any public transport, walking to all attractions. The closest is the spanish steps (15 mins) Trevi Fountain (20 mins) Vatican (30 min brisk walk) Collosseum (40 MIns). We returned with very weary feet and legs but it is all possible. We found that the queue for St Peter's Basilica was hours long but revisited at 7.30 am and walked straight in. There was also no queue on our exit an hour later. ROOMS - We stayed in a superior which was small but manageable. I had read on another review no space for a suitcase which i found to be untrue. There wasnt a luggage rack as such but they did fit in the corner of the room without causng and obstruction. A bi folding wardrobe door meant that access to the wardrobe could be tricky as opening it required more space than was available. The room had tv, well stocked minibar of a reasonable price, desk and chair (although the mirror was at standing height above it so ladies take a mirror if you like to sit for hair and makeup) The temperature was a major problem. After being able to control it individually for a couple of nights the hotel then took cental control and tried to roast us all. It was far too hot and opening the windows was ok until about 5.30 when trams would begin to wake us.The corridors were even hotter We got wifi in the room but it could be intermittent. Bed was comfortable (double)and we both slept well. No bath towel or bedding change was given during our 4 nights. The bathroom was very narrow meaning that your knees actually touched the bath when you sat. The bathtub itself was too narrow and shortfor either of us to lie in comfortably but the shower head wasnt great (shot water out sideways from the head soaking the bathroom)Again it was all manageable but not quite a 4* experience It was nicely supplied with bath/shower gel, shampoo, conditioner. body lotion, soap, tissues, and a lovely little beauty box containing cleansing lotion, cotton pad and buds. A hair dryer on the wall was available. Although the bathroom was spotlesslessy clean the fittings were very worn and would benefit from upgrade. A turn down service was provided with chocolates and a weather forecast (she usuaally arrived a bit too early 6.30 to 7.00 when we were getting ready) BAR AREA - Very comfortable place to sit with a nice relaxed ambience with smart decor. Half price drinks during happy hour between 6 and 10 were on offer along with snacks that you could make a meal of (sandwiches, savoury pastries, salami, nuts and crisps). Full price was large beer 5, cocktails 10, wine 5, liqueurs 4. BREAKFAST- Wonderful breakfast with pretty much everything you would want on offer. Wide selection of meats, cheeses, breads, sweet pastries and cakes as well as fuit and yoghurt and hot options too. The dining room was pleasant but again on the small side when full which made getting out of your seat to visit the buffet a bit of a squeeze. One last tip - There is a small restaurant almost oposite the hotel (La Sella del Diavola) which doesnt look much from outside but please do go in. The food is excellent and of average We visited twice paying about 60 euros for 2 of us having 2 courses each and a drink. Lobster with linguni was to die for.

The positives: *The Location is terrific. We were able to walk everyone in Rome (even all the way to Testaccio). During our stay we were able to experience a concert in the Piazza del Popolo for the 150th anniversary of Italy's unification (something we would have missed if not staying at River Palace). *The Junior Suites are roomy, clean, and nicely decorated (although a bit worn). *There were two minibars in our room filled with sodas, water, alcohol, and wines. All the items were reasonable priced. *The staff were friendly and tried to be accommodating. *Breakfast is plentiful, fresh, and relaxing. *Happy Hour at the hotel is 50% off drinks (except champagnes) from 6-10pm each night. The bartender was always friendly and efficient. The negatives: *Housekeeping - we ran into a few problems when it came to housekeeping. The first was that they always came too early for daily service and too early for turn down service. The would never come back if the do not disturb sign was on the door, they slide a card under the door saying they tried to come by. This caused us to constanly have to ask for our rooms to be cleaned once we were ready to leave. The 2nd issue was that they didn't always take and replace dirty items (mainly cups), and we don't believe the bedding was ever changed. The 3rd issue was that 20 euros was missing from our room. We went our one morning to get money and counted that money while we were out, counted it again when we got back to our room, and later in the day found that the 20 was missing. We searched the enire room, went through our belongings, verified our receipts etc. We don't know if it was taken out of the safe or if we dropped on the floor while trying to put it in the safe but either way it was gone and it wasn't our doing. We contacted the front desk and they ensured us that they would let the staff know. At the end of the day we weren't mad - if someone took it then we hope that they just needed it more than us. *Our room key was deactivated three times during our stay. *There isn't truly a concierge at the hotel. We once asked for help with a restaurant recommendation in the Trevi fountain area. The response was I don't know of any your probably best to go and look. Another time the staff was at first very helpful with trying to secure a reservation at a particular restaurant. The gentleman called but the restaurant wasn't open during the afternoon. He offered to keep calling the restaurant until they opened. Unfortunately, he didn't let us know our reservation was confirmed until we were walking out the door to go to dinner somewhere else.

We stayed in 6 hotels along the way, with River Palace being the first. My only regret is perhaps that we did not appreciate what a gem it was at the time. All four of us work in the South African Tourism industry and admit that we can be quite picky when it comes to hospitality products and services. Our first impression of the hotel was that it was not four star standard with the rooms being unbelievably small and with the tiniest shower I had ever seen ... however, as we soon found out, the room size was about normal for Italy and also realised that what what we know as a three star in South Africa is equivalent to Italy's four star! Anyway - having now returned from our holiday, I wanted to make a point of reporting back on the postives of this hotel. Firstly the location is wonderful, with easy walking distance of the Spanish Steps and the Trevi fountain and infact many other places if happy to walk a bit further. For those less energetic people though, there is a Metro stop just a few metres from the hotel. Secondly, the staff were very friendly and helpful, which once again ... we soon found out, was not the norm throughout the rest of our Journey, infact would even go as far to say that other service providers, including Tourism offices that we came into contact with along the way were downright rude! The breakfast is nothing short of superb and was the only hotel we stayed at that offered a hot option too. The selection really was fantastic and again with friendly service staff. The free wifi was very much appreciated and last but not least - one of the best selling points of this hotel was their happy hour that runs each evening from 6-10pm - where all drinks are half price. To us South Africans, struggling with a very bad exchange rate - this was music to our ears. They also put on a full spread of snacks that were complimentary during Happy hour.

We were in Rome Sept 2011 for a 5 day break for our 25th wedding anniversary, this included 4 nights in the River Palace or at least that\u2019s what we booked 8 months earlier and confirmed 2 months earlier (as we had been spooked by reviews). When we arrived the manager informed us they had made a mistake with our booking and did not have a room for us! Shock horror this was exactly what we had read about with this hotel, we had so wanted to believe that the reviews recited a freak incident that happened to a very unlucky minority but shouldn't happen to us. How wrong we were! The manager offered another hotel for our first night and then we would be back to the River Palace, I got very cross about this, he then added 20 euros to spend in the bar and two places on the hotel recommended bus / walking tour. So as not to further upset our anniversary and given the amount of time we had, there was really little choice but to accept the situation. We noticed during our stay that other unfortunate people were subjected to the same fate, which adds to the difficulty in believing these are mistakes. The big problem here is the feeling of uncertainty, the unknown commodity, 'will they really have a room tomorrow night? what will this other hotel really be like? Actually the other hotel was nice but we were still left with worry about the rest of the booking, we had no faith or trust in the hotels promise. My wife was very upset, the break meant so much to her, one important reason being that we couldn't afford a honey moon 25 years ago. So this was pretty special, she is not normally that emotional but she cried in the room later that night. It hadn't helped mind you that we had had a nightmare journey from the airport, 4hrs for an alleged 45 minute shuttle journey! The very big point here which I believe may be eluding the hotel is the amount of distress this causes. In other aspects of the River Palace experience the hotel does try very hard and succeeds to provide an excellent service, however this problem cruelly lets it down where it matters most. Right off the soap box and back to the rest of the stay with the River Palace, which was great! The champagne breakfast was fabulous, the best continental breakfast we have ever had, I tried everything and made a point of fuelling up daily with salmon and mushrooms and whatever else I fancied (pastries, fruit, cold meats, cheeses) plus champagne, well rude not to really \uf04a. Did try their hash browns, bacon, sausage and scrambled egg, tasty enough but not as good as english hotels but of course we weren\u2019t there for english style food. When we finally got to our \u2018Superior deluxe \u2019 room on the second night, the room was exactly as per the internet if not better, it was very slightly smaller than a typical English hotel room but more than ample for us. We\u2019ve both got middle aged spreads but still had plenty of space in our room and in the notorious second lift, which incidentally is as small as we had read about. The hotel is very pleasantly decorated with some nice touches like the cast sculptures and paintings. The piano lounge is a good size and well appointed with soft leather sofas and coffee tables, it leads to the marble stairs and legendary happy hour half price 6 \u2013 10 bar, which leads to cocktail upon cocktail which leads to us and other happy tourists enjoying each others company. On our arrival in our room we received two large sweet apples, then every morning we received two soft sweets and a card with the daily weather forecast. The room includes bath robes, slippers, safe, dumb waiter, pay tv, phone, bidet, good shower but similar to other Italian hotels no tea or coffee facilities. The linen is good quality and the bed was comfortable, the room air conditioning works fine and as well as the privacy nets the two sets of curtains include black out curtains. The staff were very friendly, very helpful, good English with great restaurant recommendations. We would recommend the hotel taxi service, the guy is very helpful (50 euros too Fiumicino airport).", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cCozy, quite, best breakfast included.\u201d", "Author": "Houstan", "ReviewID": "UR119321070", "Content": "We stayed two nights: the room was nice but the fancy gold colored rugs need to be cleaned or replaced (even in the halls).

The hotel was excellent, the staff were helpful and superb and Rome was stunning. Much has already been said so I will try and not repeat everything. One of the best things we did was to arrange a taxi via the Hotel, you simply supply your flight times and they arrange everything for you. Its \u20ac55 pick up to hotel (to cover parking) and \u20ac50 return. No advanced payments and the driver is waiting for you in arrivals with a card clearly displaying your name. Alessandro Marconi (hope the spelling is correct) was our driver both ways; he was excellent and gave us a mini guided tour of Rome on the way to the hotel which later proved to be invaluable and saved us a lot of time and effort. He is not over the top and you are not expected to pay any extra for his mini tour; he does it because he is wants to help and is proud of his job and of Rome. Using some of the detail from Alessandro and some from the very kind reception staff at the hotel, you can use my following information to get you started.. We walked everywhere, there are good transport links but we did not need them. I\u2019ll try and remember the cost of things and indicate below. We had no need for \u2018guided tours\u2019; they can be expensive and do not always beat the queues. Directions and articles in the sights are well signed and explained in English. Here we go.... Step out of the hotel and turn right, you will see a big arch ahead of you - Picture 1 (2 min walk), cross the main road and walk under the arch and you are now in the Piazza Del Popolo. As you pass under the arch and enter the Popolo, visit the church on the left \u2013 Santa Maria Del Popello which featured in a Dan Brown book!? \u2013 Picture 2. Look across the Piazza (past the Egyptian obelisk and fountain) and you will see three (3) roads separated by two (2) apparently identical churches with large domes, Picture 3 The road to the left (1st) takes you to the Spanish Steps (free), Trevi Fountain (free). We then visited the Pantheon (free), Piazza Novona (free) etc. The middle road (2nd) takes you to the Colosseum*, Faro Romano* (ruins) and Monte Palatino*. (* joint ticket \u20ac12 \u2013 get your tickets at Faro Romano \u2013 less queues!) The road to the right (3rd) takes you to Saint Angelo\u2019s Castle (\u20ac5), St Peters Church (free), Cupola (this is up into the dome at St Peters, 600 + steps! - \u20ac5 all steps, \u20ac7 a few less steps as you can use an elevator to avoid some) Vatican Museum which includes Sistine Chapel (\u20ac15). There is lots more to see and do and it is all covered in other reviews. Just to round off, we had the classic (small) room and it was fine, we were offered a reduced upgrade but did not need it. We had nothing to complain about, and the breakfast is yummy! The half price \u2018happy 4 hour\u2019 drinks and free food at the bar (mentioned in other reviews) is great value for money.

The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is very clean. Breakfast has a big selection of pastries, cold meats, chesses, breads, yoghurts, cereals, tea, coffee, juice and cooked items. The happy hour was welcomed at the end of the day, we certainly made our way through the entire cocktail list with another couple that was staying there. Perfect relaxtion after a long days sightseeing. Sandwiches and snacks were ok. The hotel does not provide dinner, but there is a lovely little pizza place towards Piazza del Popolo on the same side of the road as the hotel, near Burger King. It is not much to look at from the outside, but very reasonably priced and nice size portions. across the road there is a restaurant with bright neon type signs, dont be put off - we had a lovely homecooked meal in there of chicken, rice, vegetable and fries, with 2 beers for 20E. They didn't speak much English, but were friendly all the same. It was a European resataurant, but had a funny name like \"Chicken Express\" Flaminio metro station is less than 5 minutes walk away, and there are trams that run directly outside the hotel. We were on the 4th floor, but as it was winter we had the window shut most of the time. The room could get quite warm, but it was 12'C outside and clear blue skies when we went, unlike the great British weather in January! We walked to all the main sites - Vatican, Colleseum, Pantheon, Spanish Steps etc, but occasionally got the Metro back when our legs were too weary. The location of the hotel is fantastic, just far enough out of the way to not be bombarded with tourists as soon as you step out onto the street, but close enough to the attractions. Piazza Del Poppollo is stunning, and a walk through Borghese park grounds is a must! This is definitely in my top 3 of favoutie hotels that we have stayed at and would definitely stay again if we ever go back to Rome. I would not bother paying for an upgrade, unless you would prefer to have a bath instead of a shower. The rooms are small, but unless you are bringing your cat to swing, you should find that there is sufficient space for all your clothes, toiletries etc. Highly recommended for couples as it is decorated in quite a quirky romantic way!", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Donegal", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel, Staff Excellent\u201d", "Author": "Maria T", "ReviewID": "UR117464779", "Content": "Don't normally write reviews but having checked this on tripadvisor before we booked had to give an opinion.

The public areas were all clean and welcoming. Free access to the computers (with internet) at any time during the day was really handy.

It was within walking distance of all the main sights of Rome and there is a Metro station within a minutes walk down the road for the day when you can no longer walk!

When we arrived at the hotel we had a very warm greeting and our bags were collected for us from the taxi and we were taken personally to our room and the bags followed us up. I wondered whether tips were expected but as soon as our room had been opened and the lights etc shown to us we were left immediately. The hotel has two lifts, one to the first floor and a second tiny lift fitting only 4 people to the top. During our stay we didn't have any problems with the lifts at all. Our room was lovely and we could change our own air conditioning. The bathroom was clean and well equipped and the bed was comfortable with immaculately clean bedding. You could ask for your linen or your towels to be replaced at any time. In the evening our bed was turned down and a weather report was left in the room along with two sweets along with a mat at each side of the bed (to pray on who knows?) In the evening from 6pm onwards up until 10pm was happy hour (or 4 hrs!) and your drinks were half price and free sandwiches and crisps etc were served. This was a really nice atmosphere in the lounge and although the drinks were half price even at full price it was only E2.00 for latte coffee and E2.5 for a coke which is cheaper than the local restaurants. We travelled one day to Tripoli and saw the Villa D Este which was well worth the journey however 'big mistake' you need to buy a ticket for the bus prior to getting on! The bus driver was not happy at all when we tried to get from Tripoli to Hadrians villa - we found out later that the tickets are sold in the coffee shop across the road from the bus stop! However the journey from Hotel to Tripoli was really easy - Metro to bus station then one bus all the way total cost for the return trip E6.00 each however the ticket from Tripoli to Villa Hadrian on the number 4 bus was E1.00 each way, however we didn't return to Tripoli in the end deciding to just catch the Rome Cotral bus back to Rome from Hadrians Villa (main road). The baths of Carracella or a must see with fabulous mosaics and the Villa D'Este for its gardens and fountains. Trevi Fountain - well we went in the evening but it was packed so instead we went before breakfast later in the week and got there for around 8am and only a few others had had the same idea - it was lovely and a lot bigger than I thought. Tip - avoid anyone with Roses they want E1.00 for every Rose they palm off onto you. Tip - buy your bus ticket before embarking Tip - a 75 min ticket on the metro going anywhere is E1.00 Tip - we had our best meal at Al Garraro (think spelt like this) which is not far from Piazza Popollo.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork", "Title": "\u201cCentral, Very Clean, Very Friendly\u201d", "Author": "i_kenefick", "ReviewID": "UR117268122", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nights.

I can't think of any negatives except the room size and that is such a minor issue given all the positives. We will stay here again any time we go back to Roma.

As for the hotel, the staff was friendly and helpful. However, we had an issue with our room where the first two nights of our four-night stay, the AC wasn't working at all. I don't know if it was just our room as I didn't hear anybody else complaining -- AND the AC worked very well in the lobby. But after our first night and sweating all through our attempted sleep, we said something at the front desk. They couldn't move us, so they gave us an oscillating fan. Great, but all it did was blow the warm air around. By the second morning, we were miserable. After that they were able to get us a portable AC unit to use as they still didn't have any open rooms to move us into. That worked okay (though it had a vent that fed outside which required the window be open all the time); but the last morning we were there, the unit almost flooded our suitcase as it backed up water into the room.

There were 8 adults (4 couples) in our party and we had booked our 4 superior rooms 7 months in advance. However, 2 of the 4 rooms we had reserved were not available upon our check-in. The desk staff apologized & located 2 alternate \"classic\" rooms (smaller) for their first night. Upon my insistence the 2 couples (one couple was on their honeymoon) were then transferred to \"upgraded\" deluxe rooms without additional charge for the remaing 8 nites. The manager also provided each of the 2 couples with a complimentary bottle of wine. Although the upgraded rooms included a bathtub with shower the 2 deluxe rooms did not seem as large as the superior rooms we had booked. Note to the Hotel: When overseas travelers arrive they are exhausted, excited and desire to be accommodated. The poor desk clerk had to listen to my angry rants but could do nothing until the manager came in several hours later. Overall we were finally satisfied but this was a very bad way to start our stay which we had been planning for many months and had repeatedly sent & received confirmations to/from the hotel in advance of our arrival. Re: Booking through the Hotel's Website: It appears their booking system does not work properly which resulted in our unavailable room problem. It is also impossible to make any changes to reservations when booking through their website. You are required to cancel the whole reservation and start over. Even e-mails to the desk months prior to our arrival requesting changes were unsuccessful. They need to upgrade their on-line booking system to avoid such hassles and problems in the future. The Superior Rooms were quite spacious for European standards, hotel is immaculately clean and the staff is quite helpful whenever we requested assistance with directions, restaurant recommendations, etc. The breakfasts are AWESOME -- the staff even prepared cappucino's for us each morning. The half price drinks with snacks for the happy hour in the lovely lobby/lounge area is a very welcome idea. Beds & pillows are very comfortable. If staying on 2nd floor or higher, you need to take 2 elevators but this quirky little scheme was no problem at all. At least they have working elevators! Air conditiong was great too -- especially since several days during our stay were in the high 90's and very hot. Location is super - just 2 block walk to metro/subway, about 3 or 4 blocks to the buses or shops. Can also walk to most sites. Overall we had a great stay.

Piaza Popolo is 2 mins along the road. The Trevi Fountain is about 20-25 minutes walk. We had a deluxe room which was great for us although, yes, a little smaller than most English rooms. We really only slept in our room as there was so much to see outside. It had a TV, desk, wardrobe, drawers, safe and minibar. The bathroom was absolutely fine with a shower over the bath and a glass screen. All very clean with beautiful bed linen. The only negative we found, which has nothing to do with the hotel, was it was very difficult to find somewhere decent to eat. Be careful of any restaurants on the street with nice canopies over (there are lots of them), we ate in these once or twice and it cost us a fortune for pizza which was no better than here in the UK!

Unfortunately my flight was delayed for over 9 hours and I received a phone call from the hotel whilst I was still at Manchester Airport. I explained that I was delayed but had understood that the driver would be monitoring flight times as he had been passed all the details of my flight and this is normal procedure. I received two further calls whilst still at the airport telling me I was liable for additional charges as the driver had waited for me for several hours. Upon arrival in Rome there was no car waiting and I made my way to the hotel by taxi and was greeted with less than a warm welcome. The following day I discussed the matter with the manager who was very understanding of the situation. He said that the hotel had incurred a charge of 50 euros but said that it would not be charged to me. As a goodwill gesture I informed him that I would pay half of this to which he agreed was approriate. Sadly at check out time, I was harrassed over the 50 euros the hotel had paid despite me paying the 25 euros. In addition I did not receive a receipt.

Worth noting you have to take a lift from the ground floor to the first one to access any of the upper floors- either via a second (tiny) lift or the stairs.

Let's put it this way, I had to hop over the bed to get to the bathroom when my wife is sitting on the writing desk putting on her make up. Speaking of the bathroom, the stand alone shower was so small, I felt claustrophobic in it. By the way, I'm not a big guy (height 5'11 and weigh 165 lbs.) I can't imagine how some one bigger than me can comfortably take a shower in it. Furthermore, the room looked a bit dated and is in need of some updating.

If you are staying for a while, have lots of luggage or need a bit of space, then it's probably best to consider a bigger room. You can easily and enjoyably walk to the major tourist sites but having a metro station on the dorrstep is a real plus. We used it to get to the attractions early to beat the crowds, then bimbled back at our leisure to enjoy the hotel's happy hour before eating at one of the many nearby restaurants. It's definately worth asking for the staff for their recommendations. Our top tip: when visiting the Colloseum, buy your combined Forum/Palantine/Colloseum ticket from the Palantine site as the queues there are much shorter. The ticket is valid for 24 hours so no need to cram all three sites into one day. There wasn't a lot of information on display at the Forum so take a good guide book or get an audioguide/guided tour at the ticket office - you'll need ID (a passport or credit card etc) to hire an audio guide.

We decided not to upgrade but we were shocked to discover how small the classic rooms are! We can't even open our 2 suitcases in the room!

The hotel staff are very friendly, professional and helpful when I asked for advice about the city. The room we occupied was a little on the small side but was very clean and comfortable and although it overlooked Via Flaminia and the passing metro trams, we could not hear any noise from the street.

The location of the hotel is 2 minutes stroll from piazza del Popolo and from there you can easily walk to the Spanish steps or Trevi fountain in 10 minutes, Pantheon in 15 minutes and the Coluseum/Roman Forum at the other end of the centre in about 30 minutes. Crossing the river and following it round to St Peter's Basillica takes about 30 - 40 minutes and a further 10 minutes around the Vatican wall takes you to the Vatican museum. We spent about 4 hours in the museum and Sistene chapel - absolutely fantastic and well worth the 15 Euro pp entry fee. For the 4 days we were in Rome the weather prediction was for rain.

We had booked a Jr. Suite, which I would recommend as a minimum since the rooms are small.

It was wonderful to sit out there and sip wine during rare moments of downtime.

The happy hour with complimentary snacks is also a nice way to fill the void until the restaurants open for dinner. The location is perfect \u2013 close enough to walk to most center city attractions, but just far enough on the other side of Piazza del Popolo to be a little quieter.

I am glad that we chose the River Palace since it was really a nice stay, in a great location. I think that the hotel's prepaid four day stay was a great deal. You have to stay Sunday, breakfast is included, and you are in a deluxe double room. This was a bargain compared to similar hotels in Rome. When I checked out a few other hotels we wanted to stay in mainly for a view and/or rooftop restaurant a few days before we left, they had available rooms at discounted rates so there is something to be said for booking at the last minute...We thought the River Palace was in very nice hotel...when we drove into Rome from Umbria it hard to find with all of the one ways, but eventually we found it just a few blocks from the Piazza de Popolo...not a huge awning or flags in front so we passed it by once...then drove slowly down the street again and there is was. Some previous reviews said that the area was dicey which was not the case. In fact, the two blocks from the Piazza help to separate the hotel from the hustle and bustle of Rome which was mobbed with tourists including passengers from 6 cruise ships. The concierge Sergio was on duty and he was very professional making all of our restaurant reservations, answering questions, etc. All of the staff was very helpful and professional. One important thing was that I was so happy that I did not follow their advice in emails I sent before we left the USA. They told us there was no problem, and to make our reservation for the Sistine Chapel once we got to Rome. We would never haven gotten into the Vatican Museum/Sistine Chapel; the lines to get in were at least 1 1l2 to 2 hrs. wait. This would have been a huge mistake. We should not have waited on the Villa Borghese...you could only book them a week in advance and the River Palace staff emailed me that there was no problem a few weeks before our arrival. I was so disappointed that their info was wrong, since the Museum was totally booked for days. Anyway, we stayed in the deluxe double on the first floor. It was spacious, clean, nicely decorated even though there were stains on the walls and carpets. There were two problems which we brought to the attention of the concierge. One...the air flow was horrible. Again, it seems from previous reviewers there is a problem with air conditioning. It was really chilly outside in the evening and morning, but the room was warm and stuffy. Thank God we opened up the window at night and air flowed in, although my husband was sneezing up a storm. The halls and the rest of the hotel were comfortable but there is a definite problem with the room. There was a man working in the hall for two days on the wiring outside of our room and perhaps that was what he was working on. We kept saying that this would so uncomfortable in any kind of heat. After being in Umbria for 2 1/2 weeks with rooms that had views, it was disconcerting to have such a dark room. The second problem was the shower/bath. We travel in Europe a lot and have encountered many an interesting tub, and this one has to be one of the hardest to get in and out of along with a shower handle that never worked properly and went flying in the air more than once. Housekeeping tried to fix it, but it never worked properly. We enjoyed the breakfast which had nice choices of meat, cheese, eggs, fruit, dolce...The lounge area was also very nice...clean, modern, stylish and very welcoming after a long day out sightseeing, shopping, etc. The happy hour or rather hours was a great deal with half price drinks and some appetizers such as olives, potato chips, pistachio nuts, and little sandwiches. It was nice to return to the hotel after supper and have an espresso or cappucino or a glass of wine before going to one's room. We brought our ipad and used it, but the room (like practically every one we had in Umbria) had internet service that kept going on and off so we used the lounge. There was a room with free computer usage which was nice. Must say to everybody...phone service was a real pain. We paid extra for ATT and there was absolutely no service in Umbria and Rome. In the hotel, you could not use any prepaid phone cards and they charged 1 Euro for each minute so that phone service was very poor. The hotel arranged for a cab to take us to DaVinci very early in the morning. Before we left , we were given a nice take away breakfast which came in handy since we were caught in the French wildcat strike that affected all Italian flights crossing their air space. We knew it was too good to be true...getting into DaVinci after a 25 minute ride, waiting for security (Italians do not work before 7 am), then the wait...13 1/2 hrs to get back!....All in all, the River Palace was a very nice place to stay in Rome!", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Service, Superb breakfasts, Chic Bar with happy hour, Stay Here!\u201d", "Author": "binoy_rosario", "ReviewID": "UR84227689", "Content": "We were delightfully surprised by this hotel.

The room even came with a UK/US converters and sky TV. Every evening our sheets were turned and a slip of the next day\u2019s weather and a couple of sweets were left, again another nice touch.

We booked two adjoining rooms which was great because our bathtub/shower sprayed water all over so we all ended up using the shower stall in their room. It was also nice to open both outer doors which made it feel like we were staying in a bigger room. Overall, the boys really liked the attentiveness of the staff, the 'unusual' breakfast fare (i.e., pastries available) and the fabulous location so close to all the major attractions in Center Rome.

In fact we were unable to gain access to our room until after ten past two. The man on reception said there were just too many people arriving and departing. A 4 star hotel should be able to cope and not leave customers waiting for over 3 hours to gain access to their rooms. Our room was tiny even by city centre standards. The lift system was totally inadequate. One lift to access the first floor. However, the button to call the lift was not always responsive. The porter downstairs thought he could manage to work it, but after a few minutes when it still refused to work we climbed the stairs!!. Our room was on the 6th floor. There was only 1 lift to access floors 2 - 8 which was situated down a corridor from the lift to the first floor. This lift only held a maximum of 4 people, fewer if they had suitcases. The lift was exceptionally hot and airless and would be dangerous if it ever broke down. Breakfast although good was also a nightmare. There were 3 lines of tables seating a total of 36. The chairs were back to back so it was impossible for those not seated on the outside to leave the table without disturbing all their neighbours. There were also two additional small tables. On the Saturday morning we were at the hotel the seating was inadequate to cope with the number of guests wanting breakfast, and some either had to wait or eat in the bar.

The free morning breakfast was abundant, with mouth-watering pastries and champagne, in addition to eggs, meat, cheeses, cereals, yogurt, fruit and more. The evening happy hour was complete with ample finger food and great drinks. Internet was free and easy to use. The location was very good. Quick and easy to the metro, Piazza del Poppolo, bus stops and restaurants, but just enough off the busy areas to be quiet and restful.

Gotta be sure to put out the DND sign before going to the very nice dining room for buffet breakfast (included with our stay), or you come back to find your room cleaned while you were out. One drawback is the elevators - very small and you have to take two elevators unless your room is on floor 1 (note all floors in Italy start at 0 not 1) - I have been in larger phone booths. Hotel is adorned with art and paintings has a beautiful lobby for happy hour and a comfy TV room for watching sporting events (the World cup was happening during our visit). Two convenient computers are provided for internet access, boarding passes etc. and the lack of a printer is overcome by emailing anything you want to print to the hotel's email address. Location is convenient to the Metro and about a 15 euro cab ride to the Roma Termini or a 50 euro transfer ride to FCO airport. The room was nice - although a bit cramped even though we upgraded to the deluxe room (plus 40 euro/per). Nice feature was an AC / Italian power outlet for charging stuff. The deluxe room came with the spiffy terry robe and comfy slippers. The bathtub was too small for an american - might have even been tight for anyone over 5' and 100lbs. Shower was good but had a tricky holder that tended to slip and spray the entire bathroom.as there was no shower curtain just a half divider of glass. The standard room did not have a bath at all. Nightly turndown service was a nice touch with candies and a floor mat thing for your slippers. The food was good but not great - certainly adequate and plentiful - sometimes they were out of basics like hash browns and bacon.

Location excellent, and situated near Metro station so even though we walked a lot, we could allways use the metro to get back. Nice restaurants near by, try the Gusto, we liked it. When we checked in, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a larger room. After taking a quick look at both type of rooms, we decided to accept the upgrade to a superior room for an extra 20 euro. The rooms aren\u00b4t that big so a superior room at about 20sqm felt more comfortable. We were given room on the first floor,I think it was room 103, which turned out to be awfull. The room was situated next to the hotels second elevator, everyone passed outside our door in order to get a connection with the elevator for floors 2-8. All night we heard the elevator bell ring and people talking,laughing etc going past our room. The walls were thin so we could hear our neighbour snoring, (at least he was enjoying his sleep) and the plumbing were not so good as well. We could hear people flush constantly. At about 7 in the morning we were awaken by street construction right outside the hotel, the room was facing via Flaminio. This construction would go on until 6 in the afternoon.... We contacted the reception immediatedly and asked to be moved to a more quiet room and after that, our stay was exceptional. We got a room on the 8th floor with view over the city. Fantastic!!!! The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was big and had makeup mirror with light, shower with very good pressure and luxurius amenities. There was evening turndown service where chocolate was handed out as well as the weather forecast for the next day. Nice to have a heads up. Room was quiet and no thin walls here, I just think we were really unlucky with the first room. The breakfast was really good, allthough it was not possible to get dark bread.

There is a lot of construction going on in the street and I asked for a room that didn't face the street and it was no problem. The young woman who checked us in also gave us a very good map and pointed out the location of the main sites. The deluxe room, while compact, had a big king-sized bed which was very comfortable, wired high-speed Internet, a big flat-screen TV with a lot of channels in English, a desk, a safe, robes, slippers and a gorgeous marble bathroom with a tub/shower combo. There was also a mini-bar if you wanted to partake. The room felt upscale, as did the rest of the hotel. They provided turn-down service each night and they left the next day's weather report and chocolate on the bed which was a nice touch. Other people have talked about the elevators - you take one to the first floor, then a teeny-tiny one which is around the corner to the upper floors. It isn't as big a deal as you think unless you try to cram more than 4 people in the second elevator. We didn't have any problems with it. The front desk staff were very accommodating and helped me get a museum reservation as well as arranging a transfer to the airport. We were always greeted warmly when we came and went. I felt the staff would have been happy to help their guest in any way they could. I can't say enough about how helpful and kind the staff are. The breakfast was wonderful with a huge assortment of pastries, cheeses, meats, eggs, sausage, fruit, cookies, juice, vegetables, cereals, pretty much anything you would want. The breakfast staff were constantly refilling things and will make you a cappacino if you ask. They have a happy hour at the very nice and comfortable bar area with 50% off drinks and a limited sandwich menu. It was a nice spot to spend an hour or so before going out at night. The location is a little out of the center of town, and I was a little worried we would be too far from everyting, but there is a metro stop right there, and a bus stop. As it turned out, we could pretty much walk everywhere. We had no problem walking to the Pantheon area (maybe 10-15 minutes) as well as the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain (10 minutes tops), but I think the colosseum would have been a little far but a there was a metro stop right across the street. We took the metro to Vatican City and then walked back and it took us about 30-45 enjoyable minutes. The best part of the hotel's location is that it is right next to Piazza del Popolo which was so much fun to hang out in and people watch as well as visit the two churches. We loved getting a gelato late at night and sitting in this piazza by the fountain. During the day there was always something going on there with street performers, musicians, dancers, etc. Also, Villa Borghese is just up a flight of stairs and a wonderful place to hang out on a Sunday. So I ended up loving the location and didn't mind at all that we weren't in the center of town. A one minute walk down the street are two very good, inexpensive, family run restaurants right across the street from each other. We had our best meals in Rome at these two restaurants.

The location is perfect , very close to the flaminio metro which is only 2 stops to the vatican one way and the other a couple of stops to the trevi fountain. Very close to all the shops and restaurants on via del corso and within walking distance of most of the major sites. There are a number of restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel . Orsetto which seemed to be a popular local haunt is almost opposite and served very reasonably priced piazza and pasta absolutely ideal for a budget night out or lunch. The staff at the river palace are the most helpful and friendly I have ever encountered, nothing was too much trouble and they really made us feel welcome in Rome. Breakfast in the hotel is absolutely excellent a huge variety of hot and cold items available absolutely beautiful pastries and fruit and all beautifully presented in the lovely breakfast room. Our room was a double deluxe and was very italian in style as is the hotel , beautiful wood panelling , lovely ornate ceilings , marble bathroom very warm and cosy in style . It was spotlessly clean as is the entire hotel, and was extremely comfortable. Room was very well equipped with all mod cons including a flat screen t.v. with full range of sky channels. There is also a very nice bar which has happy hour from 6 to 10pm every evening, half price drinks and sandwiches , lovely free bar snacks and again excellent service. The staff organised a limousine service to take us back to the airport which i would thoroughly reccommend . Our driver Alessandro was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and gave us a hassle free transfer back to the airport for \u20ac50 which was worth every penny. The train coming in cost us \u20ac22 euros and with the cost of a taxi from termini would only be about \u20ac18 cheaper, the limousine transfer is definitely the way to go. We were sorry we didnt organise to be collected by him on arrival which the hotel will organise for you. The river palace is a fab hotel and I would not hesitate to reccomend it to anyone travellling to Rome. My advice would be to book a delux room as some of the others seem to be a little on the small size according to some reviewers.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, fabulous service, wonderful breakfast\u201d", "Author": "toroma", "ReviewID": "UR59364111", "Content": "We arrived in Rome early morning and only had to wait a short time to get into our room.

While waiting for our room to be ready, the hotel manager gave us a tour of the first floor amenities and also showed us how to get to all of the major sites on a free (yet very detailed) map. They offered us a \"deluxe\" room for an extra 25 euro and showed us both rooms, but we opted to stick to our original booking. We did not feel pressured to take the larger room. The \"classic\" room was small, but it did have a queen-size bed that was quite comfortable. Besides the size, the room was excellent in almost every way. It was extremely clean and everything felt brand new. The 32\" LCD TV came with Sky TV and the shower had great water pressure. My only complaint would be that the shower water temperature was not stable (probably affected by other other guests using their bathrooms at the same time). The hotel has a \"happy hour\" from 6 to 10PM every day, which means half price drinks and sandwiches. They also put out a substantial amount of free food during this time. It was a welcome way to end a long day of touring to come back to the hotel and enjoy a perfectly mixed drink for about 3 euro. The lobby lounge was comfortable, although the furniture in the lounge and upper floor hallways did show some wear. The included breakfast buffet was bountiful and clean. There were a wide variety of options including eggs, hash browns, sausage, canadian bacon, cheeses, cold cuts, bread, and pastries. Drip coffee was free but you could order espresso. To top it all off, this hotel is in an excellent location, within walking distance to many major sites (very close to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps) and also near many excellent restaurants.

The room was very small (and that was a Delux!) but clean. We had a room overlooking the road / tram line (look to the right and you could see Piazza Popolo) but there was no rad noise to be heard in the room (3rd floor). The room was decorated in a very traditional style with fabric wallpaper, however because so much of the room is the same / similar colour (yellowish) it did feel a little claustrophobic. The bathroom was clean but poorly designed \u2013 the situation of the sink and the toilet made accessing the toilet a bit of a challenge. The shower was a joke \u2013 the shower head is located on the wall in the centre of the bath whereas the shower screen is located at the far end of the bath so water goes all over the bathroom. In our room the shower head would not stay up until my Husband fashioned a quick fix using the belt of a dressing gown provided by the hotels! The service in the hotel was great, and the lobby, bar etc beautifully decorated. However, other areas of the hotel could certainly do with a re-vamp (the corridor carpet / lifts etc). Upon check in we were given a very comprehensive map of Rome and the Receptionist took time to highlight all the major attractions (including telling us about the not so touristy areas, where food & drink was cheaper etc), and was more than happy to answer all our questions. We ended up using the hotel\u2019s map far more than the one we\u2019d brought with us! Breakfast is served in a small dining area \u2013 you may have to wait for a table. There was quite a large selection of food including cereal, fruit, pastries, cold meats and cooked. The quality of the cooked breakfast wasn\u2019t great but I was more than happy with fruit and pastries! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. We rated it on TA as 4* as our first impressions of the reception and bar area was that of a 4* hotel however we felt the rest of the hotel was more on par with that of 3*(in desperate need of some TLC in rooms/corridors and other public areas). The hotel is in a great location and allows you to walk to many major sites: Spanish Steps & Trevi Fountain (approx. 20mins), Pantheon (approx. 25 mins), Piazza Navona & Campo de\u2019fiori (approx 25 mins). It\u2019s a 2 minute walk to the nearest metro station to take you to the Vatican, Colosseum and more!", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stirling, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in a great location for sight-seeing\u201d", "Author": "gillymp", "ReviewID": "UR34625029", "Content": "We found this hotel using a combination of tripadviser and expedia, and it all seemed too good to be true - excellent reviews and a really decent rate for a city hotel.

When we checked in at about 10 AM, there were no Deluxe rooms ready, but they offered us immediate access to a Superior for 20 \u20ac more per night. I hadn\u2019t booked a Superior because I didn\u2019t think a few additional square feet of space were worth 20 \u20ac, but it\u2019s a different story when you arrive jet-lagged and grimy. We basically paid an extra $84 (20 \u20ac per night for three nights) just to get a shower right away. At the time, it seemed like a bargain! Just be aware, if you get a good deal, you might have to pay more if you are not willing to wait for your room class. The River Palace hotel facilities, staff, and room were all very, very nice. Not too small for a Rome hotel room, and every amenity you could ask for-- including a digital safe, Sky TV, thermostat-controlled air conditioning, and bathrobes. They even provided turn-down service with chocolates, weather forecast card, and a linen towel by the bed to step on. I wasn\u2019t fond of the \u201cmusk\u201d scent of the shampoo and conditioner, but they were good quality. The only issue we had was (ironically) our $84 shower. I would call it a \u201csprinkle\u201d rather than a \u201cshower\u201d. The water pressure was low; and even with the cold tap turned entirely off, the water was more warm than hot. The only other \"problem\" (if you can call it that!) was that the room was so quiet and the blackout shades so good, we overslept the first morning and missed our Galleria Borghese reservation. Free Internet in the lobby was a plus. The hotel breakfast was fabulous! Even better than last year\u2019s hotel (which was very good). In addition to the standard breads, cheeses, cold cuts, yogurt, cereals, muesli, milk, juices, and fruit, they also offered hot dishes such as scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon. All delicious. You could get a cappuccino with some effort to make a request, but their regular coffee was so good that I only bothered once. And their pastries were incredible! I still miss their hazelnut cookies, and the chocolate mini-pies with shortbread crusts.

In my experience, continental breakfast usually consist of a limited choice of breads and cheese, but the breakfast at the hotel was extensive, with a wide range of meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal, even sausages and bacon. There was also some amazing fresh cakes on offer. Location-wise, we couldn't have asked for more. Just a short walk was the Spanish steps, and all the main sights were an easy walk down the main street. The hotel also benefits from its proximity to the Villa Borghese, a lovely park which provides a bit of a break from the busy city, and is definately worth a visit. The hotel is only 2 minutes from the Flaminio metro station, which is only a few stops on the metro from Termini.

Bread would run out and it would have to be pointed out by several guests that it had and then you could expect to wait until the serving staff were ready to bring it out! Same went for crockery with cereal bowls often running out.

There was a small desk and if you pulled the chair out, there was literally no room to move around. I had one small carry on and was able to store it outside of the bathroom. Had I brought a bigger suitcase I would not have had enough room to put it anywhere. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very cozy. The room was very nice compared another hotel I stayed in. The bathroom was also very small. The European shower was so small and if you are a big person you probably would not be able to get through the doors. They only provide one big bath towel and one hand towel (not a plush towel, material is like the cloth napkin). They also do not provide a wash cloth. It has a hairdryer and the beauty products are very nice (Etro). It does not have an iron. The exterior of the hotel is under construction and when I first saw it I was very worried. I did not hear any construction going on the whole time I was there. The staff at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel offers free internet service which I appreciated. The only problem was one of them was always not working. The breakfast was very good. However, it served the same things day after day. Even though breakfast was a buffet I felt uncomfortable filling my plate or go for seconds because there was someone walking in/out of the dinning room/kitchen constantly. I did not enjoy my breakfast as much because of his/her presence. I understand they have to clean the tables or refill the food but I did not think they needed to be there every minute. There was always plenty of food and empty tables. There were 3 tables seated at the most the entire time I was there. In the evenings, a maid came around and passed out a piece of chocolate and the next days forecast. The last night I was there no one came to clean my room. I notified the lobby and was asked if I wanted it cleaned. Because I was so tired and it was so late, I did not care and all I wanted was a clean towel. One was brought up to my room immediately. I really liked the location. It is not in the center of everything, however, the Metro is 2 to 3 minutes away and there is also the tram. It takes less than 5 minutes to get to Piazza Del Popolo.

We chose all of our hotels based on reviews that we read on this website, so it is our duty to come online and at least write a short review. Tripadvisor was a Godsend, and we swear by it now. This hotel was almost like a renaissance themed museum. Marble everywhere, polished wood and trimmings, statues, busts, paintings etc. We stayed for three nights in the room that is one grade above standard (superb? Deluxe?), and we found that the room was somewhat small compared to some of the other hotels on our Eurotrip. My wife felt that the room itself was loud and overdone, since there was bright yellow everywhere. I was not bothered one way or the other. There was everything advertised: safe, LCD tv, tea and coffee etc. The toiletries, although of good quality (product of Milan I think, if that is synonymous with quality) were huge tubes of everything in similarly gaudy fluorescent greens, oranges and purples. The bathroom was a bit cramped, but everything seemed to be covered in either gold or marble, which compensated for the small space. The shower was in the bathtub, like so many hotels these days, so don\u2019t be surprised if everything gets wet. Oh, don\u2019t forget that the \u2018C\u2019 on the taps actually means that it is the HOT water: I learnt that the hard way. The breakfast was your standard buffet, with bread, cheese, butter, jam, cakes etc. Nothing special, but sufficient to fill your stomach. The service was excellent, in that our rooms were cleaned well, and the concierge/front desk was always very helpful in assisting us. This hotel redeems itself by its excellent location. All things Roman are but a short to one hour walk away. Whether it\u2019s the Steps, the Collisseum, the Palatine, the Vatican, the numerous obelisks etc etc, you are never far away. Failing that, the underground station is only two minutes walk anyway, and is well connected to literally any of the landmarks.

Hi Res restaurant for a very special occassion and Canova for a lovely, good quality reasonable pasta or pizza dinner with a nice wine. I prebooked Presto tours for our tour of the Vatican-worth every single penny. Ryan was fantastic and I think if we ad done the tour alone it would have been a sheer waste of money as we would have just wandered around the museaums randomly. At the colloseaum you will be approached by tyour guides, they all seam friendly, no pressure and we chose one who saud her boss did the tour and was English speaking, he did speak English but had such a strong accent (Italian I think) I really struggled to hear what he was saying. They then included a free tour of Palatine HIll-this was so boring! the place was amazing -full of history etc but the guy who did this tour talked as though he had swallowed a history text book- if it wasn't so cold, muddy and windy up on the site we would have fallen asleep! All in all, if you cant get a tour for this with Presto tours, do it yoursfelf and get an audio tour for about 4 euros.

We were very pleasantly surprised. *The front of house staff is pleasant and accommodating.

It rained a bit while we were there, and they just offered one to us to use while we were out and about. You just return it to the umbrella stand when you return. Nice touch... *We had dinner in the hotel restaurant two nights... expensive... but this is Rome and we are American's with a weak US Dollar. The pasta was excellent, and plentiful... but the meat course was lacking and expensive. I should have just had the pasta and it would have been sufficient. Some negatives... *Television could be better - I know, you are in Rome and not there to watch TV... but one can only watch CNN for so long. *In the Lounge - there was only one English-language newspaper... it would have been nice to have a few more copies available. *No washcloths... if you haven't heard already, bring your own washcloth to Italy if you use one... they are not generally available and they do not have them at The River Palace. Nearby... There is a family restaurant just down the road from the hotel that has fantastic pizza and salad... the best.

We asked them to book us a car and driver to take us on a private tour of the city, and we were very pleased with the company that they deal with. We had a charming and knowledgable guide show us the city in a comfortable luxury sedan. The two drawbacks that we encountered were that the air conditioning in our room didn't work very well and that our Pay TV didn't work.

The hotel is by the Piazza De Polopo and the start of the Ville de Corsa, the main shopping road. The hotel had changed a little since our last stay and have now added a lounge at the front of the hotel with free internet access on their computers and slightly changes the deco around the bar area. We flew into Da Vinci airport and took the train and metro to the hotel and this stops just a 2 minute walk from the hotel, although if you are a family of 4 or more its much cheaper, and quicker, to get a taxi if you book through the hotel before as it took us just under 2 hours to get from the airport to the hotel going via train (including waiting for train etc) where as taxi took less than 30 minutes! (and that was the fast train we got!). As we had arrived early at the hotel they kindly looked after our bags for us and put them in one of our rooms which was already ready for us. The hotel give you maps and information about the hotel and Rome and are very very nice. The rooms are small but you're not going to stay all the time in your room in Rome as they're is so much to do. The rooms are very nicely decorated with marble bathrooms and are very clean. You get a selection of shampoo, conditioner, bath foam, body lotion and little boxes of shoe shine, cotton buds etc. and they are very high quality. There is a mini bar with drinks ranging from 2 euros for a bottle of water, 3 euros for coke and more for the alcohol, there are also biscuits, nuts and other snacks from the mini bar to. At night, around 9pm in our rooms, the maids came in and turned our beds back, put a mat on the floor by our bed and left Godiva chocolates on our pillows (1 per room). This is a lovely touch, the only disappointing thing the second time we visited was that they no longer give you slippers and a dressing gown in your room but we did mention this to them and they made a note as they are always looking to improve on the hotel. The hotel had made a slight error with out room booking but were very apologetic and repaid us with a meal as instead of 2 double rooms they gave us a twin and 2 singles. The food in the hotel was nice for both breakfast and dinner. Breakfast is a selection of pastries, bread, cold meats and cheeses, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, cold boiled eggs, fruit, toast, cereal, yogurt etc... you name it, they virtually have it all! You can also pay extra for freshly squeezed orange juice (the orange which is on the side of the buffet is more of a squash) or for omelettes, eggs and other items on the menu but theres so much we didnt want anything else. The dinner was much better than the menu sounded... for example the chicken breast with mushrooms wrapped in pork cheek was just chicken breast with mushrooms wrapped in ham/pancetta. I would definitely go back there a 3rd time! The staff are so nice, the only bad thing... if you can call it that is not having the slippers and dressing gown, although you don't need it as the rooms were a comfortable temperature and they do have heating and aircon if you need it.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, comfortable good quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "NewDayTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR14765417", "Content": "We stayed at the River Palace hotel for four nights in September 2007.

My family had a very positive overall experience at the hotel despite one problem which almost ruined our stay from the start. Before going into my review of the hotel itself i will get this out the way. I booked our stay through laterooms.com as they had the most favourable rate. For the seven nights we stayed there we were offered the rack rate for three of these nights and a good rate for the remaining four. To cut a long story short, upon arrival we were informed by the receptionist that the full cost of our stay was wrong and that we had to pay 50 Euros extra for the extra bed for our child for these four nights. This amounted to an extra 200 Euros on top of the 1600 Euros we had paid for our stay. I booked our stay 3 months in advance and Laterooms were in good communication with me via email and i used this to ensure we would have a double bed for ourselves and a single for our child. I also made sure the rate was confirmed. After talking to Laterooms they told me that they had had a conversation with the hotel themselves to confirm this rate and that if i liked they could trace the recorded telephone conversation with the hotel to prove it. Anyway, i booked into the hotel on the Saturday and i was told by the receptionist that i would not be able to query the extra cost with the manager until he was back on duty on the Monday. This is fair enough, being a small hotel, although i would expect there to be a duty manager on at all times to deal with problems. It took me all of 5 minutes to show the manager my confirmation on Monday morning before i was assured that i would only be charged the rates i was originally quoted by Laterooms, so full credit for their customer service. If only i could have had it sorted out straight away i wouldn't have spent the first few days of my holiday thinking i had a large chunk of my spending money gone already. Why the hotel felt that i would have to pay the extra 50 euros for the four cheaper nights for a bed that was already in the room i have no idea. I'll put this down to bad communication between the hotel and their booking agent, laterooms. THE REVIEW Ok, now for the review.... The location of the hotel is excellent. Just at the top of the Piazza del Popollo (where much of Rome gathers to bring in the new year), superb links to most of the city via a Metro stop just 100m down the road. As previous reviewers have noted, many of the main attractions are literally minutes away. The Villa Borghese and the surrounding grounds just above the piazza are beautiful as well so be sure to check that out. The hotel itself was a little warm and i couldn\u2019t work out how to cool it down so i spent most nights with the window open. None of us could sleep properly until i realised this and as soon as we had a small breeze in the room we slept ok. The satellite television had two English speaking channels, eurosport (terrible picture) and CNN (American news!). Yes the rooms are little (even by European standards) but the decor more than made up for this, i have never stayed in a more beautifully decorated room before. Breakfast was reasonable, although if you are a bit towards the end of breakfast time you wont have as much choice. If you got there in good time you did have a good choice however so i would say that it was above average. I though the little bar, although very quiet was cute. The barman working here was very friendly and chatty. I didn't eat in the restaurant, we chose to eat out every night to try all the little restaurants dotted around Rome. All in all Rome was itself our favourite holiday ever. The River Palace managed to just live up to our high expectations despite starting our holiday off badly. Lastly i would like to say that if you book via a booking agent please call the hotel itself to check the rate is correct. There is nothing worse than arguing with the receptionist before you even get into your room.

The taxi charged us 65 euros and was a mercedes benz with a kind driver. Even when we got to the hotel so early they gave us the room, 802.

We did not tryed the restaurant because the day that we were about to eat inside it was closed, saturday. We payed 140 euros per night and I consider this quantity good for the service that we got.

The location is north of the city centre but ideally placed 100/150 metres from the underground and an easy 10/15 minutes walk to Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. The Vatican is 1Euro on the underground each way, only 2 stops. Would recommend the open top bus (110), there are a few companies that do this but this one you can hop on and off all day, runs 0830 to 2030, about 15euros each, and covers all the main attractions. You won,t see the Trevi Fountain or Spanish Steps from the bus as they are in areas with little traffic passing, however one of the stops is adjacent so easy to get off and walk to them. Just along from the hotel is the Piazza Do Poppolo, and from there 3 streets that run towards the centre of Rome, each street is lined with shops and restaurants. We found eating and drinking can be expensive unless you look around. Some restaurants will charge 25/30 euro for an average bottle of wine and 5-7 euros for a bottle of beer. If you look around you will find cafe/restaurants that charge a good deal less, a caraffe of house wine 6-10 euros and beer 3-4 euros, depends on you budget, we did both and the food was good all round. Taxi from Ciampino should be around 30/40 euros, the driver will start at about 50 euros, so you might need to barter. Cost us 40 euros.

It did have a great view of Rome though. The deluxe room was much bigger with a big bathroom and a nice tub. Overall this is a great hotel, however I didn't love it. A few things troubled me. 1) We arranged to have a car pick us up @ the airport through the hotel. The car never showed and when we complained at the hotel, they insisted that it was out fault. After some arguing, they agreed not to charge us. Ridiculous, as it was their fault. 2) Even though we had arranged for the upgrade before we checked in, they still assigned us to a standard room. We had to show them the email confirming the upgrade before they would move us. 3) The elevators in this hotel are crazy. You have to take an elevator to the 2nd floor and then you have to take another elevator to floors 2-8. The second elevator is tiny and can only get 4 people max in it. There was always a line waiting for the elevator. When we moved rooms, we moved to the second floor so we could just walk up and down the stairs. 4) Breakfast was okay, but one day we ate late and observed something odd. Breakfast closed at 10:30 and by 10:15 the staff was guarding the pastries. At exactly 10:30 they slammed the breakfast door shut and took all of the pastries for themselves, even though there were still guests in the breakfast room eating. 5) The front desk was useless when it came to tourist attractions. Thank goodness we had been to Rome before and had a blackberry with us! They gave us all the wrong times for attractions and a few times I had to tell them that there opening and closing days were incorrect. If you stay here, double check all of of their information. 6) The bar staff was rude. And this is the only place in all of Italy that Ihave been served a drink without so much as a peanut. The bartender looked put out at all times. 7) the hotel is loud. If you try to sleep past 9 you hear the room doors slamming every 10 minutes while the maids clean it. Annoying. All in all, it was a pleasant stay. There are lots of nice touches here - it is very close to the Spanish Steps. The Godiva turn down service and the welcoming chocolates were lovely. The bathroom amenities were nice. And for the money it was a great stay. It's just has some quirks that could be easily fixed.

The reason we did this was mainly because of the inclusion in the price of 1x transfer and a meal for 2 in the Hotel Restaurant. I had read that the Taxis operating between Ciampino and the City basically try to charge what they like if they think they can get away with it TIP. The local Government has passed ruling that the journey will be charged at no more than 30 Euros - tell the taxi driver that you know this and you will get no probs. The collection from Ciampino was problem free and the driver took on a bit of a detour around the interesting sights on the route to the hotel. The Hotel itself was a nice surprise and the photos on here dont really do it justice. The staff are without exception excellent although a little overrun at times in the Restaurant especially at breakfast time. The room we expected to get was an upgraded one from the Classic, to be honest I dont know if we actually got the upgrade as offered or not. On the first day / night we could not get the Air Con to blow warm so had to contact reception who sent a man who couldent fix it and so we were given a room change next day. All we had to do was to pack our cases and go about our daily routine as normal - when we got back they were in our new room. Now this room was laid out difrerently, was bigger and had a bath - which is part of the upgrade offer (our original room was shower only ?!?) Anyway the heating worked so we were happy. The Bar is pricey with 6 Euros for a local 0.33 beer and 7 Euros for Heineken. I know its a city and I know its a Hotel Bar but please dont try and convince me that beer costs that much. TIP. Make sure you confirm that the price list you are looking at is the same one as the barmans looking at - apparently the \"Computer\" which is responsible for updating the bar prices had been lazy and had not produced up to date price lists for the tables in the bar guest area ??! Hello - anyone at home here !!??? Also make sure if you need to drink Heineken, that you are given Heineken and not the Nastro Azzuro \"by mistake\" The restaurant is very well run and produces very good food. Unfortunately my wife is a Coeliac sufferer and once we had made this clear to the management they produced a Gluten Free 3 course meal for her without fuss. Breakfast can be a bit of a battle trying to avail yourself of all the usual things like plates, (always usefull and glasses (ditto) but once this hurdle is cleared its full steam ahead. The location is very good with all popular sights and amenities within 20 mins walk. The only complaint - and it is only minor is the TV setup. Its got too many foreign language channels to be any more than mildly interesting to English speakers. I mean how long can anyone listen to CNN without going stark raving bonkers. There is also Eurosport but again how much of minority sports can be suffered at a sitting. There are a number of pay to view film channels - but most of them you would not want you kids to watch. So a bit tedious mostly. Theres also a minibar which in our case simply served as a stand for the TV and could have been left out of the room amenities in favour of something more usefull. - Does anyone ever need a chocolate bar in a hurry in the middle of the night anyway - I dont know ?! Getting around was a bit puzzling at first as the day ticket we bought had \"Metrobus\" on it - OK is it for the Metro ? (underground) or the Bus ? (overground) - we were sent to 3 different Stops at the junction down from the Hotel before asking a local what it all meant. Shortly thereafter we were on the Metro on the way to our destination and the mystery was solved. Eating out - bear in mind if you sit outside it costs extra on top of the food price, and if you sit inside its less - simple as that ! Overall a very enjoyable experience, having read a great many reviews on this site for this holiday and most others, I have to say you get what you pay for mostly. Dont go with huge expectations and be reasonable regarding what you have paid for the holiday. Do your homework and in my experience it will pay great dividends. SUMMARY: We loved this Hotel and were surprised by the high standard of the whole deal. If you have paid for the Celebration package make sure that you get what they offer - in particular the rooms, they are all \"compact\" but some are more compact than others. TIP The rooms with BATHS are bigger. TIP If the Air Con isnt doing what its meant to - tell them immediately. TIP The rooms on the outside (street side) are fairly noisy (more so if on lower levels) The rooms on the inside (overlooking an internal patio area) are quieter. Neither option has any awe inspiring views. 8/10 for this Hotel - I would recommend it to a friend.

It is not so close to Termini station, but we thought it would be of advantage because the area near the train station is a bit dodgy. It took us 7 minutes by taxi to get to the hotel from the Termini station upon arrival, but when we were departing Rome, we just took the tube - the tube took like 10 minutes alltogether, the tube stop is just around the corner from the hotel. this was the 2 times we ever used public transport in the centre of Rome. We walked to all tourist attractions from the hotel - Vatican is about 20 minutes walk, Coliseum 20 minutes walk, too. The main shopping and dining area is 5 minutes walk (walk out of the front door, go right 50 metres, cross the road, cross the square after that and here you are! Easy and convenient! The receptionists in the hotel are superb - very friendy and helpful - full marks to them! The hotel exterior at first got us slightly worried.... until we entered the building. I can say that most buildings in central Rome look, let's say, not to the best of the conditions, grafitti is popular almost everywhere but this is kind of standard, I guess. Inside of the hotel is very clean, tidy, and beautiful. Yes, Americans may think that the rooms are tiny, but you have to get used to that - it is Europe and similar situation is in most cities.

Look for two yellow awnings as you're walking down via Flaminia - one of the awnings has a backwards \"R\" and a \"P\" on it - that's the hotel.

I know people say \"you don't go to Rome for good hotels\" but I just love coming back to a nice room after a long day out. When we arrived everything looked fine, it was very clean, easy to get to (metro just around the corner) and receptionist was friendly on arrival. We had booked a standard room which was IMPOSSIBLY small. I have stayed in some small rooms before, probably of the same size as this but they looked bright and welcoming whereas this was dull and stuffy.

We're not ones to complain usually but the heat in the room was just unbearable. We complained and they did various things like send someone to clean the air con filters etc etc and we ended up 2 nights in that room out of our 3. We didn't sleep well for those 2 nights and were shattered during the following days, this ruined our break a bit. I must say at this stage, the reception staff were all very nice except for 1 who was down right rude to us on several occasions. He is that bald guy called Georgio and he has no business in the hospitality industry. We were finally moved for our 3rd night to a room with working air conditioning but only after we timed our next complaint to when Georgio wasn't on shift. He was totally useless, rude and looked down his nose at us the entire time. The room we moved to was lovely and cool and on the 1st floor instead of the 7th (1st to 7th floor lift is an experience not to be missed). Pros: breakfast friendly reception staff excl. Georgio nice bar/sitting area good location (if you only have a couple of days and are trying to see-it-all, this may be slightly too north for things like the Colosseum and Forum, if you have time it's perfect. Cons: DON'T stay in this hotel unless you are getting a deluxe room or suite, the standard rooms are depressingly tiny. took us 2 days and countless complaints to get moved they switch air con off in the winter (if you get a hot period it's very uncomfortable) although that's fairly standard in Rome Georgio Getting a hotel in Rome is a bit of a minefield but all we needed was a cool clean room to sleep for the 3 nights.

We only disliked one thing. The hotel was not very close to any major sights, so you had to take the subway to get to everything. This was not a problem during the day, but it was a problem in the evening. The subway closed down each night around 9 PM (the official Rome subway signs say that it is open until 10, but we NEVER found a subway stop open later than 9 PM). So, each evening, we had quite a long walk to get back to the hotel. This wasn't a huge problem for us, but other people might have a problem with this.

Picked this hotel because most of the reviews on Trip Advisor were positive so reckoned it should be ok. Was not wrong. It was our honeymoon and when we arrived at the hotel, they had given us an upgrade to a deluxe room free of charge. When we got to the room a box of chocs and a welcome message was waiting. We stayed in Room 204 which overlooked the courtyard. It was lovely and quiet. The lifts are rather small but as we were on the second floor we usually walked up the stairs. Breakfast was good, with the usual choice for continental. I wouldn't describe the juice as 'fresh' as we know it in the UK, it tasted more like the reconstituted juice you can get, but it was certainly drinkable. Coffee was good. Waiters were very helpful and friendly as were all the staff in the hotel. The room although fairly small (not a problem to us as we were out most of the day sightseeing anyway) was spotlessly clean. Sheets were changed every day (I've been to quite a few 4* hotels over the years and believe me, not many change the sheets every day!). Would definitely recommend this hotel as we felt it was excellent value for money (without the free upgrade). Should mention that the Pizzeria Restaurant a few doors down from the hotel (on the same side) also gave excellent value for money if you like typical italian food (ie, pizza, pasta, antipasta etc). We ate there most nights. Usual cost of a two course meal for two with a bottle of wine was around 20-25 euros. Only warning I would give is, if you decide to get a taxi from the airport to the hotel, make sure you know what you will be charged. As it was our honeymoon we decided we would take a taxi rather than the shuttle bus. Big mistake. The taxi cost us 90 euros (47 euros on the meter when we stopped), charge 90 because we had 2 small suitcases with us!!! Also, look out for people at the Spanish Steps who catch you unawares (well, naive gullible people like us!), and charge 50 euros for a piece of string. Yes, my new husband fell for it - I couldn't believe it. Would rather have given the money to the beggars on the street of Rome (and there are lots of them)! Well, that's our review.

They were also anxious to know if there was anything they could do to make future hotel stays more enjoyable. We had a Deluxe room. The room was a bit small, but plenty big enough for two people. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. The bathroom was small and the lightting was a bit dim (hotels should really ask women to help them with bathroom lighting) but the bathroom was clean and beautiful with floor to ceiling marble. The room included a free safe and turn down service at night with Godiva chocolates. The elevator from the 1st floor was extremely small and the air conditioning never quite cooled the room as much as I would have liked - but I realize that both of these things are just the quirks you live with when staying in older buildings.

The dinner at Ziro was AMAZING. Asia was the perfect host for our dinner and the chef was fabulous - the food not only tasted divine, but the presentation was beautiful. The breakfasts were also delicious with a variety of meats, cheeses, pasteries, etc. The location of the hotel was good for us. It is not in the center of Rome (so it was very quiet), but it was very close to the Piazza Del Popolo and the Metro stop and bus stops were also only a couple of blocks away so we were able to get anywhere in the city very quickly. The walk from the hotel down Corso (major shopping) to the Colloseum was also very doable - if you like to walk. We ate a fabulous restaurant our last night in Rome. I can't remember the name of it, but it was recommended by the front desk and it was easy walking distance from the hotel on Rippeta (ask them and they will know).

The bathroom was spacious and shower worked perfectly. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed the breakfasts, they were continental, with plenty to choose from. I would recommend you contact the hotel before you stay to arrange airport transfers, (which they will gladly do), we got a taxi outside the airports and he charged us 65 euros, on the way he was trying to tell us about the sites in broken english and we felt he was doing this just so he could charge us extra at the end. After an early get up and plane journey I just wanted to sit back and relax and take in the sites not spend the journey trying to guess at what he was saying. Anyway, the hotel arranged a private mercades car for our return journey for 60 euros which was air conditioned and much more comfortable. We found it cheap to eat the pasta and pizza in Rome, but the drinks were extremely expensive, a medium beer and coke cost on average 10 euros. Some bottles of wine are quite reasonable though much to my boyfriends' delight!!

I was worried about it being too far out of the city center but in reality it is very easy to move around the city from this location if you are willing to use the underground rail or walk. If your goal is the Vatican it is perfect using the underground. It is in more of a neighborhood than other locations and I like that. It felt safe and there are great little restaurants on the same street. As for the actual hotel. It was a nice room with all the comforts of home, minus a large shower. We were in a room on the second floor and our shower was tiny, but we are both small people so it made us no matter. The water pressure was fantastic. We did have a bit of trouble with hot water for a whole day, but they fixed it and all was well. It was aggravating for the day it happen, but in hindsight it was no big deal.

The continental buffet breakfast featured plenty of choice and was very very good. Overall, our lasting impressions of the hotel are the attention to detail, efficient and friendly staff and cleanliness of all rooms and public areas. The hotel situated about 100 yards from Piazza del Popolo, makes it a walkable location to most if not all of the major attractions. We are both in our late 50s and we did walk everywhere; St Peters, the Coliseum, Piazza Navona, etc. For those less ambulatory, the metro system and local buses to most attractions are at Piazzale Flaminia, no more than a 2 minute walk. For a view of the rooftops of Rome walk up to Pincio - ask the staff for directions - about 10 minutes from the hotel. You will then be in the gardens of the Villa Borghese a lovely place for a stroll. We would certainly recommend this hotel to everyone. As said at the start of the review, the only (minor) negative was the room size but we did stay in a standard room, so perhaps a superior room would provide more space. One other piece of advice would be to use the limo service booked via the hotel for the return trip to the airport especially if like us you have to travel back to the airport during the evening rush hour (personally, I think Rome's rush hour lasts all day).

Also another little tip, their are loads of men trying to sell roses and stupid buzzing toys. They usually want 2 euro for a rose, but we kept haggling with them and got 2 roses for a euro!!!. We booked our flights with Ryan Air and hotel separate with Thomson and got a good deal. If you book a transfer with Ryan air it will cost 10euro single. But we organised a transfer with [----]..This was sheer luxury the driver waited in arrivals in a suit and then took us to a brand new e class mercedes. We were then given a 2 hour tour of all the sights of rome, we saw the vatican, pantheon,trevi fountain, spanish steps, colloseum,eternal flame, forum everything !! He even showed us this amazing keyhole at the malta embassy where you can see the vatican, rome and malta. Amazing!. He picked us up at 11.15 and dropped us off at the hotel at 1400. Perfect, and was 80 euro. Do it !!! Finally I couldnt not mention the lift at this hotel!!. It was tiny!!!. The 4 of us could get in it but it kept jolting!!, very amusing after a few cocktails.!!", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel hindered by small bedrooms and poor lift system\u201d", "Author": "AndrewCov", "ReviewID": "UR6856210", "Content": "We just spent three nights at the River Palace hotel near Piazza del Popolo.

Anyway, this was a romantic city break and both the city and hotel exceeded my estimations. The hotel is located to the nort of the city 2mins walk from the nearest metro station and tram stop. It also happens to be 2 mins from the Piazza de Popollo and Villa Borgeuese and its grounds. The area is reletively quiet so far enough from the husstle and bussle of the city centre but just a stroll from all the Roman ruins and unbelievable sites you can possibly take in. (and Rome is more blessed than most in that respect). The Hotel itself is welcoming, as is its staff who all speak near perfect english. Our room, on the 7th floor was as other reviews state 'small' but ample room enough for 2 adults sharing... it is what you expect of a european hotel room and does have all the required fixtures and fittings. Breakfast is served 'continental' style and there is ample choice. The restaurant can be found on the first floor and serves as the breakfast room and a la carte restaurant of an evening. The bar area is comfortable and relaxing, the waiters and staff dote on your every wish. The hotel does opperate a tab system payable on check out!! We were delivered to and from the airport by the hotel's own limousine service....well it was a mercedes people carrier but took the strain off finding transportation, which is daunting in a new city. Maps and advice were more than helpful. The restaurant served up food which in my opinion is unrivalled in all of Rome.... im no expert but i have never tasted a 6 course meal like it and the wine recommended was just fantastic. My hat really does go off to the chef, it must be the best kept secret in all of Italy....not cheap, the meal cost 130euro for 2, including a bottle of wine and is truly magnifico!! chocolates, a weather report on a nightly basis and a friendly smile and bonjourno everytime you go past the reception adds a final dimention to the hotel. The only down sides to this hotel was the coffee/tea making facilities in the rooms (or ours anyway)...there are none. Also, the rooms are a little warm even in Feb!!!

The hotel is beautiful and the service is impeccable. The decoration of the hptel and the rooms are beautiful and although some reviewers have suggested that the rooms are too small we did not think this a problem at all! Rome is such a beautiful city that you will not spend the majority of your stay in your room anyway but the room size is fine anyway! The rooms were beautfully cleaned everyday and turned down each evening with Godiva chocolates and the next day's weather forecast which was a lovely touch! All of the hotel staff are extremely helpful and are very knowledgeble about Rome - they recommended a great restaurant called Gusto! We did not eat in the hotel restaurant for dinner but it has had some great reviews and the breakfast was lovely. We took the Leonardo Express from the airport to Termini and then the hotel is three stops on the metro to Termini. The metro was very busy on the Friday when we arrived so if you have lots of bags you might consider getting a taxi although it is advisable to prebook. That being said, our return journey to the airport on the Monday was stress free and so if you want to save some money then this is an easy option! Rome itself is a wonderful city with so much to see and do! Visit all the typical tourists sights as nothing can prepare you for seeing them in the flesh! We walked everywhere using the map the hotel provided and, although tiring, it meant we saw so much - there are ruins and churches in every street! Make sure you take a tour of the Colloseum so that you experience what really went on and where, there are English tour guides waiting outside and using one of these also means you get to jump the queue! We visited the Vatican on Sunday which means at 12 the Pope makes his weekly address which is an amazing sight to see! The queue for the Vatican museums was, unfortunately, too long and we did not get to see the Sistine Chapel. This was because the chapel is only open on certain days and is free on the last Sunday of the month making it an extremely popular day so if you are travelling on this day bear this in mind! If you are a fan of football a visit to Rome's Olympic Stadium where Roma and Lazio play will be an experience! Italians are extremely passionate about the game and this makes for a true experience of Italian life! I would recommend Lonely Planet as this gives advice about all of Rome's attractions!

Standard of accommodation: The public rooms, bedrooms and bathrooms are all very well presented, modern, clean and comfortable. Classy decoration and furnishings throughout with comfortable beds and marble bathrooms. However the bedrooms are small, so not ideal for people with lots of luggage, for those who plan to spend lots of time in their room or for romantic breaks. If you are tall or well built you may find the shower cubicle small, so ask for a bathroom with a tub. If you find street noise a problem ask for a room at the rear of the hotel, these are very quiet. Standard of service: The staff were very efficient and helpful; when I had a problem they acted immediately. Breakfast was good. Twice daily maid service. Overall I think this is a good value hotel for the standard of accommodation and service on offer and the location. Location and public transport: Located on a mainly residential street in an upmarket area very close to the Flaminio public transport interchange just outside the old city gates at the top end of the Corso. Flaminio metro station provides direct access to Termini railway station (connections for the Fuimicino airport train) as well as Barberini (Via Veneto), Repubblica (shops on Via Nazionale) and S. Giovanni (Basilica). Metro Line A shuts at 9pm due to long-term engineering work, so plan your route back if you are going to be out late. Buy public transport tickets in advance too, this saves time and you can just jump on a bus if you get tired of walking. The No. 95 bus runs quite frequently to the Via Veneto, Piazza Barberini and the lower part of the Corso. Some walking is required to reach Piazza Navona and the area around the Pantheon (approx 15-20mins brisk walk) where the choice of restaurants is greatest, but the upper end of the Corso (shops) and the Spanish Steps are both very easy to reach on foot.

The roads are very busy!!! and the journey was more than half an hour - I didn't fancy wasting time finding buses or the right underground .If you have spare pennies I'd book a taxi. HOTEL: The hotel itself was fantastic. It was decorated beautifully. The rooms were not huge, but are definately not small. The bathrooms were gorgeous , all marble - very luxurious - just give the hot water a few minutes to come through in the shower. The reception staff spoke impeccable english although we did try out a bit of our italian on them! They can recommend trips/ restaurants and their advice is very honest. ATTRACTIONS: The hotel was in a fantastic location. It takes a while to find your bearings but follow the map the receptionist gives you and you wont go wrong. We are quite fit I guess, but the walk to every attraction was never more than 30 mins away. Give yourself enough time to see everything though - the Vatican and sistine chapel ( this is INSIDE the museum) took us all day and we went on a Tuesday which was apparantly a good day to go . On a Wednesday the Pope does his service to the people in the square which is mega busy ( but you can pre book tickets online if you want to go to this ) We did a Rome by night coach trip which took about 2 /3 hours but was well worth it ( about 35 euros each) It gives you a quick look at everything then you can find your way back there the next day. The trevi fountain was gorgeous by night - you have to go . EATING OUT: The receptionist recommended us to eat in their own restaurant the first night- which we did - but wondered if it would be any good ( you know what hotel food is like over here sometimes). Boy were we glad we ate in the hotel - the food was the best we have ever had and we do like going out for dinner. The waiting staff were amazing , as was the wine they recommended to go with the meal. We ate like kings and for only \u00a3100 euros with wine- well spent money if you enjoy a decent meal.

While the food, drink and service were excellent and beyond criticism I think that 90 euros for a main course, a dessert and a glass of wine each to be a little excessive. 9 euros for a coffee and a lager also seemed on the steep side. There are so many places to eat around the piazza (and a really nice Pizzeria at the bottom of the street from the hotel) that we didn't need to eat in the hotel restaraunt after that The rooms are immaculate, although small, but if that becomes a holiday ruining issue, then you're probably focusing on the wrong things and you should get out more... you are in rome after all! We found that all the sites are within walking distance (Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Venezia, Spanish Steps, Colosseum, Forum, Piazza Navona, Castel S. Angelo, Vatican) and also the shopping down the Via Del Corso. Although our feet ached at the end of each day we managed to get around all these places in 2 full days at a relaxed pace. There is the Flaminio metro station near the hotel, but we never needed to use it. PS if you fly using BA use the online check in - it saves a lot of time and queuing at the airport. For the flight back you can also check in online - Handily there is an internet cafe opposite the River Palace hotel So, in summation, we both had a really wonderful few days in Rome, we were very lucky with the weather for mid october and I would recommend the river palace as a really nice place to stay for all the important reasons", "Date": "October 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLoved the River Palace\u201d", "Author": "walterlazymouse", "ReviewID": "UR5931958", "Content": "It was our first trip to Rome and we picked The River Palace because it seemed to have good reveiws on this site.

I booked their Suite Borghese, with a roof terrace, and in the few weeks before our trip emailed them via their website to let them know we were on our honey moon. I can put my hand on my heart and say that both my wife and I were amazed at our stay. The suite was beautifully decorated and well appointed, the hotel staff were the most courteous I have ever come across and the service they offered was first class. Without asking they had laid on fruit and champagne for our arrival. I had also booked their transfer service to pick us up from the airport. It cost 60 euros and was worth every penny. I for one would not want to carry my bags around the public transport system of an unfamiliar city, their car was fantastic and made the journey trouble free. It was so good we used it to get back to the airport at the end of our stay. Their restaurant had just employed a new executive chef, and we dined there the night after the opening. The food was exquisite, and the service, once again was unbeatable. I had read a few reviews of the hotel on this site prior to leaving, and had become concerned about the issue of small rooms which seems to crop up once in a while. Let me put this issue to bed. The last comparable hotel room I stayed in was at the Barclay Intercontinental in New York. The room in New York was bigger. However, hotel rooms in America are, in my experience generally larger than anywhere else I have been, and the room at the River Palace was certainly big enough for us. It is just something you have to accept, that in Europe, especially in old cities hotels will be smaller than the purpose built monoliths elsewhere. The Hotel is situated just north of the Piazza Del Popolo, on the main route through the city, 30 minutes walk from the Vatican and about 40 minutes from the coliseum, we went everywhere on foot, and did so at an unhurried pace always aware that our hotel was well situated within easy walking distance of the furthest attractions we wanted to see.

The main bonus of this was the fact that someone took the trouble to come to our room every evening to pull the curtains for us and leave us a mini box of godiva choccies on our bed - yum! Staff couldn't be more helpful, giving us directions, restaurant recommendations, maps - nothing was too much trouble for these people. The location is literally a minutes walk from the metro and if you are happy to use this to get around, you will save yourself a fair few euros. An example of this is when we left our coach from the hotel at Termni station, we immediately did the tourist thing and hailed a cab. This short journey to the hotel cost us 28 euros. The return journey to the same point via the metro cost us 2 euros!!! Be brave, its easy to use and much much cleaner than London underground. If I had to find a down-side to this hotel then I would go for the room service. The food is great, but its pricey and, on-top of it already being pricey, you are charged an 8 euro supplement.

It took us most of the first day to get there as there was a Taxi strike so we had to get a (very hot) bus from the airport which dropped us at Termini Station. From there we could of got the metro but they looked a little scarey so we decided to walk it! (mistake). It was extremely hot and alot further than we thought. However when we finally got there we were pleasently suprised. The lobby was very luxurious and the staff very helpful! as other people have mentioned the hotel is set out very strangely at not good for the disabled as the lifts are very small. The rooms were very nice, we stayed in a standard room and yes they are tiny but to be honest we didn't spend too much time in the rooms anyway. They were very well decorated and the bathroom was really lfancy! they were very quite and the beds were comfy. My only complaint about the room was the minibar was very expensive! There was a turn down service on a night, they left choc's and tomorrows weather forcast on your bed (nice touch) The breakfast left a bit to be desired but that didn't spoil it. The hotel bar was very expensive and closed before advertised (I would avoid it to be honest) again no big deal, there are more than enough places to drink. We were there for the world cup which was a brilliant night, we found some lovely bars and restaurants. Also. it wasn't as expensive as we'd been lead to believe. About what you'd expect to pay in any capital city. We got a taxi back to the airport arranged by the hotel. It was a nice service but be warned it was very expensive! Just a couple of things about Rome you need to know *Be careful on the roads, they are absolutely bonkers. They don't stop at the zebra's unless you walk out in front of them and then they just go around you! *The queue's for the colloseum and St Peter's are very long expect to be there for a good hour. Also, if you go to st Peter's remember to wear sensible clothing because it's so beautiful and it would be a shame to stand in a queue for an hour only to realise they won't let you in because your shoulders aren't covered and you miss out! *Don't go in July or August if you don't like the heat because it's very hot! (30 degrees plus) In a nutshell, we had a fab time in Rome and we would definately go back to the River Palace. If you have any questions please feel free to email me!

The lift to the first floor would fit 4,but then any floor higher, the second lift would only fit two and therefore I'd not advise anyone with claustrophobia stayed here -the rooms included, not just the lift. Our room was clean and sumtously decorated, however unless you walked over the bed to get the bathroom, or showered and dressed whilst your partner was asleep there was no space whatsoever! The bathroom was nearly as big as the bedroom. Although on the good side there was a turndown service nightly with Godiva chocs,weather forcast and fresh towells etc, and sweets and chocs in the lobby bar area, the rest was disappointing. At breakfast there were only approx 8 tables, so if there was a rush you may be waiting a long while or miss out. The drinks were as expected, terribly over-priced and the bar shut beofre the stated time every night, even for us residents..! Access to stairs was only available when maids were cleaning as they must have had the keys, The doors were not able to be opened from your side, so the lift down for a night out could take 20 mins if everybody left at once...

It all adds to the atmosphere. Location was excellent and we walked everywhere, Rome is so beautiful why spend your time on an underground and miss all the sights. You could easily walk to the Vatican in 20/25 minutes/Spanish Steps 10 minutes. At the Coliseum we picked up an English speaking guide who did a tour and would recommend doing this (email me if you need their name - I can't remember it, but have the brochure at home) as they also did a tour of Ancient Rome and the next day of the Vatican. It was very informative and we got a real insight into these places rather than walking around with a guide book. highly recommended. Food excellent - you can eat as expensive or cheap as you want. In the streets past Piazza Poppolo you can eat reasonably with 2 courses/beer for about 50 euros per couple. If you just want pizza and beer even cheaper.
