{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Deserves a 2nd chance I stayed at this new hotel in December 2008, only a few days after they opened for business. Being such a new hotel, I had the pleasure of being their only guest for 3 nights, but was also fortunate to be the first to try most hotel services - which apparently were never tested before...The hotel is perfectly located 2 blocks from the Zocalo - the main square of the old city and where many tourist attractions are (as well as excellent transportation options). It's an old, remodeled building, which feels like any other Hampton Inn I've ever been to. Other than the hot dishes at breakfast (which are Mexican dishes and not the regular Hampton Inn eggs), everything feels just like any Hampton in the US. The hotel staff is extremely friendly, and most of them speak good English. They all went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable and to fix every problem that I ran into. Unfortunately - they had many problems to fix: Although they promised me that the business center is operating - when I tried to use it, I discovered that the room had no electricity; when this was fixed - the PC had no mouse attached to it, and when they brought a mouse - the PC had no Internet and the printer was not working. Later that day, however, they brought a laptop and a printer to my room for my use for the remainder of my stay; I asked them if guest laundry was available and they said that it was, but when I needed to use it - they had no washing powder available (but they did send someone to a nearby shop after an hour to buy some, and provided it for free); On one of the days the Wireless Internet was not working and they failed to fix it (but they did let me use the hotel PC in their office for a few hours to access the Internet); and on one of the days, I had no hot water in the room (the hotel manager sent me later a personal apology note and a box of candy). I must note that in all the above incidences, everyone was extremely apologetic and nice, and they all did whatever they could to help. They also credited me for 2 of the 3 nights because of these problems (Hampton do have a 100% satisfaction guarantee, but I didn't have to ask for it - they offered themselves to give me these nights for free). Overall it felt like the hotel was in a running-in period, but without announcing it as such and without doing any verification, before opening for business, that all services actually work. On the other hand, with such a friendly and helpful staff, I\u9225\u6a93 sure that if/when they resolve their problems \u9225?staying there will be a great experience.", "Date": "Dec 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR800830984", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "turiduki"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d1147625-r22968082-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Mexico_City_Centro_Historico-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "1147625", "Price": "$116"}}
