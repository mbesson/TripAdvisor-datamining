We stayed in one of the slightly more expensive Park rooms which overlook the courtyard at the back of the hotel. The extra cost proved to be well worthwhile as the room was wonderfully peaceful - had absolutely no problems getting to sleep. Excellent buffet breakfast each morning amongst what appeared to be a largely German clientele. Praise also for the staff at the reception desk who proved to be very helpful. The only thing I would add is that I'd avoid walking around the park (Kleine Tiergarten) directly opposite the Hotel as it seems to have become a bit of a hangout for local drunks. If you're looking for an evening stroll, you'd do better IMO to head south towards the river.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "pikesteve", "ReviewID": "UR98935227", "Content": "I stayed at the golden tulip hotel whilst visiting Berlin on a business trip. The hotel is a little dated but clean and comfortable. The room was of a good standard, clean and had everything I needed including a balcony but I didnt get to use it because it was -10. The reception staff were very helpful, the breakfast buffet was nice and the restaurant itself was modern. However it didn't have a bar! As for the location it was about a 10 minute taxi from tegal airport which cost about 15 euros. There are a few restaurants near by and a couple of bars. I chose this because of the proximity to the our company office in Berlin. Unfortunately I didn't get to see much else.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cOK hotel, poor location\u201d", "Author": "HicketyJim", "ReviewID": "UR86389322", "Content": "The hotel in itself was fine, every thing average and friendly helpful staff. Downside was the immediate location - in a very run down area. Not much to see, do or explore in the vicinity. Some great Turkish take-aways but apart from that not much else. That said the public transport connections were good and it was close to the main park and a 20 minute walk from the Reichstag. Can't help feeling we could have gotten better for the same price in a more 'happening' area.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, convenient\u201d", "Author": "mlin32", "ReviewID": "UR31344055", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location; a couple stops to the city centre and accessible by direct bus line TXL from Tegel Airport or the Hauptbahnhof.
