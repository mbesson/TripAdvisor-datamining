After a grueling legal battle, it is now back in the hands of its original, charismatic German owners. These people have lived and breathed Playa del Carmen for over 15 years and have reclaimed Hotel Colibri to bring spirit and personality back into the haven. The location is right if you are there to experience the eclectic and vivacious destination that is Playa del Carmen. On the beach, humble, convenient, affordable and FRIENDLY.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and price\u201d", "Author": "Bobbie B", "ReviewID": "UR123711762", "Content": "We stayed at the Colibri May, 2011 and loved being able to walk right out the front onto the beach!! The rooms were clean, brightly painted, air conditioned and even had small refrigerators in them. Loved being able to wake up each morning and lay in the hammock on the balcony and read so that I did not bother my husband still sleeping in a dark room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Everyone always seemed happy to do their jobs. We are going back again to Playa this May and we will be staying there again.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cLove the Colibri\u201d", "Author": "Gracie99", "ReviewID": "UR117543431", "Content": "We have stayed there a few times over the years. It's the best deal on the beach! Nothing fancy, but the location is wonderful, the staff is helpful, and it's clean and comfortable. It's right next to what used to be the last \"shacks on the beach\" type of accomadation in Playa and is now a pretty big condo! I asked Jose at Colibri and he said the developer wanted to buy the Colibri too, but the owner wouldn't budge-good for him, and for especially for us!!!", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muskego, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and inexpensive\u201d", "Author": "akamel", "ReviewID": "UR103064990", "Content": "Great location..on the beach and within walking distance of restaurants and night life.

It looked a little dissapointing at first compared to the Hacienda San Miguel we stayed at in Cozumel for the rest of our vacation. The value is not that great, it is a little expensive and I wished we would have stayed up a half a block at the Kinbe. The cleanliness of the room was good (room 7), but the bathroom was questionable enough for me to wear my sandals in the shower with me. The shower ended up being good though with very good water pressure. The room itself is pretty good sized with good storage, the bathroom is tiny. But the view is great since it's right on the beach. There was also a little porch outside the room with a hammock set up. Overall a decent place to stay, but we'll probably stay somewhere else next time.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel and great Dive Center with amazing staff\u201d", "Author": "DiveMex", "ReviewID": "UR33897637", "Content": "I stayed here in May/June whilst I was doing my diving Instructor Development Course, IDC. The Hotel Colibri has spacious rooms, is very clean, has a/c in every room and is right by the beach in the middle of where all the action is. It has a great small hotel charm that you don't get with the huge mega-resort complexes near here. Phocea, the dive center attached to the hotel, is a wonderfully run center with friendly and very knowledgeable staff. They have their own boat and do dive trips all over the local area as well as Cozumel. They also do dive trips in the cenotes and you can snorkel with the whalesharks (which is an amazing experience). I highly recommend Hotel Colibri and its Dive Center, Phocea, for everyone!", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Colibri", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d274061-Reviews-Hotel_Colibri-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$70 - $156*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Ave 1a Nte Entre Calle 10 Y 12</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "274061", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7c/87/7c87214665ad228fed4bd47f41b396261large.jpg"}}
