{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fantastic !! Of all the hotels I have stayed at in Sydney this is the best for location, service and value for money. The hotel has recently been refurbished and what a wonderful result has been acheived. Its a shame the pool wasn't upgraded as well or at least a fresh paint would help modernize it.My room was very clean and more than comfortable. I found all the staff at the hotel very friendly and helpful, nothing was a problem, The hotel has a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, I Iook forward to my next stay !!", "Date": "Mar 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR182293061", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "WJH40"}, {"Content": "Everything was OK OK is the only word todescribe this hotel. It was relatively cheap, with free parking (which is a big plus in Sydney), and looks quite nice with the new renovations, but is nothing to write home about.When I arrived my booking had been stuffed up  since the hotel was full they said someone would be booted. They were REALLY nice about it, but did say it happens quite a bit. Otherwise it's quite good, but I prefered the Urban which is just down the road for a similar price.", "Date": "Mar 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR646538566", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "trav3la"}, {"Content": "Internet Price Extortionate I have one purpose in this review: to strongly discourage anyone from supporting a hotel such as this that charges a whopping AU$126 for internet access for a week.I personally find it abhorrent that Sydney hotels, in particular, feel they can charge between AU$15 and AU$30 a day for internet access. It's not on, it's cheeky, and it's extortion. (For the price of a AU$90/month internet connection the hotel manages to make a profit of maybe $500+/month from each room - how can this be justified??)So there you have it: if you want to use the internet, forget this hotel, it's not worth it.There were other problems, too. I used the swimming pool one afternoon, and not only did it have a lot of surface debris (from trees) but there were used cigarette butts - I pulled two out of the water before I became disturbed enough to get out and not return.About half the free-to-air television channels were so fuzzy as to be almost unwatchable.Was anything okay about the hotel? The location wasn't bad, a short drive from Chatswood and Artarmon railway station. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean and functional. A snack machine downstairs was useful if not a little pricey. The room had air conditioning which is an essential during summer in Sydney.If this hotel wants to get its act together on the internet it needs to seriously consider making the internet free, or at least try and get the cost down to no more than AU$5/day.", "Date": "Mar 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR472222397", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "oceaniaguy"}, {"Content": "What a difference....A+++ My company has an office closeby and have been using this site for a number of years. The property changed hands over a year ago and Punt Hill has spent alot of time and money improving the place and wow all I can say is it looks like a brand new hotel... It is hardly recongnisable!! Gone is the drab  dull past and it has been replaced with modern, stylish, warm and inviting interior ... Had a meal in the new restaurant and it was nice, simple and very delicious. Staff are very friendly and attentive. I will definately stay here again as it is a really comfortable and cool place to stay!! Well done Punt Hill!!!", "Date": "Aug 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR292946325", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pedre_veloce"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d610612-r14394458-Punt_Hill_North_Shore-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "610612", "Price": "$113"}}
