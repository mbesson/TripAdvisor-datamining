And as anyone else in our business would tell you, nobody is more critical of a hotel's operations, cleanliness and service, than ourselves. Well, there is a reason this hotel is rated #1 in the area on Tripadvisor. Starting with our doorman's greeting upon arrival, then on to our bellman, to the front desk and dining staff, the service was as good as anything I've experienced anywhere in my life. And hats off to the interior designers. The guest rooms and public spaces are absolutely beautiful, with eye-popping colors and decor accented by thoughtful lighting throughout the building. We had breakfast the morning of departure and my wife ordered their french toast, which looked absolutely delicious. She doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, so with the caramel banana toppings she wasn't a big fan, so she passed her dish to her brother and I who did everything we could to avoid polishing off the entire thing on top of our own meals....we came close because it was YUMMY! When the waitress came with the bill, she told my wife that she removed the french toast from the bill because she noticed that she didn't like it. We said to our waitress, \"that's OK, we still ate most of it\" and her response was \"that doesn't matter, what matters is that she wasn't happy with her meal and should not be charged for it.\" Wow. At checkout I mentioned to the front desk agent how \"wowed\" we all were with the hotel and the service. Less than fifteen minutes later I received an email from their manager thanking us for staying and for the positive feedback upon checkout. Again, wow. The amazing staff, the great service and culture at this hotel clearly indicates it is run by an exceptional general manager and management team. I know how critical the hiring and training process is to the success of a hotel, and obviously it is all taken very seriously by this team of professionals. Most large hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton have incredible resources and processes for training, hiring, service delivery, etc. What impresses me most is that they are doing it as well if not better than the \"big boys\" as an independently managed hotel.

Pretty, nicley appointed suite. Great king bed with comfy linens. Room is nicely decorated too with lieterature-related theme.Comfy leather lounge chairs, reading lamps, complimentary use of a Kindle Nook, and a well-stocked library really do make this a great spot for reading. But the location is so great we found it hard to stay put. Fenway Park, Boylston Street, Shops at Prudential, and Boston Common are all very walkable if you like to stroll like we do. Staff knows their business. Front desk, room service, valet parking, concierge all delivered with apparent ease and lack of fussiness. Example: early Saturday morning, I asked when the concierge desk opened which wasn't for an hour. But the desk clerk asked if he could help me, and when I told him we wanted to watch the Liverpool v. Arsenal soccer match he knew exactly the place. He even called to make sure they would be showing that game and when we got there the barman made sure we got a good seat. The only cons: Bathroom disappointed slightly, about on par with a nicer Embassy Suites, but toiletries were top end. Lots of noise from Commonwealth Ave made sleeping a bit harder than we expected. The usual car horns, sirens and other city noises which are part of city like but aren't an issue at Ritz-Carlton or Taj Hotel in Boston. The icemaker outside the room occasionally goes into an extremely noisy mode which can be heard from the room. However, we got earplugs and dealt with this minor annoyance. I really debated whether to rate this 4 or 5 stars due to the noise issue and the lack of bathroom wow-factor compared to Ritz Carlton, but the staff is so competent and the little extras like the Keuring and Kindle provided in the room won the day. Not to mention, the suite is about $300 less than its counterpart at R-C. Plus free wi-fi! I don't give out very many 5 star ratings but Hotel Commonwealth earned every one of them.

The staff arranged for a wonderful room. At first I was concerned because the location was on a low floor overlooking Kenmore Square. My concerns were incorrect. The windows and curtains totally blocked the sound and light. The free Internet was flawless in connecting to my Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VPN for the duration of the stay. Further, my employer commented that the telephone reception during our conference calls was actually much more clear than my own home office. Since most are not looking for an office away from their office, I will share that the bed was very comfortable. I have never experienced such a warm wonderful shower in any hotel or home. It seems like an odd feature to highlight, however, most hotels are usually lacking in water pressure. Not Hotel Commonwealth, where I revelled in the warmth and steam. Fluffy towels and the accompanying spa bath products rounded out the experience. The location of the hotel is convenient to Boston University, area restaurants, the T, and a short walk to shopping (Newbury Street) and more restaurants.

The new Hawthorne is pretty cool and Eastern Standard and Island Creek Oyster Bar are great places - and all three are accessible from inside the Hotel w/out having to go outside (very important on sub-freezing nights). The lobby/sitting area is nice and smells great. Had a Fenway Room which does look out onto Fenway. Very big bathroom. \"Fresh\" brand hair/body products provided. Room was very dark when shades were drawn. Pretty quiet overall in the room/hallways. Fitness Center is small and has no windows, but has 6-8 machines and some free weights. Kenmore is much better than when I was a student 20 years ago, but it is still not the nicest or best neighborhood to stay for first time visitors IMO unless your activities are centered around BU or Fenway (then, absolutely Yes).

The location is very convenient, the green line Kenmore stop is literally below the hotel. This enables one easy access to the T and travel around the city. We arrived a \u00c2\u00bd hour before check-in and were offered a cup of hot apple cider. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that not only was our room ready but that we had been given an upgrade to a suite overlooking Kenmore square. Room: The room was huge and beautiful with a heavy curtain to separate the comfy king-sized bed from the living area. We loved the two comfy chairs and ottoman, a nice desk, and flat screen tv. (There are actually two, one is in the bedroom, too). We were given a complimentary bottle of wine and some delicious chocolate truffles in our room so we decided to enjoy that and watch some Saturday college football before we headed out for the night. At first, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the television to work but one quick call down to the front desk, and the problem was solved. The curtain between the two rooms blocked off any leaking light from the front curtains and we loved the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cave\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feeling\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.love complete darkness to sleep.

The bathroom was immaculate with a nice size tub and wonderful \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fresh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd products. The toilet had its separate room which was nice for getting ready when we both needed to use the bathroom. Shower pressure was great but watch out for that water, it could get really hot! The only complaint was they only provided one robe while there were two of us in the room but not a big deal. There was a safe in the closet albeit not very large. Also, an umbrella was available if you needed to use it. Turn down service is provided (they ask at check-in if you want it) and they leave you some nice chocolates. Staff: We cannot say enough about the staff that works here. They were one of the nicest front desk staffs I have even come into contact with. Any question we had was met with sincere assistance. Restaurant: We ate a late night meal and later a late lunch at one of their restaurants, The Eastern Standard. Being locals, we had dined here before and really enjoyed it but my DH loved it this time around. He had a prosciutto sandwich which he claimed is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the best sandwiches\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he has ever had (hence why we returned for a late lunch). Saturday night was packed and we hung out in the bar. I noticed a bar table had been open for a while, and when I went to the host stand, she was more than happy to seat us there. Our server was excellent (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember her name, sorry) despite the huge crowd and later hour. Location: As mentioned, the T stop is right there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.a major plus. Also, we were easily able to walk down to the Newbury Street area and the Boston Common. We had unusually warm November weather and many were taking advantage of it by walking around.

The hotel had been given notice 8 months ago that I would need to have completely synthetic bedding in the room, because I am allergic to feather and down, etc. I had also called and spoken to the General Manager a few days before arriving. He promised me that all my requirements would be addressed. When I checked into the room late on the night of arrival, I was shocked to find that the pillows and bedding were not synthetic, but feather filled. I called down to the front desk, and they told me that even the mattress was feather filled. I was shocked and left the room immediately. I had life threatening asthma as a child, caused by feather pillows. As a medical person I am absolutely appalled that the hotel could neglect something this important, and potentially life threatening, certainly deleterious to one's health. When I went back to the front desk, they offered to change out the room that was now filled with feather and allergens. I refused to stay in that room. The manager at the front desk was smirking. I left for a 5 star hotel after making a few calls. When I called a few days later to speak to the person that I had booked the hotel room through, she was also smirking on the telephone. Apparently, it was a big joke that they had messed up in such a big way. I called the General Manager. He insulted my intelligence by insisting that the room had indeed had synthetic bedding in it. I know the difference between synthetic and feather filled bedding. I found his attitude extremely dishonest. For those of you that do not know, feather filled bedding contains dust mite which is an allergen. It is the filthiest type of bedding that one can use, especially in a hotel setting where many people use it. I do not know how this hotel is No. 1 on the list for Boston.

As you enter the hotel, you are struck by the rich reddish-gold carpeting with gold, blue, green and rose colored-mosaic patterns. As you ascend the staircase, you arrive in an elegant lobby. I love enjoying my coffee and reading the paper in the lobby, during the morning, and watching people. The rooms have views of Commonwealth Avenue or Fenway Park. You can see the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Green Monster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Fenway Park from the Fenway rooms. From the Commonwealth rooms, you can watch the cars and pedestrians on Commonwealth Avenue. Comfortable beds with light-weight-down comforters and four medium-firm pillows furnish the rooms. I usually don't sleep well in hotel beds, but I sleep great here. The amenities in the bathroom include lemon-scented-soy shampoo, shower gel and body lotion from Fresh. They also offer pomegranate hair conditioner. The hotel has two popular restaurants. Eastern Standard and Island Creek Oyster Bar. At Eastern Standard, you can dine on the patio or in the restaurant. If you choose outdoor dining, you can enjoy people watching on Commonwealth Avenue. If there is a Boston Red Sox game, baseball fans pack the bar and restaurant. One of my favorite appetizers is the steamed mussels prepared with white wine, tomatoes and fennel. It is served with crunchy bread for dipping. I also love their clear chocolate martinis. One of the bartenders gave me the recipe. If you want it, let me know. Island Creek Oyster Bar is new, but it is known for delicious, fresh seafood. They rely on local farmers and advertise that they use the freshest ingredients. They have a great reputation.

I'm a Boston local but decided I didn't want to travel back and forth for the convention. I had a GREAT time at the Commonwealth! I didn't go in with any expectations and was pleasantly surprised with my experience. The last hotel I stayed at in downtown Boston was the Ritz and I will say the Commonwealth was a better stay. It's got the same great service without the stuffy attitude and atmosphere. Everyone was so friendly and asked how you were enjoying your stay and was there anything they could do for you. The hotel itself is very charming. The decor is very trendy without the feeling that they're trying too hard. I love boutique hotels so this was just perfect for me. The location was perfect for what I needed. I was a ten minute walk to the Hynes convention center, five minutes to Fenway Park, ten minutes to the best shopping and restaurants in the area ( Boylston and Newbury Streets with Copley/Prudential Malls). I had plenty to do during my breaks at the conference. The room was huge with a sitting area that had a second TV. that was great because my husband was with me and he could watch the game while I caught up on work and watched what I wanted to. There's also this great charging station where you can hook up all your gadgets we can't seem to live without at once. That was something I hadn't seen before in a hotel. The pillows were fantastic! I felt like I was sinking into a cloud every night. I was also a fan of the lush towels in the bathroom. For the first time I didn't have to call for more. They supplied nice Fresh amenities too. I love Fresh products so that was a bonus for me. Room service surprised me with a great bottle of wine and chocolate truffles when I arrived. Very nice touch after a long day at the convention. The staff is just fantastic. The room service and maid service were wonderful. The only thing that was missing from the room was a coffee maker. You need to give yourself an extra minute to grab that before you start your day. Overall I had a great time at this hotel. It was a short stay but I'll definitely be back next time I need to stay in town. I think people who are in Boston for Business or pleasure would enjoy staying here. If you are a Red Sox fan I don't think there is anywhere closer to Fenway!

A month or so before our trip, I e-mailed the hotel to request late check-out on the date of our departure to accommodate our participation in the Freedom Trail Run (a don't-miss if you like touristy stuff and physical activity!), and at least three front-end staff members replied to my e-mail within a half hour to say the hotel would be happy to accommodate my request. That was only the beginning. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by extremely friendly and helpful front-end staff, bellhops, and doormen. At check-in, we were given a jogging map just because they remembered from my e-mail that we were participating in the run! I thought that just really showed the special attention they pay to their customers. Then we went up to our room to discover a beautiful, spacious, immaculately clean corner suite! If that weren't enough, there was a bottle of champagne and a card signed by a number of the staff members to congratulate me and my husband on our first anniversary--I had mentioned in my e-mail requesting the late check-out that we were traveling to Boston to celebrate it. That was such a nice touch, and it continued to show that the hotel staff really wanted their guests to feel welcome and special. Throughout our stay we were greeted at the hotel door and desk each time with friendly faces, and we always arrived back to our room at the end of our long touring days to clean, fresh towels, a beautifully straightened room, and a comfortable bed. Every single staff member we spoke to was kind and happy to help. The front desk staff even provided us with extra towels to dry off when we came into the hotel soaking wet after running back from nearby Fenway Park during a flash storm! And there I was thinking that they wouldn't even want to let us into such a beautiful establishment in such a state! :) We also ate at each of the hotel restaurants once. The food at the Island Creek Oyster Bar was excellent, and our serving \"team\" was very knowledgable and helpful to me as I tried oysters for the first time ever! (I wouldn't know any better, but the couple dining next to us opined that the restaurant has simply the best raw oyster bar in Boston.) I was a little less impressed with the Eastern Standard (a service mishap that could have been fixed easily if we had asked about it, but we didn't, so no big deal), but the french toast I had there was delicious, so I can't complain too much. :) All said, our whole trip was just made that much better by the wonderful treatment we recieved at the Hotel Commonwealth.

However, Hotel Commonwealth had rooms still available at under $250, so I grabbed one. Boy, did I luck out. This is a truly impressive 5 STAR hotel. We got a \"junior suite\", which is essentially one very large room. (They have a large curtain divider you can use to turn your jr suite into 2 rooms.) The room was very clean. Great view. The bathroom was very clean and had a separate room for the toilet, so I could still shave, brush teeth, shower... even if my son needed to use the toilet. Extremely comfortable beds. Excellent TVs (yes, there were 2...one for each boy!) The location of Hotel Commonwealth is perfect, directly across the street from Boston University and within easy walking distance of Fenway. When we arrived at 4 pm, the maid was inside \"doing our room\". We asked what she was doing and she replied, \"Turn Down Service\". My son asked, \"Dad, did they turn us down?' Had to laugh and explain to the boys what \"turn down service\" meant, and the boys were thrilled to see the maid had left chocolates on the beds. The staff were great! Very helpful, very polite. The only problem is the rates can fluctuate by the day. If The Red Sox have a home game, rates go up. On Parent's Weekend for BU, I think my room would cost much more/night.

There was also a luxuriously large bathroom that allowed two people to get ready without bumping elbows and the restaurant (Eastern Standard) is quite a draw all on its own. We were eternally grateful they were still serving food at 1 a.m. when we finally arrived from the airport - a delightful gift of St. Christopher, the patron Saint of travelers. Everyone on the staff that we encountered was very nice and helpful. I needed to send some things back home which they cheerfully helped me with. The restaurant staff was great, and we never got that feeling like, \"oh, you're just hotel guests.\" They treated us like regulars, but that could be because we spent a lot of time at the bar in between baseball games! The neighborhood is great.

A few years ago we decided to goto Boston and see a game at Fenway Park. After some thorough research, we found that the Commonwealth Hotel was the nicest hotel with the closest proximity to the park. We stayed there for a few nights and had a great time. So, when it was time to plan another trip to Boston, we went straight to the Commonwealth. Our experience was just as good as the first. We stay in the \"Fenway Park\" rooms, which give a great view of the stadium right across the street. We had two adjacent rooms (my wife and I in one, kids in another). I have to say, knowing how loud my kids are, the rooms are very well sound-proofed as we did not hear a peep. The rooms are very spacious and clean. The staff was amazingly nice and helpful (restaraunts, kids' activities, etc...). The excercise facility is not the biggest in the world, but has all the basic equipment, all in good shape. From a proximity perspective, if you are interested in being near Fenway, you can't beat this hotel. Right out the front door through Kenmore Square, over the bridge along with the rest of the people going to the game (a very fun atmosphere) and you are at the stadium in less than 5 minutes. I have a ritual of running along Commonwealth Ave in the mornings, which is a beautiful run within a scultpure garden along the way to Boston Public Garden. If you keep on going, you hit Fanieul Hall and then the aquarium and the Italian section of town. Of course, you can hop on the Green Line T at the station just a few steps away from the hotel and go basically anywhere.

Although we were in the middle of all the action that Boston has to offer, the room was almost completely sound proof and the curtains blacked out 99% of the outside lights--we slept like babies. Overall, we'd highly recommend this hotel for a small event or for a Boston vacation.

It was the best customer service experience that I have encountered at a hotel in a long time. The staff was always smiling and willing to help out with any of our needs - from getting us museum tickets to a postage stamp, even ran ahead and grabbed us the elevator when my husband returned with takeout and didn't have a free hand. I ran the Boston Marathon and was shocked to get a visit from hotel staff after I returned to my room with a quaint little frame with a certificate inside, congratulating me on finishing and listed my finish time! The hotel not only knew we ran it but they took the extra step of looking up our results and congratulating us. We had 2 snafus at the hotel that were promptly handled in an efficient, quick manner. Our neighbor our first night was the loudest talker - had continuous conference calls during his stay including one at 10pm and 5:30am. Needless to say, I was not impressed when I was woken up so early by his call. I immediately rang the desk and they sent up security to deal with the situation. The next day I was informed that the conference caller was no loner next door to us, which was a huge relief. I was worried that it was uber-thin walls and this would be a problem throughout our stay, but we never heard our other neighbors. Problem #2 was fire alarm going off at 9:30pm one night. We were informed promptly what to do and that the situation was being investigated. Turned out to be a mal-functioning alarm so we never had to leave. We awoke to a very nice letter from management explaining the situation and apologizing for the inconvience. The location is perfect - right above the T so easy to get pretty much anywhere. Plenty of nearby food options and if you like baseball, you can see Fenway from your hotel room or floor. I would def. recommend this hotel to anyone and look forward to returning when I am in Boston again.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "esther1257", "ReviewID": "UR105492105", "Content": "We loved this hotel!

Upon returning after an amazing day at the ballpark, we were warmly greeted by the doorman and promptly checked in and our bags were quickly delivered to our room by another charming staff member.

We pulled our car up to the entrance of the hotel and we were greeted very warmly and energetically by the valet and doorman. Our bags were placed on the rolling brass rack and we proceeded inside for check-in. It was 1:30 pm on a Monday. I knew the Red Sox were out of town on a road trip. I surmised that the hotel would not be full at this time. I hate the firm 3:00 pm check-in policy that some hotels strictly adhere to and I was curious to see what would happen here. The lobby area was up one dramatic flight of stairs (there was also an elevator on the side) and the word I would use to describe the lobby area would be regal. Gorgeous red floor covering, multiple pieces of ornate furniture and high ceiling made the space feel like a large room in a European palace. Anika, who greeted us, was warm, personable and professional. She said our room was ready and our bags would be right up. Our room was on the 3rd floor of the 5 story hotel. Our room was a Commonwealth Room which was like a junior suite. The room was in shades of browns and golds and was relaxingly inviting. The marble bathroom was beautiful and was a nice size. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable and the sittiing area had the pull-out couch/bed for the kids. The view out our window faced north out onto Commonwealth Avenue. The famous Citgo sign (another Red Sox reference) was there also. The bags arrived and we got ready to head out and see the city. We took a cab over to the Children's Museum. Our kids, 7 and almost 3 had a ball for a few hours. My son was so proud to have climbed to the top of the 3 story climbing maze at the front of the museum. My daughter loved the Arthur exhibit. After an ice cream break at the huge Hood milk bottle outside the museum, we grabbed a cab over to the Public Gardens. My daughter loves the book \"Make Way for Ducklings\" by Robert McCloskey, so we took a ride on one of the Swan Boats in the Public Gardens and saw the little island where the ducks finally settled. She loved seeing the setting of one of her favorite books and we loved it too. Afterwards, we hailed a cab back to the hotel. We relaxed in the room for about an hour and dressed for dinner. We dined at Eastern Standard Restaurant within the hotel. We sat inside and dinner was excellent. Thanks to our Ipad, our kids were entertained enough so that dinner was mostly relaxing. After dinner, we retired to our room and bathed the kids and put them to bed. I did not hear any street sounds from Commonwealth Avenue and the climate control was quiet and effective. I slept perfectly all night. The next morning we had breakfast at Eastern Standard again but this time, we sat outside in a beautiful garden area facing Commonwealth Avenue. It was fun to people watch and I had french toast that was delicious and memorable. Check-out was friendly and courteous. Our car was brought around and we departed for the hospital.

(It was slightly more expensive here.) Other hotels in town were going for $350/night and up. I was wondering what I was going to give up for that $100 less. Well, let's just say that I've stayed at those more expensive hotels and the hotel here was better from start to finish. The service from the first moment I pulled up in front of the hotel was efficient and friendly. Even better, the room was simply exquisite. Much larger than your ordinary hotel room. So large, in fact, that there was a second flat screen TV in front of the couch to go with the one in front of the bed. I was on the top (5th) floor overlooking bustling Kenmore Square but the windows are sufficiently sound-proofed that I didn't hear any sounds from the street below. Kenmore Square and nearby Fenway Park are great areas offering a full range of dining options. Nonetheless, the hotel offers 24 hour room service. And would you believe, free Internet (albeit a little slow)?! I come to Boston often and while this hotel isn't particularly convenient to our office in the Financial District, the T is about a 30 foot walk from the front door. I'm trying to think of a negative for the hotel. The lobby's on the second floor, requiring you to walk up the stairs with your suitcase (or take the elevator)? If this is the worst I can say about the hotel, you get the point. Great hotel at any price. At the price I got it for relative to the competition, a huge bargain.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThe Hotel Commonwealth is elegant, family friendly and we all enjoyed our stay immensely.\u201d", "Author": "Samantha12", "ReviewID": "UR56712697", "Content": "We had a great time visiting the Hotel Commonwealth for the Kids Weekend Event!

The readers not only read books, but acted out some of the stories and sang songs with kid participation. After the event, the hot cocoa bar was a nice way to end the evening.

The location and convenience to Fenway make it worth every penny. I ate breakfast in their restaurant one of the mornings and was pleasantly surprised for a hotel restaurant. There are more than enough good restaurants in the immediate area also that give you lots of choices. The modern 7-11 next door came in very handy also. It's also a very short walk down to the Charles River where there's some great scenery, walking and running trails.

From the moment we first pulled up to the valet parking attendant, we were blown away by the friendly and professional service. We entered the gorgeous foyer and climbed the split staircase into the lobby. The hotel was decked out in classy colonial furnishings that give off an air of sophistication and style. During my first stay, I enjoyed a Commonwealth room, which a view of the major street of the same name. This suite was on sale at the time and priced the same as the smaller guest rooms. The main room had a large king-sized bed, huge closet, flat-screen TV, mini-bar, etc. Then, there was a massive lounge area with desk, second flat-screen, and comfortable chairs. They offered a huge number of cable channels, including 3 different HBOs. And the large marble bathroom was spectacular, with a separate toilet area off to the side. On my second stay I entered my smaller room to find that my bed did not look made. The decorative pillows were stacked on a neighboring chair and the bed pillows were all arranged on a 120 degree slant. It looked as if they stopped mid-bedmaking. I called the front desk and they sent someone right up. The person agreed the bed was not made, and they switched me to a handicapped room across the hall. When I saw the flat floor of the shower, I asked the bellhop if the bathroom was going to flood when I showered. He said no and quickly left the room. Well, he was wrong because it was like the Great Flood in there. Also, there was no closet, but only a very low bar to hang clothes from. My bathroom was relatively large, but the room was nothing special. On my second night in the handicapped room I came back to find my bed had been made the same way it had been in the first room. Apparently that is just the style they use sometimes. So, basically, I could have enjoyed my original room if the bellhop had told me that in the first place. In terms of amenities, the gym is decent, but pretty small. It offers 2 treadmills, a stairmaster, 2 ellipticals, 1 bike, and some weights.

At $300+ for a hotel room, internet access, (which costs the hotel NOTHING) should be comp as it is at every Marriott property.

The major academic center nearby - for which I work - attracts some of the most demanding physician-scientists who are accustomed to having things \"their way\". At the Hotel Commonwealth, that prescription is filled perfectly. Since Fenway Park is a scant two blocks away, I had worried that the venue itself would be inappropriate for our clientele. I questioned whether the rooms themselves would be noisy, the streets would be overrun with zealous fans, and whether the ambiance of the adjoining outdoor cafe would be ruined by foot traffic. So I stayed there on a Friday night to test the waters. Whatever perceptions I had originally were quickly cast aside by the incredible service and amenities offered by the first class staff. Check-in was efficient and professional, and we were wisked up to the room on an upper floor, as I had requested. Opening the doors everything was fresh and clean smelling, with wonderful French accoutrements throughout. Details: start with the oversized tub in the bathroom, continue to the Frette towels and bathrobes, and toiletries from a famous French line. Having stayed at other luxury properties I will say that nothing was skimpy in comparison. The beds were some of the most comfortable I've slept in, with luxury sheets caressing my skin while the pillowtop mattress welcomed my weary body. I may have snored I slept so soundly - without any noise from other rooms nor from the street traffic below. The state of the art phones would appeal to techies; as would the flat screen TV and wireless internet access. But I digress: in between check-in and tucking myself in, dinner at the attached restaurant was mouthwatering. Great Bay has received great reviews locally but had not been subjected to this admitted food snob's discernment. I will review this separately, but one word describes my feeling: KUDOS! Ditto for the food and owner-operated (as in on the floor) East Standard, located on the opposite side of the building, which raises the bar. Do you adore Paris? The only Boston spot where you can relax in the true Parisian style (heated year-round outdoor patio) is attached to this hotel.

The room was beautiful and looked out directly onto Fenway, which was pretty neat. And even though you're right over the Mass Pike, you don't hear road noise. No problems with the room itself or with the bathroom. Both are put together very well. We had a crib in our room when we arrived. Check-in was easy. We had a problem with the valet. When returning one afternoon, we wanted to just park, run upstairs, change clothes, and run down again -- we didn't have time for them to park the car (we'd have had to immediately call and say we needed the car... and we were already running late... we were literally inside the hotel less than ten minutes). The stupid doorman or valet or whoever he was did not understand that we were guests of the hotel and was pretty rude about wanting us to leave until we spelled it out for him and showed him our room keys. Not like we were dressed strangely, either -- my husband was in a nice shirt and tie after an interview all day! No idea why they treated us that way! Guess if you want the rifraff kept away from your hotel, that will happen! Had a much bigger problem with the paint fumes. Our last night there my husband woke me up at 3:30 am because of the terrible chemical smell. I got up and found it unbearably strong in the hallway and called downstairs. The guy on the phone informed me that yes, they were painting the service elevator, but it \"shouldn't\" be a problem for me. Ummm... would I be on the phone with you at this hour if there wasn't a problem?? Turns out it was paint thinner and no ventilation was set up. We were on the top floor, maybe the fumes collected there at the top of the shaft, or something. In any case, my eyes were burning, I was coughing, had a headache. Was online for 30 minutes trying to figure out if it was OK for our 6 month old baby to be in those fumes, or if we needed to make a run for it! But, the hotel did immediately get things ventilated somehow. Within two hours it was all cleared out and you'd never know it happened. So, while I'm mad that they did that, they did take care of it as soon as they knew it was a problem. (IN the meantime, we put a wet towel over the air intake for the heater. Hope that didn't wear the motor -- but it did work to clear the fumes more quickly from our room (I think), and it fixed the dry air too)! We had a small problem with the breakfast menu -- the menus are old and they just substitute things at random and hope you like it. Seems it would be better to print new menus. No real harm, but at those prices, seems to me the thing to do. Overall, though, it was a nice place to stay. Some things are over-the-top (borrowed movies arrive in gift bags), but I guess that's the type of hotel they want to be. The Eastern Standard restaurant was quite good too.

We booked a junior suite, which is a large room with a separate living room and bedroom. It had two televisions, a huge desk and comfortable chairs with an ottoman. The rooms are separated by curtains. It was nicely decorated, had great comfortable beds and super linens. They put a down comforter in between two high thread count sheets-what a great night's sleep. It wasn't too busy in November but the rooms were really soundproofed. When you walked into your room, you had your own little foyer with a closet. The bathroom shower was great with a shelf, immediate warm water and a separate toilet room Service was great. The location was as well. Some have said it is less than desirable due to it's location, but the Kenmore T stop is right outside the door of the hotel. Also it is close to Fenway, Newberry Street and the Back Bay area is very safe. You have to ride the T to get to the start of the Freedom trail, but I prefer not to stay in such a touristy area myself. It is well worth it to upgrade to a suite, by the way. For about $20 we had more space, and the extra curtains kept it really quiet and dark for sleeping. My husband had to wake me up one morning because I just kept on sleeping. It is classy, has restaurants on site, is near convenient stores, and we walked to the movies from there (that's our kind of nightlife fun). The only negative didn't have much to do witht the hotel-The T is a little confusing, sometimes you have to be careful not to take the wrong train on the same line, pay attention to the final destination on the outside of the car. Plus it can be crowded on the weekends. Overall, a great city and a great hotel.

During my last checkout I requested a refreshment centre item that I had not taken be removed from the bill, and so the bill was amended, re-printed and placed in an envelope and I was on my way. Later when I looked at the bill instead of zero refreshment centre items there were now 2! which were cheekily added at check out knowing full well I would not re-open the envelope there and then. I still had the copy of my first bill. I rarely use hotel mini-bars so this hit a raw nerve. Hmmm. My previous stays have been more honest affairs and this hotel is very pleasant with friendly staff throughout. The rooms are very nicely furnished and the hotel being only 4 years old are still in fine decor. The windows are on the small size so the rooms are a little dark but this does a good job at keeping out the din of busy Kenmore Square at the front and the Highway at the rear. I once had a room above the bar that was not so quiet. Rooms have complementary wireless internet access and a DVD player with free DVD's from reception, but don't expect any blockbusters. The alarm clocks are quite useless and there is no coffee maker but there is free morning coffee in the lobby. The air conditioning has always been very effective and the bathrooms are quite spacious, nicely fitted out, include a bath and the soaps are top quality. The large Eastern Standard hotel bar with its high ceiling, long bar, open kitchen is to me one of the better bars in Boston but it can get very busy so finding a seat at the bar is not always possible, mind you the last 2 meals I had were served luke warm but this is not the norm. There is a further very smart separate restaurant which again serves excellent food and then there is The Foundation bar in the basement. Fenway Park which you can see from some of the rooms and the many night clubs are a 5 minute walk so the place really gets packed out on game days. There are several moderately priced good restaurants very nearby such as India Quality and Thai Dish with its tropical fish tanks that both serve excellent food. For wings and burgers there is The Beerworks brewpub and over the square there is a very popular home made burger joint. As an alterantive to the hustle and bustle of the city you can jump on the C subway line just 1 stop to St Marys or beyond and there are some real gems. The only nearby coffee shop is across the square in the book shop but this opens quite late so you may have to visit the Eastern Standard for that early morning Latte ($4.20 + tip so $5). Kenmore green line subway station is just 30 seconds away which you may choose to use to reach the finer parts of Boston such as Newbury Street, Copley Square and Downtown which are 10, 20, 35 minute walks respectively. A 7 day $15 subway pass is a snip for a ride on the oldest subway in the USA. Jump on at the head of the front carriage for a drivers eye view as the tram snakes along. Getting to the airport on the green and blue subways takes about 45 minutes.

The food was hot and fresh. Parking was fine with the valet, but impossible if you did not use the valet. Kenmore Square has little or no public overnight parking, but should not be a surprise in light of Fenway.

We specifically selected Hotel Commonwelath for the Fenway View rooms for my kid who is a huge red sox fan. Unfortuantely, upon arrival, we were told there were no such rooms available because \"someone had extended their stay and Mass. law precludes eviction.\" So we were put in a different room that required us to put two persons on a sofa bad. Wasn't thrilled about paying $300+ bucks a night and having two of us sleep on a sleeper sofa. The front desk person assured us that he would send an e-mail to the morning desk agent to set aside a Fenway room if one became available. The next morning, I checked with the specific person at the desk who was supposed to have received the e-mail from the night desk manager and she had not received any such e-mail. She was rude, but was not exactly the most apologetic about the situation either. She said she would try and grab a Fenway Room if one became available. Ultimately, they were able to move us to a Fenway Park view room, and the stay picked up greatly from that point. [Please note that after our stay, we received a terrific letter from the Front Desk manager who sinceerely apologized for the mishap and also included a certificate for a discount on a future stay. The certificate was a nice touch, but the letter is what truly mattered. This was not a one sentence letter saying \"sorry, here's a certificate.\" Instead, the letter was a several paragraphs apologizing profusely and encouraging us to come back. It was very well written and unsolicited on my part. In short, it was a class act.] Other than the initial mishap, the service was excellent. From the doormen, to the bell staff, to the housekeeping staff - all were top notch. Very helpful, very friendly, always around if you needed them. The convenience to Fenway cannot be overstated. (A reletively new restaurant near Fenway, La Verdad, was a highlight. They have a corn and cheese appetizer that was truly amazing. The rooms were reletively large and we enjoyed the view of Fenway. No, you can't see in the stadium, but we didn't expect to be able to see in the stadium. It was still great to see the stadium lit up at night outside your window.

But if you like a greater choice of restaurants and activities very close to your hotel, this might not be top choice. The room was outstanding, and the amenities are very nice. Quiet rooms, despite the hustle and bustle (and turnpike) right outside the door. The restaurants are fine, although the types of dining styles are not extensive and a bit pricey.

At the end of the day, the staff was great -- we're not demanding but the few requests we had were easily accomodated. I did notice, however, a little bit of indifference by the front desk staff (some were very young and seemed to be in their first service industry jobs -- I guess that's par for the course in a city of so many college kids). I happened to be in the lobby a few times right around check in time, and got to witness the handling of guests being told their rooms weren't quite ready yet and it was clear that this is both a common occurrence and one to which the staff has heard everything so often in terms of complaints that they are a bit tuned out. Still, by 5:00, the lobby was clear. Lots of great touches in the room. (Would have liked a coffee maker, though -- is that permitted in Mass?) Housekeeping staff was great.

We had already rebooked our rooms when I called them back to see if they could take in the stranded group for 3 days until they could get flights out of Boston.

The hotel staff was extremely pleasant from the moment we handed the keys over to the valet to when we checked out. We stayed in a suite. One side of the room- closest to the windows- had a nicely furnished, comfortable, and spacious sitting area with a TV. A curtain could be pulled to separate the seating area from the area with the bed and bath, which came in handy since I woke up earlier and wanted to watch some TV and read. When we arrived in our room, champagne, fine chocolates, and a note were waiting for us (not something my fiance requested - just a gesture from the hotel). The handwritten card congratulated us and thanked us for choosing the Hotel Commonwealth to spend our special evening at. What a thoughtful touch. We're just two kids in our early twenties, not staying in the most expensive room, so the gesture was that much more appreciated. Sometimes I feel snubbed by hotel staff, like my money isn't as valuable because I'm younger. Not so at this hotel. The bathroom in our suite had a separate toilet area from the shower/sink area. The tub shower was large with beautiful marble. The bedding was very soft and comfortable, with plenty of pillows. It was like sleeping on a cloud. Our friends stayed as well, but in a standard room. It had less bells and whistles and was more like your standard, nicer hotel room. They really enjoyed it. When we stayed, there was construction (of course- it's Boston!). Regardless, the room was insulated from the hubbub of the city streets below and construction. I called down to the valet in the morning and asked if it would be possible to leave our car in the garage for the day until 4pm, even though we checked out at 11am. I threw in that we were there for our engagement evening. No problem - we spent the day in Boston without paying for parking, other than the typical fee to park at the hotel overnight. The in-room breakfast. I think this is why I hold this hotel so dear in my heart. I've stayed at nice places in my life - eaten at wonderful restaurant. But never in my life had I, or have I since, had fruit like I had that morning. It may sound weird or trivial, but it was so delicious I was taken aback. We went a little nuts on the breakfast and got omelettes, toast, homefries, the fruit! :), coffee and tea, and other things I'm sure. I know we spent more on breakfast than we typically would for dinner in the city. Everything was phenominal. I'd love to see what this hotel can do for lunch and dinner. The hotel is really well located and you can walk to many locations. If you're unfamiliar with Boston, it's very accessable by foot and by subway (T). But there are, of course, areas that are less accessable, and this hotel is in a good location if you would like to walk to attractions, restaurants, the Common, etc. I would be content to spend my honeymoon at this hotel, even though I'm a life long Mass resident.

Ave. is a work in progress...\u201d", "Author": "jackfurlongesq_123", "ReviewID": "UR5815541", "Content": "My daughter is at Boston University, literally across the street from the hotel. My experience stems from roughly half a dozen stays over the last 30 months. Location: \"Back Bay\" means different things to relators, visitors, and cabbies. The hotel is a couple of blocks north of Fenway, across a bridge over the Mass. Pike. Road noise is an issue, so you may wish to book Comm. Ave. side to reduce it. Unless you're sleeping in on a weekday. Commonwealth Avenue has a long term construction project at the west end of Kenmore Square. (They took down an old bus depot, and in another five years, they'll put up...a traffic light with three trees?) The hotel's web site is accurate. Kenmore Square is a beautiful stroll, but it is east of the hotel. You'll have a view of Barnes and Noble across the street. Still, the \"T' (Green Line) is right next door, easy to navigate, and able to get you downtown quickly. Pru Center and MFA are a decent walk. Rooms: Basically two types of room, deluxe and junior suite (they have the real kind, but those price out of the range of almost anyone who actually reads on the Internet). The junior suite is a bed room next to an open sitting room doubling the size, with a full wall curtain you can pull to separate the two. The sitting area has its own tv, writing desk, free Internet, comfortable leather club chairs, and an ottoman. Hall noise can be an issue that could easily be solved if guests actually recalled that they were, well, guests. But then, self-absorption has reached pandemic proportions in our country, so why should things be different in a hallway outside a series of bedrooms? Talk as loud as you like. So what if it's two a.m.? The game's over; you had six beers; we WANT to know what you said to that \"chick you followed to the girl's room.\" Service: Many of the employees are hotel school students from BU, trying hard, but not often sure how to handle the off-speed pitch (OK, my last baseball metaphor in the shadow of Fenway), like a request for late check out, etc. There is a support staff contingent from the Dominican who are extremely helpful, despite the disrespect I have witnessed from some guests. The restaurant adjacent to the lobby is uneven and pricey ('Hey, it's Boston, whaddya' expect?'), but on its good days it is a fresh sea food bistro that should probably not try to serve breakfast. Of course, any hotel that stocks L'Occitane in its bathrooms starts ahead of the pack. And they keep a large stock of DVD's at the front desk which you can borrow if you'd like your kids to curl up and watch a movie. The treat? Free goodie bag for the kids to go with their flick. Price: Depends on when you go, dramatically. Junior suite on January 1-2? $195/night. Same room during Head of the Charles weekend? Add $400. Is $600 (taxes included) too much for a spacious junior suite with free Internet, writing desk, black and white postcard photos of Red Sox of yore? Probably. But the same room, give or take, at the Four Seasons downtown is $1100 (Hey, it's Boston, whaddya' expect?) Bottom line: a reasonable, but lesser alternative to the Four Seasons/Ritz Carlton options closer to the Common. If you're destination is Fenway or Boston University, this is the ONLY option for upscale rooms, products, and service. Just keep reminding yourself. It's cheaper than the Common, and less crowded than Cambridge.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC, Canada", "Title": "\u201clocation, location\u201d", "Author": "natureniche", "ReviewID": "UR5625761", "Content": "We stayed here July 18.

The L'Occitane bath products were a welcome addition as well. The hotel offers nightly turn down service which was included in our room rate. It was a very welcome addition to return to the room after a full day of activities and have classical music playing and have lovely cookies on the pillow.

Plus, the Commonwealth is right next door to one of our favorite Boston restaurants (Petite Robert Bistro), with lots of bookstores in the area, so we decided to give it a try. We were not disapppointed. And the nightly rate was well worth it for the excellent service and marvelous accomodations we enjoyed. This is an exceedingly well run hotel; everyone from the front desk staff to the bellhops to the parking attendants seem intent on doing their jobs to their full ability. They were extremely friendly and efficient, and made us feel pampered and welcome indeed! The hotel is only about two years old, so the facilities are in excellent condition-- and everything is spotless. Our room was HUGE-- twice as large as some comparable places we've stayed.

Our server James allowed us to order way too much :) but his service, the food and atmosphere made for a wonderful evening. The lighting in Great Bay is warm and calm.
