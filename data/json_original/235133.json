The neighborhood is on the edge of El Serrino which may look a little dicey, but we were pleasantly surprised and felt secure in the the property. It is set up in a fort style with one entry -- a two story building surrounding the parking lot. The staff was friendly. We opted for the king size bed, which was very comfortable, but tight for the room. The facility is definitely older, but had fresh paint outside, upgraded tile in the bathroom adn was clean. There was also a microwave and small refrigerator. We were on the upper floor, which was quiet. There was also a walk in closet, The heater was a little noisey during the night, but an adjustment on the dial set that right. The continental breakfast was modest, but adequate, with cereal, instant oatmeal, muffins and danish, eggo waffles, toast and juice -- no fruit. We stayed three nights, and slept well all three nights. It was not fancy, but was secure and comfortable, plus we loved the money we saved over other options.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cOk for the price.\u201d", "Author": "BCandBeyond", "ReviewID": "UR117680298", "Content": "The rooms were fairly clean, bed was very comfortable and the parking was good.

It was clean, safe, and friendly service. Alhambra is a nice town and the hotel is right across the street from a residential area. It was nice to get in a early morning walk and see all the pretty homes in Alhambra. There is also a gas station across the street if you need to do a late night soda or food run. I was very impressed with their continental breakfast. They offered so much food. Waffles, bagels, english muffins, cereal, danishes, lots of coffee and juice. It was wonderful. The hotel I stayed at after the super8 was a bit pricier and I only got a muffin and juice for breakfast. I would definitely stay here again. It was very quiet at night and the beds were comfortable. There's free parking which is great and I walked outside at night to get ice and get some things from the car and felt very safe and secure. There's a fridge inside the room which was great for storing soda and any food I brought in. Also, LA is a good 15 minutes by car from this location. Alhambra has a nice city center with lots of restaurants and shopping. I found the city and location to be fantastic.

Since I charged it to Discover card when they were offering 5% cashback for travel and made the reservation from hotels.com [preferred online partner] through the discover card website, I got an additional about 4% cashback from Discover card. So I ended up paying net about $118 including tax, which is a decent deal for LA where hotels tend to be expensive and this rate included a free, basic breakfast. As others have pointed out, parking space is tight and entry is narrow so drive carefully. Hotel was only about half full so I did not have parking problem This is an older property so come with realistic expectations. The mattress was somewhat saggy, and as several others have pointed out, the carpet is old and dingy. The rooms and bathrooms are small but sink is outside bathroom so if there are two of you, that may be convenient. The bathroom tile and bathtub seem to be redone recently but the water control for shower head is finicky going from hot to cold very quickly. Hotel only provides soap, shampoo and towels so bring other toiletries. Old CRT TV but reasonably large size squeezed in corner; good part is about 66 cable channels including HBO As Super8 website says, every room has old fridge and old microwave but they worked fine. The furniture [table, chairs, dresser] are old and rather dingy but worked OK. Window AC unit seems new and worked fine without excessive noise. Sink had one blown light bulb but I got a new one from reception. One lamp above dresser did not work. Manager lives onsite and was friendly, cooperative and helpful with directions as was the receptionist. I asked for room not on Huntington Dr or Poplar so would not be disturbed by traffic noise and manager cheerfully and readily accommodated me. Basic breakfast with bread, two types of cereal, muffins, danish, coffee, orange juice, milk. Frozen waffles on Saturday but not on Friday. Area around motel did not seem very safe so be careful after dark Gas station opposite motel Has WIFI but I did not use; has computer with internet connection in lobby [$5/hour] All in all, this is a reasonable choice for those on a limited budget.

This is one of the East Los Angeles neighborhoods comprised of Latino/Asian/Caucasian so it has a unique character. There are great Mexican restaurants around the motel.

The room had a hole in one wall; you could see outside, people could see inside, and bugs could come in and out. I told the woman at the front desk that there was hole all the way through the wall. She responded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know, all the rooms are like that. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting internet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I asked her, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the room right now, what can you do about it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Here, stick this in it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And handed me a washcloth. 2. Inside the room graffiti was carved into all of the light fixtures, the air conditioning unit, and into the wooden furniture. 3. The bathroom door had what looked like dried food all over it. The bathroom fixtures were rusted and the floor was incredibly sticky both days we were there. 4. The carpet was filthy and literally turned the bottom of our socks black. We ended up wearing shoes the entire time we were there and would not walk on the carpet. 5. The sheets were clean but the top sheet had a blood stain towards the top and in a visible location. We were given clean sheets but were still disgusted by the stain. 6. All of the walls were filthy, the furniture didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match, the bottom of one of the chairs was ripped and sagging to the ground, the refrigerator never cooled enough to keep our food from spoiling., most of the TV stations did not get good reception, and all of the furniture looked like it came from a thrift store. 7. We had been gone all day the second day we were there. We arrived at the hotel room around 3pm, hot, tired, and in need of a shower. I went to take a shower and discovered there were no towels. I asked the housekeeper in the next room where the towels were. She did not speak one word of English so I went to the front desk, inquired about the towels, and was told by the woman at the front desk, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The towels are in the wash.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All of the towels are in the wash? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you have any extras?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said there were no extra towels. I asked when they would be ready, to which she replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the wash now so whenever they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re done we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put them in the dryer and when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re done in the dryer they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be ready.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 8. The continental breakfast was OK. The only problems with the breakfast was: long black hairs all over the apples and their idea of breakfast, which on Sunday consisted of Twinkies and Ding Dongs. 9. We were told when making the reservation that the rooms all had hair dryers, iron, and ironing board. Our room had NOTHING! 10. There was a homeless lady with a shopping cart \u00e2\u20ac\u0153living\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in one of the parking spaces. 11. One of the housekeepers was washing the sidewalk and sprayed the entire back of our car, which we had just had washed and detailed, with water.
