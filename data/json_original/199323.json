I found the hotel very nice. The room (210) was very quiet (on the back of the building) and had an excellent free wireless internet connection. The people at the front desk were very helpful. (The man in charge changed immediately the room when I told him that I wanted an internet connection, because he knew that the wireless connection was not perfect in the previsouly assigned room). Breakfast (typical German with delicious bread) was excellent. I highly recommend this hotel. The location is fine.", "Date": "Mar 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR513575479", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nanou1hs"}, {"Content": "Quiet Hotel with Great Service This is a great little hotel located about 3 Kilometers from the main train station.

The hotel is about a 5 minutes walk to a train station, and 10 minutes ride to Dom Romer, the Old Town Square. There are also quite a few local shops and eateries (Woolworths, Aldi) about a 10 minute walk to the hotel. It's about a 20 minute cab ride from the airport (34 euros). Location wise, it was very good.However, I was sadly disappointed when I walked into the hotel and found their treatment and service unacceptable. It was 33 degrees (high 80s) outside and the hotel faced West. The hotel was a sauna. It was so hot in the lobby, I wondered how the staff can stay there. No one bothered to pull down the shutters in my room, so when I walked it in, it was a an oven. Unfortunately, the hotel windows don't open completely, so geting fresh air into the room was difficult. I had to sleep with the curtains open, which guaranteed a 4:30 AM wake up. I got maybe 2 hours sleep the whole night, after tossing and turning endlessly. To add insult to injury, the comforter was about 2 inches thick. No one had the sense to change from winter to summer bedding. Now, the hotel is listed as air conditioned, however this is a lie! There is ventilation, but it's hot air, or fan. When I went to speak to the receptionist earlier in the day, I was informed that it was Sunday and the technician is not working. I found this excuse unacceptable. It had been a sweltering 30 degrees the week before, and April 07 was the hottest on record, with no rain fall, etc. The receptionists was very terse and just walked away, completely unapologetic. Don't know why management didn't find a techician and pay him 2x time to fix it. It's Frankfurt, banking capital of Germany, not Iraq. It was a miserable stay, and I hardly got any sleep. I tend to be quite a picky person, but not unreasonable. It's not a cheap hotel or hostel. The next day, my fellow companions (the tour had 36 passengers) all had the same problem. Many said they couldn't sleep and felt that it was very wrong how we were treated. We weren't all Americans either, there were 6 Brits and 4 Australians, and many Canadians. I don't know for sure if it was just a fluke and the AC broke the day we were there, but if I were travelling to Frankfurt in the summer, I would not stay there again. The rooms are dark and small, and for the same money, I'm sure there are much better hotels. On our return trip (the tour goes in a big circle), we stayed at the Frankfurt Holiday Inn, and that hotel was marvelous. It had a circular drive, renovated lobby, bar and the rooms were bright, spacious and many had a balcony. It was about the same price as the 'Worst Western'.", "Date": "Jun 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR514309829", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tacobar"}, {"Content": "Good Choice This hotel offers a good value and is located in Bockenheim, close to the Palmengarten which is not directly in the city center. It is rather small and has average sized rooms with an interior which is not new but well kept. Everything is very clean and pleasant. The style is not modern but not old fashioned either. The breakfast buffet is really good. At the moment they are adding a spa area in the top floor which will contain a steam bath, sauna etc. NOTE: the hotel does have a parking garage in the basement, but you have to get there in an elevator!!! This can be very problematic with a larger car and even with a normal car you are always afraid of ramming something.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR464285738", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BAS7"}, {"Content": "\u752f\u509d\ue51c\u9366\u822c\u4eb1\u9288\u5910\u4ee9\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19170898, 'full');", "Date": "May 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR143712604", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "F\u7709r Gesch\u76f2ftsreisen ok   showReview(11309761, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR581529989", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d199323-r13992131-Best_Western_Imperial_Hotel_Am_Palmengarten-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "199323", "Price": "$135"}}
