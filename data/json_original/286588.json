You guys didn't let me down! It is a fair distance from the city centre but we used the nearest Metro stop at Bologna to get in and out . As previously mentioned, it is only a 10 minute walk across a safe, quiet neighbourhood. The hotel hand out a piece of paper with details of the Metro and bus links, but we couldn't figure out which bus number went where, so we stuck to the Metro instead. To get to Fenix from FCO airport, use the 30-minute Leonardo Express (11 euros) to the Termini, then Bologna is just three stops east on Line B. On arrival we used the Left Luggage at the Termini so we could make the best use of our time exploring the city, before retiring to the hotel at the end of the day (for more details on this, I found a good website http://www.roninrome.com with lots of travellers tips in Rome). We stayed on the third floor overlooking the main road, but the windows are very well insulated and you'd only hear the odd noisy motorbike in the room. In terms of interior quality, ours was fine if a little dark yet everything was clean and in good order. Same goes for the rest of the hotel - it is generally in good condition. It has a nice garden for guest use, too. Bad points? Well, there is a PC for guests to use which I assumed was free but we were hit with a modest (and surprising) 5 euro charge upon checkout, and while the restaurant served good food in the evening it was totally lacking in atmosphere - they leave the flat screen TV on! There was a mini bar in the room but no coffee or tea making facilities either. Breakfast was very good with a wide choice of food and drink. Staff were all very friendly and helpful too. We had a 7:30am flight home on the Sunday and they booked us a Mercedes taxi to the airport for 58 euros which wasn't bad value - this included credit card charges and a tip. Finally, I'd recommend purchasing a ROMA-PASS for your stay in Rome. This gives each person two cards; one for free transport travel (Metro/bus) and the other for two free passes to tourist attractions, both valid for three days from first use.

It is now showing its age as with most its very rude staff. The rooms are ok and have good AC, but they are tired and old and cleanliness could be better. I had mould around the bath and a spilt drink from the previous guest was all over the wall. I stayed for 4 nights of which 1 day my room was not serviced at all. A used room service tray stayed in my room from the first day until I check out and my mini bar was not re-filled. Sheets were not changed once. The Reception staff are the rudest you will come across - REALLY! As Hotels in Rome can get filled up and expensive, if your not fussy and not looking for service then this is just ok but I would not return.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4003735", "Content": "After having a less than desirable hotel last year in Rome, the Hotel Fenix was a wonderful surprise. This hotel had a warm and cozy feel about it, which may be due to its small size. Besides all the amenities one could expect in a European hotel, they even had free internet access. The location being in a residential neighborhood is a bit away from the sights, however, it is very easy to get around by taxi or public transportation. While the room was small, it was nicely furnished, and the bathroom appeared to be brand new. The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful, and although we only had breakfast in the restaurant, it was more than adequate. The outdoor garden area was a real treat. There you found comfortable furniture under canvas gazebos where you could spend leisure time reading a book and having a glass of wine. This was great! I will definitely return to the Hotel Fenix on my next trip to Rome, and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSuperb hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3437913", "Content": "We have just returned from a four day break in Rome...After reading so many reviews on the very different accommodation on offer we decided to choose the Fenix Hotel. From the moment of stepping through the doors the staff were both friendly and very helpful. Information on local transport was very useful as the taxi drivers in Rome tend to rip people off ie 75 euro from the airport to the hotel!!!!! The local bus stop is just around the corner from the hotel and the 84 or 36 takes you straight into the city centre about a 30 min journey Monday to Saturday they run up until midnight but on a Sunday the last bus back to the hotel is around 8.30. Just a short stroll from the Fenix there are a few nice, reasonable priced places to eat, the area is safe and fairly quiet for Rome. The bedrooms are very nicely furnished, very clean and of a good size. Breakfast too was very enjoyable and we weren't given dirty looks when we arrived late one morning.....Thanks to all the staff you were great!!! Would definately stay here on our next trip to Rome, especially as we now know how to get around on public transport.", "Date": "May 4, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Fenix", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d286588-Reviews-Hotel_Fenix-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$95 - $227*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Viale Gorizia 5-7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00198</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "286588", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/08/14/0814092ad7fad359260a88b543b2221d7large.jpg"}}
