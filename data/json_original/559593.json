The Hackesche H\u00f6fe, the TV tower at the Alexanderplatz and lots of nice and original shops at M\u00fcnzstra\u00dfe and Alte Sch\u00f6nhauser Stra\u00dfe are located just around the corner. Depeding which room you boo\u1e31 you have either some traffic noise or a nice balcony to the back. The rooms are spacious and modern furnished (including dishwasher and a stove where you could cook small meals and a coffee maker). The famous \"Spreewaldgurken\" (Spreewald cucumbers) are complimentary, the minibar (some drinks and crisps) is quite expensive). Unforunately my room did not have a fullsize mirror so I had to step on my bed to check my outfit. The bed is comfortable with lots of different cushions. The shower is a \"rainshower\", very nice. The breakfast is EUR 14 which is quite expensive. When we had breakfast at 10:30h (it is served until 11h) the buffet was almost empty and only after asking the staff if some more eggs were available the quite slow staff arranged some more food. I would recommend to just walk around the corner to one of the nice and very cheap street cafes for breakfast. The hotel is sponsored by Adidas (you will receive a voucher for the Adidas Flagship Store around the corner) the staff is dressed completely in Adidas which is a quite unusual sight (even the cleaning personal wears green training suits). The hairdresser in the ground floor (Beate Kahlcke) is quite expensive but very good (an Aveda salon) so I can recommend it if you plan to have a nice 'do for the evening. All in all the Lux11 is a good starting point for your city trip to Berlin. The rooms are quite big, very modern and clean and the location is just perfect (but kind of noisy but that's the price for living so central).

As far as the location, this was great, right near the subway and within easy walking distance to most of the sights. However, if you want any kind of privacy on your stay DO NOT STAY HERE. There is absolutely no privacy whatsoever when showering. The shower and wash basin area are all part of the bedroom and have no door or curtain to separate the two. Whoever you are staying with will have the pleasure (or not so much!) of watching you shower, and vice versa!!! You will be happy to know however that the toilet has a sliding door! I felt as if the hotel was more style over substance. They did add nice touches like the White Company products to use and some lovely slippers and everything looked quite clean, modern and funky but I wouldn't say it was anything to write home about and, as above, the room may have looked funky but really was not practical. To add to the impracticality of the room, there were no drawers in our room, only a small hanging wardrobe area with a shelf above (and ours was not a standard room, but a deluxe one). The staff did help us out with anything we asked for. I found them to be pleasant. However the hotel to me is more of an apartment complex. The rooms are set up with kitchen areas for you to use as you wish. I think this would be more suited to people needing this type of facility. The hotel also has a salon and a restaurant attached, none of which I used though. Other than that I was not aware of any hotel facilities other than a wash room (the iron of which nearly burnt a whole through my dress and I overheard one guest saying his clothes were stuck in the washing machine as the door handle had broken!!!). If you want a luxury hotel with good facilities I wouldn't recommend it. If you want somewhere in a good location that looks funky and has kitchen facilities in the room (and you don't mind being exposed when showering) then go for it!!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carzago Riviera (BS)", "Title": "\u201cBoutique Hotel in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "Carlamaisondecharme", "ReviewID": "UR123920854", "Content": "Lux 11 is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Berlin.

When I watched the video on the website, I was really drawn to the place and booked a room immediately as my partner and I were going to Berlin for a Hotel conference. I would however like to share with you some quotes that were shown on their marketing video which is on the Design Hotels website: \"In the end, everything depends on the people\" (Quote by co-founder Elmo Hagendorf) \"It's a people's business\" (Quote by co founder Tom Tanzer) \"We don't do hotels, we create concepts\" After my stay at Lux 11, I can say that out of the three above quotes, only one of them is true. In my opinion, this hotel is anything but a people's business. The service wasn't bad, it just isn't great. They pass the minimum satisfactory level, but in a luxury boutique hotel, one would expect much better. The blonde receptionist was cold as the temperature outside - 0 degrees. She was also quite defensive at times with no sense of humour By the way, Lux 11 isn't a hotel. They market themselves as an apart/hotel but decide when it's best for them to be a hotel or apartments. Therefore, your expectations and then your experience of the place is somewhat confusing. The bedrooms are very design-led. The shower is right next to the bed so you have a bit of a problem if your partner wakes up earlier than you to take a shower, because you have to switch on all the lights in the bedroom. I cannot deny however that the quality of all the furnishings were to a high quality. So to the third quote \"We don't do hotels, we create concepts\".

The rooms were ok, spacious and clean overall. What annoyed me was the service. There are only two ppl in service after evening time (one was friendly but the other one was pretty cold and unhelpful), and everytime i needed something they asked me go to the reception to get it myself. They charged me a 10euros deposit just for borrowing an ethernet cable and said that if i didnt' bring it back to the reception or left it in the room when i checked out, the 10 euros would be charged. Also, we noticed that the housekeeping didn't replace our shampoo and shower gel after a few days, and when we asked for it at the reception, they gave us some and told us that they weren't supposed to replace those normally.

Our room was a corner room on the last floor, as I had requested. Early check-in was a piece of cake, and all of the receptionists were very polite and the service was really good.

This was really appreciated! Service was really what I would expect for a 4-star hotel. I've read in another review about the sportsclothes the receptionists wear. Well, as it seems this is rather subjective, but I really liked their outfit. It helped me feel more relaxed, instead of the standard \"secretary\" look receptionists usually have. Speaking of subjectiveness..Regarding the modern shower that is separated with a glass and mirror from the rest of the room. It is not a big deal really, even if you travel with friends, since there are so easy ways not to have view of the person in the shower, ...watching TV, lying in bed, surfing the internet from the desk, see the beautiful view from the windows..The heating system is another thing I really enjoyed. Not only the heater is modern, but the room was so warm and sleep was so resting. I can't say really how much I like everything about the room. Check-in, check-out process were fast and smooth. The location is so convenient, too. Drawbacks? Well, usually there are some. 1) Internet is not free, which is strange for our days and for the capital city of Germany, 2) the price is rather high for Berlin, since breakfast was not included in the 130euros/night for a \"deluxe\" type of room (this was a special disount offer, which means that rooms cost even more)-this is expensive for Berlin, I think. 3) Everythink in the mini bar is charged..to the pricey side...4) no room service after 23:00, 5) only half of the towels were replaced with clean (3-nights stay), and the used shampoo/shower gel was not replaced two days in a row (certainly we asked and we were given)!

We had dinner & drinks at the hotel's amazing restaurant, called Shiro I Shiro-a Mediterranean/Japanese fusion restaurant where I enjoyed a salmon fois gras tobiko sushi roll. Delectable! Our 'value' room was very sleek, simple, spacious & modern, equipped with a comfortable bed, a \"balcony\" (though it's really just a window) & a flat screen TV. The only peculiar thing was that the shower is a glass partition in the bathroom--perhaps something to think about if you're not sharing the room with a lover or close friend. The bathroom, however, is separate (with the tallest door ever) & does lend itself to privacy. The complimentary toiletries were of really high quality, so much so that we definitely packed them up & I still have them in my bathroom back home. The exterior of the building is gorgeous & lit up in pink at nighttime. The receptionists were for the most part, very nice, except for one person who was rather short with us. They offer free lighters, guides & complimentary midnight snacks of hot dogs, buns, canned pickles & tea. In our jet-lagged, whirlwind 2-day trip to Berlin, Lux 11 was perfect place for our every need: convenient, clean & tres chic without being fussy! Within walking distance, we were able to reach all of what Mitte had to offer & the fascinating surrounding neighborhoods of Berlin are easily accessible by the metro & S-Bahn. Our favorite neighborhood (& there are so many) was certainly Kreuzberg.

Rainfall shower with Korres products which was a nice touch. Comfortable, clean and friendly.

Thomas T\u00e4nzer is the owner/general manager. I was with clients and colleagues on a business trip. Lux 11 looks good on the surface. The rooms were fun in look and feel. The fun and comfort stopped when the hotel's internet service went down and stayed down for nearly 24 hours. Our client was not amused and had to seek an internet cafe at midnight while severely jet lagged in a foreign place to deal with e-mails back in the States. None of the rest of the team were amused either. Not good. In the morning, I let the front desk know that if the internet was not restored by the time we returned from our meetings around 5pm, we'd have to check out. They were in agreement. When in fact 5pm hit, there was no internet. Out we had to go, but not without a fight and room charges for late check-outs. The owner/gm wouldn't come out of his office to speak to me live. Instead he used his employees to do perform his dirty work. Now, please note that The Circus Hotel, way cheaper room rates, offers FREE Internet service and even loans out laptops for FREE. Back then, we moved to the Radisson next to the Dom, where all internet services worked beautifully. The next day Thomas T\u00e4nzer called me at my request to hopefully discuss the issue and obtain an apology or a make-good of some sort. All he did was yell at me, insult me and threaten me. I politely told him that I was hanging up on him and I hung up. He had the gumption to call back. I'd say he missed the class of Customer Service 101 & Never Read the Article How To Be A Gentleman.

I am a collector of Adidas and this hotel has strong ties to the Adidas brand. Additionally I love to eat pickles and this hotel oddly enough has pickles in every room. I really wanted to love this hotel but it was simply not possible. The reasons being: 1) No help with luggage upon arrival or getting to room. Once I was in room and noticed it was quite small and not the suite I had expected, I asked to switch rooms. That request was honored however I had to go down and retrieve the new keys myself and move all my own luggage. Not so Lux if you ask me. 2)There were endless buttons in the room and everything was very hard to figure out. Since there was nobody to show me to my room upon arrival- none of these things were explained. Making the room dark turned out to be a task in itself. 3) I could never figure out how to turn on the Air Conditioning. Finally I inquired and they said that the remote was at the front desk and I would have to pay 15 Euros per night for use of the air conditioner. $350 per night and no complementary Air Conditioning. Not so Lux. 4) No iron or ironing board. Usually in hotels of this caliber there is one in every room or at least one can be brought within minutes by housekeeping. Not so here. At the Lux 11, there is one communal ironing board tucked away deep in the basement. So when you step out of the shower and need to iron a few wrinkles out of your shirt at the last minute before a meeting be prepared to trek to the basement and than wait for the iron to be available. 5) I left behind a solid gold lighter which a friend went to retrieve 2 hours later and they claimed to not have found it. 6) Upon reviewing my AMEX statement, I noticed a charge of 180EUROS after my checkout. They said this may be for damages to the room but they were not sure and said they would call me back, they never did. I made no damages to the room and also did not smoke in the room(I had a balcony for that) so I went ahead and initiated a dispute with AMEX for the charge. 7) They refused to give me the promised 15% off coupon for Adidas despite featuring it on their website. Since they gave me a room upgrade I was not eligible for the coupon. 8) After I posted this review initially, they sent me a threatening e-mail accusing me of consuming illicit substances in their room and threatening to call the police!", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt", "Title": "\u201cGreatest place for a stay in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "Steff1", "ReviewID": "UR36238202", "Content": "We were first unsure about the location but found out, that the location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing (close to Museumsinsel) and night life as well.

Fhe first appointed room was not their standard square room in this category, but a corner room, that way the actual usage space of the room was tiny, no space even to put one bigger suitcase. After complaining we learned that all the other rooms in this category were booked out. We were only offered higher category rooms, for a much higher price. The prices were even much higher than the price we would have paid on the website through which we booked our room. Pointing that out to the front desk manager we were told that he cannot give us the room for that website price, since they will sell these rooms anyway for the high price. Eventually they downgraded us to the lowest category room. That room was still a bit bigger than the corner room in our booked higher category, but still was tiny, tiny, tiny. It was facing the street, even though the hotel advertises its windows as sound proof, they are not. The noise of the traffic will wake you up very early in the morning. Within three nights, we never did not get our normal category room. On top of it the personal was very rude not only to us, but to a biz partner who called in and afterwards he was connected to the wrong room.

I\u00b4ve visited lots of famous buildings, museums and stores, which were all easy to reach by bus or train. All in all I can say that I had a very nice vacation in Berlin and in the Lux 11. The friendly atmosphere helped me to feel comfortable in the hotel and I can say that I would recomment the hotel to everyone who want\u00b4s to have a pleasent stay in Berlin. If you want to get an impression of the hotel by yourself it might be helpful to take a look at the website [---] because there you can find a very detailed description of the hotel with lots of pictures.

We booked a Junior Suite (35sqm) which had a small kitchen (2 hotplates, microwave, dishwasher, kettle, toaster and sink), fax machine, two large heaters, separate bathroom and toilet , flat screen TV and a large king bed. We had broadband internet access (although hotel charges tiered rates) and the staff were relatively helpful and friendly. We did have one issue with the car parking - the Agent's website (who receive their information directly from the hotel) advertised free parking, which was the primary reason for choosing this hotel. It turned out that the parking was actually 18 Euro per night, which equated to AUD90.00. As a gesture of goodwill, the hotel did not charge us for one night's parking, but it was disappointing to be so misled. Also, you need to have a small car - 4WD will not fit into the parking garage. The hotel is located 2mins walk from Alexanderplatz where you'll find trams, trains and buses (Just a hint - don't get a sightseeing bus for 20Euro each, just jump on either the number 100 or 200 bus from Alexanderplatz and it will take you all over the city for a fraction of the cost - minus the audio). The hotel's also located next to the Galleria, which has a massive food and deli section so taking advantage of the kitchen and making a home cooked meal is recommended if you've been travelling for a while. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for its fresh, new decor, the friendly staff and the location.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "marienwerder", "Title": "\u201cLux11***GREAT***\u201d", "Author": "Dagobert00", "ReviewID": "UR10059275", "Content": "Great design, comfortable rooms directly in the center.

The only reasons I would not give an excellent rating is because there were some failings. The sink in the room looked amazing but only served up very hot water. Yes, it is an apartment but to not service the room for 3 days is awkward. The floors are painted light green so quickly get really dirty, the bin is small and so fills up (with no where to empty it downstairs/outside) etc.. I think if they were to consider a light clean every day and then change bedding every 3.

The location is excellent if you wish to explore everything that Berlin has to offer. However, I was here on business and just wanted a comfortable bed for the night, as I had an early start. The hotel looks incredibly stylish from the outside, and the rooms are also deliciously style conscious. The simple, sleek and elegant feel and look to the rooms makes them feel quite homely despite the lack of colour. The only drawback for me is that the hotel is geared towards the trendy traveller, rather than the functional business traveller. I arrived after the reception had closed, and the process of obtaining my room key was far from simple - I had to go to the restaurant and phone through my credit card details. The room is nice, but as I've said, not for the business traveller. I couldn't get an internet connection for my laptop and there was no room service - things that I'm sure the average tourist can live without.

It's the absolute perfect location for anyone who wants to be in the center of Berlin's burgeoning creative scene. You'll be surrounded by high-style boutiques, hip restaurants, and cool nightclubs. Also near many U-Bahn and S-Bahn stops, so it's easy to get to all corners of the city. And the building is former housing for the secret police...a little bit of East Berlin history to add to the place's mystique. I have read most of the reviews here and think the people who hated it had the wrong expectations. One thing should be made very clear: this is not a 4-star hotel that will cater to your every need. There is no room service, no concierge, no minibar, and bed turndown/room cleaning is done every third day. Sounds odd for a hotel, but because these rooms are more like small apartments, it seems to work. You get a rather chic, fully stocked little kitchenette (all the tools you need to prepare a dinner for 4) and a good DVD/CD player. It's kinda like being home. Also, this is not the place to stay if you're sharing a room with friends or coworkers...or if you're shy. There is very little separating the shower and the bedroom (just a step up and a clear glass divider). Again, sounds odd, but I found the use of space and overall design to be artful and ingeneous. I was there during moderate weather in August, so air conditioning was not an issue. I found the rooms to be airy, light-filled (very high ceilings with lots of large windows), quiet, and extremely comfortable (great bed). When you do need maintenance of some sort, they are fast and efficient. When we arrived, there was a small problem with the window (not shutting all the way and letting in some street noise). The problem was fixed within 10 minutes and the room became silent (and we were on the first floor right above the street). It's a very solid building. Long story short: for the independent, unfussy, style-conscious traveler, Lux 11 is an excellent and affordable choice.
