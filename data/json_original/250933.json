Couldn't really find much and the more I read the more I thought it would be nice to stay away from the hubbub of Venice and be near a beach. Like two holidays in one and commuting by boat each day ( only 10 mins) was part of the fun! Arriving was easy. Bought a 72 hr travel card in airport for 33euros each and took the number 5 bus to p. Roma (the main bus station). Don.t bother paying the extra 6 Euros form the express bus as it isn't necessary. Maybe save you 5 minutes tops but the number 5 is included in travel card and it only takes about 20 minutes to town ven with some local stops. Getting on the number 1 vaporetto and travelling den the Grand canal was the best way to arrive and get an idea of the city layout. Loved it. The hotel was very close to the ferry stop. About five mins down main st and then turn right. The hotel is in a quiet back street and lovely and quiet. The decor looks brand new. Desk staff checked us in and very friendly. The room was fine. Larger than most I'd seen but about average travelodge layout and size (but a lot more contemporary and stylish) however I had booked a superior room on Expedia deal so dd ask if it was a superior room as it didn't seem to have anything extra to it. They seemed confused by the question so think the night staff (after 7pm ish) maybe didn't understand English quite as well. Asked again the next morning and they said they would ask management so we didn't worry too much as room was fine and spotlessly clean. The next morning the lady on the desk said we had a largish room but not a superior one and she would reduce our stay by not charging for breakfast. I hadn't realised the expedia deal was room only so this was helpful. I was slightly disappointed as had booked it as a special wedding anniversary but at the nod of the day it was still a lovely room (315) and good value for Venice so didn't complain. There was free wifi (you need a code each day from reception) and breakfast room was never full for us and plenty to eat. Cereals, toast, yummy croissants, juice, eggs, ham, cheeses, usual continental stuff. The hotel also had pretty garden which would be lovely when weather a bit warmer. Restaurants on lido were much better food and value than venice. We ate twice at al do mati on main st and when we got a bit sck of pizza and pasta there was a lovely Indian/thali place called Buddha bar almost by the turn for the hotel which we'd recommend esp for vegetarians ( but they do plenty of meat stuff too). Would definitely return to lido and ths hotel. We spent be day hiring bikes and cycled all over the island. The Pine Forest and beach at far end of used was pretty. Hired bikes at 'lidon' just off main st at ferry end. Only 7.50 for bike each. Good value. No deposit req. just leave driving licence or passport. Loved Venice but loved having an escape route too. The vaporetto service was amazing. So easy to use and ultra reliable. Runs all night too but we didn't use it after midnight. We allowed 2 hours to get back to airport for flight home and that was easily enough as we took the faster 5.2 line back to p.roma. Hope this is useful.

It was a short walk from the vaporetti terminal and a seemingly world apart from the \"madness\" that is Venice. The Lido is wonderful.

Takes about 10 mins on the waterbus from the Lido to San Marco Square (waterbus leaves every 10 mins). Excellent value for money and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel has been newly renovated so all rooms are beautiful, clean and modern. As an added bonus, there is also free WiFi although you have to get a new username and password daily from the front desk. We offer some advice for the trip in general. Venice is very expensive but there are some ways to save money. Firstly from the airport, the main transport to Venice and the Lido is via the private waterbus company, Alilaguna. Airport to Venice or the Lido trips are 15 Euros per person (25 return) but you can get a travel card for the public transport system for much cheaper (e.g. 36 Euros for 72 hours) and this includes the bus from the airport to Venice, at this point waterbus service is available as part of the travel card. As you will most likely need the waterbus service unless you are taking water taxis which is quite expensive, it is worth buying a travel card at the aiport when you arrive to access the bus to get you to Venice. Travel on bus/waterbus from the airport to the Lido takes an extra 30 mins approximately relative to the Alilaguna boat service but will save you 25 Euros per person. On a final note about transport, we were very impressed with how efficient it was. We often sat outside and got some amazing pictures. We also recommend taking it around the island to get a good perspective of the island and points of interest. Other advice we offer is about eating out at restaurants, which can be very expensive. Many places have a cover charge as well as service charge of 12% for sit down service. The cover charge (coperto) is from 2-3 Euros per person. There are quite a few restuarants that do not charge this and makes the meal much more reasonably priced if you can find them. This information is written in the menu so take a look at the menu before sitting down to eat. Finally, beware of hidden charges everywhere, such as for using public toilets which cost 1.50 Euros per use. There is a Museum card that can be purchased for entry to some galleries and museums and this includes access to toilets (40 Euros for 7 days - no shorter option). But if you do not get this, make use of toilet facilities in restaurants and places like McDonalds (one of the few places to get coffee in a \"to-go\" cup). I know this sounds cheap but it is amazing how quickly you can find your money leaving your wallet. These are just a couple of tips that we discovered while there. We would strongly recommend Venice and the Villa Pannonia to anyone. It is expensive but is a beautiful city and worth the trip.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cService was very bad\u201d", "Author": "KenValB", "ReviewID": "UR120279422", "Content": "All I can say is the Service was very Bad.

Most of the other reviews have said all the positives about the extremely helpful and pleasant staff, which they certainly were. It is a small boutique hotel with around 30 rooms. Great location for catching the waterbus (Vaporetto) to Venice and also the airport, but being away from the crowds at the end of the day, which was most welcome. When you disembark from the boat, head for the main street - 'Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta,' walk about 300m down the right side of the road and the hotel is signposted off to the right, tucked behind the 'Grande Albergo Ausonia & Hungaria' on the main street. The rooms were both similar, but one with a lighter shower room (no baths) as had a window. Mine was dark and lacked shelving to put essentials. The bedroom was smartly decorated, but the dressing table/desk did not have a mirror on the wall. The nearest (only one) was a full length one on another wall. Not ideal for putting on make-up or doing hair, bearing in mind there was no where in the bathroom to put these items under the mirror. The towels were clean but thin. However, these are minor niggles. It was lovely and quiet and very comfortable. There were one or two small things which needed sorting and this was attended to immediately. It is worth mentioning our first breakfast on the Saturday morning was chaotic. Breakfast was served until 10.00 every morning and we went down at 9.30. The dining room which is small, was full and there was only one waiter (who was lovely and worked really hard) attending. The milk ran out, the water in the hot drinks machine for coffee etc., ran out and the orange juice (which is UHT not fresh) ran out too! It was a while before this was sorted. We went down half an hour earlier the next day and it was much better. Tip, if you want a good cup of coffee/cappucino, ask the waiter/waitress to get it from the machine at the bar, not the help yourself one, which dispenses all the tea etc and tastes poor. The former is superior and happily provided. It is a typical continental help yourself breakfast with cold meat, cheese, croissants, cake, small selection of cereals and hard boiled eggs. The only disappointment was the bread. There were only small hard bread rolls - no toast or sliced bread. There is a pleasant little patio garden outside too.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago,IL", "Title": "\u201cClean good location great service\u201d", "Author": "DanielleChicagoIL", "ReviewID": "UR116237363", "Content": "While a ten minute boat ride from st marks, it is a very nice respite from all the noise and crowds of the main area of Venice Rooms clean and comfortable and staff is very helpful Great breakfast and plenty of restaurants close by Also short walk to the beach if you wanted that opportunity", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a great location.

I travelled with 4 other people and we had 3 rooms amoungst us. All 3 rooms were very nicely decorated. They were very clean and although not overly spacious, they were not compact either. We were not disappointed at all in the location. Lido has numerous boats and from the \"bus stop\" it is about an 8-10 minute walk to the hotel. Turn right out of the \"bus stop\" and the first street past the main street is Via Michiel Doge Domenico (there is also a sign saying Villa Pannonia... and pointing down the street). There are numerous places to eat nearby and Lido is a destination that anyone going to Venice should also visit. You almost forget you are in Venice since Lido is an island that has vehicles. It is the only island around Venice that does have vehicles. From the hotel, it is about another 6-10 minute walk to the beach. We were not here during prime time which I understand is quite hectic around Lido. This is a place where all the Italians go to get away. But back to the hotel.... the staff was wonderful! When we got there, they gave us a map of Venice, showed us some good places to eat, visit, and to explore. They helped us with our luggage to the rooms and made sure all was well. The rooms were decent size wise and very clean. The biggest disappointment was the size of the shower. In 2 of the rooms it was pretty tight. The other room the shower was much larger (room 321). The beds were comfortable, There was cable TV (if you really need to watch while on vacation) and the breakfasts in the morning were very good. They have a good spread of breads, cheese, meat, fruits, cereals, yogurt, and a coffee machine that offers expresso, cuppochino, tea, and more. This was a nice way to start the morning and fuel up for the day. I also recommend that you buy a 24-36-48... hour bus pass. You can hop on and off the \"bus boats\" and there are several which stop in Lido. This is also a great way to cruise the Grand Canal. It takes about 20-25 minutes from the train station/ piazza Roma to get to Lido. Again.... this hotel was great. We also went to Rome, Florence, and Pisa and this was voted our nicest place.

Also Lido was supposed to be cheaper for food etc. We landed in Treviso and found it really easy to get our bus ticket for the ATVO bus which took you straight to the Piazzle Roma where you can pretty much get a boat anywhere in Venice. We'd bought a pass for 33 Euro for 3 days from Venice Connected and I can't recommend this enough. Them money you will save is astounding. We hopped on the Number 1 which was quite a slow ride if you're wanting to get to Lido fast but it goes down the Grand Canal so you get to see the best bits of Venice. About 40mins later we got to Lido. As soon as you leave the vaparetto station go straight up the main street that you'll see infront of you, keep on the right hand pavement and walk up the road until you get to a very large, beautiful hotel with all kinds of artwork on it. Turn right at that hotel then left and you will see the Hotel Villa Pannonia on the right hand side. Check in was very swift, the lady on reception was absolutely lovely and spoke English very well! The rooms were a perfect size for the 2 of us and the bathroom was lovely! The shower was the best I've used in Europe and only coming second to a shower in Lake Tahoe. We arrived around lunchtime so decided to explore the island. We walked for ages and got a bit lost but it was all part of the fun and we easily found our way back to the front of the island again. I'd recommend going for a leisurely stroll, it's a much cleaner place to 'get lost' than Venice in my opinion. The food was a LOT cheaper than Venice and was lovely. The staff couldn't do enough for you and the Pizzeria's on the main street are the best! Venice is definitely a place to see but be cautious, unless of course you're prepared from previous trips, to pay over the odds at a lot of places. We went for a drink and pizza at a cafe on the front and ended up paying 43 Euros for 2 mini pizzas, a beer and a campari cocktail. Luckily we just found it funny but my boyfriend drew the line at sitting in St Mark's Square and paying 8 Euros 80c for a bottle of water plus 6 Euros each for the music cover charge! The Villa Pannonia was an excellent base for our stay, yes the breakfast was the same everyday but the selection was so varied you could stay a full week and not repeat yourself! I had croissants, proscuitto, ham and cheese with a glass of orange and a cup of green tea everyday. They had yoghurts, cereal, fruit, crackers, bread rools, Philly Cheese, Nutella, Honey, Jam, the list goes on! It filled us both until past lunchtime each day. On the last night we had dinner on Lido and the weather took an awful turn and started to thunder, lighten and rain so we retreated back to the hotel bar and we wished we'd done this every night. The lady on reception was so accomodating, explained to me what a Spritz was and when the barman left she even came and poured more drinks for us and topped up our bar snacks. And added bonus, the wifi, although I receievd a username and password on a piece of paper saying it would be 20 euros for 24 hours (broken down not just 1 day), was free! I cannot recommend this hotel or compliment their staff enough. If we come back to Venice we will be sure to stay on Lido and return to the Hotel Villa Pannonia.

The hotel had excellent service and very friendly staff. Rooms were very spacious and new, with a modern decor. The bathroom was new and nicely done. Overall it was very cosy. The only problem was that I could not have a shower standing (and I am only 184cm tall) since the bath tub was below the low end of the ceiling.

It is only a 15 minute boat ride from Piazza San Marco, and a great way to escape the confusion and crowds in Venice.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel & Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "samanthajaneleigh", "ReviewID": "UR47910500", "Content": "Had a pleasant stay in this hotel, came with a group from college for the Venice Biennale 2009 so it was booked by lecturers and not myself. I was expecting something less fancy to be honest. It is very modern (chic) and the rooms are basic, designed to a high standard and very clean. (If you were looking for somewhere a bit cosy, historical or romantic this hotel would not really be the one.) The staff were all very nice, I asked for spare blankets/pillows and the man at the front desk couldn't have been more helpful. There is no bar but this was not a problem as I prefer to discover bars etc. outside of hotels. The breakfast was amazing and there was a large selection to choose from. Note: If you suffer from motion sickness I would recommend staying in Venice centre rather than Lido as it is an extra 30 min boat ride there and back each day. I would definitely come back to stay in this hotel!!!

I highly recommend this hotel if you're on a budget (and who isn't :). Staying in Lido has the benefit that you get to enjoy breakfast in the Main St. of Lido which is a gorgeous place by itself and then the beautiful vaporetto ride into Venice each morning. The hotel is very close 10 min. walk to the water taxi station and there are many restaurants near the hotel, including an internet cafe and a mini shopping mart. What makes the hotel awesome is the value for money. The rooms were basic but clean, the bathroom was nice size and not cramped which I liked and the showers and everything worked great. The staff was SUPER friendly and always willing to help. They even told me where I could find a automatic laundry in Venice (there is only one in the entire city and it would've been difficult to locate if not for the directions because it's tucked away in some alley).", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cTop hotel - great value\u201d", "Author": "Timetraveller1", "ReviewID": "UR5628294", "Content": "This hotel was brilliant.

Location is good, about a 5 minute pleasant walk from the vaporetto stops and plenty of shops, restaurants etc in the area. I did elect to get a taxi from the vaporetto stop,costing 5 euros, well worth it, as I was feeling tired after my journey from UK. The hotel is basic but clean. I was on the 3rd floor - a long way to climb stairs with heavy bags - as there is no lift. Had a double room, single occupancy, at a good price.The shower in the bathroom was one of the best - powerful and hot - great after all the walking and exploration of Venice during the day! There is a small bar area - a bit faded but functional - but no lounge area. It was pleasant sitting in the gardens with a relaxing drink and daydreaming.... The hotel served breakfast and evening dinner was optional. Breakfast was buffet continental but plenty of variety and ample. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Room facilities were basic but clean.The tv remote control came in useful - not for changing channels as the batteries were dead - but gave me that essential extra couple of inches to reach the buttons on the TV manually!!! The telephone was on a shelf above the bed. As the flex was not very long, if you wanted to use the phone, you could not take it off the shelf and had to stand on the bed to reach and use it.There was no safe in the room but valuables can be put in the hotel safe. One annoying aspect was that the room lock was very temperamental and only locked after several attempts. Other guests had similar problems too,as you could hear them struggling with their keys!! Would I stay here again? Location was good, staff good, price was good. Probably would do but may try a hotel on the main island in Venice next time. Of course, if I did that, I would miss the wonderful water bus ride and grand entrance into Venice. The journey is an unforgettable experience itself and within about 12 - 15 minutes, you can be in St. Mark's Square. Travel to and from the Lido is frequent so no worries there.
