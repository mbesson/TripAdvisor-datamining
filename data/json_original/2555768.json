So we had to upgrade to a room with two beds, still very small room, with how much they charged for this type of rooms, you can stay somewhere else around this great location that would offered a much bigger better room, please don't make the same mistake I made, read about their rooms before booking!", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cLocation Location Location!\u201d", "Author": "HarmonyGirl88", "ReviewID": "UR138165173", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here from July 9th to July 13th, 2012. This hotel is a definite hidden gem. The location is the key. Close to all shopping locations, 5 minutes to the beach, main strip, car rentals, and 2-3 minute walk to the bus stop that took us to the Diamond Head Crater. I'm not sure what some reviewers were talking about when they say this hotel was in a poor location... it was in a fantastic location!! Perhaps they wanted to be far away from everything? Across the street from the hotel is an ABC store and a \"ROSS ROSS\" store where you can do some great shopping! The concierge and front desk workers were very friendly. Dustin gave us many great spots to visit on the island. We were huge LOST fans and the minute we mentioned it, Dustin told us about the Hummer LOST tour which ended up being one of the highlights of our trip!!! It was convenient to have water, tea, and coffee available to their customers. Bring an empty reusable water bottle! No need to buy plastic bottled water! Rooms: Bedroom area was great, beds were comfortable. The only thing I didn't like was the washroom. It was old and small. The balcony felt unsafe to step onto. Would be nice if it was enclosed with a patio chair, so that we can hang our wet bathing suits outside. Other than that, we loved the location and staff.

Throw in free wi-fi and morning coffee, and it makes this a pretty good value stay for the price paid. We just wanted a central location and didn't plan to spend much time at the hotel anyway. ROOMS: We booked a standard two double room category which we knew would be pretty basic in amenities. It was. The decoration, the furniture, the tub/shower combination, and cheap soap bar gave a motel-like impression but . We were on the 7th floor and there was only a view of other hotels, even from our balcony. SERVICE: Front desk team was very friendly and eager to help with suggestions on places to eat. One of the managers even gave detailed directions for me so I wouldn't get lost. AMENITIES: No fitness center, no business center that I can recall, and a really undesirable rooftop pool. It's more like a large tub surrounded by HVAC equipment. Not sexy so don't try to impress a date there. Parking was tough, but it's Waikiki and always tough to get a spot anywhere. The kona coffee in the lobby and free wi-fi was a nice touch though. LOCATION: Probably the best sell point of this hotel. It was half a block from the main shopping street, and two and a half blocks from the waikiki beach -- very walkable and safe at night. Everything in the Waikiki commercial area is easily accessible on foot. CLEANLINESS: It's an older property so it has signs of wear and tear, but I never felt it was dirty or uncomfortable. The lobby has a modern clean finish, which didn't quite match the feeling in the rooms. In the end it was adequately clean.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but parking, bed sizes, pool amenities and guest service were disappointing\u201d", "Author": "HockeyStL", "ReviewID": "UR131936635", "Content": "I made a reservation for the Seaside Hotel Waikiki using a third party bidding service and received a satisfactory price. My 8 year old daughter and I were looking forward to our arrival at this location for the final night of our Hawaii vacation. After driving around Seaside, Kuhio and Ala Wai streets, without successfully locating the entrance among the maze of one-way streets in this section of Waikiki, we finally called the property to get directions. A very nice agent answered the phone and provided simple directions to the parking garage though I observed a complete lack of parking garage signage which would explain our frustration in locating this parking facility. The hotel is in a great location and an easy walk to the beach. The garage itself was among the most cramped I'd observed in Waikiki (which is saying something if you've experienced parking in Waikiki!) and I had a challenge parking our economy-sized Kia. Once parked, we unloaded bags only to learn the elevator doesn't operate to the parking garage! As a result we had to schlep through the garage, up a steep ramp then up stairs in order to reach the front desk. I'm not sure who decided to disable parking garage access for the elevators but someone needs to reconsider this silly policy! Once at the front desk, we were greeted by a cheerful clerk who immediately located our reservation. She then stated we were assigned a room with one double bed. ONE double bed? What is this, 1960? When I objected and asked for a room with at least a queen size bed or two doubles, we received no offer of alternate accommodations. In addition we were hit with a $22 parking fee which was not disclosed by the third party booking agent. Lovely. After disputing this charge upon my return home, since it was not disclosed at the time of the reservation, the property stated they would reverse the charge. The room itself was clean, spacious and comfortable though the Wifi was slow and unresponsive. The toilet was clogged in the bathroom and never flushed properly during the stay. Luckily there was no shortage of hot water or ample water pressure in the shower. We then decided to check out the view from the balcony which didn't even have a single chair to sit and relax, let alone a small table. Fail. Given the spartan room, we changed and headed to the pool which required traversing two flights of stairs in order to reach the roof. The pool itself was lined with a grand total of SIX lounge chairs. Yes. Six. Total. And they were taken. Fail. No towels were available at the pool area which was another essential amenity lacking at this property. Between the noise leakage through the patio door, and the pint-sized bed, sleep was a challenge which negatively impacted our stay given we had a 4:30AM alarm for the early morning departure flight. At checkout, we experienced a clerk (Rick) who seemed more suited for a roadside motel in rural Kansas than at a Waikiki hotel. He never bothered to assess our satisfaction of the stay and when told of our primary issue, the non-functional toilet in the guest room, he simply asked \"are you having a bad day?\" No apology, no empathy, not even an acknowledgement that a toilet that didnt work would be a problem. Now I'll admit I wasn't feeling all warm and fuzzy due to the litany of issues with the stay in addition to the poor night's rest but for Rick to directly confront a frustrated guest in this manner was unacceptable. I later learned this property had been owned by United Air Lines and used as a crew rest hotel. It seems the Seaside Hotel Waikiki has failed to properly upgrade their furnishings, or guest service training program, to accommodate what paying guests at a Waikiki hotel would expect. The internet bidding site I used issued this location 3 stars but I honestly think it's closer to about 1.5 stars given our significant issues related to both the physical accommodations and level of guest service. I would not recommend this location to any friends or family and I'd advise others to perform their due diligence prior to making a reservation.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA Cozy Gem\u201d", "Author": "Allyson M", "ReviewID": "UR130639692", "Content": "In short -- this is a great, no frills hotel with wonderful staff, comfortable rooms, in an excellent location. Excellent value. Location: Perfectly situated in the middle of Waikiki. It's a 5 minute walk to the beach and is surrounded by great restaurants, shopping, and access to transportation. Some of the highlights include an excellent food court 3 doors down, amazing shopping at high end stores (Coach, Chanel, Hermes, etc) literally just around the corner, a well equipped Ross department store across the street, and a small international flea market 1 block away where you could purchase a lot of your souvenirs for friends/family members at reasonable prices. There is a huge duty free galleria 1 block away, and the hotel is one block away from the major bus lines that will take you everywhere you want to go within Oahu, from Ala Moana Mall to Diamond Head Crater and even the North Shore! Also, check out the restaurant directly adjacent to the hotel. If you enjoy caribbean/mexican influenced food, you will not be disappointed. Just beware, rooms with odd numbers have balconies that open up right over the restaurant and can get somewhat noisy at night when the restaurant is busiest. If you want a quieter room, I'd suggest asking for a room that ends in an even number. THE ROOM: The room gives you everything that you could ask for in a place to stay for vacation without all the added frills. Its size is modest, with enough space for two people to sleep in a king size bed comfortably and walk around the room without feeling cramped. There is a recliner in the room, two nightstands which flank the bed, and a desk with chair along with a dresser that had a flat screen television on top. The bathrooms are good sized and the towels provided were good quality. The bed was extremely comfortable, the water pressure was appropriate, and room service did a great job everyday of keeping the place clean. The only downside about the room is that if you are coming on vacation to have a nice room with a view, a large majority of the rooms will not have one. We stayed on the 8th floor in an even numbered room and had a view that overlooked a run-down apartment building directly in front of us, but we still had an OK view of some taller high-rises to our right. The view of the run down apartment was less than glamorous, but the purpose of our trip to Hawaii was to explore the city and surrounding attractions, not to stay in our room so it wasn't a big deal to us.\u00a0 THE STAFF: By far, the staff was what made our stay there so enjoyable. Everyone was SO kind and helpful to us. They would inquire as to how we were enjoying our vacation and following up with us on topics that we had mentioned before. They were always quick to offer suggestions on great places to eat, printed out directions, and even on one occasion walked us directly to a store that we had been wanting to shop at because they knew it could be difficult to find. The first day we arrived we got in late, and were hoping to get a room on a higher floor. The next morning we put in our request, and when we arrived back we were already relocated to the floor that we had chosen. They had even moved our luggage into the new room for us (obviously asking us first!). I was just so impressed by their hospitality and professionalism. You could tell that they were really interested in making sure that we had a great experience and they did everything they could to make us feel as comfortable as possible. Their hospitality made our vacation and stay at the Seaside one of the most enjoyable and memorable vacations yet. Thanks guys! There it is. A full out essay on our experience at the Seaside. As earlier reviews have mentioned, they have just been acquired by a new management company based out of San Francisco called Joie de Vivre (www.jdvhotels.com). This management company owns a lot of boutique hotels and the plan is to renovate the Seaside within the next year into another boutique hotel. If so, I don't know what that will do to the price of the hotel, but all I can tell you is that when you combine the location, comfort of the rooms, and quality of the staff, the price of your stay at the Seaside is well worth it.\u00a0I'd stay here again.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value, great location and quiet.\u201d", "Author": "kph100", "ReviewID": "UR130538510", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights, in a 12th floor king bedded room.
