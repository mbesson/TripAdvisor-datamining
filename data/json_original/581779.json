But expect nothing special. The reception service is slow, but helpful. Even simple things seem to take much longer than you might expect, but to be fair, they eventually resolve problems. I was given a non-smoking room which was stinking of cigarette smoke, so they changed my room to a better one. The hotel charge included free wifi and breakfast. Wifi worked quite well. Breakfast was very basic, and it did not start on time. It was supposed to start at 07:00 (which is quite late, but perhaps normal in Spain). It was still not serving at 07:15, so I had to leave as I could miss my flight. The room was I stayed was quite nice, and seemed clean (but I have seen some bugs in the bathroom). Perhaps one of the most annoying thing is that they did not have iron or iron boards, and the laundry service is not always available, if you need to leave the hotel for a meeting you can be caught by surprise. Overall, it was not a bad hotel stay, but expect really basis services, if you need more, pay a bit more and go elsewhere.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chippenham", "Title": "\u201cNot bad.

It is clean, friendly, accomadating and quiet. It is well situated for the train station. There are resturants and shopping near as well as many coffee and fresh bread shops. The beds are clean, comfortable and the bathroom is well accomodated. A lovely bath was had by my friend. We had travelled all night on the train from Burgos and the clerk was kind enough, even though we came without a reservation and at about 8:00am., to clean a room for us and not charge us extra. We bathed, had quiet restful sleep and were refreshed for dinner and the city bus tour which was near the train station in a double decker bus. That evening we enjoyed restful sleep so we were refreshed for our flight the next morning to the USA. The hotel clerk arranged for an English speaking taxi also who was so informative about all the different airports in Barcelona and realistically we would have most likely gone to the incorrect one if we had taken the bus ourselves. It was also nice to have a view of the town from the cab. This is the hotel we will stay at if ever in Barcelona again. We prefer it.

Close to the Barcelona Sant train station, information office, tourist bus and Diagonal high street for shopping. The local busses stop in front of the Hotel.

Many hotels were already booked but the Medium Prisma showed rates of 49E/night for a single, and booking on their web site got free wifi thrown into the deal. The hotel is clean and even makes a half-hearted attempt at style in the lobby, but two factors trump everything: the noise and the location. The walls and door to my tiny little room were so thin that every small noise seemed to be right in the room. The hotel has (admittedly, spotlessly clean) tile or slate floors, but this served to amplify sound even further. Breakfast dishes clinking one floor down sounded like they were above my head, maids moving furniture in the room next door might as well have been running jackhammers directly into my brain. At one point in the evening I was awakened by what sounded like someone crumpling paper in the hallway. It's that bad. Location is terrible even for the intrepid. Subway stops are a good 15 minute walk away, and those on a line that goes parallel to the center, requiring an awkward changeover. I'm an avid public transit user and went online to figure out the bus system, but even that was a nightmare, with only one bus meandering towards the center of town from the hotel's street. There are a few restaurants nearby as well as what appear to be, er, gentlemen's clubs, but after about 10pm nothing is open within what seems to be a mile-wide radius. Taxis are not cheap in Barcelona and you'll spend about 5E to get to the center -- plus if you can figure out the night bus (\"nitbus\") routes, those aren't included, inexplicably, on your all-inclusive transit card. Go figure. It was the \"high season\" for tourists in Barcelona, sure, and a non-skeezy, clean bed for under 50 euros a night is a damn good bargain, I'll admit. But if you can't sleep through the night because the walls are made of some sort of sound-amplifying cardboard, what's the point? And if you're going to spend 10E/day on cabs to get anywhere, you better figure that into your budget.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cNoisy small hotel but spotlessly clean\u201d", "Author": "DublinTara", "ReviewID": "UR25437207", "Content": "The hotel is about 2km from the Barcelona Sants Station.

The hotel was a good 10 minutes walk away - which is too long a walk when you've got heavy luggage. Arriving disgruntled, we were made to wait another 30 minutes because our room wasn't ready yet - this despite the fact we arrived at 13:30. These annoyances aside, the hotel was quite nice. The decor wasn't 'state-of-the-art', as the brochure proclaimed, but modern and comfortable, with a particularly appealing bathroom.
