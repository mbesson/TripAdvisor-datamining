The location is perfect, tucked behind San Marco, with a great view of the Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri). All the rooms are junior suites, and it is worth the extra price to choose a canal view room. My husband watches all the boats that go up and down the canal, while I get dressed..............it is fun!!!! Each of the rooms is very large, as it is an old Palazzo. They are decorated in typical old Venetian style with canopy beds, wooden beams, fabric on the walls and huge Murano glass chandeliers. The breakfast room is in a \"sister\" hotel, just a few feet away. The breakfast was quite good, with the normal breads, cereals, yogurts, fruit, but also some very nice cakes, typical of Venice. The people at the reception desk were all very friendly and very helpful. They gave us tips on places to eat and looked up information for us on various exhibitions they weren't familiar with. This is a small hotel that does not have a lobby as such, where you can sit and read, so if that is what you are looking for, this may not be the hotel for you. Considering its location I feel the price is very fair. I do think that management needs to check the rooms more carefully, as there were a few deficiencies. There was a lightbulb out in the large chandelier, as well as in the bathroom. Europeans tend to have darker rooms than Americans are used to, so burned out lightbulbs make a big difference. Some of the furniture needs to be replaced, as it is just tired. The small couch was difficult to sit on, as the cushions sank very low. These are all minor items, but I think the rooms need to be refreshed to keep up with other similar hotels that have been refreshed. That being said, we will definitely return to this hotel, as it is the experience that we are looking for. I just want to be upfront, so that others looking for a different experience will not be disappointed.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caracas", "Title": "\u201cgood location, nice room but...\u201d", "Author": "Leopoldo H", "ReviewID": "UR121083297", "Content": "Ill been there three nigts.

Location: Just off St Marc's square.

No complaints whatsoever Bathroom: Needs some improvement. It was pretty large but looked worn. For example, the shower curtain was old and stained The view/noise: We did not pay for a canal view room so the window looked into the street below. Because of the narrow street, we could hear sounds till late in the night Food: Breakfast was served in the room and was quite good. The room service is through the All Angelo restaurant just in front of the hotel. The restaurant was amazing. However, the free dinner that we had was from a very limited menu, which was okay, but we would still have wanted more choice. Check out: This is what really made my blood boil. We needed to check around 6:30 ish in the morning for our train. We did not want to spend another 70 odd EUR on the water taxi, but would have done so if the hotel had not given us false assurances. The previous evening we asked if someone from the hotel could take our luggage to the vaporetto stop and we were told it could be done. So we did not book a taxi. But during the check out, we were told that only an authorised/union porter was allowed to carry luggage.

It wasn't fixed.That night we slept with the windows open, NOT a good idea! The bell tower in St. Mark's Square rang and rang and rang about 100 times! You could also hear the noise from the metal doors opening and closing when the restaurants were closing up. It was HORRIBLE! Also our shower didn't drain properly so our bathroom flooded after a 2min shower! We mentioned that to him and he said he would send someone up right away. He didn't...... we had to go one day with this, the LAST thing we wanted after a day out of walking around in the HOT Venice sun... He was very sneaky and flaky. We didn't care for him at all! DO NOT EAT at the Restuarants the Hotel recommends.... HORRIBLE food!!

All he could offer us was two complimentary drinks at one of their disgusting restaurants....... We never used them. If you want to go to Murano take the Vaporeto. If you're between the ages of 19 -29 they have discounts on the water taxis passes... so it works out to be a lot cheaper then going through the Hotels service to Murano. Also if you're looking for some sort of night life and dont want to pay an arm and a leg to sit and listen to the Orchestra in St. Marks Square, go to Saint Margarita. You have to get there by the water taxi but it is well worth the local night life. The locals are very friendly and the drinks are very inexpensive.

Although some other reviews say that this hotel is quite difficult to find, it actually is not -- if you take the waterboat and get off at San Marco (the main square in Venice), the hotel is a mere less than 5 minute walk behind the square. The hotel is also a short walk from the landmark Rialto bridge, and is very very near to all the shops - anything from those selling Venetian glass to Gucci and Roberto Cavalli. We arrived early in the morning from Rome all tired, only to be told we would only be able to check in from 2pm onwards as the previous occupants were only checking out at 12pm. So we took a walk around and came back just before 1pm and to our delight, were told that our room was ready! The moment the bellboy opened the room (253) door, we were amazed by what we saw. A lavishly designed Venetian-style room which spelled the word f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s to say the least. It was spacious, with a flat-screen television (the only English channel I found was CNN) and seating area. The bathroom was well-equipped, with a bathtub and heated towel rack. I also suspect that the bathroom and/or its floor is heated too, as the bathroom was always a bit warmer than the bedroom itself. And that meant - no cold toilet seats and stepping on chilly bathroom tiles/marble! The room also comes with a complimentary turn-down service. It was nice to come back to a room with the curtains closed, ambient soft lights switched on, some sweets and a slip of paper with the weather forecast for tomorrow! But the best was yet to come - breakfast served in the room the next morning! Every evening you indicate what you want for breakfast and the time you want it delivered, hang it outside your door and wait for it to be served the next morning. No more rushing down to the coffee house and jostling with other guests for a buffet spread! The staff in the hotel were also very accommodating and helpful (that says a lot because I found most Italians generally rather unfriendly), so that was a welcome break from the norm!

The room was dark and tired and very noisy. there is no bar or restaraunt in the hotel so we were served breakfast in our room each morning we stopped after two days as the bread, toast and croissants were that stale. there is a lot of building work going on right opposite the hotel I did question this before I left as I had read about it on trip advisor but they e-mailed me and confirmed that the building work had finished in May 2007 which was a lie. the workmen the generators the noise starts between 7-8a.m each day. Some of the staff were helpful the others were not I would not stay there again and would not reccomend it to friends or family.

The hotel did not disappoint in terms of it's location and the room itself was fantastic. However, the scaffolding we had expected on the building on the opposite side of the canal was made worse by additional scaffolding on the building next door to the hotel, completely blocking all light and view from our balcony! The sound of building work all day long was made worse by the fact that the new scaffolding had created a tunnel for the busy pathway bellow which our balcony was at the end of, channelling all of the echoing sound directly into our room. We can only imaging how wonderful the room could have been. Thankfully, the hotel's management decided not to charge us the additional cost per night for this room we had originally agreed to pay but it would have been nice to have been warned of the situation prior to arrival. Other than the building work taking place around the hotel's immediate location, I would thoroughly recommend staying in this hotel and will return when hopefully it will all be completed!", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Tx", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hotel, but BEWARE\u201d", "Author": "jefferyrowland", "ReviewID": "UR6842140", "Content": "This was a surprise trip for my wife for our 20th anniversary, so I booked a room \"with a view\" for the occasion about 6 months in advance of the event. I ended up inviting our friends and some family as well (also a surprise). Our friends booked much closer to the event date, so there was a significant difference in our rates. Not a big deal, as I wanted to ensure availability, so I understood that. We loved the hotel, and the hotel also did some very nice, special request things for me for the occasion at my request (for a price); however, here is the thing that did (and still does) bother me. Outside of my room, the building across the canal and outside our windows was covered in scaffolding which was absolutely a total unsightly mess. My dissapoint was that I was paying a premium for \"A room with a view\". When I brought the situation to the hotel's attention, I was told that it was not the hotel's fault that the construction was taking place. I told the hotel staff (they would not let me talk directly to anyone higher than the desk manager) that I was paying extra for a room with a view that did not exist, and that the price should be adjusted. I got the email address of the hotel ownership and general manager with whom I corresponded accordingly. I was not able to get any kind of adjustment for this situation, nor would the hotel staff give me the courtesy of any coorespondence after I checked out. Combine that with the fact that at 7:00 AM promptly every morning, the workers began hammering all day until at least 17:00 every day, I was dissapointed to say the least that the hotel management did not place more importance on me as a customer. Again, I absolutely loved the hotel, but clearly if you don't specifically ask, you may pay a premium for a view that you may not normally be willing to pay a premium for.", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "crocodilehunters", "ReviewID": "UR5811632", "Content": "We have just returned from 4 nights in Venice - staying at Al Ponte Dei Sospiri.

It is only a minute or so from the Square - Tip: if you don't like crowds and want to enjoy the squre all by yourself, go either very early or late in the evening.

What can I say about this gem just around the basilica di San Marco and with views to the rio della Canonica and the Bridge of Sights itself? This hotel has just 8 rooms, all junior suites, and we were at the Ducale (room 101). Incredible suite of about 35-40 squared metres, with four posters king size bed, enormous Murano spider, brocades here and there, tapestry, 5 metres high ceilings with exposed beams, jacuzzi tub, four windows and a balcony from where you can see the canal della Canonica and the bridge of sights. Sadly, the fondamenta is on heavy repairs, and the wiev was very poor on the bridge, you could see just the top volutes. The breakfast was served at your room at the time you choose (from 8 am to 10:30 am). You get a card everyday, and the night before choose what you want to eat, and the next morning is served on your suite by a waitress. We arrived on my birthday, and our room there was a bottle of prosecco and two cups waiting for us. This hotel belongs to the same owners of the Don\u00c3\u00a1 Palace and Al'Angelo hotels and the Al'Angelo, La Canonica and La Grotta restaurants, so you can use the services of the Don\u00c3\u00a1 Palace (20 metres away) as bar, terrace, etc. This hotels have their own water taxi, and they offer very competitive rates: 50 euros for the three of us plus luggage from the hotel to the airport. The situation is wonderful for me, just 70 metres away from Piazza San Marco, in the middle of the rush that I love, but many people can find it too busy. This is the first hotel in Venice where I'd like to come back, and have known a few of them before. One more thing: the hotel is marked as a four stars hotel, but don't know how they've got it. For me, this hotel is a \"pensione\" developed to the \"extra deluxe\" rank, but it has no common places, nor bar or restaurant. On the other hand, it has a very good lift and a private pier, so you can reach the hotel directly from your water taxi, with nno need to carry your luggage. The concierges were helpful and very good natured, but a bit distant, that for me is a good point, don't like these clerks who seem to know you from 10 years ago.
