The rooms are small, beds are of low quality, there is not enough closet space and the living room has a stained tablecloth. THe free wifi, wasn't working most of the time, which was a real pain, because I didn't find free access points over the city.

However, the building was in a great location, the eccentric lift was a constant source of fun, and staying in an apartment meant that we could buy, buy, buy at the Boqueria Market & pretend for a few days that we did actually live in this wonderful city. The apartment could have been so much more comfortable with a bit of minimal maintenance.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location, Great service, Great Value!\u201d", "Author": "J2uk", "ReviewID": "UR120058575", "Content": "Was a bit worried about going here after reading a few of the reviews but just goes to show that some people are will moan about anything! I loved staying here and it was great value for money, so much so that we have booked out the whole apartment next year when I visit Barcelona again with some friends. There are two apartments above each other, we stayed in the top one and the apartment itself was cleaned every day, although I don\u2019t think the rooms were, but I wouldn\u2019t expect this for the price. The room was fine, simple and effective if you do not intend to spend much time in your room. The apartment had 2 bathrooms, and a WC, a breakfast area and a fully equipped kitchen which was very useful as although there is a cafe downstairs, it wasn't particularly cheap so sometimes we just had a quick breakfast in the room before we left for the day. The location was excellent and it is only a 5 min walk to the nearest tube stop which was Tetuan (one stop from Sagrada Familia) and there is parking outside the hotel for a moped if you rent one (by far the best way to see Barcelona). It can be a bit noisy at night as the road it is on is one of the main ones in Barcelona but this is easily solved if you just take some ear plugs. I can\u2019t wait to go back again, Barcelona is a very cool place and the apartments are a great place to see everything from.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterford, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cReally good place to stay\u201d", "Author": "MGer0000", "ReviewID": "UR119029580", "Content": "Stayed here for 5 nights in September. Great location, very central and convenient, with markets, shops, restaurants nearby. Ok, traffic is noisy but if you close the windows and shutters at night it blocks it out. There's a fan in eveyr room. Kitchen was spotless, as was common areas. We hardly saw our neighbours, nor did we hear any noise from any of the other apartments there. Rooms are very spacious, high ceilings, comfortable beds. It's not a hotel, so don't expect hotel service, with new sheets and towels every day, it's more like an upmarket hostel. I would definitely stay there again, and recommend it to anyone I know travelling to Barcelona.

That was nice but I also found out that they charge for late check-in. \u20ac25 after 9pm, \u20ac50 after 11pm. Thought this was quite steep but too late to rebook. The manager showed up when we arrived, and all was easy. Passed us the keys, and she spent 10mins walking through sights and recommendations. The room was small and basic, no tv, no cabinet, no table. We stayed there 3 nights and no change of sheets nor towels. Made a mistake first night I was there - did not fully close the balcony doors at night - to let the air in. Turned out the roads were busy all night with buses and ambulance. Closing it fully kept the noise out, and there is a standing fan in the room. The 2 showers/toilets were adequate, but I really did not appreciate how it was not kept clean nor dry. Also, when one of them ran out of toilet paper, it was not refilled during the days when we were there. Because of them dampness, they smelled rather bad. Location is good enough, about 15 mins walk to popular La Rambla, Old Town and Segrada Familia.

You have to call when you arrive in Barcelona, so that they can send someone to give you the keys. This may be a problem if your sim card or your phone doesn't work abroad! Anyway, we were given a cold welcome by the manager, but she showed up to be quite helpful, by giving us advice on the \"how-to\" of BCN (pickpockets, ID card, streets to avoid), and handing us over a map on which she annotated the main touristic spots. The place is clean, it's a big appartment with locked and common rooms. You have the \"hostel\" feeling in the way that you share spaces with others, but everyone has it's private room, like in a regular hotel. The walls - as it is usually in old buildings - are not very big, so you may hear some noise from a couple (\"hum, hum\") or sweedish binge drinkers (which we experienced). They went anyway get wasted in clubs around midnight, so we slept very well everynight. The kitchen is clean and has everything you need, and our room was granted a big fan, so we were that hot. They view on the \"avenida\" is quite nice in the morning, if you are used to street sounds.
