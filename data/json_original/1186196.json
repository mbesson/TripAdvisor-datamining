There is a pretty reasonable bar in the hotel and additionally also offers a complimentary breakfast which has a quiet a few options including some traditional Arabic breakfast choices. Although the location can be a bit disappointing as it faces the dry docks (since the address reads Jumeirah Beach, I thought the beach may be a few minutes walk away) and is away from the malls & other tourist attractions the hotel is quite reasonable & moving around is not too difficult in Dubai if you take the cabs.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel for business\u201d", "Author": "FASUAE", "ReviewID": "UR126156530", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for more than three times when I attend my business meeting the hotel location is good but not the best staff are friendly and breakfast buffet is fine but very Lu Ted choices in it as there is no hot dishes like eggs", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cNot the best Holiday Inn\u201d", "Author": "greg s", "ReviewID": "UR126015966", "Content": "I stayed here as I was attending an exhibition at the nearby Dubai Exhibition Centre, and I like to collect my priotity points so always prefer to stay at a Holiday Inn if i can.

I am a platinum member of the priority club and chose this hotel due to proximity to Jumeirah beach and elite membership in priority club. I have a mixed feedback of this hotel. Let me start Good things: 1. Breakfast was quite good, certainly better than holiday inn express hotels in the US! I am a vegetarian and still could manage well for 4 days 2. Fully functional basic hotel, and I didn't experience any difficulty during my stay 3. Front office people are fine, except a few which I will talk in the next section Not so good things: 1. I did not get any benefit of being a platinum member! All the rooms are same so no upgrade, but at least they could have given me corner room (which they didn't); I was told that I will get 'free' newspaper every day which I didn't; and breakfast is anyways free for everyone. So do not expect a special treatment at all. 2. This is a very basic hotel so do not expect any service; no concierge, no room service etc. One night I fell sick and called up reception requesting to send a bottle of water and charge to my room, but the guy refused point blank saying there is no service, and said come downstairs, pay for it and take it to the room! I know that there is no room service but some flexibility should be there! Similarly once I asked for a baisc info, a nearby grocery store but they said there is no conceirge! 3. Its difficult to get taxi from the nearby metro station Room rate during my visit was exorbitantly high so it wasnt a good value for money. However I don't think rates are usually high.

The breakfast was complimentary and had sufficient choices for vegetarians. However, the location of this Hotel is a drawback for tourists because this is located at Dry Docks and not at Jumeirah Beach Road. Before arrival, I have assumed from the address that it may be near the beach. So, the Hotel does not offer any good view also, there is no market place nearby so we needed a cab to visit any nearby place as walking on the road is almost impossible because of sizzling hot during the day time. The Hotel does not provide any complimentary toiletries or eatables in the room and one will have to purchase everything from the reception. After reaching late in the night, we requested from room delivery of water but we were advised to personally visit the reception and purchase it from there. We had a bad experience about the phone service available in the room. The local call charge as in the tariff card kept in the room was shown as AED 5 for each call but while checking out, it presented a bill of AED 135.

Our cleaner was brilliant and kept our room spotless. The staff were very friendly however lacked basic knowledge about the surrounding area. For instance, we arrived at 9pm and after we unpacked, wanted to find a restaurant to eat. The receptionist told me the nearest shopping mall was a 10 minute walk up the road, where we would find restaurants available. 20 minutes later and gthe \"shopping mall\" was the Palm Springs which is essentially a group of boutique shops with a Starbucks and Haagen Dazs. Eventually we ended up getting a taxi to Mall of the Emirates (which is probably the mall furthest away) by taxi as it was the only one I could think of. On another night we had booked a table at the Coconut Grove restaurant which is located in the Rydges Plaza- a 5 min taxi ride from the hotel. We in fact walked back after the meal it was that near. The staff and security had never heard of the hotel and I had to go back to my room to get the address of the Rydges so that they could tell the taxi driver. We were also misinformed about the Big Bus Tour, where is stops in relation to the hotel and where we can buy tickets. A different staff member told me that the bus leaves at 9.30am every 15 mins from down the road that mosque is on. THIS IS ALL INCORRECT INFORMATION!! We walked in the boiling heat to the mosque to find no bus stop anywhere in sight. After a nightmare morning we eventually found the stop was outside Starbucks (on the other side of the street and on an entriel different street!), and the tour started at 9am. HI Express- PLEASE PLEASE train your staff to have the knowledge of these basic things- we wasted a lot of time, money and energy following your information. Our requests were nothing out of the ordinary, and things I would expect a hotel to have plenty of knowledge and information about. Courteous staff is lovely,but they need to have knowledge. Breakfast was ok but the same every day. Milk was warm. We had one drink in the bar and the barman didnt know how to make one of the cocktails (took 15 mins for him to bring drinks over)!! There is no drawer space at all. There were hardly any hangers (though they did bring us more up when we asked). The rooms are small but if you're out most of the day it doesnt really matter. The hotel was very clean and modern. The staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome. Getting taxis is easy. We walked to the open beach on a couple of occassions (about a 20 min walk in the heat), and there is a Carrefore's just round the corner. Other than that the hotel is a fair way out from the nearest shopping mall, restaurants and metro (Dubai mall- 10-15mins by taxi).

Our room was small, had a musty smell and the furnishings were tacky. Standard items like drinking water, glasses and tissue boxes were not provided. The bathroom had no soap or shampoo, instead there was a hair/ body wash which my wife said made her hair texture oily. The shower knob had no hot or cold markings and needed to be turned clockwise, so one had to be very careful to control the water temperature. When I called Housekeeping to send up some glasses they asked me to call the restaurant which i did. Their response? You guessed it - they asked me to call up Housekeeping. Finally, they sent up two plastic glasses. The hotel is located in a very isolated area of Jumeirah with a \"picturesque\" view of the dry docks and no restaurants, shopping, activity spots within walking distance.

There's no easy public transport and it's not walking distance to anything so we spent quite a bit of money and time in taxis.

Its a friendly and efficient hotel. Rooms are comparatively higher standard than comparable Holiday Inn Express hotels in the UK, with very comfortable beds, fridge and digital safe in the room, overall feeling more like a Holiday Inn than the Express brand. Overall tasteful, peaceful and restful decor and includes kettles tea/coffee in the room. The bathroom was good, and now there are soap/shower gel dispensers both at the sink and in the shower (previous reviewers have commented these were missing when they visited). Breakfast included bread/toast olives, yogurt, grapefuit, pastries cereals and fresh fruit - all in all fine. It got quite crowded when we were there on one morning - the biggest bottleneck being the tea/coffee machine - only one of these so there could be a lengthy queue at times. But go early and there's no problem. We tried the evening buffet one night and were pleasantly surprised - a good and tasty range of salads, about 5 hot dishes, and fruit salad, cream puddings, banana fritters etc - all for 60 AED per person. Very friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is about 10-15 minute bus ride from the Al Ghubaiba bus station (the terminal for buses to/from Abu Dhabi) in central \"Old Dubai\" on the No 8 bus (runs every 20 minutes both ways), with the bus stop about 300 metres from the hotel. So getting to the Creek, Souks, Dubai Museum is very easy. The No 8 bus also goes, in the other direction, all along Jumeirah beach road, so easy to get to the beach and look at the Burj al Arab and other big hotels. Dubai is though a very spread out city and unless you get a taxi it means quite a long walk (30 mins) to the nearest Metro station if you want to get easily to the newer sights around Dubai Mall etc. Overall connectivity between the buses and Metro is not good so we ended up walking quite a lot. While during the day it was hot, at night time it was atmospheric enough, taking us into non touristy areas, and busy areas with quite good local restaurants (nearest of these about 15 minute walk from the hotel). The immediate vicinity of the hotel overlooks the dry docks, and there is office/restaurant development going on nearby. Despite this hotel not being in the centre of things, we got the impression very few hotels we saw in Dubai could be described as ideally located for public transport - hopefully something Dubai will get right in future.

If driving yourself, pay the extra and get the GPS (Satnav) with your car. Once you learn a few landmarks, the hotel location is easy to remember. Security was helpful and pleasant. They met me as I parked the car and delivered my luggage to the room. They're also quick to hail a cab for you if needed. Checkin was painless and within minutes my head was comfortably resting in bed. The room was small but adequate. Compared to stateside Holiday Inn's you're getting more for your money. Be sure to book your stay in advance. Witnessed two men at the front desk requesting the internet rates without success. They paid about 50% more. Breakfast is buffet style with few choices but adequate. Only ate here on the first day. Excellent food awaits you elsewhere in the city. The business center and internet access is adequate but pricey. The one shortcoming was their ability to provide copies. Either the copier was acting up as the desk clerk claimed or she didn't know how to operate it. Needed copies of identification for my interview and the ones she handed me were completely unuseable. Each copy was 3DHS, little less than a buck. The bar is now up and running but extrememly expensive even compared to trendy expat bars on the beach.

My friend and I (females in our twenties looking for a fun week away) stayed here in February and had an excellent time. The hotel staff, particularly security and in the restaurant, were extremely pleasant and polite and made us feel very welcome. The rooms were similar to any other Holiday Inn Express around the world that I have stayed in, reasonably comfortable with basic facilities (no room service/mini bar though.) Breakfast is buffet style with a range of options, croissants, pastries, toast, cold meats & cheese as well as fruit, yoghurt and cereal. Should you wish to, you can pay extra to order a cooked breakfast. The hotel seems to be orientated towards businesss trips and stopovers as it is fairly close to the airport (about 15 minutes drive) but I would definitely also recommend it to other holiday makers as it is great value for a first time exploring Dubai. It takes about 30 minutes to get to the centre of Dubai, where the majority of hotel bars/clubs & restaurants are based and about 20 minutes to the Burj Al Arab/Jumeirah Beach hotel area (where the Wild Wadi water park and lots of the other restaurants and bars are located.) Despite this, it is very cheap in a taxi for the amount of time you spend driving (at the very most 10 pounds to get into the centre of Dubai.) It would have been nice to be a little more central as it took quite a large chunk out of the day should we go back and forth from the hotel back into the centre of town. However, we spent most of our time on the beaches in the centre of Dubai, when there is in fact a beach that is 15 minutes walk from the hotel itself, so if you wish simply to visit the beach during the day, then this will considerably cut down your travel time. Despite being on the main road leading out of Dubai, a few taxi drivers didn\u2019t know where the hotel was, so if they don\u2019t, nearby points of reference that we found helpful when explaining where we wanted to go to were the flag (virtually opposite the hotel), the dry docks and the fact that the hotel is in Jumeirah 1. We had a few minor complaints but all in all the price of the hotel far outweighed them. The first was the fact that on arrival we were told that we must put down a deposit of 1000dh each (currently about 100 pounds) in cash and were unable to leave our credit card details instead. We were unhappy to pay this on arrival, particularly as it had not been advertised in advance and we did not wish to be left with such a large amount of foreign currency in cash which we would be unable to spend being left with it on our last day in Dubai. Therefore, we eventually agreed with the receptionist to leave a smaller amount of 100dh each (approx 20 pounds currently) which I would definitely recommend to do if you do not wish to be left with lots of cash to change back on your return home (should you not use it up in additional room costs.) There is no swimming pool, which is a shame in such a hot country and also being near a beach it would have been nice to have a balcony (if only to use to dry towels.) However, these are minor complaints and generally the Holiday Inn Express provided us with a great location from which to explore the rest of Dubai. Don't expect 5* luxury, but a great base from which to experience Dubai on a budget!", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Express Dubai Jumeirah", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1186196-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Dubai_Jumeirah-Dubai.html", "Price": "$56 - $171*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Corner Of Jumeirah Road and 60 Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Al Mina, Jumeirah</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1186196", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fc/3c/fc3c1dec4694db896b3cce6957181e466large.jpg"}}
