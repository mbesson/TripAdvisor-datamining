Great location and low price lured us in. But it was dirty, inhospitable, noisy, and with poor service. Our names and reservations were on the books, but it took them 20 minutes to figure out which rooms we should be in, mostly because we had booked rooms with a private bathroom. My friend struggled with her bags while the two desk clerks watched. We asked for drinking glasses and were told to go to the gelato shop next door to get plastic cups. (Sorry, Mr. Desk Clerk, for interrupting your ongoing personal phone calls.) No one checked our name against the room register when we asked for our key off the peg board -- anyone could walked off the street and gotten our room key. The room doors were flimsy and not secure. No in-room safe. The shower was grimy and the shower head was broken. Water was hot, linen was clean.

It's not the Ritz but the rooms were spotlessly clean, the air con worked, the shower was hot and the bed was large and comfortable. The rooms are small, but space is an issue in Rome and this will be the case pretty much anywhere central unless you pay big bucks for the privilege. It is a family run place and the staff were very friendly, the breakfast was staple continental and of the same standard you would get in a much pricier place in Rome. This was my fourth visit to the city and for location, and price it was the best, almost exactly in between the Spanish steps and the Trevi fountain (both two mins walk away). If you are looking for a cheap, clean, quiet and safe place to stay in the thick of it then I wholeheartly recommend it. Will definitely come back here for my next visit.

I had read some of the previous comments about the hotel before I stayed and thought it would be worse then it was. Although the hotel was old and in need of some TLC it was clean the people were very friendly. We didn\u2019t spend much time in the hotel so the location was more important to us than the place itself. One of the main tourist buses the 116 stops right outside the hotel making it so easy to get to all the attractions or if you don\u2019t mind a stroll you can walk to most of them. Overall the location to us outweighed the hotel itself; the place was clean which is all that really mattered I have stayed in far worse places. One thing I would say is the room didn\u2019t have any air con or even a fan and it did get quite hot, we slept with the window open which meant a very noisy road in the morning, this didn\u2019t bother us to much as we had lots plan for our trip but if you like to sleep in late maybe ask for a room at the back of the hotel.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIf you're wanting an American hotel in Rome this is not for you.\u201d", "Author": "JBridger89", "ReviewID": "UR114838536", "Content": "I think that a lot of these reviews are written by people who were expecting the Hilton. You can find those hotels if you want to pay that much.

It is old, if you get a room with a shared bathroom you need to be prepared to-wait for it-share a bathroom. Again, this isn't the Ritz. If that's what you want stay somewhere else. But you will not get the fantastic location this has to offer. I could get everywhere by walking if I wanted and the metro is close by. It is literally a block away from all the expensive shopping (Gucci, YSL, Prada), the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and if you're up for a little walk the Parthenon. I didn't come to Rome for the hotel room, I came for the experience. I'm a college age male so I would say if you're a family, or you're wanting to sleep a lot, this hotel can be a little noisy. It didn't bother me, but I can see how other people may not enjoy that. I also want to give a shout-out to a little restaurant I ate at while staying in Rome. I found it in Rick Steve's guide of Rome. It is pretty close to Erdarelli and is one of the best that I ate at while in Italy. It's called L'Antica Birreria Peroni.

We were on the fourth floor at the front of the hotel and we have the following comments: - room tiny and 'double' bed was 2 small single beds pushed together - wallpaper was peeling off the walls - no air conditioning, and with temperatures at 35+ degrees this wasn't good - single glazed windows which we had to keep open anyway due to heat meant we had the full volume of what seemed to be the noisiest street in Rome (I'm sure we heard tanks one night) - bathroom minute...it was a pod-like thing in the corner of the room that would have served well as a sauna but was hopeless as a bathroom. And, as others have said, the shower is minute. If you are over 6 feet tall or have a few extra lbs then don't expect to get in. And god forbid if you want to shave your legs. - no hairdryer, tea making facilities, bottled water, etc - hotel was no smoking but some staff smoked at reception so you had to walk past clouds of smoke on occasion - renovations were ongoing (which will be good in the long run) but meant we had to climb over painters on the stairs - breakfast was continental but not great. Individually wrapped cheese slices (a la Kraft), cheese triangles, juice, hard buns, croissants which were glazed with sugar, juice, water and a hot drinks machine with the worst coffee I've ever had. Positives are: - it's in a good location - 5 minutes from the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain - close to Metro station and all trips only 1 euro - cost was 'affordable' BUT don't book through third party company - go straight to hotel website. We used Bookings.com and paid more than we could have. - staff all seemed to speak a bit of English so easy to book in/out, ask questions - they gave us a corkscrew to use when we asked - gelati shop right next door (also sells beer and wine - open late) - near lots of cafes/restaurants and 15 mins walk from a large park - the lift worked (if previous user shut the doors after themselves) So, if you want somewhere a bit shabby (and I'm not just talking old here) but in the centre for a half decent price then go here.

I booked at the Erdarelli primarily due to the location. I saw the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor but thought \"How bad could it really be?\" besides, I was only staying for 1 night. Well, it was bad! This place is not a hotel, it's more of a hostel. I am a single woman from New York City, it takes a lot for me to feel unsafe, but from the minute I stepped into the hotel I got a bad feeling. Got worse as I located my room which was in a dark corner (literally no lighting) on the 3rd floor. Then when I opened the door which has a cheap key lock, I was taken aback by the room. A tiny twin sized bed with a worn and stained blanket. But the worst was the smell. The room smelled old and musty, so strong that when I left the room the smell remained on my clothing. The shower was tiny with black mildew lined corners and a dirty bath mat. Surprisingly, the towels were actually clean and white. I used all my might to not make a rash decision and bolt. So I left the hotel to clear my head, have some dinner and visit a few sites. The location is superb, minutes to the Spanish Steps, Trevi fountain, and the Pantheon. However, during dinner I couldn't get over the feeling of dread of returning to the hotel. At 1:00 AM, I returned to the hotel and checked out. Despite knowing that I would have only been sleeping there a few hours before checking out in the morning, I couldn't stomach being in that dreadful hotel and using that shower in the morning. I ended up checking in at the Hotel Concordia just around the corner. If you don't mind hostel quality boarding then the Erdarelli might work for you, particularly because of the excellent location.

The breakfast is in a typical continental style, caf\u00e9, tea, bread, jam. You can order egg, toast and other dishes too, it is all really cheap.
