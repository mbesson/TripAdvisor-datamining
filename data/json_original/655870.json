You just have a room and a key - no concierge / bar / restaurant etc. so it's more like staying in someone's house (although you can order room service from the bar next door). The decor is quirky and quaint - shabby chic meets Victoriana - the bathroom is particularly unusual with a old claw footed tub and brass taps. We stayed in December and were grateful for the fire that you can light as you wish (gas with flames, not real wood!) - it really adds ambiance to an already spacious room. The usual amenities and mini bar are on offer, with a few thoughtful extras like maps. The location is great as well - easy walking distance into Soho and of course the lovely Bowery just around the corner for drinks. This place is edgy and cool and beats more traditional hotels hands down. Only criticisms would be that the TV was very old and it took us a long time to get any channels on it at all and also the iPod dock / alarm clock didn't work - but technology didn't really seem appropriate in our old-school room anyway!", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat downtown option\u201d", "Author": "Colin H", "ReviewID": "UR118671669", "Content": "I love this property, as it's really well located close to bowery/east village and all of the restaurants and bars that come with the neighbourhood.

The pictures on the website are accurate. The problem is that if something goes wrong after hours, you are basically out of luck. In our case, the issue was a noisy party in the room below us, perhaps not a big deal for some people but it was very annoying for us. We tried both the operator and the \u201cafter hours\u201d number \u2013 no answer from either. Ultimately it proved impossible to get hold of anyone on the hotel staff. The party ended eventually, but it would have been a big concern had there been something more seriously wrong. It was well into the following week before we got a call back from the hotel about our complaint. The staff when they did finally get in touch was apologetic and comped the room for that night, which we appreciated.

I booked it because I wanted to explore this part of Manhattan and come home to a working fireplace each chilly evening. Well - the location was great but the fireplace was a big disappointment. When I enquired about using it, I was told that as 'it wasn't winter yet' the fireplaces were not working. This seemed a bit unkind because it was definately winter weather - everyone on the streets was rugged up in overcoats and boots and scarves etc. We arrived at around 10pm and, as arranged, collected our key from the bar next door - all good. But our room was freezing when we checked in and the central heating radiators were stone cold. I called the 'after hours' number, which our 'welcome' letter advised we must not hesitate to use, only to receive a recorded message asking me to leave a message. All very unsatisfactory.

The building is an old brownstone and the entire building has been restored to it's original glory. There are no facilities on site, but plenty of restaurants and bars very close by. My only negative comment was about the construction work going on outside, which has been going on for several months and with this much distraction I can't understand why the hotel didn't mention this beforehand.

The building and accoutrements ARE pretty special. It is not for everyone but serves a unique need in NYC....much more like a private house than a hotel. The downside is that a hotel set-up like this requires GREAT management and staff. The longtime manager was recently let go and this has really changed the place. After staying at Lafayette house tens of times over the past few years, we checked in recently and had an appallingly bad experience. (The new manager was on holiday when we were there, so we were subjected to the staff on hand and this may have been part of the problem.) Let's just say: 1) if you get the wrong room, it's no fun. we had an entire family staying there and half of us got a great room in front while the others got a terrible room in back. 2) Our fireplace broke, nearly set the room on fire while we were out, and had to be disconnected for the rest of our stay. 3) They misran our credit card and called us in the middle of the night to demand a new CC number. They re-ran it (after waking us up) and found it was fine. Don't wake your guests for your mistakes, especially when they are longtime guests. 4) Unlike our many previous visits, we felt unwelcome, the staff was rude and unhelpful and in general, all the charm and \"specialness\" were gone.

But if you like the privacy and peace of being in a real house, sleeping in a huge room (suite-sized, really), right smack bang in Noho just a stroll from Soho and Nolita and the LES and the West Village and well, everywhere, then this is the place for you. It's decoated, as mentioned, as though an eccentric, arty great-aunt did it in the late 40s and it hasn't been changed since. The bed is comfy (if a little noisy...), the tv is awesome (and has DVD player, HBO on demand, etc), the shower is INCREDIBLE and the bath is about four feet deep. One of the reviews alleged that it's not clean and everything is falling apart - completely untrue. It's spotless, and the threadbare rug is part of the charm, darling. Perhaps she'd be happier at a Marriott. The one thing that does need changing: the drapes. No matter how you arrange them, there's a two-inch crack on either side of the windows and light comes straight in. Not ideal for jetlag. There's no room service, as mentioned, but the B Bar and Grill next door does great coffee and brunch and incredible burritos, there's a sushi bar downstairs, Five Points around the corner does one of the best burgers I've ever tasted and well, it's New York.

I was in NYC to enjoy the nightlife and shopping, not to sight-see. This is an old old building, 1848, \"Gangs of New York\" era if memory serves. This means that things are old and it is decorated in a similar style. If you are not used to real antiques and aren't fond of victorian style, this hotel won't be for you. If you like to be pampered by hotel staff 24/7 you won't like it. If you like to be left alone, you will. I do like it and It reminded me of similar old hotels in New Orleans. It is very charming but it is not full service, faux vintage \"modern luxury\" hotel. This also means it has no elevator and narrow steep victorian stairs. If you are person with mobility problems or disabilities, this hotel may be a no go for you unless you are on the ground floor. I stayed all the way on the top floor in a gigantic room. (pictured in the tripadvisor page) with a pleasant sitting area and fireplace. I had no noise problems, although I believe that your experience of this hotel *could* differ greatly depending upon which room you are in. Very important to me is the fact that the thick double paned windows of my room shut out the vast majority of the New York noise.. and best of all, they opened so I could enjoy fresh air if I wished. The cost was a fair value for New York ( New York hotel rates are way higher than the rest of the country) given the size of the room, but not if you were expecting modern fixtures. If you appreciate the style, this room would be excellent for a romantic get away (or for someone like me who appreciates a bit of history). It has a large deep bath tub. Negative is a shower that requires some arcane knowledge and skill to operate. Positive: I had several special requests that were met right away. In contrast to what some others have written, I found the hotel staff to be very cheerful and responsive. One possible warning: They are doing construction across the street. While I was staying there no work was being done, just a big hole in the ground, but I would check first. For me the mood, privacy, service and excellent location outweighed any negatives.

I saw the reviews online and was convinced it sounded like a very nice new boutique hotel. Overall the reviews were overrated and you can definitely do much better for a similar price. Pluses: 1. Great neighborhood/location downtown 2. Nice sized room with a working fireplace, chandelier and sitting room 3. Pretty terrace that opened out into the courtyard downstairs. Enjoyed it very much especially with the early Fall weather. 4. Free Wi-Fi 5. Small Kitchenette with mini-bar amenities 6. C.E. Bigelow products 7. Nice big king sized bed BUT see below Minuses: We stayed in Room 4. 1. Bed reeked of cigarette smoke. When you are visiting NY for a day and a half and paying $425/night for 2 nights TO SLEEP the last thing you want is (literally) a smelly night's sleep. Manager promised to have all pillows, mattress pad, blanket and sheets replaced but when the maid came, we did not see any of the so called replacement supplies. In order to avoid the same problem, I emailed that morning requesting that she ASK the maid to make sure her instructions were followed. Instead of being profusely apologetic, understanding and bending over backwards to be helpful, I got a snide response saying I should think about moving rooms or to another hotel (not ideal when I was working all day and not returning late that night). I have emails to prove it. Guests should NEVER have to apologize for a cigarette-smelling bed. I don't care how new or boutique the hotel is. And yes, the bed still smelled the second night. 2. Manager was virtual. We only communicated via email the entire time. Never saw her once, never got a consolation fruit basket, nothing. The worst part was at 7am, someone started literally banging on the pipe. Free yet unwanted alarm clock. Not the hotel's fault but still...added more discomfort to an already bad situation. 3. Decor was not my style - Dusty rose velour curtains, shabby chic style but it looked more shabby than chic (to me). Some people may adore this look but I personally like to see antiques refurbished and appropriated the way Kelly Wearstler does it. Overall, room looked like your grandparents old townhouse from 1898 (think the Age of Innocence 1898, not Manhattan 2008) 4. Bathroom was disgusting and old. Not old and preserved in a good way but broken tiles, sink was scuffed, mirror was hung too high and not what you would expect from a nice (albeit residential townhouse) hotel. 5. LIGHTING - It's poorly lit everywhere. It's caters more to mood rather than task. I would like to know how women are supposed to apply makeup in the dark poorly-lit bathroom. 6. Mediocre Service - If you are going to have a residential hotel, service should be impeccable. This is a more DIY, deal with what you get place. If things don't work, hotel won't care. They say they will fix something but won't. Room #10 We booked an additional room for a guest who WANTED to stay here and actually suggested it and just today told us his room had \"ghosts\". Overall the place feels like the Chelsea hotel with slightly better appointed furniture. But you can't really get away from that dark, danky feel. I'm used to better rooms and better service.
