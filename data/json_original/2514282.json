I often stay at hotels and hostels across the world and I've not come across anything as unpleasant as this hotel. Okay, so the price and location is ideal, but it's really not worth it!! The lady behind reception was as nice as she could be, she asked if we needed a map of London and provided us an iron after we had requested. The room itself however smelt SOOO bad, the bed covers looked clean but smelt stale and damp - That bad that I could not bring myself to sleeping under the covers so decided to sleep on top of my towel with my coat on!! The room looked as though it had never been dusted and there was still coffee ring stains on the bedside table - which is surprising as mugs or kettles were not available in the room to be used, so where the stains came from is besides me! The carpet in the room was from the 1600s and the curtains were hanging off their tracks, I did not want to move them in the fear that a creepy crawly may fall out of them! I may not describe the room as best I can but I just need to say please be aware that you'll be highly disappointed in the room regardless of the price/location.

The worst part is actually that I booked a single room with bathroom for 60 GBP and already paid partially online, but when I arrived at 9pm they told me all the rooms with bathrooms are gone because a few of such rooms have bathrooms issues and not available that night (not sure if true at all). They said they only have rooms with shared bathrooms left and would give me a 10 GBP discount, and take it or leave it. For this kind of room in such an old and unclean establishment, the 50 GBP price is too high. However, the receptionist was not apologetic and was extremely rude.

We arrived early and were told that we had to wait to check in at 3pm which was okay as they advised us that we could leave our case there. Our cases were left next to a filing cabinet in a tiny corridor behind the desk. This was sort of unprofessional but i didn't see it as that big a deal. Came back later and got given room 56 which is located in the annex. The room was tiny, sheets were unclean and smelled, shower had hairs etc in it, a bath towel each but no hand towel? Room looked like it was in dire need of some tlc there wasn't even any duvets. Went back and politely asked to switch rooms, we were offered another room in the building, number 12 which upon first impression looked okay, until we saw the bathroom and a pile of dead flies in the shower. At this point we went back and asked for a refund. Clearly the guy didn't believe us because he checked, came back and said \"oh it's only some flies!\" probably not very wisely I lost my temper at this point and had a huge argument with them. Extremely rudely they spoke about my friend and I in Indian to each other while we were stood right there. Apparently refunds take 8-12 days to go through. Again something I found difficult to believe as we had only done the transaction on a card machine a half hour earlier. The guy tried to tell us he was charging us the first night because we had \"used\" the room. We were in the room for half an hour trying to decide how best to go abort complaining about it.

Having searched the net, I realised that trying to get a room in central London was going to be expensive. The budget I had for a double room for me and my mate was \u00a360. We wanted to be as close to Leicester square as possible, and found that rooms around this area cost around double and upwards. The nearest alternatives were Victoria, paddington and kings cross, which would have meant an expensive taxi ride after a night out. The Gresham Hotel is in the perfect location. Two mins to walk to Tottenham court rd. And 5 mins or so to Leicester square. Now having checked in we were allocated a room on the 4th floor. This meant a steep climb up three flights of stairs. Which is great if you want to lose a few pounds but not if your unfit. The female receptionist wasn't friendly or engaging but didn't come across rude either. She handed over the key and advised that it had to be returned when leaving the hotel which I found really strange, however she advised that this because they opened 24 hours. My immediate concern was for my valuables therefore I made sure that I kept wallet etc on my person. The room was a decent size twin. With a basin And small table. The decor was basic. There were clean towels and bedding. The room had a faint musty smell which you didn't notice after a while. Outside there was a shower room and a toilet. Both were clean but the shower had a faint odour. I believe this was coming from the shower trap/drain or possibly the curtain. It was'nt unpleasant. Due to the fact that my friend has trouble climbing stairs as he's a big lad I decided to request a change of room as I was meeting him a few hours later. By this time there was a different receptionist called Ryan. He was fantastic and accommodating. He gave me the choice of two rooms a double and a twin on the first floor. They were both clean but smaller rooms. The double was a reasonable size. And the twin was long and narrow with the beds back to back. I chose the twin as didn't fancy sharing a bed with my mate! My only gripe with this room was that the mirror light was broken which was frustrating as it was difficult to shave as it was getting dark. Also the bed was a bit springy for me but my mate was happy. As it was a warm day we had to leave the window open, so you could hear traffic. But as we both strolled in at 4.am it didn't matter as we were both out for the count! The only annoying thing was that we had to wait 10 mins after buzzing the door to be let back in the hotel. Overall I would say that \u00a355 for a double room was excellent considering the location. If we had elected for an en suite room it would have cost \u00a375. The hotel next door was charging \u00a3125 for a double. Now this hotel has zero luxuries but offers cheap accommodation in the heart of London on the exclusive Bloomsbury rd. If your prepared to lower your standards for a night or two then I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It was clean but very basic. No breakfast, kettle, mugs, glasses or iron. What you see is what u get. Now I can't swear to this but I think I may have been bitten once or twice, however this happens occasionally in my own house as I have two dogs and a cat, so it's an occupational hazard and therefore didn't phase me. To put things in to perspective I noticed several homeless people sleeping rough on the streets in the early hours of the morning.

Our room was designed purely for the function of sleeping in.The toilet/bathroom was one of those moulded pod affairs that was so small you only used it when absolutely necessary (we ended up using the loo in the corridor outside our room...more spacious and private...).

The rooms are in desperate need of a lick of paint, if this was done it would make a big difference.

It\u2019s rare that I would rate a hotel experience as terrible (one or two perhaps out of those thousand hotels) but, unfortunately, our recent stay in the Gresham was truly awful. I won\u2019t bore you with my personal take on the atmosphere at breakfast \u2013 for example \u2013 but I would criticise the Gresham, compared to other hotels available in the area, for the following reasons which I think are pretty fundamental points for a pleasant stay: - Location - Value for money - Cleanliness - Security The Gresham is located on Bloomsbury at \u2013 perhaps \u2013 the noisiest junction on the street; particularly if you are based in the annex as we were. Hence, traffic noise surpasses the point of irritating which you may find at the Jesmond, Arosfa or Ridgemount and reaches the \u2018unbearable\u2019. In terms of value for money, the Gresham is more expensive than neighbouring hotels, but offers less right across the board. Perhaps the only advantage is the shorter walk down into 7 Dials. Our room, and the various corridors and stairwells we saw, were dirty. The clump of hair we found on the bathroom floor next to the unemptied bin was so big it could have been given a name and a collar and we could have taken it to the vets for its shots. We didn\u2019t venture into the shower; we thought it was safer not to. One of the three pillows was confined to the floor as we were sure that it had served the previous residents of our room. Finally, and perhaps the most serious point, security. The window of our room could not be closed. This meant that neighbouring rooms had access to our room via an adjoining balcony. This \u2013 obviously \u2013 bothered us, so we deposited our valuables at reception and asked to have the window fixed. When we returned, we were informed that the handyman was unavailable, and \u2013 \u201csince you\u2019re only staying one night\u2026\u201d We suggested that the problem would \u2013 also \u2013 apply to the next night\u2019s guests and offered to fix the window ourselves if they gave us the tools. No tools. We headed up to the room to find the window wide open. We closed it and left the hotel, returning some hours later to find the window wide open once more. When we discovered that a piece of jewellery had been stolen from our room, we informed the hotel reception. There was no comment. There was no apology (and neither of us look like lawyers, believe me). When you book a hotel, you don\u2019t want to have to go out and buy a tool kit to secure your room. Not \u2013 at least \u2013 at this price, and with cheaper, and safer, hotels just a stone\u2019s throw away. If you want cleanliness, security, location and value for money, sadly we have to say: \u201cDon\u2019t stay here\u201d.
