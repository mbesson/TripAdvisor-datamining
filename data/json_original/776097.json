The room was very small, but compared to other hotels in the area in this category, it was a very good value. I mean the bed took up 90% of the room, so if you're looking for space, this hotel isn't for you, but be prepared to pay five or six times the price. Everything worked. Refrigerator in room, good air conditioning, quiet, 24 hour lobby. No breakfast, no restaurant, but lots of places all around, including many 24 hour convenience stores. There is also a great supermarket across the street, which can save you lots of money. There are two different subway lines close by, and it takes about 15 minutes to walk to the Shinjuku train station. From the airport, get off at Shinjuku station by train or bus, then either walk or take a short taxi to the hotel. It's a great neighborhood to explore Tokyo from. The large Isetan department store is also close by. The staff doesn't speak much English, and their website is all in Japanese. Best to email or call them to make a reservation.Hotel details:Hotel Park Inn[---]Tel 03-3354-9000Shinjuku area of Tokyo, 15 minute walk to Shinjuku sation.street address on their website.", "Date": "Nov 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR573102386", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "pattayainsider"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d776097-r23043755-Hotel_Park_Inn_Shinjuku-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "776097", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
