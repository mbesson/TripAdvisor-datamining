DO NOT go here!!!! This hotel is dirty and disgusting. We had dirty female underwear on the back of our bathroom door left from the last customer. The bedspread had cigarette burns on it. The ashtray had cigarette butts and ashes in it. There was a crusty looking bedpan left ON the counter where one would hope to brush their teeth and feel clean. There were dark hairs all over the floor upon our arrival. The lighting is offensive. One florescent light stuck in the middle of the ceiling with no shade or anything. With the boring white walls (with patches of off-white here and there) and light like that, I felt I was in a prison cell. A horrible, non-romantic ambiance.The staff was the most unfriendly and unpleasant I encountered in our one month stay in Bali. We checked out the very next day and couldn't wait to get out of there and never come back.", "Date": "Aug 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR908587886", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "rythmflower"}, {"Content": "Not so great We had items stolen from our room. When complained to management they couldn't have cared less they were of no assistance. The items weren't expensive as we keep our valuables locked away but it was things like a razor, blades etc things you wouldn't notice missing immediately.We checked out that day. Its a shame as the place was nice but if you can't trust the staff with your possesions its not worth the rIsk staying here.", "Date": "Aug 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR446257126", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "an0is"}, {"Content": "I love it!       swimmingpool by night", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR741213396", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "petpet"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d648696-r22992095-Hotel_Puri_Tanah_Lot-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "648696", "Price": "$30"}}
