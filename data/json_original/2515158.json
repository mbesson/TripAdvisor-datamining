The Hotel Langlois is a fantastic, affordable, classic Paris hotel. The room we had, which was a two-room suite, was comfortable and large. It had high ceilings, a bathroom that was spacious and clean, and a television with cable. The view was very cool - it looked out onto the front street where every morning we could open the windows and see businessmen and women buzzing about on the streets. Our room was on the third floor, and there is a small elevator, which is unique and beautifully adorned in wood, but it is not necessary to use all the time. The marble stairs are large and on a gentle incline so unless you're on the top floor or unable to use stairs, it isn't a big problem. The service was friendly - the front desk and breakfast staff were helpful and smiled when they saw us. There were free newspapers (The International Herald Tribune) at the desk every morning and breakfast was served in a front room. We ate there a few times but generally went to the corner and had a delicious breakfast at the cafe right there looking out at the plaza. The location is excellent. It's in Paris's 9th district and therefore is convenient to many quintessential Parisian sites and places. There are many excellent restaurants nearby. Also, the hotel is in a location that is not too frequented by tourists, so you feel like a Parisian resident yourself when staying there. The metro is nearby and taxis are plentiful in the area. There is a bike-sharing system at the foot of the street, viewable from the front rooms in the hotel. Overall, it's a relatively affordable and hotel that is unique and filled with character and individuality. You will not find this anywhere else in Paris.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallinn, Estonia", "Title": "\u201cCharming\u201d", "Author": "tk44", "ReviewID": "UR116274063", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel during a business trip and spent very little time actually inside the room. But I was satisfied with what I had - the antique feel was very 'parisienne' and I named my room 'the princess room' as soon as I checked into my 6th floor room, because of the sitting area. It looked like a charming little gazebo (there is a photo of this room onthe hotel web page under standard rooms). The room was well enough equipped - closets, tv, suitcase rack, hair dryer and a reliable wifi connection. Many lower budget hotels in Paris offer wifi these days, but most cannot actually guarantee it inside rooms. Many times I've sat on the stairs and to check my e-mails nodding and smiling at the elderly japanese couples taking photos of this curious scene. Many travelers here have complained about noise, but I guess that was before the sound-proofed windows. The only noise keeping me awake was the washing machines. I think they were next-door to this prnicess room of mine, because there was a 'staff only' door and the noise ran all night and went silent again in the morning. But I always use earplugs when sleeping in strange places anyway, so that failed to really bother me. The sites I needed - Sacre Coeur and the Montmartre area - were really close (we walked around all day, had tea on the hillside and it was all charming again). And the metro is just around the corner. We strolled around with our suitcases and had no problems. A tip for if you stay here - around another corner (right side street from the Trinite church) is a small store ('Jardin de Trinite'), where you can get fruit and water etc. And about a 5 min walk to the right from the hotel on Taitbout street there is a larger grocery store 'Franprix', where you can get yoghurt and all sorts of other goods if you are looking to spend less and skip the 13 euro breakfast.

The RoissyBus service from Charles De Gaulle Airport stops within walking distance from the hotel, which is very convenient. My room faced the back of the hotel and didn't have much of a view, but it was very quiet and peaceful. I thought the price was a bargain, given the excellent service and the size of my room. My sole complaint about the room was that the bed was uncomfortable -- the mattress was too firm without much cushioning. Also, unfortunately I do want to report that my purse was stolen from next to me in the breakfast/computer room just off the lobby. This was definitely not the hotel's fault -- it could happen anywhere. But please watch your valuables carefully when you are in the common areas downstairs.

The bathrobe was fairly old-fashioned, but everything worked well and there was a bathtub. The only amenties provided were soap, shampoo and a shower cap (besides towels of course). Both rooms were very clean and kept that way. The staff was excellent. They were very helpful with transportation advice and went out of their way to assist us with whatever we needed. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. I did not have a laptop, and tried to access the lobby computer a few times. Unfortunately, the connection was sporadic at best and at times did not work. The telephone connection in my room was also problematic and calls got cut off or weren't able to get through. There is construction work being done next door. The hotel volunteered this information when I first contacted them, so I have no complaints to them. The work would begin about 8:00 am, which you might want to take into account. The location is a plus or minus, depending on how you view it. On one hand, the hotel itself is not really near anything, except perhaps Rue Haussemann and the department stores. The Rue Richer area is a 7-10 minute walk.. On the other hand, many sites are within a 15-30 minute walking range. In addition, there is a Metro station right on the corner , and the Metro system in Paris is truly excellent. You can get almost anywhere within a few minutes. I really enjoyed my stay at the Langlois. Next time I might opt for a different location.

One of the stars of the hotel has to be the elevator - cosy, not for those who suffer from claustrophobia - but very quiet and efficient. We have just stayed at the Langlois for five nights and thoroughly appreciated every moment of the experience. Unfortunately, the building next door is being renovated and the resulting noise starts early - but, come on, you are here to sightsee and shop, not sleep in late every morning. Our room faced rue Saint Lazare and while not whisper quiet one was not overtly disturbed as long as you kept the double glazed windows closed. The room was impeccably clean, serviced every day, and we were given a non-smoking room as requested. The location of the hotel near some great brasseries and pastry shops, with the Metro station right on the corner, and fantastic shopping within easy walking distance, make this a perfect spot to stop.

We are a family of three (two adults and one nine-year-old boy) and have become accustomed to very cramped hotel rooms in Paris. The room for three we had at the Langlois was palatial in comparison. Large double bed (king size) and plenty of room for a cot. The bathroom was also gigantic; it appeared to have been converted out of a regular sized room. (Don't know whether this is true for all the triple rooms, but you might ask.) High ceilings as well, so we really had a sense of spaciousness all around. At the same time, the decor of the hotel has just the sort of charm one expects in Paris -- beautiful carved wooden decorations and an old fashioned caged elevator that actually worked. Some of the furnishings in the room were a bit drab, as is the breakfast area, but these can be tolerated. The hotel also provides free computer access downstairs, which is a rarity for a two-star hotel these days. Finally, when we paid our bill (150 euros per night for the the three of us -- not bad), they retroactively gave us a discount of 15 euros per night as they had decided to reduce their rates for the period we were there after we had booked our room. Such honesty is almost unheard of! The staff was also extremely accommodating. The only slight downside of the hotel is its location -- a little bit away from some of the central attractions.

The beds were clean and extremely comfortable, especially after a long day tramping about Paris. The bathroom was perhaps the only minor gripe that I could make. It was quite cramped, but provided the necessary I suppose - bath, shower, wash-hand basin and toilet. Any minor gripes were extinguished by the view from our window (on the sixth floor). Straight ahead, Sacre Couer could be seen on top of La Butte, whilst to the left was Trinite church. It was great watching the sun set behind that glorious view.

The location of the hotel is ideal for exploring Paris. You are about 10 minutes walk from the Opera and all the sights beyond that. Hotel: The hotel is \"old world paris\" with its fireplaces and antiques in the bedrooms. The lift is amazing with it's iron frame and heavy wood interior. The hotel is on a very quiet street, but really has no views of the Parisian skyline. The staff speak some English, and are willing to help and offer guidance when prompted. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning which was very good. Locality: The hotel is right on the trinity Metro line which provides access to the whole of Paris. We purchased the 10 ticket deal which was ideal for our 3 day stay (tickets are so so cheap!!) . There are plenty of little restaurants close by the hotel with decent food. We went to the 6th floor restaurant for breakfast at La Fayette which was excellent and had superb views of Paris. Sights: We bought a two day open top bus pass, which was superb...1st time we have done this in a city. Some of the sights look close, but are a bit of a distance on foot. The bus is ideal as you can get on and off as often as you like over the two days. You can also add in a riverboat cruise to the ticket. We didn't fid it at all expensive, but ran out of time for the boat cruise. Tickets are valid for two years so we will be back! Dining: There is no smoking ban in Paris, so coming from Scotland we found the smoking in restaurants very unpleasant. I would say do your research on restaurants and try to book in advance, don't rely on finding somewhere nice for that evening as you will probable end up in a tourist restaurant. Watch out many of the cafe's and restaurants all offer the same menu. We had two meals one excellent and the other the best meal ever. We dined in the Juiles Verne restaurant on the second floor of the Eiffel Tour. We couldn't fault it and the meal was first class. It was such a romantic venue and the view over Paris was amazing.

Located on a narrow street close to the Opera, the frontage of the hotel onto the street is so small one could easily walk past it and not notice. When we (wife, daughter and self), first saw the hotel, we were a bit taken aback. We have, over the years been used to staying in big, modern hotels in various countries, so this came as a bit of a surprise. The hotel is very old and has a storied history, so do not be surprised if you are initially disappointed - as we were - by the small and seemingly shabby reception area. The lift, off to one side of this small lobby, is very small too \u2013 sort of an an iron cage that creaks its way up and down slowly!! This too, is clearly a vintage contraption. We were greeted at the reception by a very friendly young lady who quickly checked us in. We were given a suite, facing the street. As I mentioned, the hotel is old and has the same old style architecture and layout till today, so when we walked in to our suite \u2013 such as it was \u2013 we felt let down. The room was old, as was the furniture. We continued to feel disappointed. But as we spent some more time in the room we realized that contrary to initial appearance, it was very clean. The bedlinen was clean and the bathroom was fairly large and very clean. The towels were fresh and white. The room heater worked very well The maids came in daily to clean the rooms, change linen etc. The limited breakfast served in the dining room on the ground floor was also quite good. The best part of the hotel is the location. The Paris underground is fabulous and there is a station just a couple of minutes down the street from the hotel. Since it is in the Opera district, it is pretty centrally located and close to many attractions. The Hop \u2013 On, Hop \u2013 Off Paris bus tour stop is about a ten minute walk away and there are any number of very good restaurants and cafes within a five to ten minute walk in any direction from the hotel. The staff at the reception were always friendly and helpful and ever ready to offer us advice on \u201ctouristy\u201d activities in Paris. I can confidently say that we did not have a single bad experience with the hotel during our stay \u2013 absolutely nothing to complain about at all.

We very much enjoyed our stay and would happily recommend the hotel to all value-conscious travellers. (We'd give it a rating of 4.5 if we could...) The hotel, a renovated bank from the 1800s, has considerable character and both the reception and cleaning staff are warm and accomodating (although some have limited English). Our room (#55) was very spacious and pleasantly, if simply decorated. The baby cot we had requested was set up while we were checking in, so that it was ready when we moved in. If we leaned out the bathroom window, we could see the Trinity church nearby - about the best view possible, given the hotel's location on a narrow side street. The antique (original?) elevator is a real adventure: it is attractively oak-panneled with an open swinging door but is extremely small and lurches frighteningly when it stops, often at the wrong floor. We found it great fun, but it is clearly the bane of the staff's existence and would be very unsuitable for those who are nervous, claustrophobic or mobility-impaired. As far as advantages, the hotel's location is good, quiet and yet very close to a metro station. The free internet access in the breakfast room is a real plus (although the wireless access is unreliable). We did not eat at the hotel, but the breakfast buffet looked nice and twice the staff thoughtfully gave our baby a fresh croissant when we left in the morning. I liked their key system: each time you leave, you drop your pass key off at reception and the 24-hour desk attendant welcomes you and returns it when you arrive back - no lost keys and the cleaning staff knows when your room is empty. The mini-bar prices were better than most of those in the local shops, so we drank very many bottled waters and juices and then were only charged for a few.

We skipped breakfast in the hotel in favour of nearby cafes or boulangeries, of which there are plenty. Downsides? Make sure you bring your own toiletries, or buy some from the Monoprix nearby: the soaps and shampoo sachets are really horrible, stingy offerings, and there's not even a facecloth. Our room was freshly cleaned when we arrived, but it did smell very pungently of fragranced cleaning products, to the point where we had to leave the windows open during the day, just to air the place - if you're a non-smoker with sensitive nose, ask for a non-smoking room!", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSigh...I wish I was still there\u201d", "Author": "alexp1963", "ReviewID": "UR6316701", "Content": "We arrived early October and planned to stay six nights.It was the last leg of a very long holiday, 2 months in all.

Silly move in hindsight especially when you have two kids(8 and 13), two adults and too muych luggage and you have no idea how the train system works. Eventually go to the hotel with the help of a local and checked in. Staff were very nice, no issues at all. Went up to our room (24) and were quite surprised. It was a very nice room. Note that the lift (elevator) only fits one person and two suitcases so you may have to do two or three trips to get all your stuff up if you are a family. Anyway we wanted to do some laundry and found a laundromat up the street (turn right when u leave the hotel, approx 300 metres). Along the same route before u get to the laundromat is a small shop where u can buy lots of other necessities, milk shampoo, fruit etc. For breakfast we had hot chocolate and and some croissants that I bought from the two bakeries nearby. We had that same breakfast for fourdays in a row, we just loved it.....on the fourth day the staff gave us some extra hot choc. and juice....they were very very nice. As for the sleeping arrangements, our kids slept on two fold out beds which were quite good, better than they looked. The hotel exceeded our expectations.

For a 2 star hotel, the service and room were very pleasant indeed. On checking in, I was given the key to room 23 and took the elevator to the 2nd floor with a heavy case. (Tip - remember to close the interior elevator door on entering and leaving!). The room was a double, facing towards the Rue Sainte-Lazare. The bed was very large and two square pillows were provided, as well as a long bolster-style pillow (which I didn't find terribly comfortable but perhaps others will!).The room comprised a double mirrored-wardrobe, television, small refridgerator, three wicker chairs, a guest table, two bedside tables. In one corner was a marble fire-surround/radiator grill upon which sat a marble bust in front of a large mirror. The room was also air-conditioned (optional, and controllable in the room), and had a small balcony/French windows looking into the street. The bathroom was compact and not terribly well-lit, but had a hair-dryer, shower/bath, toilet, sink and shaver point next to a mirror. The housekeeping at the hotel was not intrusive but the rooms were well-maintained. The staff at the reception desk were helpful and friendly throughout my stay from the 18th-24th October. I did not take breakfast in the hotel as several other options were available nearby, including a patisserie on the same street. The location of the hotel was good for sightseeing, given the proximity to the Metro line 12 station Trinite and also the Gare St Lazare for other lines, including that to Versailles. My one (very small) negative comment is that although the hotel has one computer terminal with internet access in the breakfast room, I would have appreciated free wifi in the rooms, and would have probably paid a little more for the room, was the service available.

It lived up to all our expectations. My wife is handicapped. They assigned us a large room with an enormous bath on the 1st floor. Unfortunately, after we got up to the room the romantic, but aged, elevator broke. They relocated us to a ground floor room which we enjoyed very much for the remained of our stay. It took a couple days for the part to arrive for the elevator, so it's a good thing we opted for the ground floor room. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the bathroom had all the modern touches, including a hairdryer. Breakfast was added on to the bill and was very good. In addition to the normal French breakfast of one baguette and one croissant, they had a spread of cheeses and cold meats; yogurts; an egg cooker, fruit, and a variety of regular and sweet breads and rolls, including croissants. Although breakfast would have been cheaper at the cafe down the street, we felt it was (1) worth the money; and (2) worth the convenience since it was February and we didn't want to venture out in the cold and drizzle just to save a couple euros. We met our friends from Belgium at the hotel. She is a travel agent and was impressed with the hotel. She thought that the only reason it was government rated as 2* instead of 3* was because the breakfast room is small. Apparently a 3* is supposed to be able to seat a larger percentage of its guests at one time. it is definitely nicer than other 3* hotels I've stayed in. The staff was helpful; the breakfast waitress was very friendly albeit with very limited English. The location is convenient. Because of my wife's handicap we cannot take the Metro, but there was a taxi stand at the end of the street in front of the Trinite church.

I did enjoy staying here, but wanted to counterbalance some of the overly-effusive 5 star reviews. I got off on the wrong foot with the property mostly over problems that were not the Hotel Langlois' fault. First, I had severe jet lag coupled with having landed in what I consider a confusing city. Second, I booked the room over a year ago when it had percolated to #2 on the tripadvisor rating scale (!) and hence was due to be disappointed. You need to remember that this is still an old style, two star hotel with all that that entails, i.e. street noise, paper-thin walls so that you can hear conversations next door, some rooms with tiny bathrooms, small closet space with not enough hangers, no ironing board, no coffee maker, no clock of any kind and finally a pleasant enough concierge whose job discription is less travel agent/confident (as you find in an expensive hotel) and more security guard/busybody. We were celebrating our 25th and were quoted 120 euros ($180 in my currency), not what I call 'budget'. The first room shown to us had a huge bathroom, and a view of...a wall. I asked to see another room and to her credit, the concierge showed me #63; tastefully decorated, tiny bathroom (but with tub, so usefull after walking all day!) and the killer view looking north at the Sacre Couer. We took it with no regrets. Moral; ask to see more than one room if possible. Getting back to the function of the concierge, when I asked for directions to a tourist bureau, she looked at me as if she had never been requested this before. Right then I knew I was on my own with regards to finding out what's on in town, making dinner reservations and deciphering the mass transit. When asking for multiple room keys, she explained the custom of only giving out one and when you leave, handing it to the person at the desk. I guess it's for security, but it can still get awkward when you both go off on seperate itineries. Anyway, I did get over the jet lag, calmed down and started to get in the vacation groove. And yes, I must agree that it is a very quaint hotel in a marvellous city. I loved the old, tiny elevator (reminded me of an old favourite in San Fran), just remember to close the inner door! The neighbourhood was nice as well, not touristy, but convenient to the sites and safe. You can feel like a Parissienne staying here. Below, dear reader, is some description of the locale to hopefully help you get acclimatized fast. As you step out of the hotel and head left towards the square you will run into a charmingly staffed patisserie. Patisseries in general (and this one is no exception) are the best deals in Paris. You can get a baguette, a delicious pastry and a 250 ml bottle of wine for less than 5 euros. One of our best remembrances was bringing said groceries back to the room, and snacking in front of the open window. Remember to bring/buy some wine glasses. Next to the patisserie is a nice cafe. Cafes are the worst deal in Paris. If you need a coffee, consider drinking at the bar like many commuters, you will be charged half the price. Also, they do not seem to have coffee-to-go in Paris and it is the next strongest thing to expresso. If you find it too strong, consider a cafe-au-lait. Next to the cafe is the Trinite metro located on the very convenient North-South #12 line. The metro is great, but can be daunting to a first-timer. This station has a manned booth but no photo-booth which you may need if you are considering the Carte d'Orange. I brought an extra passport photo which worked in the end. Walking is great in Paris but the metro is convenient and if I had to do it over again, would have taken the bus more. I would have killed for a map with the bus and subway lines justaposed over the streets, although I realise it would have been awfully busy. As you look out at the square, to your left is the way to Galleries Lafayette which is right next to the Opera which is where the RoissyBus drops you off. This is an economical and easy way to get to the hotel is you don't mind schlepping your bags four blocks. The map on the hotel website will make it easy for you to find it. Getting back to the square, if you go right instead for a short block, you will hit the Bistro des Deux Theatres, a prix-fixe only bistro where you get a kir, appetizer, entree, bottle of wine (limited selection), dessert and coffee for 33 euros. We found the experience fantastic. Finally, out of the hotel, if you head right instead of left and head up the road that veers north you will soon find the tiny Musee Gustave Moreau. If you are interested in the Museum pass, it's easiest just to buy it here, the clock does not start ticking until your first real visit. You will be hard pressed to break even on the pass, but it also can save you a lot of time in line. It gets you almost everywhere with the Eiffel Tower being the most notable exception. Also, even though my guide books were dated 2006, they wrote about 1,3 and 5 day passes when, in fact, they have moved on to 2,4 and 6. I hope these tips help you and just remember that the stereotype of the snootty French is most undeserved. Always say bonjour and try to speak there language no matter how broken your French is and they will meet you halfway and show you the secrets to their beautiful city.

We stayed in a suite on the street (St Lazare) side of the building but the noise was not a problem for us. There was an excellent pastry shop just down the road toward Trinite Square and a metro/subway station at the square. The metro is easy to navigate and you can get to any of the locations you would probably want to visit with little problem. We had a Paris Visite card which we had to validate the first time we rode on the metro which was an excellent value for us as it was essential for getting around to the major points of interest. The staff directed us to a laundromat which was in the opposite direction from the square where we were able to wash clothes. (We had been in Europe for a while before we got to Paris and were then continuing to London.) Although we were somewhat perplexed where to put our money to get the washers and dryers started a couple of locals patiently got us through it. There was a major shopping area Lafayette close by which my wife loved and where she claims she got some great bargains on what appeared to be an endless selection of lingerie. CONs: The hotel is somewhat off the beaten path. Although the metro system was excellent, still would have liked more variety nearby for meals and other amenities. Even though the breakfast (buffet style) was good; the breakfast room, just off the main entrance, was very small. It didn't take much of a crowd to find yourself cramped in and having to inconvience your fellow diners when trying to get to the breakfast table. Also the bed was somewhat uncomfortable and you could tell our suite was not orignally disigned as such. OVERALL: Will we stay here again the next time we are in Paris? Possibly! I think I will shop around a little more and use those resources available, especially this forum, to look for for something a little more centrally located and which would better suit our tastes.

We had a super meal at les Deux Theatres restaurant, set menu with lots of choices for33 Euros inclusive of a bottle of wine between two and coffee plus a sparkling wine aperitif. The hotel is handy for the sights with a combination of metro and walking. We found that a Paris Museum Pass was handy to skip the queues at Musee d'Orsay and Louvre but didn't save money unless you are a museumaholic.

I didn't sleep on the fold out beds but apparently they were adequate. The rooms were quite spacious, they were clean, and service was good. The elevator is a relic of a long bygone era It's small and quaint, and in very good condition!. There are a pair of doors behind the front door of the elevator. These inner doors have to be closed for the elevator to work. Hotel guests keep forgetting to close those doors, or don't know they have to, and then the elevator won't move.

Most tourists stay in the arrondissements surrounding the Seine: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Those areas are maximally thick with tourists. After spending a day in the Saint Germain area I felt like I needed elbow room and was very happy to go back to the 9th which is mostly French. The Saint Lazare Metro station is at the corner of the hotel\u2019s block. It could hardly be more convenient. A taxi stand is also at that corner. There\u2019s a computer with Internet in the breakfast room which is available for use without charge.

Our hotel room was robbed during our stay and the hotel managed this incident very poorly. Our almost entire wardrobe got stolen during the trip including many luxury brand items that you cannot necessarily fit into a safe. Some of these items were bought during their trip in Paris including luxury handbags and footwear. The robbery took place on the day before our departure. We are still investigating the matter, but we have not been compensated for our loss to this day and it seems like such an expensive stay for a 2-star hotel when you factor in our loss, not to mention the stress factor. I would stay away by all means. Here is a recap of the hotel theft incident: We entered the room one evening to find it all messed up and realized many of our belongings were missing from the room. We called the reception which then informed the manager. The manager apologized and told us they would compensate us for whatever was stolen. We said we would like to inform the authorities and make an official statement to the police. The manager told us this is unnecessary and asked us to make a list of stolen items. When we asked the manager if he could see in the computer any entries to our room other than housekeeping, we were told that there were none. However, one hotel staff did tell us later that our room was entered after the housekeeping left and before we arrived. We were puzzled. The next day, when we provided the manager with the total value of the missing goods, he proceeded to the closest bank and came back with a copy of a swift message for X Euros (total value of the stolen items) showing that this amount was transferred to our bank account and allowing no arguments or discontent on our part. The case seemed to be settled and closed. That day, we flew to London, relieved. When we came back home, we found out that the manager recalled the money from our bank without even informing us. We were told to deal with the insurance company. Well, as the hotel manager had told us at the time of the incident that it was unnecessary to call the police and issue an official statement, we were in no position to recover the total value of the goods from the insurance company. We had a wrong start. Had the hotel manager not provided us with the bank receipt showing X euros were transferred to our account the next day, our approach would have been more professional and official. We have been robbed and later deceived by the hotel management. We faced tremendous stress in dealing with this hotel theft situation. The hotel's management of the situation was far more stressful for us than the incident itself. Again, I would stay away by all means.

From Port Maillot we travelled on to Concorde where we changed for Trinite. Although we took a wee while to find the hotel it's really very easy to find if you know where to look. Just come up the steps of Trinite Metro and take the street on your right - Rue St. Lazare. It's just along there a bit. From this station you can get anywhere within minutes. It's also within easy walking distance of the Moulin Rouge and the Opera. The hotel itself is very charming and we found the service to be excellent. The bed could be more comfortable but the room was huge and we had a shower, toilet, minibar and tv. We were lucky enough to have a room at the back so we didn't get much noise although it's in the middle of a big city so you should probably be prepared for that. Any time we asked for help at the reception we received it with a smile. My biggest tip would be to ask for a restaurant recommendation. You won't be disappointed.

Although the room was bigger than most of the hotel rooms I've seen or stayed at in Europe, I did not quite like it. The room was not sound proofed, making each and every sound from other rooms very audible including footsteps on a creaky wooden floor from the room above. I'm sure the occupant of the room below me also suffered, as my floor also creaked badly and I was restless for most of the time. I should maybe take some responsibility for not specifically asking for a non-smoking room, but it was as if people on my floor were on a smoking holiday. They would smoke until the small hours of the morning and by day break I would be literally choking. The bed was uncomfortable, 'caved in' and creaky, the pillows equally uncomfortable. I don't know if the heating system was not effective or if it was just me freezing.

There were 3 major problems: the noise, the neighborhood, and --most importantly -- the poor value based on what you can find elsewhere. As for the noise, the sewage pipes and the radiator pipes are not insulated, so you hear every time someone in a nearby room flushes the toilet or showers. But the radiator pipes were the worst. Every night from 10pm to about 2am the pipes from the radiator clanged so loud it was impossible to sleep (even for a heavy sleeper), then the heat would be reduced and the room was chilled during the day. We asked to change rooms, but were told that it was an old system and that other guests had the same complaints and that there was nothing to be done. Don't expect to go to sleep any time prior to 2am because the radiator pipes will keep you awake. Furthermore, the hotel is not in a nice or convenient neighborhood. It's in a busy commercial district. You'll take the metro more than you need to and walk on ugly streets to get where you need to be. It's not the impression you want of Paris. Regarding the value, the Langlois is charging 110 euro for a standard double plus 9 euro for breakfast. So for 2 people, you're paying 128 euro because despite what other guests say, the breakfast is the best deal you'll find. You'll pay 9 - 12,50 euro plus tip for a similar breakfast on the street unless you get a pastry and coffee, which is neither healthy nor adequate for a morning of sightseeing. The 9 euro for a breakfast that includes yoghurt, cheese, and other sources of protein is reasonable. So 128 euro for a noisy, shabby room (We had one of the rooms pictured on the web. It's not so nice in person: terrible mattress, musty smell, and rickety furniture.), a poor location, and a not very helpful staff. Whereas we moved to the Hotel D'Angleterre, on Rue de Jacob in the St. Germain area and for 145 euro (which included breakfast) we had a charming room with a garden/courtyard view, easy walking distance to all the major sights (NOT METRO --the fares add up, by the way), a charming neighborhood that was a pleasure to stroll through, easy access to all sorts of cafes and bistros, a wonderfully helpful staff, a beautifully appointed lounge and breakfast room with lovely china (extensive buffet breakfast), and most importantly, a quiet peaceful place to sleep. Had we not moved hotels, we would have left Paris with a bad impression based on being tired and having to negotiate the horrible streets around the Langlois.

At a total cost of 446.54 euros including two lots of taxes but excluding breakky, I had an absolutely fantastic stay and thoroughly enjoyed what the hotel and Paris had to offer. We stayed in Room 71. It is HUGE because it is basically half of the entire sixth floor with the dividing walls knocked down. Entry to Room 71 is via its kitchenette, complete with pots and pans, microwave and fridge; followed by the lounge room which had a table and 4 chairs, a TV, a futon sofabed and wardrobes; then twin bed bedroom with (another) TV, and finally a big bathroom with quite fancy towels and fawcett/basin. See the room pictures room and window views. On yeah, the lift is one of a kind. The receptionist girl was very friendly and helpful but she only works on certain shifts, and then a surly eastern European guy (who claims he speaks zero English) takes over from 6pm and everything goes downhill from there. There is a fast computer with broadband internet and a CD/DVD burner (perfect if your digicam's memory cards are low) in the breakky room. It is free for all patrons. When you walk out of the front door, take two successive right turns and you will be outside a small supermarket. I went nuts on the French gummy bears. I would say you do not have the 9 euro breakky at the hotel simply because there are so many alternatives available. The croissants from the bakery on the way to the metro are quite awful (but cheap, at 0.72 euro each), I don't know why everyone is recommending that place other than for reason of convenience. There are so many nearby cafes offering hot breakkies it's not even funny. Prices are all quite reasonable. There is a taxi rank outside Trinite, across the road from exit of the Trinite Metro. Very convenient. I found the hotel a bit too hard to find when I got off the Roissybus at Opera because of the strange shape of Rue St. Lazare. As it turned out, if you are facing Trinite, the portion of Rue St. Lazare where the hotel is situated is the SECOND narrow street on your RIGHT, after the Trinite Metro exit (in a kinda roundabout setting). Paris is absolutely wonderful. So is the Langlois. Not hard to guess where I will stay when I come back to Paris.

We have relied on TripAdvisor for choosing many of the hotels we have stay in in Europe and we\u2019ve always been satisfied. But the Hotel Langlois was definitely an exception. We made reservations for a superior double with a large bathroom, but when we arrived, we were given a very small room with a tiny bathroom and angled ceiling on the 6th floor. The mattress was visibly and significantly caved in the middle. We were shocked to say the least. We explained that this is not what was represented and asked if they had any rooms like those pictured on their website. Fortunately, they had two others and let us look at both of them. Both were on the 1st floor and were spacious and attractive like those pictured. But one of them again had a mattress that was visibly caved in the middle and was on the street side, with very loud traffic noise even through the closed windows. We chose the other, mostly because it looked like it had an okay mattress (though very worn) and was quieter. We were content with our choice: two big dressers to put our clothes in, a large bathroom, attractive, and typically Parisian. Unfortunately, we discovered that even though this bed wasn\u2019t visibly caved, it was in reality caved, lumpy, and extremely uncomfortable. As another reviewer wrote, it also got unbearably hot with the heaters and we were forced to keep the windows open which caused the radiators to crackle and pop very loudly all night long. Being on the first floor, we could also feel the room rattle every time the metro train went by, which was quite frequently. By the next morning, we were exhausted, having slept very little. Then when it came time for showers, there was almost no water coming out of the shower head, not even enough to get the shampoo out (my husband worked on it for a while and it got better but was still quite bad)\u2014so forced to take baths and wash hair under the running faucet. This continued for the first four nights of our visit. We had scheduled a trip to London in the middle of our Paris trip (thank God!!) and by the time it came to leave, we couldn\u2019t have been happier to check out. Fortunately the hotel we stayed in in London was very nice (and cheaper) with excellent beds, and we were finally able to get some sleep. Upon our return, we were given a room on the 6th floor with a completely disfigured mattress\u2014significant mountains and valleys all over. I\u2019ve honestly never seen anything like it. The room was also small with a bathroom so small that only one of us could stand in it at a time (and this was a superior double!). They had no other room to give us, it was late Christmas Eve, and since we hadn\u2019t researched anywhere else to stay, we agreed to stay. We flipped the mattress which made it somewhat better. We slept awful again with the same heat and mattress problems, but this time in addition we had extremely loud plumbing noises that sounded like a waterfall coming into our bathroom every time someone flushed the toilet. By the next morning we figured out what was going on\u2014there literally was a waterfall coming into our bathroom. Some of the pipes were broken and every time someone flushed the toilet their raw sewage was pouring onto our bathroom floor. At this point, I felt pretty resigned to dealing with it and just getting through the next three days, but my husband was so horrified (Thank God) that he demanded another room. The entire time we were there, the staff was overwhelmingly UNhelpful, but this time there was a different person at the desk that my husband spoke to. She was very sympathetic and offered to give us a suite for the price of a superior double. We moved into the suite on the 3rd floor\u2014again another mattress with visible caving in the middle. The bathroom had an awful smell of urine, the TV was broken, the room was overheated, and filled up with exhaust fumes in the morning when the windows were open. By our last night, at about 3:00 am, my husband pulled out one of the chairs that turns into a twin bed and exclaimed, \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s actually comfortable!\u201d A word about the staff: with the exception of one person (a young woman who spoke excellent English and was very kind), the staff was pretty much completely unwilling to help. A month before our stay I contacted the hotel and asked them if they would be able to help with recommendations for Christmas dinner since from what I could tell most restaurants would be closed that day. The woman I spoke to told me it was too early to ask and told me to contact them two weeks before Christmas. So I emailed them two weeks before and was told that they would provide that information when we arrived. When we arrived, my husband asked the older woman (not the young helpful one) at the desk and she said she didn\u2019t have any recommendations to give us. Then when we asked again upon our return on Christmas Eve, the man at the desk said he had nothing to recommend. I explained that we really needed help with this and that they agreed to help. I asked him if he would be willing to do some research and find out what was open. The man had the gall to tell me to go research it on my own on their computer! I told him that I had already spent several hours on the internet trying to find something but was not successful because I didn\u2019t speak the language, and didn\u2019t know the city and what resources to look at. He said, \u201cWell whatever I find you could just find yourself.\u201d I said to him very assertively, \u201cNo, it\u2019s appropriate for you to do this. It\u2019s part of your job. When we return from dinner, I expect you to have this information\u201d Very quickly, he had a restaurant and made reservations for us. Why was it necessary for us to go through that? I also emailed the hotel prior to our stay asking for help with getting Louvre tickets. I said that I had heard that you can avoid the long lines by purchasing the tickets in advance, and asked if they had tickets themselves (a common service of most concierges) or had a way of getting them. I received a very terse and rude reply, \u201cNo, it is not possible for us to go and stand in line for you to get your tickets for you,\u201d and then she wrote the word Louvre in all caps because I had misspelled it. When I received this reply, and being upset enough to want to cancel my reservation, I decided it must have been due to a language barrier and gave them the benefit of the doubt, but having experienced the lack of hospitality there, I now know that it wasn\u2019t. My husband and I have stayed in many hotels throughout Europe and South America at comparable or cheaper prices, and I can honestly say that this is the worst hotel experience we have ever had. Some of the rooms are spacious and attractive and it is in a very convenient location, but unless they buy new mattresses and undergo some significant renovations (heaters, plumbing, etc) and hire new staff that is actually interested in helping, I cannot possibly recommend this hotel. Having gone through the experience, although I never would have imagined saying it, I would recommend staying at a cookie-cutter, boring Ibis for a comparable or cheaper rate.

It proved to be a great decision, as the rooms were very spacious with really high ceilings, marble fireplaces, antique statues, and large double windows opening out onto a relatively quiet one-way street. The building is quite old and the parquetry floors creaked a little, but the rooms were spotless, the elevator worked, the plumbing was good and the ensuite just fine.

We chose not to pay the little extra for breakfast there, but instead opted to eat out which is what you have to do in Paris. The location was perfect. Everything was within easy reach even by foot, so we walked nearly everywhere. The train station for Versailles was a 10 minute walk. There was a metro station within 200 metres, and a great number of theatres, shops, restaurants, bistrots, cafes, and convenience stores all around. The opera house is nearby as are the 2 famous department stores. We took the metro one memorable evening to Sacre Couer and, after dinner in Montmartre, walked back down the hill to our hotel through interesting lanes via the more \"vibrant\" Pigalle district (Moulin Rouge, nightclubs, bars, etc) for a rounded view of what makes Paris so... Parisien.

We stayed in a variety of different hotels during our trip to Europe, including a Chateau outside Paris, and we both feel without a doubt that the Hotel Langlois was our favorite place that we stayed. If you are looking to experience some Romantic charm and you want a good place to start exploring Paris from then this is definitely a great place. My wife and I arrived in Paris via Gare Du Nord. The Hotel Langlois is accessible from Gare Du Nord by taking a Metro train to St. Lazare Station (one stop). It will take some navigating to find the E train but if you are carrying heavy bags you will find this to be an easier way to go. Once you arrive in St. Lazare Station you can connect to Line 12 and go north one stop to Trinite station however I would not recommend this if you are not comfortable carrying your bags up approximately 20 steps. St. Lazare Station is approximately 2.5 blocks from Hotel Langlois and there are escalators/elevators that can take you up to street level. Stopping at this station will require a little more walking but looking back we found this an easier way to go (arrived and departed via this station). Walking through the front door of the Hotel Langlois you almost feel like you are walking back in time or into a game of \"Myst\". We were given room 54 which exceeded all expectations. If you are carrying a lot of bags you may have some difficulty with the elevator. I remember riding up and down the elevator just for the fun of it though on several occasions. If you have ever played Riven or Myst I think you will get a kick out of this place. Room 54 was more than we could have asked for. The bathroom came with two glassed (curtained doors) and was large by European standards. The windows open allowing you to look down onto the street. You can just make out the top of the Sacre Coeur off in the distance. This is the same area where the movie \"Amelie\" was filmed and if you have watched this movie you will get this feel in and around the Hotel Langlois. Our room had air conditioning available and it was capable of turning our room to a near deep freeze if you wanted. We had read from previous reviews that there had been a lack of air conditioning... this is definitely not the case now and it can be easily adjusted up and down depending upon what you like. We felt the cleaning staff at the Hotel Langlois took great efforts to help make are stay better than we could have hoped for. We had left a \"Teddy Bear\" out on a chair before we headed out one morning and when we returned we found him lounging on our bed with legs crossed. There were other little things the staff did as well that really made us feel welcome but I think this was one of the little things that looking back still brings a smile to my face. The rooms are definitely well kept. The free internet service was great. The front counter staff can speak a little English but if you know some french it makes it a little easier.

Friendly staff with clean rooms filled with character and beautiful floral oil paintings. Our room faced the side (courtyard) where the view was not impressive, but generally quiet.

For 96 euros it far surpassed our expectations and the bar fridge made it convenient to stock water, wine and snacks that we purchased in nearby shops. Good walking shoes are essential in Paris, as is a hotel close to a metro stop. The Langlois is about 100 ft. from the Trinte stop which made getting to areas outside of walking distance quick and easy. The grand stores of boulevard Haussmann are close as is the Moulin Rouge. A mist filled morning spent in Montmartre and visting the Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur and a simple evening sipping wine and nibbling cheese on the bank of the Seine may seem cliche, but made for the perfect Paris vacation. An evening at the old-world Cabaret Lapin Agile in Montmartre offered a glimpse into French folk song and tales performed by a colorful Parisian family. An attraction not to be missed is Sainte-Chapelle (\"Holy Chapel\"), located within the Palais de Justice complex on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 in the center of Paris. You will have to go through some security to get in, but it is a truly memorable spectacle that will stay with you long after you return home. A riverboat ride along the Seine is also a fascinating way to get a different perspective on the city. An all day pass is affordable and you can hop on at the Louvre, travel down river to the Eiffel Tower and then return back as the sun sets and the city lights create their own romance.

The rate was 96 euros a night for a room on the back side with a large double window. Compared to other hotels we\u2019ve stayed at, the room would be rated a 2-star hotel. The worst part of the hotel stay was the \u201ccreakiness\u201d of the floors. The floors creaked whenever anyone walked in or around the room, including hallways and adjacent rooms. Creaky noises were present at all hours of the day. Not good for light or late sleepers. After work hours and at night, the world is incredibly quiet. We left the window open all day and night. No air conditioning was provided, but it was not needed this time of year. The closest metro stop, a half-block away, doesn\u2019t take you anywhere you want to go unless you are willing to station-hop around the Metro system. Its more efficient to hike to and from the three outlying Metro stops. There is a great corner food store (Franprix) about 2 short blocks from the hotel. I strongly suggest you stock up on food and drinks from this market. The store had great prices, when compared to local cafes and the in-room mini-bar prices. It was fun to try locally produced drinks, fruits, breads, cookies and cheeses purchased from the store. My overall impression of Paris \u2013 a great place to visit but I wouldn\u2019t want to live there. Traffic in Paris was horrendous. Don\u2019t even consider renting a car.

I had high expectations of this hotel, and for the most part those expectations were met, but I had to do some negotiating first, which displeased me. I made my reservation two months in advance, and specifically asked for a street facing room, on one of their higher floors, but apon check in was given room 32, (3rd floor up out of 7 floors) and it was facing a courtyard which was not only dreary but a tad creepy due to the fact that it seems to be some sort of office building and is deserted totally at night. And I adore and require fresh air, and apon thrusting open the windows I noticed that just to the right of the window is pideon central and a TON of guano (pidgeon poo)...so I kept my window shut. But I must say that I immediatly went down to reception and kindly reminded the very nice young lady that my reservation was for a street view room and she told me that they are not able to make an guarantees, and that for today she could not place me in a street view, so I inquired about tommorow and she said they could place me in a street room then, so I was fine with that. And indeed the next day they did infact transfer me into a new room, which was FABULOUS! Room #64 with a beautiful window and railing that looked out far above the buildings across the street and had a fabulous full on view of Sacre Coeur, which is lit up at night. I noticed a fellow lodger posted a few photos, including the view from the room of #63, which was the third window to my left, so I had a clearer view of Sacre Coeur than they did, just for your reference. The bathroom had a great opening window too. There was a nice seating area, which consisted of a table and two chairs. There was also another chair by the heater. The view and fresh air from the window was so nice that a few nights I opted to \"dine in\" so to speak, and brought home a hot quiche from a patisserie, and some cheese, wine and various snacks. I really enjoyed staying in room #64. The housekeeping staff were very nice and the reception staff was very nice too, but even with using quite a bit of limited french, there really was a huge communication gap. ( I did order breakfast in my room, over the phone, entirely in french, though lousy, which the lady understood perfectly) but idealy if you spoke fluent french, this is the best. I opted not to ask for directions or help in locating things in town because I knew how difficult it would be for us to understand one another. All in all though, a very pleasant stay, and the staff is willing to accomodate your desires, if you are able to make yourself understood. I highly recommend having your breakfast delivered to your room, and enjoying your view and coffee. A delight! Oh, one other note...the elevator has one large iron door one opens first, and then a pair of wood and rattan inner doors, which can be held open by attaching them to little grabber hooks inside the elevator...anyway, apon exiting the elevator, if you fail to unhook these two inner doors, and just shut the outer iron door, and walk away....the elevator stays on that floor. Forever. Or, untill someone comes along and closes the doors or uses the elevator from that floor. So I did have to walk up 7 flights of stairs TWICE in one day because someone had forgotten to close the doors. The staff never told me about this or that I should pay attention to be sure to close the doors each time I rode the elevator, so I think this is something they should really stress to the guests. A terribly sweet elevator though!! An old Otis sweetie that just goes silently up and down all day. Wooden and tiny. Oh, one more thing...the wooden floors in the rooms are so darn squeeky!! In the first room, #32 it was sooooo bad I felt guilty walking around at all, just knowing how awful it must sound below. But my second room only had one or two spots which were easy to avoid.

There were 7 in our party. My husband and I stayed in a double room, while my brother, his wife and their 3 children stayed in a suite which was very reasonably priced for so central a hotel. I had had a lot of trouble finding a budget hotel in central Paris that could accommodate my brother's family in one room, so after much searching on the web was delighted to see the reviews for the Hotel Langlois on this web site and took the chance of booking. We were all very happy with the hotel. It is perfectly situated for sight-seeing, and was within walking distance of the Louvre, Opera, Palais Royale, large department stores, the Roissy Bus, L'Open Tour Bus and Metro. There were a good number of restaurants (French and ethnic) nearby, though I would recommend trying to go further afield if you have a smaller party than ours, as we had difficulty finding any interesting or particularly French culinary treats close by apart from the cake shop next to the hotel and the creperie booth opposite the Trinity church. But the French restaurants nearby did offer good size portions of standard 'pub' fare and were helpful in regard to children's meals. The hotel itself was very clean, the breakfast buffet was fresh and there was plenty of it, and the hotel has obviously gone through a recent refurbishment. There are also many pleasing period features retained throughout the building. Our only complaint was that the rooms were very warm at night.

Decided on this hotel after reading all the trip advisor reports..... and was not dissapointed. I found it too be a really charming, typically Parisian hotel....The rooms we had, numbers 12 (99 euros)and 14 (89 euros)on the 1st (2nd?) floor, were both fairly large, although the bathrooms in both were very small. ( a bit of a suprise as the bathrooms shown on the web are all large) Our double room, No 14, had a 'Juliet' type of balcony overlooking the street below. Whenever the Central heating become too much, we opened the double french doors to this balcony to let in cooling air... The rooms and bathroom were spotlessly clean...and furnished in an ecletic style...not exactly antique, not exactly \"junkshop' either... Very high ceilings added to the feeling of spaciousness. The double glazing on the French windows was excellent, blocked out all noise from the street ( although the hotel is on a quiet one way street). We did hear the person/s in the room above walking around early one morning though.... and the floorboards in our room did sqeak a bit... Was suprised to find a fridge in the room, and it was also stocked with the Langlois version of a 'minibar'.... very handy for keeping your beer and wine cold.... Staff were pleasant and friendly, but it does help to speak a little French....as they do not speak any English! Apart from Madame Bojena that is, who spoke a little English and was very helpful, ordering taxis's etc...We didnt partake of the Breakfast at Langlois, but preferred to pop around the corner to any number of Pattiseries etc.... By the way, avoid the cafe/restaurant along the street and on the first corner of Rue St Lazarre... as it was so close to the hotel, and so convenient, we ate here on the first evening.... we all ordered different Salads, and all were bloody awful... even the bread was below average... (the only thing good was the service!!!) Passing by the cafe a couple of times a day, we were always so suprised to see it full most of the time....surely they never got any repeat business!!!! But, it was the only time in paris where we did get poor food.... The hotel is very close to the department stores, the Opera etc... and is a pleasant 10min walk to Louvre... Will I stay at Langlois again? Although I normally like to stay at a different hotel in a different location when I return to a city, I probably will..... for the price I doubt there is a Hotel in Paris anywhere near as charming...clean....convenient...... if there is, I'd like to know about it... tt", "Date": "January 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cHotel Langlois \" A wonderful find \"\u201d", "Author": "chee", "ReviewID": "UR2975776", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Langlois on Dec. 24, 2004 for one night.

Well, so is this hotel, for which we're indebted to this website and to those who've made such useful contributions to it. It's so helpful to have current opinions, even negative ones. Thus we weren't expecting a synthetically swish corporate hotel with robotic if multilingual staff. Just a small clean un-fussy well-run French establishment which offered value for money as well as some distinctively individual character. And that is exactly what we got. Room 15's bedroom and bathroom are both spacious and high-ceilinged and there's even an ante-room. Furniture and furnishings are suggestive of the building's history, but don't expect them to be pristine fresh - this is a deservedly popular hotel. There are no spectacular views from this first floor but you do overlook that section of the rue St Lazare, which is tucked away behind the Trinite Metro and is therefore relatively quiet and particularly so at night. The hotel's geographical convenience is well-documented on the website. And yes there are the usual suspects. The communal breakfast room on the ground floor is a bit of a squeeze. The buffet breakfast, though good value, is modest and mainly carbohydrate; that it's available for some four hours every morning allows for some flexibility about when you choose to eat but it does seem taxing for the one person who runs it. The central heating system works effectively if somewhat mysteriously so that when it was freezing or below outside we were always comfortable but the lack of air-conditioning would be an important consideration in summer. The management is, thankfully for us, very low-key; the reception staff handle things undemonstratively, pleasantly and competently; and with some geniality and tolerance if you try a few words of French. In our view the hotel entirely deserves its current high-rating. We very much hope it continues to maintain this standard and that that is monitored through subsequent reports on the Trip Advisor website.

The hotel was great with the foyer and very cool lift setting the mood. The room (64) was clean (apart from the mysterious but inoffensive appearance of an empty wrapper marked \"Trojan\") and had a great view of the Sacre Coeur over the rooftops. The furniture was warm (in feeling, not temperature although that was fine). The staff was helpful and patient with my French. We didn't try the television / look in the minibar since there was no shortage of entertainment or bars even in a very wet and windy December Paris. We didn't try the breakfast either as there's no shortage of cafes to find a coffee and a croissant. Since I travel relatively frequently with business, I find it difficult to drop into holiday (vacation) mode in the sort of identi-room seen in most cities in most countries, and when I'm off for a long weekend with my fiancee we don't need a pool on site, great conference facilities and 2,134 channels of TV to alleviate the boredom of a soulless cell. This place was the perfect antidote. I gather the previous reviewer's successors in room 63 (or 62) also enjoyed their stay from the faintly audible expressions of pleasure (ahem), but other than that and some gently gurgling plumbing, the place was quiet. Obviously the place has a certain mood to it...
