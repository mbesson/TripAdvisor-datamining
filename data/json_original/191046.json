I informed the front desk, and they came up to look, issued a curt apology and gave us a new \"upgraded\" room (rm 502). The \"upgraded\" room had two couches we put our luggage on and was next to a loud couple/group. I guess two couches and a curt apology are all ant bites, allergic reactions, multiple days of itching and applying Allergic cream are worth. A waived lockbox fee or dinner/drink coupons would have been sufficient; however, nothing above moving to another slightly upgraded room (which we had to pack our stuff and move which resulted in delayed dinner plans and evening) was all that was offered. I emailed the hotel after my trip, and I did not receive a response.

They went straight to our rooms to check the room (although three girls in one room, clothes & make-up everywhere isn't going to help much when looking to see if anyone's gone through your stuff!) They checked the safe was still locked. They had our safe key replaced by lunch the next day & meanwhile we used the hotel safe to keep our valuables in while we were out. Breakfast was pretty good. Not the best I've seen at a 4*, but more than enough to fill you up. There was fruit, cereals, hams & cheeses, eggs & bacon etc. I ordered a club sandwich one afternoon and the portion was huge, enough for two. The staff at reception were great too. In the room there was a book with info on where to go during day/night including restaurants, clubs etc. My friend & I took the book to reception to ask one of the younger staff members for recommendations & he was more than happy to help. He gave us names of places we would never had known about had we not asked. The hotel is located at the top end of La Rambla so it's literally a 1 minute walk from Playa Catalunya which was great for getting the tour bus & the aerobus.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bolton", "Title": "\u201cWhat a suprise!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "mrskipling", "ReviewID": "UR33714414", "Content": "We stayed at the Rivoli Ramblas for 2 nights after staying at the adjacent Continental hotel (which we loved) As it was my husbands 60th birthday i had booked this 4* hotel as a treat.

Now about the hotel.....This is a great property, centrally located at the upper end of Las Ramblas (a superb pedestrian boulevard). The people-watching couldn't be better. Especially on Sunday afternoons (family day)...everybody strolls Las Ramblas. The rooms are typically European small, and rather spartan, but immaculate. The lifts to the rooms are the size of microscopic phonebooths. No more than 2 people with one bag each. Claustrophobic (?) take the stairs. There are at least 14,721 restaurants right outside the door, but for breakfast - the Rivoli Breakfast Buffet can NOT be beat. Americans: Get a transformer from the front desk when you check in if you didn't bring your own. You'll need it and they have tons that are free to use. Ask for a upper floor room if you want to face Las Ramblas (kinda noisey on wknd night). If you're overlooking the garden restaurant any floor is ok. Very accommodating staff, and they have a free secure luggage drop if you arrive early, so you can get out and see the this great city without lugging your bags with you.

Really had expected an upbeat, classy hotel for the money I paid, but I don't think the Rivoli Ramblas could be described as that. The room was small and at the rear of the hotel, with a view of several pipes running up the wall of the adjoining building, about 3 metres away. And that was it for the view. I was pleased to see a spa-bath. Unfortunately the bath took about half an hour to run and several of the hoods of the spa jets were loose, which can make for a rather uncomfortable bathing experience. The loose ones had been left at the edge of the bath for the cleaner to see, and I returned later in the day to find that they had been replaced, and were still loose. Otherwise, the bathroom was clean, but dated. The other thing was the intense heat in the room. I mentioned it to reception as I couldn't seem to get the Aircon to operate, and was told that due to the time of year there was either heating available in the hotel, or aircon, and that was it. So the window got left open at night as otherwise the heat would have been intolerable. One reviewer described the hotel as little better than a travel lodge. In terms of the rooms, I would agree. Breakfast was quite good, fresh orange etc and plenty of meats and yogurts, fresh crioissants, so no problems to report there. In general I have stayed in much worse places that Las Ramblas.

I had very fond memories of the city and wanted to share them with my new husband as he'd never been and we were in Spain to celebrate his birthday.

It ticked all of the boxes for me but I took some advice that I had read on another review and it worked! I told them I wanted a nice room as it was my husband's birthaday and that I wanted a front facing room with a nice view. We were arriving late so my main criteria was that I wanted to be able to find the hotel easily after travelling and having not been to the city for 7 years I was pleasantly surprised. If you want to be based on the Ramla, I don't think there is a better hotel location wise. We got the airport bus into the city and from landing to checking in was probably only about 40 mins! We only had a short ammount of time in the city and I wanted to cram everything into less than 24 hours! La Rambla has got a little bit, shall we say, colourful, over the last few years. If you haven't been, don't expect any glamour! but I don't think that's why people go to Barcelona anyway. We got up early and went to the Boqueria as the hotel breakfast was extortionate. The boqueria is only 2 mins away, as is the port, the gothic quarter and the placa Cataluna. We took the Metro to Parc Guell which was only 20 mins away and it was absolutely stunning. We spent the rest of the day shopping and the hotel were happy to look after our bags for us. Back to the hotel itself, friendly staff, clean, well equiped with additional touches such as reading lights and remote control shutters on the windows that blocked out all of the noise from the street. This hotel also ticked boxes for me from a personal point of view, sometimes I like hotels that aren't part of big chains and feel personal, I like a bit of kitsch and I got it here with the murals on the walls of scenes from the city, and the aquatic scenes in the piano bar and also the crushed velvet bedspreads!

On arrival the chap on the reception advised us the only room left with a double bed was an interior room & suggested an alternative twin-bedded room. We went for this, as it's not uncommon in continental hotels & the beds are usually together. I had seen on the website that there are two types of rooms - modern & 'classic' so I said we would take the twin if it was a modern room.

The whole thing had a very contemporary feel. The bathroom was a a bit odd - very futuristic metal finish with red worktop & tiling but great bath & shower. (The stainless steel basin looked great when cleaned but once you've washed your hands once it looks a real mess - probably not a good decision by the folks who chose the fittings).

If your looking for good value for mony, in a great location, you can't go far wrong with this place, I would certainly reccomend this hotel, AND I would stay there again.", "Date": "July 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location.

I sometimes wonder how four star hotels are rated?, The first room we checked into was obviously in need of updating, and was quite small, did not have a particularly exciting view so I asked to be upgraded. We had to pay an extra 60 euros per night but it was well worth it, we had a junior suite with a huge bedroom, sitting room and a bathroom with a jacuzzi bath. However when our friends checked in the next day they had a lovely bedroom that was much more modern and plenty big enough, so its seems pot luck to be honest. Reception was polite but did not point out any of the hotels facilities, ie gym, sauna, restaurant etc. There is a cocktail bar, which is very reasonably priced however the bar staff were very ignorant. We asked the concierge to hail us a taxi and he told us it would be quicker to walk to placa cataluyna and get one ourselves. The Rivoli has a great central location, but attention to detail lets it down, have stayed at three stars on the Ramblas that were cheaper and just as nice.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murcia, Spain", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Barcelona thanks to Gaudi\u201d", "Author": "Carolinaribera", "ReviewID": "UR4624764", "Content": "Stayed three nights at the Rivoli Hotel in Barcelona.

Gaudi was way ahead of his time and The Sagradi Familia Cathedral is an ongoing work in progress you will not believe! Having the Olympics in 1992 completely revamped the infrastructure of the City and apart from the grumpy staff in nearly every restaurant and shop - we had a fantastic time. There is so much to see and entry to all the museums is very reasonable.

The staff were courteous and pleasant, and the surroundings were tidy and clean. Unfortunately, this came to an abrupt halt upon entering the room which was allocated to us on the 7th floor. Dull & dark colours in the room, which were not too pleasing on the eye. The bathroom only had a mixer shower from the bath taps, which wasn't even pressured so the water flow was slow. If you do not understand Spanish so good, then your only TV choices in English are Sky News & CNN. I too also experienced warm air only from the air-con. Prices for the mini-bar, and in room safe are not displayed, so be careful on what you drink and eat. There was also no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, and so if you required tea or coffee you'd have to go to the hotel bar, and pay the local fees given. All facilities mentioned in brochure and on the website, were unavailable due to ongoing refurbishment. This would be your alarm clock in the morning at around 8AM with the constant drilling & Hammering taking place. On a plus side though, the room was cleaned everyday to a high standard, and bed sheets changed daily. Breakfast was appetising to say the least, and the presentation was laid out to satisfaction. On another day in the future and once all refurbishments have taken place, this hotel may meet the 4* grade it is supposed to be, but right now in my opinion I don't think it's there yet.

Room on mezzanie floor \"0\" was huge, with balcony, very clean and professional. No problems with smell and arrived for breakfast at one minute before closing which did not seem to cause a problem. Went on hop on/off open top bus on blue and red routes which really gave a flavour for what to see if staying 48 hours in Barca. 21 euro for two days and covered the Gaudi favourites, the Camp Neu, Park Guelle(sic), the Olympic stadium and the waterfront amongst a lot more.

The breakfasts etc in the hotel are very good but vastly overpriced! go next door to a local tapas & get an even better breakfast/ snack/ coffee for a 1/4 of the price. For us Rivoli Ramblas was adequate and we would be tempted to use it again, but would probably go for somewhere quieter.
