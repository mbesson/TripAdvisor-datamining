At the time, I checked it out, but thought that it was a little out of my price range as there are often great deals for hotel rooms in Montreal. This time, I was travelling with my senior managers and I really wanted to treat them to something special. We booked 5 rooms and a meeting room for half a day, and the bill was just over $1,700, which I thought was reasonable. This hotel is close to both old Montreal and the downtown area. It is beautifully decorated, the staff are very friendly and professional. My room was upgraded (maybe because I was picking up the tab?), and it was lovely. Large bathroom with a soaking tub and shower. All up to date and modern amenities, HD TV, free WI-FI, fancy phones, you name it. My only complaint; I didn't like the pillows - too soft for my taste, but I didn't ask for an alternative, so ended up not having the best sleep, but that was my fault. I didn't use the spa, but I did take a tour. While it is very smalll and in the basement it is in a very cool space. Two people in my group had treatments and loved it.

They read our complaint, though, and offered a free night and breakfast package in compensation. We thought they deserved another try. So we went, this past weekend. As usual, we were asked which newspaper we wanted in the morning. The girl at the desk noted our answer but there was no newspaper at the door the following morning. Plus, the room had been prepared (small bottle of water, robe, slippers, etc.) for one and there were 2 of us... I called the reception to ask for the newspaper and was told the one we wanted was not published during the weekend. I know very well it is. They finally got one for us. I asked them to prepare the room for two on the second evening. To no avail. Of course, this is nothing really serious, but it is precisely the kind of little simple things you expect in that category of hotel. At the least...

This was my first visit to Montreal (with a friend). The lobby area is lovely--with a gorgeous library-sitting room and a stylish bar in the restaurant. And there are some old-school touches at the Le Saint James, such as chocolates on the pillow at night and old-fashioned keys that you leave at the front desk when you go out. But. I do have two big complaints. First of all, the bloody sheet incident. I crawled into bed one night exhausted and didn't really look carefully at the bed. Until I noticed a blood drop on one side of the pillowcase and then on the other. And then saw there was fresh blood on the blanket (duvet cover) as well. In fact, there was a lot of blood on the bed! It must have been the housekeeper who had an accident during turn-down service? All I know is that I called the front desk to come change the sheets, and as housekeeping was not available at 2am, they sent the front desk clerk and another guy--neither of whom had ever made a hotel bed (they said). This was fine and got me through the night. Though I was VERY suprised that the hotel neither apologized nor gave me the night free when I spoke to them the next morning. My second complaint is small--I think I got the handicapped room because there was no bathtub, just a shower with a long rail and a wooden bench in it (it definitely looked designed as a handicapped room). Water in the shower sprayed ALL over the bathroom, no matter what I did...quite a mess and not relaxing. In the end, it was a fine hotel but they did not live up to their end of the bargain.

The best part was the upgrade to a suite. What an incredible room with 20 plus foot ceilings, a massive four post bed and a bathroom with 24 towels..gorgeous big seemingly brand new towels. Suite 301 (the Maxwell Suite) is on the third floor and is ultra private. Only two rooms on the floor, both are suites.

Our late night room service was very very good (veal steak, salmon, shrimp cocktail, massive onion soup, berries w/ cream) but it was half as much as our room for one night...again pricey but well worth it. We had drinks in the bar - very charming servers and the bartender took our \"requirements\" for drinks and created two top notch cocktails. Savoy worthy even. We had breakfast in XO - the service was good but not perfect. The food was good but again not perfect. Note to the kitchen...toast the muffin used in the Eggs Benedict or the muffin just turns into a soggy muffin. The decor in XO, well, you'll either love it or hate it. It's eclectic without a doubt but does have a feel of 1989 just a bit. The changing colored lights are interesting but too prominent. The large screen TV's, that's just a big azz mistake if you ask me. They do not belong anywhere in the public's view when you're in such a fine hotel and restaurant.

The hotel is located on the edge of Old Montreal so it is within easy walking distance of many restaurants, shops and the waterfront. The hotel itself is an unimposing structure with only 60 rooms, each one of which is unique. Once you walk in your impression immediately changes. The entryway is a combination of small but spacious while on the immediate right is a marvellous library room. We had coffee, played chess (they supplied the board) and accessed wi-fi while in a genteel surrounding with an extensive collection of books both in French and English. Our first two nights were on the 11th floor where we had a well-equipped but not particularly spacious room with a queen size bed. The bathroom was medium size with a superb shower. As tall people we had requested a kingsize bed but through an administrative error were not given the correct room/bed. Once a kingsize bed/room was available they moved us to the 10th floor. This room was larger and had an even more spectacular shower (6 different shower heads including directly overhead that could be used in any combination desired). I don't believe any of the rooms have views of note. What we found most impressive was the willingness and dedication of every staffmember to do everything possible to make our stay pleasant. As regular guests at Ritz Carlton properties we're used to the highest levels of service. Le St. James went one step beyond. Perhaps it was the smallness that made it more personal. Breakfast in the lounge/bar/dining room was a delight. The menu was varied and over our stay we tried many different choices: all excellent. While we never had lunch or dinner at the Hotel we had drinks/wine in the early and late evenings. The intimate setting was relaxing. The wine list is good but not extensive. The gym (in the basement along with the spa) is very small with two treadmills and two stationary bikes with a limited amount of free weights. If you want to do anything but basic cardio work you'll be disappointed.

Strangely, however, we were billed for the Continental Breakfast, in addition, to juice, tea and cereal, even though we did not order the Continental Breakfast. Our breakfast, therefore, wound up being a cost. Another couple who sat next to us encountered the same problem. Despite having raised the issue with the general manager and the front desk, the problem reoccurred each morning. It baffles us why Hotel Le St-James would want to bill in this manner and leave guests with a feeling of being overcharged when Hotel Le St-James could offer guests a truly memorable experience and encourage repeat visits. If visiting Montreal, I recommend choosing a different hotel, like Hotel Place D'Armes.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service\u201d", "Author": "SEE1981", "ReviewID": "UR115504688", "Content": "This is a lovely small hotel near the Old town in Montreal.

We booked this hotel after our scheduled vacation to Budapest fell through at the last minute. In light of this disappointment, I was thoroughly prepared to dislike this hotel; however, it was impossible not to fall in love with this first class establishment, as well as the city of Montreal. From the moment we arrived at Le St. James, we were treated like royalty. Upon our arrival at the hotel (by car), the concierge unloaded and parked our vehicle (there is a separate fee for parking) within the blink of an eye. Check-in was just as smooth, and it was only a matter of minutes before we were fully ensconsed within our room -- a junior suite that was exceptionally roomy and clean, and included all of the basics (flat screen television, speakers, safe and minibar). The bathroom had a bath and separate shower, and my daughter and I loved all of the bath products (particularly the body cream and sleep mist). The hotel, a former bank, is classy and elegantly furnished. A reading room off the lobby is extremely comfortable, and houses a Mac computer with free wi-fi access (there is a $20 charge for wi-fi access in the rooms, which I do find unnecessary) as well as newspapers, magazines and books (all of the great classics). Le St. James has a spa (which I did not have the opportunity to utilize) as well as a small fitness center. The fitness center houses two treadmills, an elliptical machine, several stationary bicycles and some weights. Although small, the fitness center was more than adequate, and I never had to wait for a machine or to use the weights. We had the opportunity to dine at XO, the hotel restaurant. Although pricy, the food was excellent and the wait staff more than accomodating. We also ordered room service during our stay, which was delicious, albeit expensive (our turkey club and coffee came to $50, with taxes and service charges). At this point, I must note that everyone employed at the St. James went out of their way to ensure that we had a fanastic stay in both the hotel and in Montreal. The staff at the front desk was wonderful throughout the duration of our visit. The concierge went out of his way to prepare a full itinerary for us, complete with restaurant recommendations (all of which were fabulous, particularly Barroco for dinner, and Olive & Gourmando and Eggspectations for breakfast/lunch). Even the housekeeping staff expressed concern about our comfort, and made sure to give my daughter extra chocolates during the nightly turn down service (which were especially appreciated by a certain 10 year old). Le St. James is centrally located within Old Montreal (or Vieux-Montreal, as it is called by the locals). Most of the sites that we visited were accessible on foot, and those that were further (ie. the Biodome, Botanical Gardens, Complexe Desjardins) could be reached by taxi or train. A few additional points ... Le St. James does take pets (for an additional fee). Although I chose to leave my canine companions at home, I did see other guests with dogs in the hotel lobby. Also, if traveling to Le St. James by car (and you are relying upon a navigational system), please be aware that there are two 355 Rue Saint Jacques (the address of the hotel) in Montreal. The address that we arrived at first was an abandoned building; however, when I plugged the name of the hotel into my navigational system (instead of relying upon the address alone), I was immediately directed to the correct location. Anyway, all in all, I cannot do anything but rave about Le St. James. I have traveled a lot over the years for business and pleasure, and very few hotels have made me feel as special as Le St. James. I am already planning my next trip back to Montreal this summer ... and you can be sure that I will be staying at Le St. James.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cClassic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "GRJESQ", "ReviewID": "UR102084148", "Content": "The Le St-James is a beautiful and luxurious hotel.

We anticipated that there would be a comfortable lounge with multiple seating areas and service for drinks or light appetizers, and instead there was a shabby \"library\" adjacent to the drafty main entrance, which served as a waiting room for guests checking in. Not a place you want to sit and have a drink. There is not really a lounge in this hotel at all. The fitness center was promoted as being \"state of the art\" although there was one treadmill, one weight machine, and a couple of other pieces of equipment in a basement room. The \"spa\" is one treatment room with stone walls, and there are zero amenities available to hotel guests. The steam room is really just a steam shower, and you cannot access this unless you have purchased a treatment in that room. There is not even a bathroom at the spa level, nor is anyone sitting at the desk unless they are waiting for an appointment. My wife found this basement area to be creepy, and I found it to be nowhere near a five-star level. The breakfast included with our booking turned out to be a continental breakfast only, which was adequate for us, but perhaps not for someone else - lesser value than I expected. I was particularly insulted, however, by the fact that I was charged $6.00 for a cup of regular coffee in a take-out cup. I came to the lobby early in the morning looking to bring coffee upstairs while I did some work, and was astounded at the nerve of the hotel charging this much for coffee - they need to get a clue from the Four Seasons about service - free coffee in the morning is five-star - this was not. This charge for the coffee was consistent with the $20 per day WiFi charge we were compelled to pay - let's get real about service - free internet is service-oriented, charging for it, let alone $20 per day for it, is not. Other than these complaints, the room was very nice and comfortable, and the hotel location was great. What nearly made up for the hotel's shortcomings was the excellent concierge staff, particularly Simon, who were so accommodating and knowledgeable about what we New Yorkers would want to do and see. They sent us for an incredible meal at Barroco, which really made our trip, and were so informative and responsive. Overall, we will never stay at this hotel again and I do not consider it to be a five-star hotel, although the staff was well-trained and accommodating.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service - Beautiful rooms - Allows Dogs\u201d", "Author": "CAShirey", "ReviewID": "UR92725672", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights over New Year's eve weekend and it was wonderful.

The best part for us was that they allowed us to bring our dog and even set up the cutest dog bed and bowls for him in the room. Its hard to find hotels as nice as this one that welcome pets. We also had treatments in the spa and although the massage was just OK, the rooms were worth it, very unique and we got our own private room with sauna, shower, and steam room to get ready in.

In deciding on a hotel, I spent weeks trying to figure out whether it would be worth the cost of the rooms at the St. James since there were so many hotel bargains being offered. The bottom line, it was worth it. Everyone just loved being at the hotel. In fact, it was difficult to get the girls out of the rooms. When you figure in the money spent on other things like dinners, drinks and entertainment, the cost of the room where you spend most of your time was a reasonable expense. We walked to the Point Vieux Port ice skate each day, then a leisurely lunch. The girls loved the beautiful, spacious, well-appointed bathrooms with radiant heated floors, wonderful beds, beautiful linens, luxurious amenities, flat screen TVs and comfortable bedroom furnishings. We ate out each night at great restaurants within easy walking distance. The first night the \"children\" wanted Mexican. I am thinking I did not come all this way for Mexican food, but in the interest of family harmony quickly agreed. We walked three blocks to an outstanding meal at Casa de Mateo. The next night, Le Bonaparte served us another extraordinary meal. The Hotel restaurant is in the former grand bank's main room. The children would have like breakfast choices at 11:30 a.m., but were limited to dinner type entrees and $22 hamburgers. My lunch of PEI oysters, sliced steak and apple/pear tart with walnut ice cream was delicious. Had I told the concierge what we wanted, however, I am certain he would have directed us outside, but I wished to experience all of the Hotel and so I chose to eat in. The value wasn't there. By contrast my son and I had a beer the first night in the library off the main entrance and sat by the fire reading the days papers. Even at $10 a beer it was worth it as we sat there eating the chilled free clementines. Each evening we would return to our rooms after dinner to find clean linen mats by our bed, new complimentary slippers, chocolates and bottles of water on each side of the bed. The doormen, concierge and the receptionist staff were all very friendly and welcoming. The bottom line is my wife and children think of our hotel stay as the best Christmas present I could have given them and that is exactly what I was hoping for. Travel is all about the experience and this was a great one for our family. I will do it again, particularly since the drive is so easy.

The hotel was really cool, with the kind of boutique hotel decor that I really like: dark and cozy and plush. I like that the rooms are all different too - ours were decorated very nicely - a bit dark though. It always seemed like it was about 6pm, but Le St. James is a downtown hotel in the old quarter of the city, so this is to be expected. The bathrooms were very nice - big tub in one of them which I always appreciate. The hotel restaurant is expensive but delicious - we all really loved our meal there. Had a bit of a communication problem sometimes but that is Montreal. Service was also above the average, but not by much. I did think the people at the front desk were friendly enough. The standouts were: The concierge, Eddy Amoroso. He is a wonderful concierge. He organized a few things for us that I couldn't do myself, and he did that wonderfully. Thank you Eddy! The spa. I went for a massage because I wanted to see the bank vault that the spa is located inside. I am so glad I did! It was really something special, and the masseuse was a very capable lady, so I left quite happy. The room service was disappointing, verging on horrible. We are room service junkies, so I know more or less how things should go, but I felt pretty bad for these fellows and for myself because it was very expensive (as always), but they always managed to forget something: coffee cream, cutlery (yes, can you believe it?), a meal, etc. The worst of all was when we wanted to order a dessert after a nice day out. We ordered a brownie and a sundae. It took over an hour to arrive, (our son fell asleep so no dessert for him), and the brownie was so burnt on the bottom that I actually had to spit it out of my mouth. It was literally charred! I didn't bother to complain because it was so late. All in all, it was a pleasant stay, but I think I might check out other hotels in Montreal before I went back again just because it was pretty expensive for what it was. But it was worth a visit, certainly. The neighborhood is funky, but there are a LOT of homeless men walking around the general area... I did get a fantastic blowout from a hair salon around the corner called Leopolds. He was so gentle with my hair!

Fatou could not have been more helpful and was kind and considerate and sent emails within seconds of our conversations. She secured a room for us for our 20th anniversary when the hotel was completely booked for several of the days of our stay. I cannot thank her enough for her helpfulness. She had no reason whatsoever to be so accommodating but chose to be exceedingly helpful. For that, I am eternally grateful. Our anniversary celebration was perfect and Fatou was instrumental in that. We had a few problems with the wireless internet access which shouldn't have been a big deal except we were there to attend the Canadian Open and needed to access the schedule each day which is available only online. The concierge, Simon, went to extraordinary measures to help us obtain the schedules. Both concierges we encountered were unbelievably helpful. We were not thrilled with the restaurant recommendations of Boris Bistro and it's sister restaurant, Harvey; however, both were adequate. All meals that we had in Montreal seemed to be sub par for the value. We had a few very nice meals but all were VERY expensive compared to similar meals in the states, even NYC. Our two favorite meals were at Le Latini and Le Locale, both within walking distance of the hotel. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant but did use the WC after checking out and before our flight home and were very impressed with the facilities. When I am Roger Federer, I will hire the interior designer that came up with the decor in those restrooms! The subway was just a block away from the hotel so very convenient. It was extrememly safe (as was all of Montreal that we could see) , clean and simple to navigate--color coded just like the Paris metro. The accommodations (Room 605) were spectacular, the room, five star. I believe the room we were in was a step above standard. There was a special anniversary treat waiting for us when we arrived. The housekeeping staff were invisible, from a.m. clean up to turn down service. Two problems with the room were that the tv was so far from the bed that the remote did not work from the bed. We forgave this inconvenience because we didn't need to be watching TV on this trip and most channels were in French. Also, had we spent less time at tennis and more time sightseeing around the hotel I would have been disappointed that there was no real lounge to sit around in sipping cocktails and people- watching. There is a beautiful library with cocktail service from the restaurant but I never saw another person in there so it would have been more like having a cocktail in our room. The bathroom was 5 star and the shower was extraordinary. There was no bathtub which was fine with us. We never saw or heard another guest on our floor in the four days we visited, though the hotel was fully booked. In regard to the complaints about windows and light, we left early each morning and arrived back late each night so the windows really weren't of much value. I believe we had 3 heavily-draped windows in our room and one in the bathroom, all facing other buildings, but it just wasn't an issue for us. I knew in advance, from reading previous reviews, that I needed to bring higher wattage light bulbs and didn't bother. The light and make up mirror in the bathroom were just fine. The bed was five star with white Frett-style linens, sumptuously comfortable. We were overwhelmed with the beauty, comfort and hospitality afforded by this hotel and will return again, God willing.

The spa is something to be seen as far as it's decor. We both had 60 minute hot stone massages which were the best I have ever had. As for facial treatments, the \"mask\" is literally just that and not a traditional facial like I am used to. Next time I will take the 90 minute massage instead and skip the face treatment.

We looked into other suites but nothing would work for a family with 3 young ones. Anyway, I would highly recommend this hotel for couples, but not at all for people with children coming along. There is basically no common areas, and the restaurant XO is very odd. Room service is out of control: no kids menu, and in the adults menu the selection is exotic. Couldn't get a mac-and-cheese, we got very close with a selection of pasta and white sauce that cost us $30 and the kids did not like it. Room service took about 1:30 hours to deliver - including our sandwich and a salad - no drinks, not even soda - the bill was $170. Even wine or champagne from the room service was a looong wait. Now, you may call my kids spoiled but they were sad that there were no little special gifts for them - you know how the Ritz offer those little lions, Four seasons leave a beautiful tray of cookies on arrival and other little gifts, le St James basically just absolutely ignored them, not even trying to know their names (and they are usually greeted by their names everywhere we travel).

We were looking for a place to spend a relaxing weekend that did not involve traveling a great distance. Montreal proved to be ideal. Only 57 minutes from Philadelphia, take off to touch down...and you're in France! How great is that? We have become spoiled at some pretty amazing 5 star hotels in the past. We always read the review on tripadvisor.com before we make a reservation and since this hotel got some pretty rave notices we thought we would treat ourselves to 4 nights. We paid $355 per night for a queen room. Well worth the price when you consider that renting a car in Montreal is not necessary and public transportation is inexpensive and easy to navigate. We drove up to the hotel well located in the nicest part of the old city...walking distance to everything... and were immediately taken with the lovely exterior. The door men greated us by name when we exited our taxi and we entered the warm and inviting lobby with its beautiful wood work and inviting decor. My test of a great hotel is the feeling that I'm home when I enter the building and when I get into bed in the evening. This hotel hit the mark! On our first evening we were too tired to go out and decided the stay in and order room service. When we were shown to our room we loved the cozy interior, beautiful antiques, classical music playing on the CD player and a stack of CD's to fit anyone's taste. We unpacked, crawled into bed ,,,,,,,Ioved the Frette linens...and ordered room service. Although we did not order it........ there was Caviar on the menu. A few minutes later there was a knock on the door. The maid welcomed me, handed me a small bottle and wished me a good sleep. Where else do they leave sleeping spray in the room?? How did I ever live without it? The next morning the concierge directed us to Olive and Gourmando for the most delicious pastry and Cafe Ole'....and dinner later at Bonaparte....everything in old city was an easy walk...and the Victoria Station Metro station is right under the hotel....how convenient is that? We wanted to see Montreal from the top of Mount Royal and walk down to the Beaux Art Museum to see the Yves St. Laurent exhibit ( to die for!!)...it was about a 20 minute walk...but Phillipe, the helpful concierge suggested we take a cab to the top...and insisted that we take a hotel business card so that if we could not make the climb down we could call and they would send a taxi for us. Now that is service! There are many reasonable places to eat in Montreal. We avoided the hotel restaurant although it looked lovely. Being in the coffee business I could not imagine what would make a cup of coffee worth $8.00 .....and a hamburger worth $30.00...I never saw many people there so perhaps I was not alone in thinking that it was over priced. The hotel might want to rethink their pricing. The last thing to note was the tremendous contrast we felt between the people of Montreal..and perhaps all of Canada...compared to Americans...we found EVERYONE to be extremely helpful. From the lady who owned a very small icecream shop operated from a window...who graceously let me use her small restroom when I desperately needed one....rather than making me go to a public one.....to the warm and friendly airport personel who post a passenger bill of rights at the enterance to the security check point...and hand out the small plastic bags that they want you to put your liquids in...and offer to help you in any way they can. Most of all I wanted to transport these kind people back to the state with me.....but aha!....in 57 minutes I can return for another fabulous and romantic holiday.

We chose the Hotel Le Saint James because we wanted some quiet luxery, and we wanted to be close to old Montreal. It met both needs perfectly! First, our room. We booked a deluxe room, which was the lowest category. It was surprisingly large and beautifully furnished. Because it was on a lower level, with buildings right outside the windows, it had these lovely plantation style blinds that offered just the right amount of privacy while also providing charming lighting. We really enjoyed our room and found ourselves returning early most evenings to snuggle up in the sumptuous bed and watch movies. Second, the spa. It's one of the more unique spas I've visited--it's in the hotel's basement, very dark and secluded, and it only accomodates a couple of guests at a time. I had a wonderful vichy shower treatment from an incredibly gentle and professional masseuse. Expensive, but luxurious. Third, the location. We really enjoyed being able to walk to so many places in old Montreal. There are many art galleries nearby, as well as churches and cafes. The doorman is always at the ready with a taxi if you need one, and there is a subway station within a few blocks, so it's easy to visit other parts of the city. Fourth, the service. Overall, we were very pleased with the service that we received at the Hotel Le Saint James. The doormen were gracious, as was the concierge. I'm taking off one star in this review for a little bit of pretentiousness, though. My husband and I are both vegetarians, so we asked for directions to an underground vegan restaurant that was in an admittedly unglamorous part of the city. The concierge's reaction? \"Are you sure you want to go there? I could book you into a much nicer place.\" Grrr . . . . we felt a little judged. All in all, it was a wonderful stay, especially for a weekend trip. And if you've never been to Montreal before, you really should go.

This hotel is quite beautiful and located in the old section of Montreal. Quite convenient to the airport - about a 20 minute ride with no traffic. Upon arriving at the hotel when you enter the hotel you get the feel of yesteryear as this was once a bank - very grand. I must admit that they do pay attention here to the little things regarding their guests. When I arrived from the airport via cab the doorman proceeded to remove my bag from the trunk of the cab - in doing so he made note from my luggage tag of my name and was quick to address me by my name - a little thing - but it definitely shows you something about this hotel. When I was brought to the reception desk for my check-in it was handled efficiently - though I had to wait a few minutes to make sure that my room was ready (which was odd to me as it was 5pm). My room which was a deluxe king was lovely - large and tastefully decorated. My only qualm was that I was given a room that was right near the elevator (I had made my reservation through Leading Hotels of the World where I am a member - my profile and reservation state to be placed away from elevators - reception needs to pay attention to this - though I will be honest as it did not become a problem because it was extremely quiet and I never heard any noise in relation to the elevator). In detailing my room which was large, there was a large king bed with delicious linens (very European), a desk, a small sitting area with two chairs and a large closet. The bathroom again very large with soaking tub and spa shower stall (with the rain shower fixture) with wonderful products for use. My room was extremely clean - and one very odd thing is that there were no do not disturb signs for ones door - but that did not matter because housekeeping never interrupted you while you were in your room (this usually happens in most hotels at around 7pm as they will come around for turn down service) - but when you went out in the morning as well as in the evening for dinner - you came back to a room that had been attended to. The hotels dining room \"XO\" is breathtaking (I believe some refer to this as the Grand Salon). Very stately for all meals as well as a formal afternoon tea or for drinks (there is also the Library for drinks as well). Please note - if you plan on having breakfast a the hotel do not bother with their continental breakfast (which consists of juice, coffee, and pastries) as their breakfast menu is superb! From presentation to taste - I never had such a fantastic breakfast. I did not dine in the restaurant for dinner but can only imagine how wonderful it must be and next time will try it. The concierge staff is tops. Prior to my arrival I had phoned with some dinner reservation requests which were taken care of perfectly - even a reservation in the top restaurant in Montreal Toques'. The location of the hotel is really quite convenient and just a ten minute walk to the historic area which is filled with shops, galleries and restaurants with a very Eurpoean feel. In summarizing, the hotel is lovely, very European, perfectly situtated and well worth the expense.", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel we've stayed at in years\u201d", "Author": "misssnootysnoots", "ReviewID": "UR5969726", "Content": "Amazing place.

Upon arriving at the gorgeous facade of this hotel we were immediately greeted by a warm and professional doorman who quickly retrieved the luggage out of the cab. The doorman complete with shiny brass buttoned coat and white gloves escorted us through the lobby to the front desk. An equally sophisticated front desk staff awaited us there. The check in was quick and we were on our way, but not before being presented with the most beautiful hotel key I have ever seen! A heavy brass key chain with a luxurous red tassel. The luggage was taken up to the room by yet another professional staff member. Upon entering the room we found soft music playing, the perfectly made bed with crisp Frette sheets and the beautiful overhead halogen lighting glowing made the room look absolutely divine. IOur room a junior suite had a bedrrom area with an adjacent sitting area with a desk and chair. The bathroom, a large marble one had a separate shower and deep tub with dual sinks. Everything in tis hotel is of the utmost quality! The towels are thick and gorgeous. The sheets are Frette and the quality of the decorations and furnishings was over-the-top. Upon returning to the lobby area where we found the hotel's restaurant, the XO. The XO is exquisite! A breathtaking dinning room with very high cielings and chandliers. A mezzanine level sits over the restaurant where one can either sit or have coffe, drink etc. The first day, we had breakfast and the service was exceptional as well. The breakfast was beautifully and artfully presented. The portions were small but adequate. It is slightly expensive but a real nice treat of refinement to start your day off right! In the evening, the library adjacent to the entrance is an absolutely divine place to have an after dinner drink as you let your eyes be dazzled by this beautiful room. The hotel houses a rare collection of books and many newspapers are available every day, along with current magazines. It is just a treat to sit down here in the evening or on a rainy day a great place to read a book and cocoon yourself away! The hotel is also very centrally located in the heart of the old section. Its a 5 minute walk or less from all the sights. Notre Dame a gorgeous Basilica is just a couple of blocks away. When in Montreal DO NOT miss the dramatic light show which is presented nighly at 6:30 and 8:00. It is beautiful, dramatic and educational. It will present the history of the church and of Montreal and it is a MUST do! While we were there we did not have a bad meal. I would highly recommend the Pierre du Calvert Restaurant, housed in a 300 year old mansion. Food, Service and decor was outstanding! Gibby's a steak house housed in the Youville Stables is excellent as well. Another hit was Bonaparte which is open for both lunch and dinner. By the way, the Concierge at the hotel named \"Phillipe\" is wonderful (I wanted to take him home with us!) Very knowledgeable, refined and service oriented. He seemed to know what we needed without asking and always gave great recomendations. Along with Phillippe the entire staff was outstanding and we cannot rave about this property more. It was a wonderful 3 days in heaven. I would go back tomorrow! Do yourselves a favor and stay at the St. James when visiting Montreal. A tip: The website lists rack rates which are quite high and Expedia never seems to have them available. I called the hotel directly and spoke to the genral manager which gave us a very reasonable (for this 5 star plus hotel) price of $350.00 (canadian) per night. They upgraded us to a junior suite which although not huge was spaciuos and very comfortable. A great stay at a great hotel!!

We booked through the Leading Hotels of the World site and received a \"Stay 4 nights Pay for 3\" deal. The hotel doesn't discount at all when you book directly. Even so, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we'd been upgraded to a Junior Suite from a King Room when we called to request an early check-in due to a flight change. They were very gracious and even treated us to coffee in the beautiful restaurant while our room was prepared. The room was extremely quiet (no view, but the hotel is downtown and surrounded by other buildings) and comfortable. The decor varies from room to room and we had a more modern decor, which suited us just fine. Our bed was super comfortable and the turndown each evening was wonderful, with bottled water, slippers, robes, chocolates and the next day's weather forecast set by the bedside. One of our favorite things was not having any interruptions when we were in our room from housekeeping, yet our room was always done to perfection when we returned from a day of sightseeing and the turndown was complete when we returned from dinner. The concierge and front desk staff were professional and very well informed. We went to use the small gym every day and only saw one other person working out during our 4 day stay.

The location is good too -- just down the block from the Cathedral and close to some good dining. (OK, dining costs a fortune in Montreal, and the meals take hours. However, on a minute-by-minute basis, I figure it's cheaper than McDonalds!) Strangely, the place was almost empty. We dined alone in the dining room, but the lamb and French wine were terrific. Go got a corner suite that was large and very comfortable, and I enjoyed playing with the peculiar electronic telephone that allows you to control every aspect of the room -- including the TV.

Decided we wanted to stay in Old Montreal. We were going up there for an \"event\" weekend, the CART race was on Sunday, many hotels were charging more than their usual rate. Le St Sulpice would have been my first choice, but at rates of $700, they were just too pricey. Le St James seemed to have even better reviews, so decided that was a good choice. I checked out online booking, and their site, which had no online reservations. I always like to check with the hotel for their rates, often they match or are lower than online. When I called and asked about rates, the person basically told me to book on Expedia, as I would get a much better rate. On Expedia their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rate was 299. But after reading the fine print, these rooms only had a queen bed.. Their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had a king for 359. So I booked the Deluxe. I have to include the fact my husband and I were getting away for a much needed R&R weekend, we own our own business, and have gone through a very very stressful few months in preparation of opening a second location. My husband enjoys going to CART races and this seemed like a good short get-a-way. I really wanted the hotel to be perfect. When we arrived at the hotel and the staff was very gracious. A manager showed us to our room, it was very nice, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem as large as was indicated on Expedia. When he left, I realized we only had a queen bed. Since I paid $60.00 more per night for the king, I requested we get a king room. I did have all my Expedia info printed out. Had to give it to them and they moved us to another room. This room was much larger, had a separate sitting area, the only downside was there was absolutely NO view. The room had four windows, 2 in the bedroom area, and two in the sitting area, both looking out at a brick wall. But we had our king bed, so was ok, but I was wondering if because we booked through Expedia we got a less desirable room? We walked around Old Montreal that night, had a great dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant, but were very tired and looking forward to relaxing in our room. My husband was a little disappointed they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have cable or any pay per view movies, but he got over it. It was getting a bit chilly in our room, the air was off, we set the temp to 75. It just kept getting colder. Over night it got cold in our room. My husband was MISERABLE. The room temp went down to 66.(Thermostat was still set to 75) I know this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t horrible, but when your paying 360 a night, I think you should get the temp you want! I told the desk person first thing in the morning, and they said they would make sure this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen again. I told them how completely stressed out we have been, & my husband was really uncomfortable. They said they would get a tech to fix it. We were out of the room all day Sunday at the race. After we got back checked the temp, it was still set at 75, the room temp was up to 71, but it was still nice out. I checked with the manager, they said they thought they had it fixed, if the temp didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise in an hour call back. Went to dinner, got back and the room was getting cold again. Called the desk, expressed my concerns again, and they promised me it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go below 72.. Since they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have cable they will put a DVD player in your room, and let you rent free DVDS.. We did that. By 10:30 the room was down to 69 again. Even though we were both uncomfortable, we were both so tired and just going to bundle up and hope for the best and go to bed, but the toilet seemed to be filling up... my husband flushed it(without using it) and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop! By now it was after 11 at night and we were exhausted. He turned off the water, and I called the desk. They said they would send someone up to clean it up! With the room temp still falling, at this point I insisted on being moved, again. I really think they would have left us there if we let them. SO we moved to our 3rd room in 2 days. This room was exactly the same as the 1st, but did have a king bed. It defiantly seemed more of the square footage size of the standard room. This room did stay at the temp we set it at, so we were comfortable. I have never booked a hotel room through Expedia, or any other online agent before, I am wondering if we got some of their least desirable rooms? And why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we get a king in the first place after paying extra for that? I saved about 30$ a night booking through Expedia, but this savings was not worth the frustration. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to trash the reviews of this hotel, because it did seem like a nice place to stay, I think we just might have had bad luck. I was just a little disappointed in the fact that after the 3rd move, and having to move after we went to bed for the 2nd night, I think they could have given us a nicer room.
