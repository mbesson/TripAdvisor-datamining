This was my worst experience ever with any hotel in over 40 years of travelling. I booked with Agoda.com this 4* hotel, 2 rooms, for a nice vacation with my wife and my two young children. I chose this hotel since we wanted to be at the town centre and after seeing the \"fantastic\" reviews this hotel has received. We arrived on the 6th of April at about 2PM after over 5 hours flight from Tel-Aviv and were given two adjacent rooms 221 and 222. We walked into the rooms and I immediately realized those are not even resemble the rooms we have looked at the web page. Just a small window facing the sewer pipes of the entire building (photo enclosed). No air-condition and no ventilation. I immediately refused to accept the rooms and told the reservation manager, Adrian, the rooms are not acceptable. Adrian agreed that those are bad rooms, but he apologized that they are, that night, fully booked and that we will need to stay in those rooms only one of the four night. Adrian even suggested not to open our luggage, just for the night necessity, and that the next morning he will give us more adequate rooms. We were tired after the long journey and quite hungry, so we had no choice and accepted his offer. That was my biggest mistake!! We spent that night in those rooms and that was terrible. We could hardly get some sleep. We had to keep the window open to get some air, therefore we could hear every toilet flush during the night from all the rooms above us. I am not a tall man only 182cm tall but I couldn't stretch in bed since it was such a short bed. Next morning, first thing, I went to the reception to ask for the other rooms. Adrian was not there and the girl that was at the reception named Martha told me that Adrian went for vacation and didn't tell them to replace our rooms, just to try \"if possible\" and of course they are now fully booked and that they will not replace our rooms at all!!. needless to say that I felt cheated and humiliated!! Martha was the perfect girl to give us the bad news! I never encountered an hotel receptionist more unpleasant!! (I'm being polite) She said she will call Adrian and find out what he have promised us!! by noon she told me she have tried calling Adrian 3 times and that he is not responding his phone. I never heard such a ridiculous lie. I have tried getting a hold of Agoda by mail (enclosed) and by the 24 hour \"service\". I was very disappointed with Agoda for recommending that hotel to us, which looks nice and is very nicely located and I am sure they have some nice rooms as well, however \"for some reason\" Agoda customers are being accommodated in third class rooms!! The next 3 days were a disaster!! the bath tab would not flush and you couldn't take a shower. The dirt would come out of the pipes including cockroaches (see pictures). They sent 3 times a bell boy who tried to pump the sink with no success. We ended up taking all 4 of us the shower in the other room. The third night was the worst. It got hot and the air was not moving. We practically suffocated in our rooms. the only solution for some air was to open both the tiny window and the main door to the corridor to get some air circulated!! The light in the corridor all night and the noise from the toilets flushing all night were the least of our problems. At least we could get some air to breath!! That's how we spent the last two nights. Next morning my wife, after not sleeping all night, went down, crying, trying to talk to the hotel manager. He was not there!! so they told her. He was not there 4 days when we tried getting a hold of him. Adrian was there and even offered to replace one of the two rooms for the last night of our stay and even offer his \"sympathy and understanding\". Our dream vacation in Barcelona turned into a nightmare!! It was completely destroyed! I could not enjoy any more the beauty of this city. I was waiting for this to end and to be on the plain back!!

Excellent central location with everything you could need within short walking distance. The hotel is only 20 mins from the airport and cost us only 22 Euros by taxi. The hotel itself is impressive from the outside and that does not end when you enter the reception area, which is modern clean and inviting.

We were staying on a bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast selection was great and had enough choices to keep even the most demanding guests happy. Even though the hotel is on one of the busiest streets in Barcelona, the rooms were very quiet. The only negative was the room. Although immaculately clean, it was very cramped and very tired looking. I have stayed in many city hotels and this one was definitely struggling to be that of a 3 star hotel and not a 4 star. We were also disappointed that the extra bed placed in the room was very small and for the amount of money paid, would have expected better. We arrived at the hotel early before check in and were offered early check in for 10 euros, which I thought was very reasonable and suited us immensely as we were able to drop our bags and head out straight away.

The bad point: Although we didn't hear street noises, the noises from within the hotel were loud. Evey time someone closed a room door, it would make a loud bang and wake us up with a start, the whole place reverberates. Can also hear phones and conversations in the next room. We had room 415 not far from the elevator on the back side (nice view of the pool). But perhaps a room in one of the wings in the corner of the hotel on the street side would have not have broadcast the noises so loudly...The walls were cheap pine with the nail holes clearly visible.

That was then followed by a really gruesome 'Creme Catalan' (nothing like it should be!) I could have forgiven them if they had not then charged us 50E for that appalling meal and refused to offer any refund. Shame because the breakfast buffet was amazing. The staff was friendly and helpful and the bar staff very competent and efficient.

We relied upon and received terrific and gracious help from the staff, especially from Oiana and Marta. Those two young women were really terrific. They helped us with dinner reservations, internet access, last minute transportation to the train station when our taxis did not arrive timely, and good advice on how to efficiently use the excellent subway system. We really appreciated their help. We visited this hotel with our young adult children and a couple of their friends, divided into three rooms. The deluxe rooms were fairly well appointed, although only typically sized for European standards, the bathrooms were spacious. There is a newer and older portion of this hotel. We were in the older side. It is served by a slow, single elevator. The top floor is probably ideal for quiet, but we often ended up walking up or down five flights of stairs because the elevator was nowhere to be seen. One reason we chose this hotel was the advertised availability of free internet. Among the six of us we had six devices to log into the internet. Unfortunately, on the top floor of the old section of the hotel (where we were all located), there was poor internet access. My computer could not hold a connection to the hotel internet while in our hotel room. We solved that problem by using our computers in the pleasant lobby of the hotel. Actually, several of us had difficulty logging onto the internet, but between Marta and Oiana, we all had access in a few minutes. Finally, we liked the location of the hotel, just beyond the Rambles. We were in close proximity to department stores and restaurants. In July, Barcelona is a busy place. This hotel is just barely out of the busiest areas of Barcelona. So, we could easily reach the mosh pit of Barcelona, or retreat out of it.

The only thing you can say against the hotel - is the thin walls - as many have already noted about this hotel. Often - it's not so bothered us. But one night, apparently the people in the room next to us were talking (probably flew a night flight) and our city. Total - I highly recommend the hotel and definitely come back again if I get to be back in Barcelona.

Our family group consisted of my wife, me and our 3 children in their early twenties and the boyfriend of one of the girls. We got 3 rooms in 3 different parts of the hotel. Our room (#703) was on the 7th. floor (next to a suite) and was clearly one of the best standard rooms they have. A spacious bedroom with big terrace and bathroom with beautiful red marble walls. A pity the bathtub showed ugly signs of corrosion... Another room was on the 6th. floor and had an unsightly view of the small inner space between the 4 sides of that part of the building. The 3rd. room was not fit for occupation and we demanded to get another room which we got, but that one was not very clean. As there was no other room available, 2 of our kids had to sleep one night in a less than acceptable room. Breakfast was indeed very good as has been mentioned here by many others. Service was in most instances adequate although not more than that. If understaffed, full house or other reasons were behind this is for us as hotel guest irrelevant. Because location is really a very important issue when visiting Barcelona, this hotel still scores high in our recommendation. Being the most expensive hotel on the list of 4 stars hotels we were offered, we expected a little more service and amenities. Charging an extra 5 EUR per day for using the safe in the room, even with free WiFi Internet, did not make things better. The swimming pool is much smaller than it appears on the picture and was, on top of that, not particular clean. Maybe management is too complacent with so many positive reviews?

Great location just off Las Ramblas but in a quiet street. Very handy for shopping, sightseeing etc.... Other recommendations - Cafe Reunion - amazing food at incredible prices...seem to be mostly locals. Also, take red bus tour as oppose to green bus - no queues unlike the other that most Hotels reccommend. Pretty much same tour/same sights. Went to beach 2 days - lovely but busy. Barcelona is a great place for a city break with a difference - stunnning architecture. Don't go if you're looking for a lie on beach/sun lounger, do nothing all day holiday.

Smallish by American standards, but with plenty of room truthfully. The bathrooms are large and the shower was excellent. We did not eat at the restaurant, but enjoyed the lounge very much. It is large, quiet and very inviting. We hosted a get together for 12 in the lounge, and the restaurant manager did a great job putting together appetizers for us. It was a great evening! The bonus about the Duques is the pool. I did not go to Barcelona to lounge by a courtyard pool, but it was a wonderful respite for our tired feet after a long day of exploring the city. This is not a suffy or fussy hotel where staff members bow to your every move. Personally, I find that type of property too formal and staff insincere. Here, staff are welcoming and professional. They give you what you need and are very nice. My one minor complaint would be some of the front desk staff, but even that seems a bit unfair. Their back office has the desk chairs and their computers facing away from the front desk, so they often do not see you. If all staff are working in the office, guests have to wait until they notice you, or give a little \"Hello\" to get noticed. This is a design and management flaw, but is quite minor overall. This small property has all you need and more, and is steps from the Plaza, Las Ramblas, the Gracia, buses and Metro. I highly recommend it! And be sure to have a mojito at the pool.

The hotel is located on a side street adjacent to Placa De Catalunya, right at the top of La Rambla and pretty much at the hub of everything. All tourist buses, main tourist information kiosks, and metros are to be found here, along with an infinite supply of cabs and the Airport Bus stop. You really couldn't get more central. The rooms were lovely, spotlessly clean, and plenty big enough. Our room (611) overlooked the pool area out the back, and was very quiet. Staff were very friendly, especially Miquel in the bar. He got our sense of humour, so we had a good bit of banter with him. Drinks were very reasonably priced. Can't really comment on the food, as we stayed \"room only\" and never ate in the hotel. An English couple we met had dinner in the restaurant, and they said it was beautiful. What I can say about the food is, the hotel were charging \u20ac15 per person for breakfast, which we thought was rather pricey. So every morning, we walked down to the corner of Placa De Catalunya to Caf\u00e9 Zurich for breakfast. Two ham & cheese paninis and two fresh orange juices for the princely sum of \u20ac13. It's a great location to \"people spot\"...right at the top of La Rambla with a metro station next door. You could sit for hours in the sunshine watching people going by!

The Rooms We had two room one double and one twin, The room were clean and the bathroom was well stocked with complermenty toiletries on arrivle. The bed were comfy but a little short for average size person as leg would hang off the end. The room had air com which worked efficently. The bathroom was clean and big bath towels supplyed and changed everyday. I did have a little difficulty using the shower the temperture taps were on the wall oppisite the bath a shower and its was hard to regulate the temp of the water the showers was either too hot or too cold. There was a mini bar in the room which we took full advantage of. We were on the 4th floor and had 2 year old with us and didnt find the windows very secure you only had to flick handle and the window open wide very dangerous for children. The Pool And Bar Area It was clean and all bar staff very friendly all ready for a chat. The pool area quite small but never too crowed always some where to sit.

The room was a little small but had the benefit of a good sized balcony with table and chair great for chilling out, sunbathing enjoying a drink. No tea or coffee making facilities so if you fancy a drink take your own bottle opener and snacks! You could use the mini-bar in your room but I guess it's probably pretty expensive. The room has a decent bathroom with all you'd want. The room was serviced every day and left immaculate. What makes this hotel recommended is: 1. The Location - it's just off the Cataluyna Plaza which is the heart of all the transport links. The metro line is superb - buy a ticket with 20 journey's it's much cheaper. You can also get the airport bus direct from the Plaza. Just off the plaza is the famous La Ramblas. The Plaza and La Ramblas are very busy popular areas but this hotel is just off in what is surprisingly a quiet street. 2. The Breakfast (food and the service) - buffet eat as much as you like with a very wide range always kept in good supply, always tidied and kept neat. In fact the staff are just so attentive, warm and provide an excellent service. Topping up your coffee is no hassle someone is floating around all the time looking after you. The food is good quality. The freshly baked cakes and donuts are highly recommended! 3. The Pool - on the first floor there is an open air (small) swimming pool -surrounded by gardens, trees, shrubs with a good supply of chairs and sun bed. Towels provided too. This is a lovely relaxing haven from busy city life. 4. The Architecture - the hotel was designed by Gaudi's teacher - the doorwar and staircase has all the hallmarks. 5. The staff - all pleasant and helpful - especially breakfast staff. The only downside was that the aircon didn't seem to be working - so a huge vertical fan was installed in my room which was fine - left on too long air con leaves me with a dry throat.

Having been to Barcelona before, I chose this hotel for price and because it was close to Las Ramblas without actually being in the thick of it, and it was well-placed for seeing other districts as well. The hotel, while almost on the Plaza Catalunya, is amazingly on a quiet street. It is a few meters from plaza, just at the top of Las Ramblas, where several metro lines and the train converge. You can walk from the hotel to most of the major areas with the exception of Montjuic. A nice bonus was the rooftop pool and very pleasant bar, which made for a calming apres-tourism oasis. I had a double room looking on an airshaft, but that was not a worry. It meant no street noise. I wasn't in the room so much. The bed was really comfy, just soft enough to rest me well after long days of wandering around. The sheets were really high-quality, and I appreciated that. The room had climate control. My only disappointment is that the room seemed rather plain and under-decorated for this class of hotel. There was a separate door between the bedroom and the entry foyer. That was useful, as the hotel has marble floors and sounds echoed. The bathroom, off the foyer, was spacious with a full size tub and nice big towels, changed every day. However, the ceiling vent fan was not working. One thing I did not like, as this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel, is that they charge by the day to rent a lock for the in-room safe. That should just be part of the deal. The staff at the front desk was helpful for my needs. They have only one internet station in the lobby and it is terribly expensive. There are internet places down in the Las Ramblas areas for 1/10th the price. There is so much great food in Barcelona, yet one night I was lazy and ate at the hotel restaurant. It was excellent with fine service, not overpriced, and I would recommend at least one meal there. Breakfast, though expensive, is quite good, too. For outside meals, tapas is found everywhere. I recommend El Taller de Tapas, an upscale place for outstanding quality and preparation and a great winelist. I liked it so much, I went 2 nights in a row.

The hotel is walking distance from Plaza Catalunya and there you can take the underground which takes you anywhere. Careful with the thiefs at las Ramblas and even at the Hotel Lobby. This place, which is as central as it can be contains the best and the worst of what you would expect at a Hotel. In fact no queries would have been found if we had not have breakfast the last day of our stay in which we had to suffer how baddly the staff could be trated by the Restaurant's manager. We were having breakfast and that person which was supposed to be in charge (Giseppe) shouted, and apparently tried to be laughing of his own staff. That was really embarasing for us because the service was being very friendly and kind. In fact the service provided by Giseppe was nasty and seemed to be a favour. A favour that was not for free, of course. Disgusting. Rude.

The Lobby was very pretty and the room was large and clean although very simple. We had a small sitting area with a couch. Only problem was that our room was situated right next to the stair tower on the top floor and since the stairs are open from the top floor to the bottom you could hear an awful lot of noise. Service was friendly, they originally gave us a room with two twins but we wanted a double bed and they were very accomodating, allowing us to check in early. Nice pool area in the courtyard.

The location is 5* 50 metres to the main Catalyuna Square and same to the La Ramblas area. The breakfast was excellent, good fresh selection a mixture of continental and britsh. Staff were friendly and at all times attentive. We went on the bus tours which were excellent 23 euros for two days hop on off. It is the best way to see everything in a few days. We also ate in a lovely restaurant, in Placa Real on the ramblas. The name translates into 15 nights. This was so popular, no other restaurant hada queue in the sqaure, in Jan.

To be honest it wasn't the first choice but other hotels were not prepared to take 15 (ageing) blokes - their loss. However, top marks to the Duques de Bergara. Location perfect, next to Place de Catalunya and metro station. Rooms were generally sapcious, clean, modern, with good washing facilities and toiletries provided. And (important for us) twin rooms meant twin rooms (not doubles !). Staff were friendly and polite, and (minor point) there was an endless supply of fruity sweets at reception. Breakfast outstanding - continental and English. Considering what we paid, real value for money. As for Barca, glorious sunshine, plenty to see, cheap beer and food at Cafe Zurich (1 minute away from the hotel). As the guide books tell you, don't stray off La Ramblas at night and if you want an alternative to the Nou Camp, try the Olympic Stadium (fantastic views of the city and beyond) and watch Espanyol.
