Claudio was helpful every step of our day excursions and even loaned us an adaptor for our US electronics. Although not central to the hustle and bustle, it is in a safe location convenient to public transport - although we always would 'just miss' the 360 bus connector which became the ongoing joke! The restaurant food was delicious and a great bargain, and the complimentary breakfast was well stocked. I can't say enough good things about our overall experience, which was a 4-night stay in the midst of a whirlwind London/Rome/Paris excursion. We had a triple room - three singles - and despite my fear that the European rooms are small by US standards, we had plenty of room for three women with lots of stuff! To respond to an earlier comment, there is grafitti EVERYWHERE in this city, so don't be put off by there being grafitti near the Del Muse.

Took the terravision bus from Ciampino airport to Rome (even bought the return ticket while queuing to board in Liverpool airport!) which was direct & easy. Got the bus (306?) from the Terminale to piazza delle muse (the last stop & takes approx 20 mins) - make sure you wait at the right stop as this bus goes in 2 directions - one to Zama & one to Muse! ( The sign at the stop has an arrow on it showing which direction it's going). Passed the hotel on the bus & a very short walk back to it in a quiet, leafy area. Great welcome at reception & were also given a sheet with lots of helpful hints about getting into Rome ( can get a bus back from piazza delle muse or from Piazza Hungaria - 10 min walk, straight to Colosseum or Trastevere; or about the same walk to the train for 2 stops into the centre of the city, only 1 metro stop away from the Spanish steps etc!) and they also gave us a really detailed map of the city, including the area around the hotel, which was much easier to use than either of the ones from our guide books! If you're going to hop on & off the metro, trains &/bus a few times a day, then it's definitely worth getting a day travelcard (from any tabacchi) for only 4 euros! Breakfast was great - loads of choice with all kinds of croissants, Danish pastries, biscotti, cereals, bacon & scrambled egg, boil your own eggs, toast, continental style stuff & yoghurts, fresh fruit......! One handy hint - if your room has metal shutters - look for a switch on the wall which raises them electronically (we were trying to lift them for a while before we realised!) Our room overlooked the garden where breakfast is served later in the season & it looked like this would be lovely! Wi-fi in the rooms & could also use the computers/printers in reception if you liked. Room was clean & a nice, roomy bathroom with shower & bidet. I would definitely recommend staying at the Muse - it was lovely to stay a little outside of the city (& would certainly pay a lot more for this kind of hotel in the centre) but transport links were good & could get around easily.

Plenty of choice, not so many hot options if you like your full cooked english but as far as continental brekkies go, this was fab! Lots of pastries n cakes if you have a sweet tooth like me!Cereal options, ham, cheeses, breads, yoghurts etc etc The room was spacious, not too hot and not too cold, had a small balcony and a lovely clean bathroom. The shower wasnt upto much but it did the job. The room was a bit dated but clean which is the main thing. We had the Waltons staying next to us and the kids were quite noisy at times and did wake us up one morning. Also the opposite side of us we had a loud Itallian man who used to have loud animated telephone conversations at 8am! Ok im on holiday to sight see and not lay in bed but surely people should hae some respect for their neighbours?! The hotel staff were polite and friendly and reception were useful with directions etc. The only negative point apart from the thin walls and hearing every noise from neighbouring rooms is that 1 day we went back a little earlier to rest before going back out. It was around 5pm and there were workmen working in he corridor by our room. They were banging for approxiamately 1 hour. We did not complain about this as it was a normal time of the day, we just found it a bit annoying! Also we were not informed of the 'City Tax' of 2 euros per person per night until we were checking out - so keep some money aside for checking out! The lifts are also a little small but an experience! All in all this hotel was excellent value and a great base for seeing Rome. I would definetly consider staying here again.

The hotel is more like a 4 star, however communal areas with a little improvement would raise this level, the rooms however are fine, beds comfortable, bathrooms modern and spotless, tv, internet, air conditioning and great views from the top floor (which is where I asked to go) I even had a terrace outside my room, which would have been lovely in the summer, but even in the winter was nice to take in the buzz of rome in the mornings. The staff are very friendly, and do everything they can to make your stay comfortable, from clean linen daily, clean rooms and bathrooms, making beds, to excellent buffet breakfast where you are asked if everything is ok, and no trouble if you want anything different (though the breakfast buffet has just about any possible taste you cn imagine available-from cakes, cereals, breads to cooked meats, eggs and cheeses.) The evening menu is very affordable and tasy, even if it is simple. Definitely adequate after a long journey. They hotel is run by italians that enjoy their job, and the front of house helped with bookings for sightseeing and all other phone enquires where I needed italian speaking support. The area is a quiet and safe residential area an easy ride into town on the bus just outside the hotel door. (same side of road as hotel) Will come back here for sure. This was a nice safe place as I travel alone with children, and Rome is a hectic city...watch your pockets, I didnt have any trouble in the city, but the crowds outside the attractions can be marauding. Top tip...book sights online before hand, Queues can be anything up to 3 hours for entrance to vatican museums, or colisseum. I took a chance at an off peak time at vatican, and that was still an hour queue...in the rain! Could be baking in the summer though as you are queueing with no shade against a high wall.

Our transfers from Fiumicino airport were very cheap. (A pre-booked ticket for the Terravision coach to Roma Termini costs \u20ac4, and the bus to Muse costs \u20ac1 \u2013 total \u20ac5 per person). However, our flight from London to Fiumicino was delayed, so we had to wait one hour for the next Terravision transfer bus from the Airport to Roma Termini. Then, we had a long wait for the bus to Muse. By the time we reached the hotel with our luggage, it was almost 8 pm and we were tired. For convenience, it might have been better to ask the hotel to arrange a car transfer from the airport costing \u20ac50. The situation could only improve \u2013 and fortunately it did. Check-in was prompt and welcoming and the receptionist advised us that dinner was available in the garden restaurant. The restaurant offers a set menu costing \u20ac18, which varies nightly and includes a pasta course, a meat or fish course and dessert. However, my wife must adhere to a gluten-free diet. The hotel offered gluten-free pasta, but we decided to order \u00e0 la carte. Everything was reasonably priced and the menu options included a massive cold buffet of salad and vegetable items. We were so impressed with our dinner that we decided to eat at the hotel on the next three evenings. Breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was more than adequate and comprised breads, cakes & pastries, cold meats and cheeses, yogurts and fruit juices. Hot options included boiled eggs (cook them yourself), scrambled eggs, bacon and canned cocktail sausages. The hotel is in an old building, which adds to its charm. The lift (elevator) is really tiny, with barely sufficient space for a passenger and one suitcase. However, our double room on the third floor was very comfortable and spotlessly clean, with a tiled floor, quiet air-conditioning, electrically controlled blinds, telephone, LCD television, and ample wardrobe space. The hotel offers free wi-fi internet, which worked perfectly in our room. The en suite facilities included a shower and bidet, but no bath. Although many of the hotel\u2019s guests come from the UK or USA, the television in our room (#362) had no English language channels. Ideally, the channel line-up should include Sky News, CNN and BBC World, all of which are available in Italy. The reception and restaurant staff, all of whom spoke English, were very helpful. The receptionist supplied maps and advised us about sightseeing options. He also warned us about pickpockets (even though we were aware of the problem, following our previous visits to Rome). Far too many Roman hotels and restaurants are sub-standard and overcharge tourists. That does not apply to Hotel delle Muse, which provides excellent value for money. My wife and I dined at the hotel on four evenings. Even though each our dinners included three courses, wine, a litre of sparkling water and coffees, the total bill for extras was only \u20ac160 (\u20ac20 per person per night including service). Red or white house wine, costing \u20ac4 for 500 ml or \u20ac6 per litre was very drinkable. The location of Hotel delle Muse is an advantage \u2013 but could be a disadvantage. The hotel is in a quiet residential area, and we were glad to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. However, extensive road works and a nearby construction site meant that the pathways were closed, so it was difficult to use wheeled suitcases. (That is a temporary problem). Buses on Route 360 tend to be delayed in heavy traffic at peak times, so you might have to wait a while at Termini railway station. Incidentally, buses from Termini to Muse stop on the main road, by the side of the station forecourt \u2013 NOT in the bus station. On your first visit to the hotel, it is best to remain on the bus until the end of the route. Then, walk back to the hotel. On subsequently journeys, it is easier to disembark one stop before Muse terminus \u2013 and walk a few yards up the hill to the hotel. Tips: It is very easy to travel in and around Rome. However, you cannot purchase tickets on buses or trams. You should purchase your tickets from a newsagent, tobacconist or vending machine before you board the bus or tram. Then, you must insert your ticket in the yellow validation machine on the bus or tram. Ticket options include: B.I.T \u20ac1. Standard one-way ticket - valid for one Metro ride or 75 minutes on all buses and trams within Rome. B.I.G. \u20ac4. Daily ticket, valid until midnight for unlimited Metro, bus, tram and train travel within Rome B.T.I. \u20ac11. Three-day tourist ticket, valid for everything listed above. C.I.S. \u20ac16. Weekly ticket You can also purchase regional versions of these tickets, for travel within and outside the city. For instance, a B.I.R.G. one-day regional ticket for Zones A & B is excellent value at \u20ac6 and will take you from Rome to towns such as Tivoli, Grottaferrata and Frascati. You can purchase regional tickets from the ATAC ticket office in the pedestrian subway at Termini station (use the subway entrance, close to the Route 360 bus stop).", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff\u201d", "Author": "LJinSC", "ReviewID": "UR120459498", "Content": "The price was reasonable.

But do have some cafe latte and a roll with cheese and meat. The free internet at the three computers in lobby are very convenient. The front desk staff was helpful and mostly friendly.

There we were greeted by a cold, non caring staff member. He didn't so much as smile and after reading all the wonderful reviews of amazingly friendly staff we were disappointed. The lift is hilariously tiny and it was good we didn't have large luggage with us. Our room was alright. It was clean and to average standards however I hated the shower. It's power is very weak and you can't remove it off the wall so your hair gets partially wet each time you shower. The restaurant staff are friendly, better than reception. But one night after dinner we waited nearly 30 mins for our bill. This was because the waiter was chatting to other customers and ignored 3 tables who were all waiting for their bills too. In the end we had to ask if we could charge the meal to our room cause we got so tired waiting for him to finish his conversation. The bus stop is very close to the hotel and buses are regular most of the time. However one day we did wait around 45mins. And when the bus did finally arrive the driver stood outside smoking for about 10mins while passengers waited in a hot sweaty environment. The little town the hotel was located in left much to be Desired. There were not enough restaurants, shops or cafes to warrant staying there. And nearly every wall is riddled with swastikas. This made it a very intimidating place to walk around when the sun set so we were forced to stay in the hotel every evening. At the moment there is some construction work being done.

The main hot food was scrambled eggs, you could also boil your own eggs; sausages and bacon, toast. Also cakes on offer,croissants and the usual crusty bread. There was juices, one was a Red Orange, more a cordial but nice, and I always had coffee with hot milk, there was various teas available, so a really good choice. We did eat in at the hotel and it was about 7 Euro's for a pasta type meal, one waiter Ali was really nice and always so friendly, oh with the meal you got a glass of wine included in the price which was a nice touch.

The hotel is situated to the north of the city but we enjoyed the (exit hotel & turn left) 15 minute stroll down to the bus/trolley stop (19 to Vatican or 3 to Colosseum) You can use these buses to connect to the metro system. There is also an underground station 15 minutes the other way (exit hotel & turn right) but its a bit of a mission to find & I'd only recommend it if the buses went on strike tbh.

It's a nice, quiet, more upscale area, the perfect place to relax after a day spent amid the bustle and crazed drivers of Rome. Cab fares were not too much, about 10-15 euro to the major sights. We had a very nice, clean quad room on the first floor, a large bed for my wife and I and two little beds, side by side, in an offset area for the kids. The beds weren't very soft- we didn't find any in Italy that were- but we used the extra blankets provided to pad it. My only other mild critique of the room would be that the shower temperature never got above warm (I love hot showers). But that said, we would certainly stay here again, it was great. The staff was very helpful and friendly, obviously genuinely concerned with our stay. My wife and sons are Celiac (gluten intolerant), and the hotel gave us a goody bag full of gluten free items for them to eat for breakfast on our arrival. My 6 year old was very excited! Italy is much more aware of gluten intolerance than the US. In fact, all Italians are checked for Celiac disease when they are born, and we ate delicious gluten free food our entire stay and never got contaminated.

It isn't the biggest room in the world but was fine with us considering we left every morning around 10 and only returned around 7 or 8 that night. Only one English tv channel, Fox News...but at least you'll have an idea of what's going on in the States. There is free wi-fi, just get the password at reception. Also, these guys are great because they let us check-in early on our return visit, and there wasn't any hassle--we actually left our luggage and then walked down to Saturno to get some awesome food (hotel restaurant wasn't open yet). Another huge thing is that Claudio ( I think that's his name) speaks Italian, English, German, and French and everyone else seems pretty multi-lingual as well--if you're worried about not being understood don't even worry it! On our return we were put in room 121 which was HUGE with a huge patio...definitely a room for in the spring when everything is blooming! It was really nice but the shower was smaller than in 250 but still big enough for me. The restaurant is fine for food if you aren't planning on going out that day but, there's better cuisine in Rome proper. We did eat quite a few meals there and all of it was decent, good quality food but when you're in Rome you should eat somewhere besides your hotel! There is an absolutely lovely little pizzeria/tratteria called Saturno straight down from the hotel...right next to the grocery store. The guys inside speak a little English and understand hand gestures and broken simple Italian...I think they found it amusing when we came in and ordered stuff. Absolutely wonderful chicken salad filled focaccia!! Turn left out of the hotel and continue walking straight down the street, it's the orange modern looking storefront on the right hand side corner after the Carabinieri with automatic sliding doors, grocery store is on the righthand side of it. Trust me, all of their food is amazing and pretty cheap. Location of hotel. While not in the thick of things, it isn't out in the middle of nowhere with no good transportation links. A taxi from the termini station will cost you 13 euro, which is reasonable and my recommended mode of getting there if you have any luggage whatsoever. Then, once at the hotel, you can buy a Roma pass off the front desk which includes 3 days of unlimited transit usage...so you can immediately hop on bus 360. The stop is a short walk uphill from the hotel--turn right out the front doors and walk to the top of the hill where they are doing construction, the bus stop will be on your right and is clearly signposted with times. I don't think you should have to fear about safety because you're a short distance from the Carabinieri, and I know there are a few of those officers that eat in the restaurant. Also, it is a more residential neighborhood with people out and about at most hours of the day so you're less likely to encounter trouble--unless you forget to look down and step in dog poo!

(To people planning to use the $25 Go-Today shuttle service from the airport: it took almost an hour to stand in line to check in and then wait for it, and then literally 2 hours of an uncomfortable jolting and jerking van ride, with a cold wind blowing on me from the continually-coughing-driver's open window, to reach the hotel. Consider using the train from the airport and a taxi or bus to the hotel instead.) I checked Delle Muse out with tripadvisor and liked what I read. I have to agree with those positive reviews. We liked it for these reasons: -We got there about 11 AM and were allowed to check into the room 3 hours early. -Quiet, safe, residential area, lots of trees, almost no traffic noise heard in the room. However, we could hear the people in the room next to ours using the bathroom and talking. Fortunately they were mostly quiet or gone. -Excellent staff. All the desk staff spoke English, and the restaurant wait staff understood it well enough not to be a problem. Especially outstanding were Gavriel (desk) and Paolo (waiter). Everyone was eager to please. When we needed phone calls made locally (e.g., to set up a reservation to tour the Borghese Gallery), they were willing to do it for us. -Our room was very clean, spacious, attractive, and comfortable. I know some people have complained about the beds being hard, but they were fine with us. We asked for twin beds. It was actually almost like a king size bed but with separate linens, and a space of a couple fo inches between. The room style is older, which we liked. Furniture was a teeny bit worn, but not ugly, and everything worked. The weather was chilly while we were there but the room was a very comfortable temperature. The room safe and room internet worked well. The TV had lots of interesting channels (though I hate to think of non-Americans seeing Fox News as representative of America!) and worked well. -Bathroom was large and equipped with everything (except shampoo), including a real shower stall with a door, unlike many European bathrooms that let the water go all over the place. -Linens and all supplies were plentiful, replaced as needed, and were spotless. -Our only problem with the room was there was no sort of chest of drawers, so clothes had to be stacked in the wardrobe shelves, and there was very poor light into it, unless it was daylight and the drapes were open. -The breakfast is marvelous and has even more items than I see listed in the reviews. We never needed to eat again until evening, it was so plentiful. -The dinner is another matter. As it was moderately priced and convenient, we ate three dinners there and the total was about 130 Euros. However, the quality was very uneven. We did better eating elsewhere. Our favorite was a place a block from the Pantheon called Rotunda Ristorante (or Cafe) where we got a really good and large three course meal in a nice atmosphere, for less than 10 Euros each. I recommend their fixed price meal of lasagna and roast beef. -The only other negative is transportation. The bus is nearby, and comes every 10 minutes M-F, less often on Sat. and 30 min. on Sunday (the person who said in their review it is supposed to come every 10 minutes on Sunday didn't read the weekend schedule on the other side of the pole). However, on this Sunday they simply skipped one arrival, so we waited an hour. It goes to the terminal, where you can catch some other buses and the metro, but it takes the bus 30 minutes to get there. A taxi to termini takes about 10 minutes and costs 13 euros. However, if you are going to get a quiet, moderately priced residential neighborhood hotel like this, the trade-off is that it is less close to things in the city's center. All in all, if we go to Rome again and stay at a hotel, we will certainly stay here. Otherwise, we will do as we've done before and rent an apt. more conveniently located.

We were pleased with the hotel in general; the rooms were fine, the staff at the reception was kind and the breakfast was very good considering the hotel category and price. As it was mentioned by some reviewers, the hotel also has a nice garden with a restaurant. We decided to have our last dinner in this restaurant, just one night before our departure. Well, I must say that I would advise anyone to stay away from it, no matter how attractive the prices might be. After we took a table, it took some 10 minutes for the waiter to bring us a menu, although there were only 4 more tables occupied at that time. Although I had initially thought this was just a poor service, I now realise this might have been some kind of warning, like if it was a subtle way to give us a chance to leave and look for a better place\u2026 Anyway, the waiter made up for it by bringing a complimentary glass of champagne which was nice. We noticed that the menu had a warning stating that everything is freshly made and therefore, customers should be patient as the food might take time to be prepared. Although I am not keen on waiting long, I must say that I got confident when I read that the food is freshly made; that actually sounded promising! Our order was not the most difficult to prepare; we choose the \u201cbruschetta with tomato, olive and basil\u201d, \u201cspaghetti aglio and olio\u201d and \u201crisotto al funghi\u201d. The last option was taken after the waiter assured it is prepared with porcini mushrooms. We have also taken the house wine to go with it. The first thing that came was the wine, which was better than expected for the price (4\u20ac for half-liter).. everything seemed good till here! The bruschetta came right after it\u2026 and the first thing we noticed was that the \u201colive and basil\u201d that were mentioned in the menu were missing and we were left with a piece of toast with chopped tomatoes which was rather bland. This was however not so bad compared with the spaghetti aglio olio. I have no idea on what their recipe is but it consisted of some watery pasta with tasteless pieces of garlic and frozen leaves of some herb that I ask myself if it was Parley (it was as tasteless as the garlic and therefore difficult to identify). If it is to serve something like that they should just give the customers a package of \u201cCup Noodles\u201d, I am afraid it would have tasted better. It goes without saying that the \u201cRisotto\u201d was not much greater. It was obviously made with champignons instead of porcini not to mention that the rice was definitely not risotto rice! Oh, did I mention that the menu said it should be \u201ccreamy\u201d? Well, it wasn\u2019t at all! Just some plain boiled rice mixed with pieces of champignon.. great risotto! We did not have the guts nor will to try and pay any desert after those dishes. It was obviously our worst meal experience in Italy and quite sad that our trip had to end like that!

Before we left the USA, Giorgio communicated through emails and a phone call to arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel for each group in the family arriving on different days from different parts of the USA. He gave us five rooms on the same floor of this charming hotel located in a quiet, cooler, residential area, very accessible to Rome's center. As well, Giorgio arranged for a bus and driver (who quickly became part of the family) for our overnight trip to Montescaglioso. The gracious (English speaking) staff was always kind, attentive, informative. The hotel provides a safe in each room for valuables. We were advised on different methods of travel to various sites in Rome. The surrounding neighborhood has a variety of shops, including home made gelati, and a health food store! Breakfasts at Hotel delle Muse are delicious: fruits, cheese, meats, eggs, pastry, cereals, yogurts, juices, fresh milk, cappucinos, lattes, an array of teas. With the help of the hotel staff, we planned a special dinner (cooked to perfection by the hotel chef) for our Roman relatives and served in the hotel's elegant garden. The rooms are spacious, clean, quiet, air conditioned, (and, if preferred, windows that open into the fresh night air). Giorgio also directed us to some of the neighborhood's restaurants where he takes his own family. Each one of us, from the 4 year old to the more experienced ages of our parents, 88 and 91, felt at home, relaxed, attended to by the kind staff at Hotel delle Muse. My parents enjoyed sitting outside, reading the newspaper, and watching the neighborhood go by when they weren't visiting the gardens and museum at nearby Villa Borghese, or accompanying the 4 year old to the zoo or Vatican City.

We were so happy to have made this hotel our choice. From FCO we took the train to the Termini and then took the 360 Muse bus. The bus ride was only about 20 minutes and quite comfortable and quiet. The hotel is between two stops, Salvini and Muse within only 2 easy walking blocks. On arrival the reception staff was very welcoming and spoke excellent English. We were told our room was not ready yet but we could wait in the lounge and have coffee or other drink while we wait. Being travel weary, this was appreciated. Our wait was only about 10 minutes, enough time to have our drinks, when the key was brought to us. Our room was on the 2nd floor and even though they have an elevator, we took the stairs which were easy. On opening the door, we both were wowed by the large size room and how well decorated and clean it was. The bathroom was a very good size with a heated towel rack,hair dryer and window. The best surprise was to have a private large terrace out the large french doors. The terrace was above the outdoor restaurant garden which was not in use since it was March so it was a very quiet place to sit and relax. The doors/windows also have the additional shutters that darken the room completely when closed. The room was so comfortable, quiet and dark that we actually overslept one morning, which we never do and were shocked at the time. I also enjoying walking in the morning and found this to be a quiet and safe residential area. All the staff at the hotel are friendly,courteous and helpful. We were always greeted coming in and leaving and were given good directions on the best transport ways to the sights. The hotel has a wonderful and large breakfast buffet with everything you could want. He was always making sure all was set out plentifully and would accommodate special requests from guests. We were able to have such a large breakfast that we could tour all day and only have a snack and dinner. This is a big cost savings. Most all travel was done by bus to the main Termini and then the metro or buses to the places we wanted to go. The metro is efficient but covers a small area but the buses are everywhere and very easy to navigate. We were surprised that we were always feeling safe and comfortable on the buses and it gave us time to review our map and tour plans and see some beautiful parts of the city while on route. On leaving the staff discussed the transportation options for getting to the airport and we decided to have them arrange a transport shuttle for us since we had an early morning flight. The cost was 47Euros for a pleasant 40 minute ride in a Mercedes with a very handsome and congenial driver. We left Rome feeling treated to a luxurious holiday week.

We booked through www.go-today.com (a great booking service by the way) with their taste of Italy tour (also very highly recommended). We read the good reviews but were even more pleasantly surprised when we got there. Like some have said, take the 360 MUSE bus from the Termini station which is (with your back to the station) all the way on your left side a little past the 360 ZAMA bus stop. Once there after check in we took the elevator up with our bags. Just so you know, all elevators in Rome are really small (can fit 3 people tight and maybe a small bag or 2). ROOMS: When we got to the room the room had a strong smell of smoke which makes us nauseous. We told the front desk and they said people aren't supposed to smoke in the room but it happens. They said don't worry about it, they will fix the smell before we get back at night. When we came back at night you would never have known the room smelled like smoke, which we were all very relieved. The key also serves as the power for the electricity (see the pictures in the previous post), and we stuck a folded cardboard in it a couple of times which also works if you need the key. The room we had was a triple and the other people in our party had doubles. The rooms were big enough for the beds but don't expect too much extra room. There's a security box in everyone's room where you can set your own code and put things like your passport and extra money so you don't have to worry about losing it. The beds were singles and enough room for one person. We didn't think the beds were hard, but then again we like firmer mattresses in general. The first 2 nights we were a little cold because they set their ventilation system to either heating or air conditioning and they had not set it to heating yet so all we had was air conditioning. We all thought the bathrooms were big enough and the shower was enough room. They give soap and shower gel and shower caps and bar soap. There is also a hair dryer which looks like a vacuum cleaner hose on the wall that works well. The outlets are a type of electrical converter, but when i tried to plug my straightener in (a USA plug) the left side wouldn't fit, cause that side is a little bigger, so i suggest you bring a power converter for your electronics just in case. INTERNET: The lobby has computers that allow you to go online for free but their wireless internet doesn't work at all. BREAKFAST: Their breakfast was a very pleasant surprise. They had scrambled eggs, raw eggs you can make soft or hard boiled, bacon, ham, cheeses, other meats, yogurt, fruit (kiwi, apples), bread, rolls, cookies, juices, nutella and a coffee machine that makes cappuccino, and two other things. If you want fresh cappuccino or espresso just ask one of the ladies working there, they don't understand english well but are sweet and have no problem making it for you. So the breakfast is not to be missed and is a bit surprising since the italians consider breakfast to be a cappuccino and a pastry. STAFF: The staff is nice, they speak english well and are very helpful. They told use everything we needed to know for how to get around and public transportation. They give you a good map and there's a bunch of free little fat books in the lobby that has maps and interesting things about each of the site which is a good idea to have. TRANSPORTATION: The last stop of the 360MUSE bus stops a little past the hotel. So to walk to the stop, make a right outside the hotel and walk a little uphill. The arriving bus will say 360MUSE but to go to the termini you want the 360ZAMA and since its the last stop the the 360MUSE changes to the 360ZAMA at that stop. Its about a 20min ride to the station where you can get other buses or hop on their subway (they only have 2 lines, either line A or B). It was great that the bus stop by the hotel is the first stop on the way to the train station b/c the last day we had our luggage and had no problem fitting it on the bus. There is also a trolly that can take you to st. peters/piazza popolo (where you can walk to spanish steps or trevi fountain) quicker than the bus. Its about a 5-10min walk from the hotel (opposite direction from the bus, make a left outside the hotel) and it uses the same transit ticket as the buses. You can buy these bus tickets at the newspaper stand you pass on the way to the 360 bus by the hotel or at any tabacchi booth. We paid for the 5 day unlimited pass which i think was around 16 euros (cash). Make sure you put the card in the machine everytime you board a bus/train/trolly b/c the transit police will get on the bus or stand in the train stations and check to make sure you've punched.

Out of the 2 other hotels we stayed at in Italy (Mediterraneo in Florence and Corte Contarina in Venice) this was probably the best one of the three. While this was a great boutique hotel, I still gave it an average rating only because the bed was actually the worst of the 3 hotels and the shower was really quite small. I read other reviews, but still wasn't prepared. BUT, if you don't think it can get any smaller, it DOES! Our shower at the hotel in Venice was even smaller. And another reason why I gave it an average rating (even though this was my favorite of the 3 we stayed at in Orlando) - I've traveled enough and been to enough \"average\" hotels in the U.S...and this just didn't compare. So I think the scale that we use to measure is different here in America. So an average rating in Europe is actually VERY GOOD!!! LIKES: This hotel was a little 'out of the way' from the center of Rome. But, I actually liked it. You got to see the outskirts of the city. Major *PLUSES* about this hotel: (1) great staff - extremely helpful when asking for advice on how to get to the different sites in Rome. (2) three computers in the lobby for your use - for free! [The hotel in Florence charged 5 Euro for a half hour! - which we did not pay.] (3) GREAT restaurant in the hotel. It is located outdoors, but is so quaint and romantic. I never got a picture of it, but it was just lovely. Good to Know: The key that is given to you is also the key to the electricity in your room. The guy at check-in failed to mention that you take your key ring (which is just a plastic plate with your room # on it) is supposed to be slipped in this little slot just as you enter your room. This will give you lights, run the air conditioning, and turn on the TV. Dislikes: (1) the bed (in 486 at least) was extremtely hard and uncomfortable. However, after walking around Rome, my husband and I were SO exhausted it really didn't matter. (2) small shower - but, I've read from other reviews that it's not UN-common in Europe. And again, after long and exhausting sightseeing days - the fact that HAVING a shower, we were very happy about. HOW TO GET THERE: From the FCO airport, take the express train to the Roma Termini station. Once you arrive at the station, walk out the station and you will see a bus station ahead of you. Find the ticket office and buy a ticket. You'll want to take the 360 bus towards Delle Muse. Just as the hotel's website says, it's the last stop. Where do you find the 360 bus you ask, amongst ALL the other buses...as you came out of the station, it will be on your left, almost alongside the road. There are 2 360 buses now - one going one way on the route and the other one going towards Delle Muse. So look for the #360 bus sign that has the arrow pointing down towards MUSE and not ZAMA.

This time, we took our 14-year-old nephew Joshua and his father, Roger. Our plan was to share the beauty, excitement and history that is Rome with Joshua. The Hotel Delle Muse is a family owned and operated business, headed by Giorgio Lazar. It is located on a quiet residential street that reminds me of New York's upper east side, but without the traffic. The standard rooms are small, as in most true European hotels, but we booked two larger rooms. Our room also featured a large whirlpool bath -- a big hit with my wife. Breakfast is served from 7:00 to 10:00 AM daily. The scrambled eggs and bacon were good, but the cheeses, meats and pastries were exceptional. This wonderful breakfast is included in the price of the room. The restaurant also serves lunch and dinner. It was good -- after many long hours of travel -- to check in and then meet in the restaurant for a fine Italian dinner. The food is very good and priced well. We also made use of room service, which is prompt and courteous. We also tried two restaurants recommended by Giorgio. We had two meals at Osteria Della Frezza -- both were excellent. Our last night in Rome, we all had the seven-course sampler menu at Antico Arco Ristorante. What a marvelous meal! Both places were thoughtful recommendations, traditional Roman restaurants, not tourist-oriented. We also had lunch at Caffe Parnaso, two blocks up the hill from the hotel. Good food and a great view! If you attend an event at Parco della Musica, I would recommend an after-theater dinner at Ristorante Red, just a few steps from the concert halls. Both the service and the food are excellent. Back to the hotel: I have to add that the staff at the front desk were very helpful. The desk is staffed 24 hours, and English is spoken as well as many other languages. There also are Internet stations available in the lobby. The hotel arranged for a car to and from the airport, which I would recommend. The dollar being so weak against the Euro these days, our trip was more expensive than we had planned.

I don't remember any paintings on the walls. Ceilings are high. The bathroom was very moderm with bidets and we had a spa bathtub which I enjoyed as well as a shower. This was actually a triple room as there was an extra single bed. The housekeeping was excellent. The room was spotless and the housekeeper seemed to anticipate our needs. We took the extra pillow from the extra bed and the next day when our room was made up, we each had two pillows and the extra blanket we used was added to the made up bed. It seemed to me that sheets were changed daily as they were always very crisp. Towels were nice enough, with face towels and bath towels. The room floor was tiled and the halls are carpeted which could use replacement. It got quite cold and the heat is not usually turned on until November 1. After a day of cold, we did get heat. Breakfast, included in the price of the room, offered a huge variety of food. There were all kinds of rolls, cheeses, fruit-dried, stewed, baked, fresh, canned, eggs, bacon, other meat, juices, all kinds of coffee and more. It is served in a very nice room and the staff is very nice. The 360 bus stopped a block away and went to the main station Termini. This worked out well except for the Saturday when there was a big demonstation at the Termini. It took about 20 minutes to get downtown depending on traffic. The location of the hotel is a plus and a minus. It is in a neighborhood just north of the Borghese Gardens, which is a walkable distance, taking a bit over a half hour. The Pariole neighborhood is very quiet and away from the touristy areas That is the plus. There are a few but not many restaurants that we could find in the area. However, the location is also a minus in that it is not close to all of the sights. We found that once we came back to the hotel, which was often in the late afternoon or early evening, we did not want to go out again.

We paid in the low 90's euro for a mini double, taking advantage of a 5% cash discount and a 5% internet discount to get it that low. In trying to find a hotel for the time less than a week after Easter through mayday, about a month before our trip we pretty well hit a wall. Virtually everything was booked or quite expensive. The place we had stayed at and liked in the fall a couple years earlier (Hotel Parlamento) was, due to season, both more expensive and unavailable. We poured over trip advisor, the web, and virtually every guidebook published on Rome in the USA. We considered strange plans like camping or staying in the hotel where one had to give up one's room during the day for train workers. We considered neighborhoods we really didn't want to stay in, said goodbye to the humble dream of an in room bathroom, and then, at our darkest hour, we found Delle Muse. It seemed too good to be true. We emailed. They emailed back! They had a room. We confirmed by phone (having to call back when one of the English speakers was there). We had our small double with bathroom en suite for fewer than 100 euros. Huzzah! Literally we walked around for a couple days wondering if we really did have the room until we forced ourselves to knock it off. Good thing too, because everything they told us at Hotel Delle Muse was entirely reliable. Reading ahead of time enough positive things about Hotel Delle Muse left us with only one serious concern about it: location. I\u2019ll try thus to go into a bit of detail about that. Where is this Parioli District where lies the Hotel Delle Muse? Well, look in your guidebook map of Rome. Hmm, it probably cuts off somewhere in the middle of the villa Borghese (that big park). Some books don't cut off until we're just a teensy bit north of there. How nice! We\u2019ve sort of just barely made it to Parioli. We really need to go a bit north and east now to get to our beloved hotel. So what does this mean? Just how far out are we? It all depends on you. Don\u2019t much like being on your feet? I can't recommend Rome for you at all. Want to see the best art in the world and drink the best coffee and eat the greatest pizza, but not a great walker? well, get over it as much as you can, employ what public transportation you can (I like the tram best- a mile walk, take it towards the Vatican and get off just before it turns to head over the river. this puts you out just beyond Piazza del Popolo, the north edge of the central city, the heart of Rome, most of the best stuff. There's also a bus quite near the hotel that goes to Termini and beyond, and there's a moderate walk (a mile or less?) to a train station (Aqua Acetosa?) that seems to not come all that often and goes to, oh, forgive me, I think that train station just north of Popolo). But enough of this. Here are my estimates (very rough) and suggestions for you walkers of cities like myself and my dear wife. You want to get to the park- the Villa Borghese- as your way to the city. I am guessing two miles to that. It is a pleasant, interesting walk through an urban neighborhood of tall apartment sort of buildings. No sights here, but interesting and Rome. At the park begins paradise. Dragon statues, Romans leisuring, pond with rowboats, possible greatest museum on face of planet (Borghese Museum-reservations mandatory) and so on. Our trips between the Hotel and the City Center started out very long and rather confusing and then just got better and better. This is what helped; finally getting a decent map, namely the free one at the hotel, finding the fabulous short cuts (sorry, can\u2019t explain much here, but subway tunnels at mid park can take you right on out to the Spanish steps, or stay up high and take the sort of large pedestrian bridge out to the stunning views over Popolo and the Spanish Steps (and to nice ways down to them)), plus of course, we got stronger! I think maybe 3 miles from Delle Muse to the Spanish Steps or Popolo if you get the best possible route, at once long and not so long. So, about location, on the negative side, well, it is connected, but also set apart. Going home or leaving was always a trip. We were by nature of location less night people as we did not want to come home too late. The park closes apparently (though we never got caught out) and while ways around it are entirely feasible they are longer. We never felt unsafe quite, but it can be pretty desolate walking home at 11 or midnight. Transit definitely shuts or slows down on the earlier side and overall we did not so much manage to use it much for getting home. On the plus side Parioli is nice. The center of Rome is very very intense. It is our favorite city in the world, but I could not imagine going in the summer and in the spring the crowds were, well, sometimes too much. It was nice to go to our genteel neighborhood that was not so intense, to get away from the noise and people. Having a reason for walking through that park most days was lovely. A few blocks from the hotel was a little pizza by the pound kind of stand on Eleanora Duse. It is called Pippos and it turns out I have a white hot passion for it, finding it as good in its own way as Da Baffetto in the central city. Actually we did as well with restaurants there in Parioli as anywhere. I enjoyed both Celestina and La Maremma (?) which are nearly across the street from each other on V.D. Parioli and are sit down pizza and other thing places. So, about the Hotel, I liked its size, big enough to be anonymous and not so personal, but small enough that one could know the staff and, well, this is contradictory, but, be personal. We never ate in its restaurant, though it has one (same place you eat breakfast). I can only say it did not look particularly bad or good. It is a mildly pretty hotel. The staff was very professional and nice, my wife especially liked them and we brought the evening gentleman who was friendly about our rudimentary attempts to say the number of our room, a little plant. We made much use of a little safe deposit box behind the desk. There are internet computers for guest use in the lobby. This is handy for making yet another reservation to go to the Borghese Museum. Our room was small ala Europe budget, but well laid out as it was not retrofitted like the other places we have stayed. The high ceilings helped the feel of the room. The room was clean enough- we\u2019re both pretty easily grossed out- it wasn\u2019t perfect at all, but it was clean and comfortable with a good bed (I suddenly cant remember but think it was a king!). The windows are great, you\u2019ll see, and I don\u2019t mean the view, though it is a nice backyard kind of view. Very small shower, bidet, toilet, good sink, table with chair in room, closet. There appeared to be air conditioning in the room-don\u2019t know if it was extra- we never used it nor would have. Included breakfast is the sort of mixed bag that is diverse enough that you should be able to put together something to suit you if you\u2019re a bit adaptable. You have to ask the waitresses/maids to get you a cappuccino (or due cappuccini) and they will and it will be good. Pretty good croissants and nice tomatoes! Where did they get those tomatoes? Though there weren\u2019t really enough of them. The staff and hotel as a business was polite and fair and reliable. Guests when we were there were mainly European, lots of Italians, but that seemed true everywhere in Rome. Most staff did not speak English, but some did. Based on the rest of the city it was an extremely good bargain, though I cannot speak for the larger rooms. In conclusion, I would say, if you\u2019re not rich or horrified at the location or physically impaired, stay here.

We only had a problem getting a bus back once in the late evening when we had to wait about 20 minutes, but other than that the buses were running every 10 minutes or less. One last point on location - about a 15 - 20 minute walk from the hotel is Piazza Ungheria where there are a few restaurants - one of which we used three of the four days. Can't recall the name but it is around the corner about 4 doors down from the Restaurant Hungaria towards the zoo and is the only one open late at night. Food was very good and inexpensive by Roman standards, although service was spotty. Closer to the Restaurant Hungaria is a take-out pizza spot with a few stools, which sold its pizza by weight, very good and cheap, but it closes early. The hotel is clean and quiet. We had what the hotel described as one of its smaller rooms (which were Eur$20 less per night) and they were certainly sufficient. Not the sort of room where you would want to spend the entire day. The bed was large and comfortable. The front desk staff provided all information requested, and were a pleasure to deal with. We arrived mid-morning and they were apologetic that the room was not ready for us. They gave us a guidebook which had maps and a list of all the bus lines, so we could plan our excursions in advance. One very nice feature was three computers in the lobby available for guest use for internet and email at no charge. The breakfast buffet was plentiful, with many different varieties of buns, croissants and sweet breads, cold cuts, cheeses, yoghurt and cold hard boiled eggs.", "Date": "May 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cJust loved this hotel .\u201d", "Author": "thefahertyfamily", "ReviewID": "UR3168180", "Content": "This was a wonderful place to stay on our first visit to Rome in 2002.

On our first visit to Rome, we decided to take a chance on the Hotel Delle Muse, Via Tommaso Salvini 18, 00197 Roma-(Parioli)-Italy. Although I felt like a part of the family before I even arrived, I felt like a stanger walking in. Our room was extremely hot and small but they warned us of this beforehand. Additional fans were provided upon request. But, and this is a big but, Nino (I believe is the owners son), the maid (also breakfast server), and Palo, especially Palo, the waiter are outstanding. The rooms are simple but clean. Amenities are minimal yet adequate. For the price, I highly recommend. We paid $180 Euros per night for two rooms; which included a very nice breakfast. By paying in cash and internet booking, we received a 5% booking for each. For the cost, transportation from the hotel to all sites are economical and easy once you figure out the route numbers. In spite of the heat, I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "August 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasanton, CA", "Title": "\u201cToo Far Away\u201d", "Author": "mmplus", "ReviewID": "UR1843332", "Content": "We recently returned from a 5 night stay at the Hotel Delle Muse. The staff is friendly and the room is clean, but rather unattractive. The main problem is the location of the hotel. It is 30 minutes by bus, but the buses are totally unreliable. We waited over 60 minutes on two occasions for the bus to come, and 30 minutes commonly. The neighborhood has very limited eating places. Highly recommend a more centrally located hotel where you can decrease travel time by walking to the sights and where there are more dining options.", "Date": "April 27, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel delle Muse", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d205063-Reviews-Hotel_delle_Muse-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$75 - $207*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Tommaso Salvini 18</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00197</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "205063", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8c/9b/8b/the-building.jpg"}}
