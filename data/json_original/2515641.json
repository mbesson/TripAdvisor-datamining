There is a spa next door in the Hilton Garden Inn. Landscaping was beautiful around the property, and I even found someone mopping the sidewalk one morning as I was leaving. It did seem very clean in all areas of the property, and was in a location that felt extremely safe. Despite other reviews, I had no problem with connecting to wireless at this location. All in all, a good stay for the week of business I had. Easy to get to from the interstate, and there was a Vons nearby for groceries, etc. Nothing really around if you're on foot ... you'll need a car.

The crew at breakfast did a great job of keeping things cleaned and stocked though a little more variety for fresh fruit might have been nice. There were grapefruit and apples everyday. A couple days there were oranges and bananas. There were also make-your-own waffles, scrambled eggs, another hot selection that varied (sausage, potatoes, biscuits/gravy), oatmeal, yogurt, cereal, muffins, bread/bagels. The noise level in the hotel was mixed. It was far enough from the highway that we didn't hear road noise, but we faced the courtyard with the pool so heard the revelers in the hot tub until they closed it down at 10 PM. The hallway doors were nice and tight, but the walls still pass quite a bit of sound - babies crying, people on the phone. One morning they started doing some very loud work in the hallway outside our room at 10 AM, one way to make sure we got out and about after a late night I guess.

We wanted to be close enough to home to keep an eye on the progress of the repairs and also be comfortable, and to me, that means being able to cook our meals. I am a local internet marketing consultant so I am all about checking reviews online before I make a decision about where to buy, eat, stay, etc. This particular had great reviews so we booked 2 suites. From the very first time we walked in, stressed, upset, and my mother almost in tears, we felt like we were home. All of the staff are so kind and generous, going out of their way to make sure guests have everything they could possibly need. There were a few who stuck out though, and in the best way possible. Stephanie made my mother feel sol much better, just by being attentive, chatting with her, getting to know her. She always asked how things were going at the house and made my mother really feel hat she cared about her welfare. The chaos of the demolition in her house was extremely stressful for her and being able to come back to Homewood Suites after being amidst the debris and the construction was like a balm to her. She was able to head upstairs after chatting with Stephanie or one of the other front desk staff and unwind for awhile before I brought dinner to her. I am a night owl and got to know the staff who worked the afternoon and night shifts a bit better. Monica was, during the time we stayed, worked in the evenings and many times I would wander down and chat. because most of my work is dependent on having a good internet connection, when there were occasional issues, she bent over backward to find a solution, whether it was calling any one of the wonderful maintenance staff to trouble shoot, or running next door to find a cable I needed. These folks are so efficient, thoughtful and frankly, creative in the way they take care of their guests. I have traveled a great deal in my time on the planet, as has my mother and we have both stayed in so many hotels, neither of us could even begin to count them. Out of all of them, we both agree this is the absolute best experience we have ever had . From the physical space, the rooms, the actual kitchen...really...with a stove,a dishwasher and a real refrigerator where I could actually cook, and did, every day, to the housekeepers, the maintenance guys, all of the front desk staff, especially Stephanie during the day, Monica in the evening (though she works during the day now) and Dan,my favorite night desk man, these people take pride of place and service to heart. All of them, every last one of them, made what was a very unpleasant experience for my mother and me and turned it into a rather fun little adventure...one where we actually made friends and felt truly cared for. They wear many, many hats, wear them extremely well and are at home in all of them. We are grateful we found them...and I have decided that the next time I need a vacation from my mother, I am running to my other home in Del Mar.

The staff is so great, you'd think they were all part owners (and i have never wanted to take the time to get on this site and write a review before). Last year i got sick, the front desk offered to bring me meals as well as a free VCR with a library of movies. This year, a boiler had gone out, so I had no hot water when I woke up. i went to the front desk who were very sincere and offered me a shower in their spa; which i planned on using during lunch. Only by lunch time, the boiler was back up to full speed. The manager asked if I needed anything else. I did need a haircut, so she booked me one. When i went in for the cut, they said i would get 50% off. Well the hair cut, shampoo and style was probably the best ever (when I got home, my wife said, \"finally! a great haircut'). After the cut, I paid the 50% i owed and left the rest for a tip; about $20. When i returned to my room later that night, there was an envelope with a note from the manager saying, \"Sir, sorry for the misunderstanding. Your service for today was compt. Please see attached\". When I turned the letter over, there was my $20!!! This hotel truly cares more about their guest than making an extra buck.

Most of the people that normally stay here are businesspeople I believe who have work in the nearby Del Mar/La Jolla/Carmel Valley area, but there are a large amount of families too I think given the value proposition. Service first of all is pretty great. I would think that the people here are all from the MIdwest in terms of the attitude [friendly] but they are also very motivated to help [eager]. That's a great thing. Negatives here are that they don't have bellboy service, so if you want someone to help with your luggage then this is not for you. They didn't have dual double beds so we ended up with a King for our stay of the family of 4 [kids are 6 and almost 4], and that was a little struggle. Sleep quality would be higher if we had double beds I think. They have free wired internet, but who does wired in the iPad/iPhone era? WiFi would be really nice in the rooms. The pool is also small, so when it's crowded it's not as fun and there aren't many chairs. The pool towels are also basically the golf towels with the blue or green line down the center and with a rough feel, so if your tushy needs to be babied instead of just dried, then don't expect Frette quality or anything near that there. Other than that, the sheets are fine [it's San Diego, so no need for down comforters], and the shower is decent. I'd love to have a double sink basin, but no need of course. The kitchen is great, and the topper are the complementary breakfast buffets [with waffles for the kids, though there's almost always a line] and happy hours [meals during the week] with beer and wine. My waist didn't thank me, but my stomach did.... The kids also got balloons and different little rubber duckies at breakfast one day which was a great touch, as well as opening up their Del Mar Ballroom when there was an overflow at breakfast. They played some kid movies on the TV in there, which made for a long but entertaining breakfast for the kids. Overall, it's a great stay, and usually great value. As it was, it was darn good.

Kitchen supplies are abundant all the way down to the mini-cutting board. Our room overlooked the courtyard in which a small pool and hot tub were situated among tropical plants. We also checked out their evening reception as the schedule was posted on the fridge. Their daily offerings vary from enchiladas, teriyaki chicken, and of course the BBQ Thursday nights. While outside dining options throughout San Diego are delicious, the evening reception is convenient and satisfying as it is accompanied by a full and fresh salad bar. The wine offerings left much to be desired. It would be nice to see some offerings from local vineyards (i.e. Temecula). Breakfast showcased the strength of Homewood Suites with real eggs (not that powdery, dry stuff), sausage, bacon, potatoes, fresh fruit (not day-old), and waffles. CONS: It was tough to find one, however, travelers should note that wireless internet access is available only on the first floor rooms. Only hardwired, ethernet connections are available on the other floors. This may be problematic for some - not all. There is a spa at the nearby Hilton Garden Inn which we did not take advantage of, however, while comparing prices to the spa just down the road, the prices at the hotel spa were relatively high for treatments. Homewood Suites Del Mar left no stone unturned and delivers a viable option to all types of travelers from business to recreational - the best value and location to enjoy all that San Diego has to offer.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "Ottawa1546", "ReviewID": "UR113525999", "Content": "My family spent 4 nights at the Homewood Duites over March Break.

We had a king bed suite which had a kitchenette area with a refrig, 2 burner cooktop, dishwasher & microwave. The sitting room had a desk, sofa you could stretch out on & an easy chair. The only complaint I had here is that the desk chair doesn't go up very high in relation to the desk height. Free internet access was a biggie for me plus they had a business center should you need to print out anything. The suite had 2 flat screen TV's. The bathroom set up was a bit different - the toilet & shower were behind a door but the sink was open to the bedroom - I get why they did that but it can be a bit of a pain if one is asleep & the other is up & about. But that is so minor compared to all we found that was right with this place. You do have to drive to get anyplace, it felt as if the hoeld was in a tech area but we had a car & access to I5 & 805 was a breeze. La Jolla was right around the corner as was Del Mar. Parking was ample easy. They had a small fitness center with a recumbant bike, 2 treadmills, an elliptical and set of weights. Hot tub was clean & enjoyed after a long day at the parks.

Family of four including two teenagers. We booked a king bed suite adjacent to the pool using the hilton web site for 200$ plus tax a night. The suite was quite nice (ground floor) with bay window that opened on a small table + chairs area with view on the pool. The masters room was quite nice, great king bed, comfy bed, great pillows, i had great nights of sleep no problem. Very little noise from the outside. Rooms are well insulated. The living area was nice as well, altough the sofa bed was a bit rudimentary. The two teenagers slept on it but complained a bit on the comfort of the sofa bed so i would not recommend it for adults. The pool is nice, there is a jacuzzi as well (small) but quite handy after a full day of sightseeing in order to relax. The staff was very helpful and friendly, the self-parking around the hotel, very easy to go by. There are no restaurants at the hotel but you can walk across to the hilton garden inn and you have a quite decent restaurant - we tried it one evening - with decent food and prices. There is as well a snack bar at the hilton garden inn where they have great sandwiches, we always loaded up with food to go at the snack bar before we hit the road towards the beaches, parks, etc... You must have a car to visit around. There is a von's grocery store less than five minutes drive, so you can get all you need as well for snacks or if you want to use the kitchenette area in the suite to cook your own meals. The breakfast buffet was quite OK and it's included with your room fee. If you are back at the hotel between 17h and 19h from monday-thursday evening, you even have the managers reception free of charge. On Thursday evening they had a nice BBQ and salad bar outside by the pool area... free of charge... so we loaded up before hitting the road to go to the padres baseball game downtown. It is a very nice hotel and i would say very convenient for a family. The only drawback is that the hotel is a bit remote from the main san diego areas, it's location is however easy access from highway 5. Our favorite beach from our trip : La Jolla Shores (beautiful beach!). Our favorite nature hike : torrey pines state reserve (10 minutes drive from the hotel) a must see i would say. Our favorite attraction : san diego zoo and balboa park. It's a great area.

It IS an extremely well-run, comfortable, pleasant, clean and enjoyable place to stay, especially with a family (we were two adults and two kids, 5 and 7). Our trip combined theme parks and a conference downtown. The hotel was well situated for all of our activities -- a manageable drive to all of our destinations, and also close enough to the beach areas of Del Mar and La Jolla to make those readily accessible. Breakfasts were good; evening snacks/meals were fine for a traveling family looking for something decent and easy, but not a restaurant experience. Of course, it wasn't intended to be, and it was just right for what we needed on two evenings -- something convenient, easy, and kid-friendly after a long day with children who couldn't make it through a restaurant meal. The deli next door is good and convenient for sandwiches to go. Parking is easy and plentiful. The pool is small, but still a nice respite and more than sufficient for the kids. If I were traveling exclusively on business, and for a couple of days, I'd likely stay elsewhere. But if I were returning to San Diego to do theme parks, beach, and some downtown activities (zoo, Padres, USS Midway), this is the first place I'd try to reserve.

We did have ONE DISAPPOINTMENT during our stay however. One afternoon, we returned to our room about 4:00 p.m. and I noticed the bathroom door was shut. When I went in, there was a very strong smell of cigarette smoke!. (We do not smoke and always ask for a non smoking room). This was fresh smoke and I know for a fact that someone was just in there smoking prior to our return! I called the front desk right away to let them know and to ask for fresh clean towels. Someone brought the towels and some air freshner, which I guess was all that could be done for us at that point. It's rather disappointing and infuriating to know that an employee goes in to a guest room/bathroom to smoke. For all we know, this could have happened on other days of our stay and the smoke disappated before we got back, or it could have happened in someone else's room too. I don't know what management did to look in to this matter when I reported it, but hopefully they found out who it was and let that employee go. Despite that, I do recommend this hotel for all the positives we did experience. One suggstion I have for the hotel to consider is installing a towel bar or hooks on the door to hang towels.

The rooms are nicely decorated, but I'd wish they'd lose the silk plants. They are just dust collectors no matter how clean a room is. Couldn't they just get a simple real potted plant that does not require a lot of water? The flat screen TV was nice, and the bed had a poor quality mattress.

Other nights we had fajitas with rice and beans, and stir fry with rice. Breakfast is nice hot buffet with eggs, potatoes/sausage, oatmeal, waffles, cold cereals, muffins, bagels, toast, juice and coffee. The coffee is always available in the lobby. We also used the laundry, and spent only $3 to wash and dry a full load of wet, sandy clothes. The room was great, especially when travelling with kids. We had a one bedroom suite (2 queens) and a sofa sleeper. Plenty of room for us to move around without feeling crowded. The full kitchen was very handy when the kids didn't want stir fry. I ran to the grocery store on the first night (about 1.5 miles away, easy to find) and picked up some mac and cheese, hot dogs and milk. The kitchen has only a stove top, no oven, but that was fine for us. Again, the evening meal really is a meal, not a snack. We figured we saved about $200 on meals by staying here. The room was well worth the price. The staff was very warm and friendly.

We stayed for a week (11-18 June 2009) in a one bedroom suite with 2 queen beds and LOVED it! Location: For a week\u2019s trip to the San Diego area, we LOVED Del Mar. We thought it was quite, nice, and scenic. After seeing all the sites and driving by other locations such as Hotel Circle and Gaslamp, we were so glad that we were in Del Mar instead. It could be nearly 30 minutes to some of the attracts at the wrong time of day, but it was so worth it. Room: The room is actually 3 rooms. The first is a kitchen, living room, and dining all in one. The kitchen is nearly a full kitchen including dishes, a dish washer, garbage disposal, stove, microwave, and fridge. The only thing not included is dish soap. In the living area is an average size TV. This room includes a desk. I believe high speed Internet access was available, but we didn\u2019t bring a computer with us. The cable on the TV includes many good kid friendly channels with movies and video games for rent. The bedroom was a good size. The two queen beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for a crib, which they provided. The sink/mirror area in actually in the bedroom. I was able to use it without waking my children. Another TV is in the bedroom. The bathroom contains a shower/bath and toilet. They were good about providing cleans towels. The cleaning service did a great job. Once they came while I was dealing with a fussy baby. She said she would come back and left right away. The best part was that they always found time to come back when we weren\u2019t there and did a thorough job cleaning. Breakfast: They have a hot breakfast buffet everyday that includes items such as eggs, potatoes, bacon or sausage. They had cold items like yogurt, cereal, and fruit (oranges, bananas, and apples). They have the do-it-yourself waffle makers. The only truly bad thing at breakfast was the coffee. It was HORRID. I tried flavored creamers, sugars, etc, but it could NOT be saved. It consistently tasted too strong and brunt. The first day my favorite breakfast item was the seasoned potatoes with peppers and onions. They were perfect and delicious! However, in following days they were tamed down and less seasoned. I\u2019m sure they were more kid friendly, but disappointing to me when on the first day they were so flavorful. Amenities: We used the pool once. The girl at the desk thought it was heat to 82 degrees. It felt a bit cooler than that to me. It was early evening though and probably not the best time to swim. I like that they have plenty of lounge chairs and spare towels in the pool area. The business center is just 2 computers with Internet connection. I only got on there briefly to check e-mail. It did the job, but was running slow. The laundry room is two washers and two dryers that are coin operated. I paid a total of $4 to do 2 loads. It was nice to not go home with a week\u2019s worth of dirty laundry. They only powdered Tide in their micro store, so bring something else if you want it. We didn\u2019t get to use the manager\u2019s reception as we were out running around too much. Price: I thought the price was pretty decent especially considering the fact that they didn\u2019t have parking fees or resort fees. We paid something like $175 a night plus tax.

I have to say that everything positive I read about the hotel is true and then some. We had 2 rooms next door to each other for a family of 5 - 2 of which were teenagers. I didn't even think to ask for adjoining rooms when we checked in but this worked just fine. We got there early and were able to check in right away. Each room had it's own bedroom, living room and small kitchen. The kitchen had everything you would need - a full size refrigerator, sink, dishwasher, all pots, pans, dishes, soap, utensils - everything!!! There was a stove top but no oven - no big deal. The living room had a sofa sleeper that worked perfectly for the youngest. In my personal opinion, all the furniture in the living room made it a little \"tight\" for space but we just moved the cocktail table out of the way and we were good. We arrived on the Thursday before Easter and had booked 3 nights at the hotel. We were starving once we unpacked and decided to go next door to the deli in the Hilton. My daughter had panini that was to die for, we had chix ceasar salads and my sons had sandwiches. It was an awesome meal - not too light but just enough to get us by until dinner that night. We went out to the pool for a little while - it was a little chilly but our littlest one was very happy being in a warm pool - even though it was 65 degrees. Pool was not real big but it was nice and clean. They also had a jacuzzi that was well taken care of. Lounge chairs around the pool and they had tables & chairs outside of the pool area to sit and have drinks or watch the kids without getting wet. Apparently, they have free dinner Sunday or Monday thru Thursday nights - COOL! So, we had grilled chix breasts, hot dogs, hamburgers, corn on the cobb, fresh cut fruit, chips, drinks etc. It was really nice after getting in from flying and not having to worry about dinner. Beds were very comfortable, pillows great and the cleaning ladies were there every day. No problems at all with anything. It is a little \"secluded\" and not out amongst everything but a quick drive to the expressway and very easy to find. It was a great start to our spring break vacation!

I even felt comfortable enough to not wear shoes while lounging around in the living room. While the room was in the right configuration and clean, the room is not the highlight of this hotel. The staff was absolutely EXCELLENT. So often, the hotel has the goods (the rooms) but the staff is not helpful or courteous or is in some way lacking. This was not the case here. First off, we checked in kind of late (almost midnight) and the night host was chipper and cheerful. He insisted that I park right outside the front door so it would be easier to carry bags up to the room. He let us know the various amenities available in the lobby and what we could expect at breakfast. He talked it up so much, that despite my fatigue from being up so late, I got up early and went to the free breakfast buffet. It was excellent! We had decided to go to the beach, but didn't know where to go or what to do. Another helpful staffer came by to clear some of our breakfast dishes and when we asked him what to do, he gave us many suggestions and his own personal preference for the beaches. He then came back with a map of the area already highlighted and marked with directions to beaches, shopping, and local eateries he thought we might enjoy. He was right on the money with all of it. Thanks to the staff of this hotel, my family and our friends enjoyed some of the most relaxing adventures we have ever encountered and would heartily recommend this hotel (and their OUTSTANDING STAFF) to anyone and everyone.

Our family stays here any time my husband's work brings him to San Diego, and we absolutely love it. For starters, the staff is absolutely terrific. Everyone, from the front desk staff to the restaurant staff to the maintenance team, is friendly, helpful and courteous. It is so pleasant to stay at a hotel where you know that you'll be treated wtih respect, and welcomed with a smile, regardless of what your question or concern is. The amenities are fabulous as well. The rooms are true \"suites,\" with fully stocked kitchens and living areas separate from the bedroom area. You can actually cook full meals in the kitchen, although you won't have to Monday thru Thursday nights. On those nights, the hotel offers what they call a \"light meal.\" The last time we were there, their idea of a \"light meal\" was lasagna one night, chicken breasts in mushroom sauce with mashed potatoes the next night, and then their signature BBQ on the patio (complete with burgers, hot dogs and chicken breasts) on Thursday night. Light? I think not! With the meal they offer complimentary beer, wine and kid-friendly drinks like lemonade, so everything (and everyone) is covered. They also have a full breakfast served every day of the week. This is not a continental breakfast (although you can get cereal or bagels if you'd like). They usually have two egg dishes and either bacon, ham or sausage, with potatoes of some sort (on the days they don't have biscuits and gravy!). If you consider the price of feeding a family of 4 both breakfast and dinner, and take that off the price of the room, you'll rapidly figure out that this hotel is a real deal. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The pool, although on the small side, is always stocked with towels and is more than adequate for the size of the hotel. There is a Hilton Garden Inn next door that is affiliated with the Homewood, and they have an absolutely fantastic restaurant, for those nights the Homewood is not serving their \"light meal.\" The location of the hotel is ideal. Even though it appears to be off the beaten path a bit (it's in more of a residential area, which actually makes it very quiet since it's away from the highway), it's actually very close to the beach, Torrey Pines, Legoland, and it's only a 20 minute drive to downtown and Sea World.

The flatscreen TVs (2) are *very* nice. The room itself was clean and the full kitchen well stocked and everything clean.

The dinner on the patio was what really sold me on this hotel. We stayed a Thursday night and dinner for my family of five included BBQ chicken breasts, beans, hamburgers and hotdogs, potato salad, fresh green salads, potato chips, lemonade, wine, beer, iced tea - all we wanted - plus all the condiments - completely free. I figure with free breakfast and free dinner for my family of five who are all hearty eaters I saved $100. My only complaint - we had left in a hurry and I needed a toothbrush. I was told I could *buy* one at the shop in the hotel. I was disappointed to hear this as even budget hotels give out complimentary toothbrushes.

From the time we arrived to the time we left, we had a nearly perfect stay. Check-in was easy, and since it was dinner time, they gave me a sheet that listed all of the nearby restaurants, including driving directions and a note referencing those that were 'family friendly'. While we ate in restaurants Saturday and Sunday night, Monday through Thursday they provide quite a good dinner, with a rotating menu (such as pizza, chicken Caesar salad, chili with baked potatoes), and complementary wine and locally-brewed Firehouse beer. Breakfast, while not made to order, was quite good, with scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, meat of the day (bacon, sausage or ham), make-your-own waffles, cereal and pastries. Our suite was well-maintained, with the typical Homewood amenities including two-burner stovetop, microwave, full-size refrigerator, small dining table, two TVs, tall showerhead. The bedroom also had a ceiling fan, which I appreciated. Unlike a previous reviewer, I had no problem with noise, either from the street or from the neighboring rooms. A squeaking door was quickly dealt with by maintenance. The business center had two free computers with Internet access. The outside pool water was cold, but the hot tub was refreshingly warm. As for the local restaurants, we tried the Italian restaurant next to the nearby Von's (skip it--overpriced, mediocre food). We also tried the locally-based regional chain Rubio's, which is a fast casual Mexican restaurant known for their fish tacos. All of the food we had there was good--and reasonably priced. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, particularly to families and to business travelers looking for an 'extended stay' facility.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "Bortch", "ReviewID": "UR10023822", "Content": "We just stayed at this hotel for seven days and have nothing but praise to give.

Everything about this hotel was fantastic, except for the very thin wall, which I believe may be the thinnest among all the hotels I've ever stayed at. The following is the detailed story. First, the previous reviews mentioned it could be difficult to find this hotel for the 1st time. This was true for me. The point is that from Hwy 5, you have to take \"Local Bypass\", which merges with the ramp to Hwy56, before reaching the Carmel Mountain Road exit. We checked in around 2pm. Our suite is at the corner on 4th (top) floor. Across the hallway is the stairway entrance, making it feel like a small section of private hallway. When we first entered the suite, it was really \"wow\" - the living room and bedroom are both quite spacious, with new d\u00e9cor. I think this hotel is about 2 years old or so. The small kitchen includes 2-coil range, microwave, full kitchen, dishwasher (no detergent available, though), a small dining table, chairs, etc. It really feels like home. The bathroom is small, with the sink (vanity area) separated. There is a door between the living room and rest of the suite, while there is no door between the vanity area and bedroom. The bedroom is right next to the bedroom of our neighbor (a fatal design, but I think it's unlikely to have the bedroom really at corner, due to bathroom pipe connection). The central A/C system is quiet and nice, and the fan does stop blowing when the set temperature is reached (I encountered a non-stop fan blowing on a bed somewhere else before). The living room has a sofa, desk, TV, while the bedroom also has a TV. There is an ok mountain view. If we opened the window, we could hear the highway/traffic noise, but as long as the window is closed, it's ok. The construction is on the other side of the building, so I didn\u2019t hear anything of it, even in the day time. The hotel is in the middle of some business park and townhouses. It looked safe around here. While it's close to Hwy 5 exit, there is virtually no shop/restaurant around. About 1 mile away, with easy local driving, there is a plaza with the supermarket (Vol's), Subway, a Chinese food pick-up(ok), and an Italian restaurant (didn't try). It's quite convenient to visit Sea World, Zoo, Balboa Park, La Jolla, etc, from here. We never encountered any traffic jam on Hwy 5, as the gridlock is at the Hwy 5 section north of Hwy56 (all day long, around Del Mar). When we came back to the hotel in late afternoon/evening, we did notice big traffic jam on Hwy 5 south, from La Jolla to Sea World, but we never needed to drive south in that time frame. We tried the hotel's free light dinner (Mon-Thur only) on the 1st night. It happened to be the type of the food I don't like at all, such that we didn't dare to try the free dinner for the rest of our stay. They do provide the menu, with different variety for each night, so do check that before you plan for dinner. The free breakfast buffet is pretty good, with the waffle machine, in addition to hot scrambled egg, ham/sausage. Now coming back to the thin wall. In our 1st night of stay, before I went to bed ~ 10:30pm, I heard some argument from a man and a woman in the adjacent room. It didn't sound like yelling, and it appeared the wall between our bedroom and our neighbor\u2019s is pretty thin. When I finally went to bed, the woman started to weep. What a night! To make things worse, our beds are right next to that thin wall, with the headboards right on it, so my head was very close to that thin wall. The episode went on until midnight or so. The 2nd night was better. I could still hear some brief talking. It sounded the unhappy couple had checked out. I could hear when my neighbors took shower, which didn't really bother me. Then the 3rd night, around 2am, we were waken up by the 5-10 minute hacking cough of our neighbor. Worse came worse - at 6am, we were awaken by the music alarm of our room. We never set the alarm and didn't hear the alarm in the previous mornings. Anyway, since we couldn't 100% exclude our 5-year old son as the culprit (he denied it, and we doubted he would know how to set it up), we didn't complain this to the hotel. Anyway, it's a good idea to always double check the alarm is not set, even on the 3rd night of stay. Before I went to bed on the 4th night, I already developed some anxiety for sleeping here \u2013 I didn\u2019t know what would happen, and my sleep was in the control of my neighbors. Unfortunately, my neighbors came back after 10pm, and kept talking. They didn\u2019t shout or yell, but the wall is so thin that unless you intentionally lower down the voice, your neighbor will hear you. At around 12am, I got fed up and decided to try the sofa bed in the living room. The sofa bed was not comfortable at all, with a thin mattress and no sheet, plus the refrigerator noise. When I went back to the queen size bed at 1am, finally my neighbors had stopped talking. When I complained this to the hotel staff, they acknowledged the wall is thin. This is a structure problem, and there was nothing they could do. In summary, I think everything about this hotel is wonderful, except for the very thin wall. However, with paying more than $250 per night, one deserves a better sleep, which is the most important thing. I think the wall of this hotel is probably the thinnest among all the hotels I\u2019ve ever stayed in. I don\u2019t recall being bothered by the voice in the next room, other than the TV sound. My advice for the light sleepers is: if you can\u2019t tolerate people talking nearby while you sleep, DO NOT stay in this hotel, unless you want to bet on that your neighbors won\u2019t like to stay up late and talk.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cTHE place for a family\u201d", "Author": "LVMV", "ReviewID": "UR8500320", "Content": "This hotel was GREAT for our family of 5!!!

I booked the room on the Hilton website for $215.10 excluding taxes. On my bill the suite was described as a \"Larger Suite 1 King Non smoking.\" The Homewood Suites was our jump-off point for visits to San Diego area attractions. This is not a destination hotel but rather an option for those who need more room at a moderate price. It is very convenient to the towns and beaches of Del Mar and La Jolla. Since it is at least 20 mintues north of downtown San Diego it is also convenient to the San Diego Wildlife Park. We spent our last night at the Hilton San Diego Airport/Harbor Island and took in many of the downtown area sites at that time. Back to Homewood Suites. This hotel is perfect for families. It is also perfect for those who want to concentrate their visit on La Jolla and Del Mar. The hotel serves a hot breakfast every morning and dinner Monday through Thursday. With five mouths to feed, I found this feature very attractive. Dinner even included cold beer...which I found equally attractive. We enjoyed all of the meals. The staff is excellent and helpful. Speaking of the staff, the front desk gave us free tickets to the nearby San Diego County Fair so as to take in the fair and fireworks. Our room overlooked the front entrance. But you won't be staying here for the view. As other posters have noted, you are in area of quiet office building and very nice apartments/condos. The worst thing about the hotel is learning to navigate your way to the hotel. Getting to the hotel will challenge your compass and pioneering skills. \"Carmel Mountain\" is a critical road in this process. Yet at one point, the road actually takes a 90 degree turn and becomes Carmel Mountain again. Meanwhile, the roadway you were traveling that was once called Carmel Mountain continues going straight....but assumes a new name. It took awhile but I finally figured it out. This hotel suffered damage during a June 7th fire at an adjoining hotel that was under construction. As a consequence, half of the rooms were being cleaned-up and refurbished. My guess is that all rooms will be back on line by the end of the summer. This did not affect our visit in any way. The pool is perfect for kids. The nearby hot tub was hot and felt great after a long day at the beach or site-seeing. The suite was great...no complaints. In sum, this is a well-managed property and was perfect for my family.

We found this hotel to be modern and very clean. The staff was very nice, especially the manager. There was a great complimentary breakfast every morning, free newspaper, free parking, free coffee/tea and some fruit available all day long. The hotel is located very conveniently close to I-5, but it is up the hill from the freeway and there is no noise. There was a fire on a construction site beside the hotel a couple of weeks before our stay. It occurred on appoximately June 12, 2007. The hotel next door that was under construction, and soon to be open, completely burned down. This caused some external damage to one of the wings of the Homewood Suites hotel, and some water damage in the suites of that wing. As a result, the hotel closed that wing for renovations. Otherwise, the hotel is fully operational, including the center courtyard, pool, and hot pool. Other than seeing the external damage to the one wing of the hotel as we drove up, nothing bothered us. The hotel was easy to find when travelling from the SAN airport. I suggest following the directions as outlined on the Homewood Suites website: Heading I-5 North - Take local bypass for state highway 56. This is 100 yards past the Sorrento Valley Road exit. Exit Carmel Mountain Road and turn right. Drive one third mile to Vista Sorrento Parkway. Turn right on Vista Sorrento Parkway, drive one half mile to the Pacific Plaza traffic light. Make a U-turn at the traffic light and the hotel will be on your right. These directions are much more accurate than the ones from mapquest. The hotel was a great base for tourists exploring San Diego. An approximately 20 minute drive to San Diego ZOO and Balboa Park, 15 minute drive to Seaworld, 25 minute drive to Coronado, 10 minutes to Del Mar Beach or La Jolla area. Although there are no restaurants next to the hotel, there are restaurants and a Vonns grocery store within a 5 minute drive. Front desk has a very good information sheet with directions.
