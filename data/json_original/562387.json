Anyway, this review is for park view hotel located in bugis. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. Excellent, close to mrt station, very reachable with mrt from the airport. It's also close to bugis junction. The room is... just barely enough to be called as hotel room. It's more like boarding house. There are strands of hair in the sink and the bathtub. It depends though, if you're just like me who doesn't care about these things, you might find the room adequate. The service is... terrible. The hotel staff is cold. You have to pay up front, which means if you want to check out early you might face some problem with the payment. The worst thing is when you put your laundry. it will take 24 hours to complete your laundry, or you have to pay extra 50% for one day service. And the hotel asked you to pay after each laundry order completed AND you have to pick your laundry to the receptionist. This happened to me, and I bluntly refused to pay and go down to take my laundry. I asked them to deliver the laundry into my room, and the receptionist delivered the laundry yo my room. I've never been in a hotel that asking its guests to pick up their own laundry.the staffs nt.

The Good: - The Location is great as it is 5 - 10 minutes walking distance from Bugis Junction MRT station. - Surrounded by good and cheap eats. Steamboat restaurants abound at SGD18 per head and you can get a plate of chicken rice or noodles for just SGD3 or so. - The aircond works well - The shower water pressure is strong and steady. There are shower curtains, too. - Although we were facing the street (6th floor), we did not hear very loud street noises when we sleep at night. - I booked through Hotels Online and requested for Twin Beds and got what I asked for. I also liked it that they included the taxes and such into the price so that I do not have to pay for any surprise charges. - The reception was manned by the owner, if not mistaken. He speaks good English, not the friendliest demeanor but he is quite helpful when you ask for directions, etc. - The bed looks clean and I had a good night's sleep on the firm mattress. - The windows have thick black-out drapes which is great when you want to sleep in and block the sun out. - The breakfast is adequate and they do change the main dishes daily and refill the food trays when they are empty. - There are laundry bags. - There is a safe. - There are plenty of hangers. - There is a TV though we did not turn it on once - we are not TV people :) - The fridge works and they have tea/coffee making facilities. And now comes the fun part... The Bad: - There were mold on the bath tub tiles and under the sink. Pretty gross looking stuff! - No slippers for the bathroom. - No free WiFi internet - The room was small - just enough to fit in two twin beds and a small drawer in-between. - No complimentary water bottles.

However in our haste to leave, we did leave clothing and some other items in the room owing to my girlfriend slipping on the tiled floor and requiring medical treatment. Within an hour of leaving the hotel I called them to notify them that there were items in the room that I needed and was prepared to pay for postage back. After at least six phone calls to the hotel Singapore in the following days and weeks, nothing was ever done about returning the items. I see that the reputable website that originally did the booking is no longer accepting bookings from Parkview is probably testament to the problems too?
