She then explained about breakfast which was between 7:30 -10:00, although none of our group managed to get up early to sample the breakfast so i can't comment on the quality of it!.... we paid 135 euros each for the stay which to me seemed a bit much but i don't really know how that compares to other places in amsterdam. for the people staying in the main building there was a 4am curfew (although i think this depended on how long the person looking after the hotel bar felt like staying.. ) but it was secure, the key had to be left behind the bar and guest's had to be buzzed up to the room's. None of this applied to the people in the annex who had their own room key to be kept at all times and could come and go as they pleased. As said about the location it was very near the station, and also very close to the red light district. so in general Its probably in the ideal location for a group of friends. or anyone wanting to be near the red light infact. The room was pretty basic. we stayed in quad rooms, which had 4 beds, a sink in the corner and one table. There was also a tv which had a good selection of channels including BBC 1. the toilet was shared between the rest of the floor aswell as the shower. The shower however was awful, it was impossible to get the right temperature. It was either boiling hot or freezing cold. the windows where also very thin and made it very noisy off the street. Another slight minor point was our bed sheets were not changed at any point and i think we were only given clean towels on one occasion also.

I stupidly paid for my room before seeing it only to find a box for my single room which stank of cigerette smoke (It must be the only hotel in the world that allows people to smoke inside the room). It was dirty, and dark as it overlooked other windows and a dirty roof top. Easy book didn't make the location or the room description clear (and also I didn't take proper precautions to look, never again!!) It was room only with a shared shower and toilet which was fine on paper, but when I realised most of the clientele were single men travelling alone (needing hotels in the red light district.. mmm what for I wonder?), going to the toilet also became a health and safety risk.

If not i would pay extra and regretted not reading reviews.", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield", "Title": "\u201cThis is definetely a stag do/group orientated hostel!\u201d", "Author": "Tiggerchick", "ReviewID": "UR20940171", "Content": "This place is very convenient for the train station which is why we chose it for the last night of our stay in Amsterdam. This also means it's right in the heart of the noise and there's no getting away from the rowdy people outside, except listening to the rowdy people inside this place. It's a hostel but has some twin rooms. We stopped in a twin room, which was tiny and a weird size so we weren't able to put the beds together to pretend it was a double. There was a shower and toilet on each floor (beware the wet floor in the toilet - yuck!). The stairs in this place are very steep. Our room was on the same floor as 2 dorm rooms that had noisy groups in so we were hardly able to sleep as there was constant shouting and slamming doors until about 5am. Funny enough, we were the only people up to have breakfast in the morning which was fried eggs with a bit of bacon in and cheese on top with bread on the table to have with it. I'd say this place is best suited to those in a large group and just looking to roll to the place and use it to crash (although you'd have to be really careful on the stairs). If you're not planning on going out and smoking and drinking then it's probably not for you as, like us, it's likely to be too noisy for you to sleep. If you're a couple I'd recommend going a little bit further out and staying at the Hotel Hortus (also a hostel, despite the name) as this is in a quieter area and was that bit quieter inside while we were there. We also stayed there during the same break.", "Date": "October 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201clast Chance\u201d", "Author": "roonie49", "ReviewID": "UR20180163", "Content": "Left Harwich on 12th Sep on night boat to the Hook all was well.

Booked The Old Nickel through easytobook.com, thought this was an absolutely brilliant website, simple to use, good rates and you didn't have to pay online, just direct with the hotel on arrival. We arrived in Amsterdam on Mon 18th August at around 10am and thanks to fantastic directions from a TA member, we were able to find the hotel which is around 5 mins walk and just across the road from Centraal Station down a little side street. Since we had arrived well before check in, they let us put our luggage in the kitchen while the room was getting cleaned and they told us to come back at lunchtime. Once we had paid and got our keys, we were told we would be staying the other part of the hotel which was a couple of seconds down the street, next to a very good internet cafe and even closer to the Red Light District. We were shown the electronic entry system and told it was open 24 hours and that breakfast would be served in the original hotel bar between 7am-10am. Our room was on the 2nd floor at the back, right next to the toilet and shower room which was handy. Once in the room, up very steep stairs - like most in the area, we found it to be very clean, tidy and with ample space for the night. The only downside was it was a long room rather than a square one and had 2 single beds either side of the room which couldn't be pushed together...however it was funny trying to squeeze on the one bed! The Shower room and toilet were also very clean and the shower room was huge, me & hubby shared a shower and had more than enough room. Once we had got settled in we had a walk through the red light district and had lunch in a little pub, which was when I realised that alcohol is really expensive, just over 10 Euro for a pint of beer and a vodka & coke! We went into the Erotich Museum which was fun and then decided to take a look at a Peep Show which was an experience.....2 euro for 2 mins of a very attractive blonde girl dancing, stripping & pressing up against the window, she could just see us through the glass and seemed very happy.....and suprised....that a couple were watching her, we stayed for about 6 minutes, would have stayed longer but the cabins are tiny :o) After that we walked down Damrak and went into the Sex Museum, pretty much the same as the Erotich Museum but they are both very cheap so it's worth seeing both. We decided to go back to our room at around 4pm so we could chill out for abit, Amsterdam really is a walkers paradise and all the fresh air really tires you out! We were also planning a late night so wanted to have an afternoon sleep and get ready for the night ahead. We did our research before and found out about an interesting restaurant called The Butterfly Thai Cafe where all the waitresses are basically Thai Ladyboys. We headed out there at around 8pm and had a wonderful and very reasonable meal, the food came to 20 Euro and so did the alcohol so our total bill was 40 Euro. It was a great place though and we would def go back. We then took a walk down a few of the windowed streets and had some fun there, again the girls were much more receptive and friendly with me as I'm a girl and part of a couple. Obviously this is an open website so I won't say to much but I will be putting a review on [--] very soon ;o) Also if anyone wants to pm me about this then feel free to! We went back to our room at around 1am so not too late and got a good nights sleep, abeit being very close in a single bed lol. The next morning we woke quite early and went for breakfast around 8am, lovely cleaning lady / cook showed us to a table and immediately bought us a pot of tea and coffee, 2 omlette type things with bacon inside and a few slices of lovely fresh bread, butter, jam and marmalade, yummy! Checkout wasn't till 11am so we made the most of the time to pack and have a refreshing shower. As we booked the minicruise our coach was booked to pick us up for the ferry at 5pm so we had ample time to do abit more exploring. The only downside was we had to drag a suitcase with us all day, we could have possibly left it in the kitchen again but felt more secure having it with us, even if it was abit of a pain. We decided to jump on the Tram and went to The Albert Cuyp Market which was ok, just like a regular market really but it was nice to get away from the hype of the city centre. We spent an hour or so there until around 1pm and then went back to the centre and found a little gem in the form on the pub next to St Christophers Hostel. It was brilliant. full of young backpackers and beers and spirits were buy one get one free so we had a few drinks in there to wile away the hours. I think we may even stay there next time as it has a great atmosphere and rooms (the private ones not the dorms) are lovely and spacious. After stopping off in the peep show again and then popping in to their eqv of tescos for a few goodies for the coach, we junped onboard and headed back to the ferry for a well earned rest :o)", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cCheap, clean convenient, and a friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "retrovertigo", "ReviewID": "UR13978655", "Content": "We stayed at the annex which is about a block away.

I was traveling by myself (52 year old male). I've never stayed at the Old Nickel before, and I booked through Easytobook.com, a site I've also never used before. They had a good rate at 185 Euro for the four nights, so I somewhat nervously booked through a website I wasn't familiar with, but called the Nickel the next day to confirm, and they did have the reservation and confirmed the rate. After taking the train to Central Station, it's an easy couple of minute walk to the Old Nickel, but a word of warning...the old Nickel is on a small street that not many people are familiar with, so it helps to have specific directions as to where to walk. I loved this place, but you have to know what you're getting yourself into. The facility itself was quaint and lovely, a nice dark-paneled pub downstairs, with the rooms above, accessed by a buzz-through security door. The usual claustrophobic Amsterdam hike up three flights of stairs to room 12, which was quite nice but VERY VERY small. I happen to like small houses and rooms, but I'm talking small to the point where I could touch the opposite walls without stretching my arms out all the way. We're talking SMALL here folks, so if you're OK with that, go for it. The room was clean, as were the shower and shared bathroom in the hall. I stayed in room 12 on the third floor. I've read some complaints about noise, but my stay was quiet and peaceful. I can sleep through a nuclear explosion, so if there were some loud partyers next door, it wouldn't have bothered me. There was a nice flat panel TV in the room that is impossible to turn on. Ah-Ha! I finally figured out that they give you the remote control at the desk, in exchange for a 10 euro deposit. They gave the deposit back to me (without my having to ask) at checkout...let 'em keep it for a tip. Breakfast was yummy, a fried egg 'n cheese thingie with three slices of white bread, butter 'n jam and a pot of yummy coffee. The location was absolutely perfect, couldn't have been better, right on the edge of the red light district. There was so much to see and do within walking distance that I almost never felt the need to jump a tram or train , but if I did, they're right there. Stay away from the rip-off taxis, and watch out for pickpockets.

Sometimes you seems to bother her when ask something. - rooms are very tiny, and not really really clean (dust in the wardrobe and it seems they never clean under the bed) - the problem with shared facilities is when you share it with human pigs that don't clean up the place before they leave. - In my opinion it was very noisy . Both outside and inside ..nothing the owners can do ..but people slamming the door at 7-8 am or making noise because they're drunk at 3am are terrible. I guess some people don't know the meaning of respect. - the worst : I woke up late on one day (spent the night before in airport) and room was just not done during the whole day.
