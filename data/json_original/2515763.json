Wow. What a view ON THE BEACH!! Rooms are decent sizes with microwave and full size fridge. Staff was very nice and spent time with guests every day. I woke up early each morning for a breakfast at Konos On the Beach. We watched surfers and fishermen from the pier and my kids swam and took surfing lessons. We chose this property so that we could be on the beach and have enough extra vacation $$ to eat and play and have extra fun there.

She welcomed us for 20 years and watched our kids grow up. God rest her dear soul, she made it a tradition for us. Pacific View Motel was a frozen in time 1940s style beach front kitchenette motel. Loved the 1940s gas range/refrigerator combo, kitchen cabinets of dishes, pots & pans, dish soap and dish towels. You could fish all day and come back and fry up what you caught from the ocean in your room! Sadly, the iconic Daisy has passed but her friendly, gracious ways have been pass down to the new management. There's no cooking in the comfy rooms now, but the staff made us feel right at home by giving us an extension cord for our jumbo griddle to fry up our day's catch outside on the balcony. The room was clean and fresh, new beds, shower and vanity fixtures. After all, we Arizonians are only inside the room to shower or plop down and sleep as we want to maximum the time outside in the cool, ocean breeze outdoors before we go back to the 115 degree blast furnace known as Scottsdale, AZ. This is still the best value on the beach, thanks Pacific View Inn for preserving our yearly family fishing trip tradition!", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cFirst Time Disappointment\u201d", "Author": "Cyndi L", "ReviewID": "UR132764887", "Content": "Our first time to the area and found this little hotel on the beach in San Diego.

I knew it was the most reasonably priced hotel on Pacific Beach, and therefore would provide basic accommodations. I didn't expect a lot, but unfortunately the Pacific View Inn still fell short of my expectations. On the positive side, I agree with the other reviewers that if you are looking for a place right on the beach, the Pacific View Inn cannot be beat. But, the new owners have a ways to go to bring it up to speed. I noticed the hotel has been updated, primarily in the hallways, with fresh paint, wall art and light fixtures. Our room, too, had been recently painted but still smelled musty. We spent two nights and the maid never came to clean our room. Because we had ordered take out food, our leftover boxes, bags, etc. were left overflowing in the one small wastebasket the room is furnished with. We had a coffee maker but no cups to drink from. And if you are a light sleeper, beware that the plumbing at the Pacific View Inn is extremely loud (we all had to agree not to flush in the middle of the night so as to avoid causing other guests to be startled awake by the sound). Hot water was elusive during our stay and only one person actually got hot water for a shower. Because the hotel is located near several bars, expect a lot of rowdy folks out on the street late at night. Unfortunately, the windows in our room were old and the frames were rotting out, therefore providing no noise barrier (we learned the second night to turn on a fan that was furnished in the room, not for the breeze it provided but to help cancel out street noise). I can overlook a lot but perhaps the most concerning thing about the Pacific View Inn is that the staff seemed rather uninterested in us as guests. Nobody seemed to go out of their way to make us feel welcome or give us tips or information that might be helpful to us. For example, when we arrived we parked alongside the building to check in. Unbeknownst to us, it is a strictly enforced no parking zone and we nearly got a parking ticket. It would have been helpful for the staff member who checked us in to forewarn us, the new arrivals, of the hazards of parking on the street. When approached, staff tended to reply with the briefest possible response delivered in a friendly but detached tone. I would recommend the owners plan not only to upgrade the interior of the hotel but their friendly touch as well.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midland, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPacific view motel\u201d", "Author": "TrishaSolla", "ReviewID": "UR127976285", "Content": "By far the best location with the best price and best service.

This motel is nothing fancy but the location is perfect, right on the beach. Our room had a partial view of the ocean. The view of the ocean from the balcony outside our door was amazing! The room was clean, very basic, with a small refrigerator, microwave and coffeemaker. They gave us extra coffee, towels, etc. when we requested them. The bed was comfortable. The motel is within walking distance of many restaurants, many of them right on the beach. There is a coffee bar about a block away at Crystal Pier. However, parking is definately a problem. There are not enough parking spaces and the parking on the street fills up fast, especially on the weekend. We would definately stay here again.
