The hotel's location is great; on a relatively quiet street, but in the heart of the tourist Sultanahmet quarter, within 1 block of major sights and tourist-y wants like travel agents, cash machines, food, etc. We booked the first night in a single for the first arrivee, but due to snafus at the airport, they upgraded her to the triple that we were to use for the rest of the stay for no extra charge. We added two nights to the original booking, no problem. They sent a shuttle to the airport in the middle of the night, no problem. Nb: the hotel charges in Euros, and requires cash. There's a cash machine 1 block away. Breakfast is minimal, but OK, a little monotonous. The deck view at breakfast is fabulous from outside, inside is a little stuffy. The room was functional, clean, and had some charming touches; double-glazed windows reduced any street noise (not eliminated - apparently reserving a room in the back helps). Be aware there's no elevator, so if you have a basement room and you're heading for breakfast, you've got four flights of stairs ahead of you. The staff are lovely, especially the maids. They insisted on carrying luggage, helped us getting settled in our rooms, going the extra mile with breakfast when we moved up to the top deck and smiling and being pleasant with every encounter. The owner was helpful and friendly, especially when we were introduced by a long-time patron of the hotel that we'd met at breakfast.

The location is ideal, just a short walk from Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big three tourist attractions (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sopia, Topkapi Palace) and from the Sultanahmet tram stop (just 2USD=3TL=1.5EU from the airport by metro and tram). I booked a single room without bath, the only room category available in late March for my mid-April stay. Although there are reports of rooms without external windows and back rooms facing air conditioners, I was given a very nice front room with large windows and twin beds. The room was pie-shaped, and about 120 sq.ft. = 11 sq.m. in size. The bathroom was across the hall and was clean and almost always available. My room started out very clean, but remained ostensibly untouched during the first four days of my stay (I left early and forfeited the last two days of a six day pre-paid reservation for reasons discussed below). I did obtain a fresh dry towel from the front desk after the third day. The hotel web site has good information about the hotel, including photos. They make it clear that they hold an internet reservation with one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit card number, but payment is in cash, due on arrival. The front desk is flexible about currencies (TL, USD, and EU are all acceptable; currency conversion rates are based on internet quotes at the time of payment). There is a three day cancellation notice, so I did not request a refund when I left two days earlier than planned. Recent reviews have almost uniformly complained about the front desk staff. I found them neither friendly nor unfriendly. They did not seem eager to please, but they did fulfill requests. Their attitude made no difference to me. As a rule of thumb, younger staff (such as the night staff) tended to be more accommodating than older staff. Recent reviews have also faulted the (included) breakfast. A noticeable effort has been made to improve this. The breakfast now includes an omelet. The breakfast staff is quite friendly, and the view from the breakfast room and the roof terrace is awesome. Two internet terminals are available near the front desk at a nominal charge (1 TL per 30 minutes). This was very useful for those guests who were trapped by the volcanic eruption and needed to re-book flights into northern Europe. Safe deposit boxes are available without charge, but be aware that the safe box master key is not monitored -- on request it is handed to each guest who then uses both keys to access his safe box, which is located down the hall from the front desk. The safe box key looks like a smaller version of the room key, and I handed in the wrong key once when departing. Luckily I returned minutes later and corrected my error before anyone accessed my safe box. I was less fortunate regarding room security. As I mentioned, no one ostensibly entered my room during my four day stay. The bed was untouched, the bath towel unchanged, and the room uncleaned. The daily tip that I always leave for housekeeping also remained untouched. I did not tip at the end of my stay. However, at some time during my stay someone entered my (always locked, even when I went to the bathroom) room and picked apart the zipper on my carry-on, which I also locked. Nothing was stolen, but my damaged carry-on, which now has a non-functional main zipper, cost more than my entire hotel stay. This attempted theft, coupled with disruption of air travel due to the volcanic eruption, led to my early departure.

I just wanted to come on and say that this was not my experience at all, and I thought the night staff were really helpful and kind. I stayed at Side for four days, and then stored my luggage there while I was in Bursa for the weekend. I came back from Bursa at around 11:30 on Sunday night, and had a flight leaving at 7:00 the next morning. I didn't want to pay for a hotel room since I was leaving so early, and figure I would sit in the Side lobby until they kicked me out, and then maybe go and sleep at the airport from there. I assumed, especially after the reviews on here, that the man at the desk would be annoyed by my presence, and I'd have at best an hour before he either asked me to pay for a room or kicked me out. Quite the contrary. Not only did he let me use the internet and drink tea free of charge as if I were still a guest, I also was able to curl up on the couch and sleep for a while. I curled up on the smaller couch that was farther away and less noticeable so I wouldn't be a bother, but he actually approached me and suggested that I sleep on the larger couch near the front, so I could spread my legs out and be more comfortable. He woke me up at 4:15 and called a cab for me to get to the airport. This was very nice of him to do, as I had already checked out and paid my bill three days prior, and he could have easily and justifiably asked me to leave that evening at no consequence to him. I am really grateful for this, and had a much more comfortable rest than I would have at the airport. He was very pleasant and nice, not rude in any way. To sum up, please don't avoid this hotel because you may think the night staff is unfriendly, I really had a great experience with them. In general, the hotel was very clean, in a fantastic location, and a great price. This is the cheapest place I could find in the Sultanahmet area, next to Eurasia hostel, which isn't nearly as nice on the inside (I had a friend staying in there and was able to see the inside).

The staff was exceptionally rude, and pretty much useless at anything. The breakfast had gone from basic but tasty Turkish, to stale bread, three olives, one slice tomato, and a triangle of processed cheese. You had to ask for jam. The rooms were still clean, but the it looked like no money had been re-invested since my last visit. The bed linens were starting to get threadbare, the pillows were like rocks, the towels had holes. I know this was the pension side, but those staying in the hotel fared the same. As far as I know, the only difference between the two is that the hotel rooms have A/C. Also, as others have mentioned, beware the credit card scam. They claim the machine to be broken when you check out, forcing you to pay cash. Yet, if for any reason you need to check out early, or break a reservation, they will quite happily charge your card.

There is very little difference between the hotel and pension rooms, they are hot, noisy, very basic, and super overpriced for what you get. The cleaning staff are great and do a good job with keeping rooms tidy and supplied fresh towels and sheets but the reception staff downstairs is downright surly and rude. They claim to not accept payment by credit card because \"their machine is broken\" but then are miraculously able to charge you for nights if you don't stay as long as you booked for.

A big NO to the Side.", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cPoor Service at Clean, Well-Located Hotel\u201d", "Author": "rosannasf2000", "ReviewID": "UR17629526", "Content": "I write this review from the perspective of someone whose family has run a resort hotel for over 40 years. My husband and I just visited Turkey where we enjoyed the famed Turkish hospitality throughout our travels with one exception: the Side Hotel and Pension in Istanbul, which was unfortunately recommended by a friend who lives in Istanbul On the plus side, the hotel is clean, reasonably priced and has an extremely convenient location. Breakfast is served on a lovely terrace with a city view. We would never stay there again, however, because the hotel operators provide poor service. First, it was extremely difficult to make a reservation. In a city where there are many good English speakers in the tourism industy, the hotel clerks do not speak competent English (despite the fact that the hotel clientele is virtually all English speakers). They refused to take a reservation over the phone or over the internet. They wanted us to fax the reservation, but their fax machine was either broken or shut off for many hours each . I was finally able to make a reservation upon my fifth attempt to fax their reservation form to them. This process took three days. Secondly, the hotel refuses to accept credit cards for payment. Although they informed us of this policy when we checked in, we were so jet-lagged that we forgot. We almost missed our flight because my husband had to run out and find an ATM machine, which was not close by, to obtain cash. Thirdly, the day clerk, who was one of the laziest human beings I have encoutered, refused to help us with directions, information about laundry faciltiies or transportation. He referred us to the night clerks, who I had to ask FIVE TIMES to order a cab for us to the airport. They demanded immediate payment before they would do so. Fourth, the clerks never remembered to give us a wake-up call even after we explained we had lost our travel alarm clock. We understood the reason on the day when we checked out when we had to shake the clerk from a deep sleep so he could unlock the front door so we could leave for the airport. In short, even though we were paying hotel rates, the Side Hotel provided us with pension service. I heartily recommend that you consider staying at one of the other nearby hotels.

This is *the* area for hotels and hostels, so a lot of the restaurants and nightlife establishments are geared to tourists. The Side's location means that you can get to many of the big tourist attractions in Istanbul very easily, but you might not see other sides to the city if you stay in the area all the time. Excellent value, particularly out of season. Rooms start at 23 euros per night, without a shower. Our 'with shower' room wasn't much more, Note for those on a very tight budget: if I stayed again, I would be quite happy to share a bathroom as they were so clean, and never seemed to be in use! The building is divided into hotel and pension. The hotel rooms are rather more expensive, but I didn't actually see how the rooms compared. The pictures on the excellent Side website gave an accurate idea of how our room looked, so it is worth checking those. One word of warning: not all the pension rooms are quite so good. I specifically requested a room on a high floor with plenty of light, because of I had heard not all the rooms had windows. I got just what I wanted, though the rooms all seem very small, but i did see another (even smaller ) pension room in passing: a three-bed room with a tiny window. The pension rooms are very simply and tastefully decorated, with a comfortable decorative-iron bed. It was quite small, however, with limited wardrobe space and very few drawers, but that didn't diminish its overall charm. This is a clean comfortable place and exceptional value so my quiblles are very small. The bathroom was roomy and really clean - loads of hot water. The view was over old Turkish houses in a quiet street to the posh Four Seasons hotel at the end. Downstairs there is a narrow communal area with two computers for checking emails (small extra cost) free tea, and a little library. The desk staff are mostly friendly and helpful. The breakfast room is on the pretty roof terrace - views over the minarets. The Turkish breakfast was included in the price and excellent - very healthy - with tomatoes, cucumber, olives, very fresh bread, little cheese triangle, boiled egg and jam. This could come as a shock to an 'eggs and bacon' person, I suppose! I got to like this kind of breakfast so much we sometimes make it back home. Very friendly service. During the summer, people bring tea or beer up to the pretty roof terrace and sit out.
