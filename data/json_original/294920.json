Nice lobby area with free internet and a small bar section, pricy. The area has several small stores and restaurants, easy to pick up snacks, beer, soda, etc. Many street walkers approached me and asked the typical \"you want Turkish women?\", just kept walking.

Front desk quite helpful in arranging a bus, and giving us a general idea navigating through the city. Rooms are very Modern and smart, although a few complaints: Beds: Not comfortable at all (we had 2 twin beds)...small hard and flimsy mattress. Only a bottom sheet and a comforter (no middle sheet) TV: Not easy to operate (maybe we had a bad one)...we're pretty tech savvy & this one was impossible some nights just to turn on. Noise: Windows didn't block out much of the noise..even though it is off on somewhat of a side street, we could still here the ongoings outside - they didn't have a fan to loan us to block out some of the white noise either. Bathtub: Faulty design meant we had a big puddle on the floor after every shower needing lots of extra towels. Closets/Storage: We could hang 4 items each & No other storage space for clothes...Very inconvenient. Overall if the above doesnt bother you...not a bad place to spend some time.

First the good, this is a good value hotel, in a great location. Breakfast is decent with a wide variety of foods, and whilst on this visit my room was a little small on previous visits I have had better sized rooms. Now onto the bad, I had a business meeting at which I needed to make a good impression, having a creased shirt would not have been great. Unfortunately when I asked if I could borrow an iron I was told that 'there are no irons, this is a hotel', obviously something could have been lost in translation, but I was very specific and asked three times. I was then told that I could use the trouser press in my room, which might have been a reasonable alternative, except there was no trouser press in my room. This was met with a shrug of the shoulders, by reception. In the end I user the hotels laundry service which I was assured would have my two shirts available by 9.30am the next morning, with a doubt in my mind I found a shirt shop and bought a new shirt which the shop ironed for me. This was lucky as my shirts were eventually ready for me at 11am, the reception told me that there was a translation problem, relating to the times, this may well be the case, but it does not deflect from the point that it seems impossible to get a shirt ironed quickly. I have stayed all over the world in hotels and consider having an iron available to be a minimum pre-requisite of a 3 star hotel.

The Metro stop is at Taxim Square and we found the public transport in Istanbul amazingly easy to use. The hotel is what the Best Western's are known for: fairly basic but efficient I would say though that it is misleading to say that it has a pool. It's basically a very small plunge pool which we did not use. My kids gave me a lot of grief for not being able to swim!

The roof-top breakfast room gave a lovely view of Istanbul and the buffet food was of a very good quality and lots of it !

I was at a conference so met travelers staying at some of the other hotels and I think mine was probably better at least in the breakfast I got. My first room was a smoking room so I refused and then was given a tiny room in the back facing some air conditioning units. The big lamp was missing a lightbulb but an electrician promptly arrived and fixed that and also gave me an electric thing for one of my own appliances. But while I didn't want to use the heat, it was very hot anyway. AFter two nights I had 3 plumbing problems and the management immediately moved me to a much larger nicer room across the hall facing front. The beds were firm and I slept well all 4 nights. There are apparently more modern rooms in this hotel but at a higher price which I wasn't prepared to do. Also, you need to be firm and ask for a no-smoking room. The breakfast was quite extensive and very good except for the breads which seemed quite hard. In addition to the great yogurt and honey and jams, there was also always eggs, sausage and other cold cuts, cheeses, cereals and halvah and apple cake. The hotel staff without exception were really pleasant and very helpful. Location for this hotel is in Taxim which is safe. Lots of restaurants especially along the tram walkway. Best one was a workers' cafeteria. I was concerned about being an older woman traveler on my own but had absolutely no problems. At this time of year there are few tourists so everyone spoke to me in Turkish which I didn't know even one word.
