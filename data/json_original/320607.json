I travelled with my family of five. The room they gave us was divided into 3 main sections: the greeting hall (to take off shoes, no more than 2 square meters), the main area (a tatami multi-purpose space, during the day the maids set up a coffee table to drink tea and at night they lay out the futon beds, 20 square meters) and the bath room (which is divided into 2 parts, a sink area and then another room with a shower, toilet and another sink). The room does come with sliding shoji paper screens :D. The shuttle bus is very convinient , which runs between Ueno Station and the hotel.Its hard to rate the room by North American standards, but i'd say only 3 because it was quite small, but very different, highly recommended for the adventurous budget traveller.", "Date": "Jul 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR354987509", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "200455665"}, {"Content": "Good price and good location Depending on your plans for Tokyo, the Suigetsu Hotel Ohgaisou could be in a perfect location: It is a short, easy walk from Tokyo's Ueno Park and from several options for transportation, including the JR Ueno train station, the Keisei Ueno train station (which has an express line to/from Narita Airport), and the Nezu subway station. My single Western-style room was small, but it met my needs quite well. (Very tall people might find the ceilings a bit low. The hotel also has tatami rooms, which I did not see.) The window could be opened for fresh air and allowed a view of the local city-scape. Desk staff spoke at least some English and were eager to be of assistance. The hotel also has baths and a massage service, which are free to guests. I was very pleased to stay at this hotel!", "Date": "Jun 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR680270889", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "KJA3"}, {"Content": "Excellent Suigetsu Hotel My Wife and I satyed at this hotel Xmas 05  New Year 06. This is a really nice hotel in Uneo which, is in the heart of Tokyo. It is filled with parks and museums. The hotel staff are as you would expect them to be polite, courteous and very friendly. The hotel forms part of Ohgai Moris' house who was one of Japan's most famous novelists. You can either stay in tradistional Japanese style rooms or as we did on this occassion a Western style room. Prices are very reasonable. The western rooms are small however, remember you are only sleeping there as you will spend most of your time out and about. This however, does not matter as they are great rooms and are ideal for the purpose. This location puts you right at the centre of the JR Rail Network allowing you access to the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) leaving for most ares of Japan. Trains from here will take you to numerous areas of Tokyo and Japan including Disneyland Tokyo and don't forget Tokyo has probably the best underground system in the world and in my expreience if the subway dosn't go there it's not worth visiting.We are returning again to Japan this Xmas  New Year and are in the process of booking rooms there again so I totally recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR305844959", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "honbu"}, {"Content": "\u6d93\u5b2c\u657d\u9287\ue1bd\u68be\u6901?#x201d;   showReview(19161899, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR981212292", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066461-d320607-r11681444-Suigetsu_Hotel_Ohgaisou-Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "320607", "Price": "$110"}}
