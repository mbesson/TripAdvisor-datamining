Neither nice neither ugly \u9225?let say just ok.Front desk: friendly staff, ready to help.Breakfast \u9225?very poor. Espresso was not included in breakfast, brad is not tasty.

You can\u9225\u6a9b park car anyway, price in public garage is 5 Euros per hour (let me calculate for you \u9225?120 Euros per day).

You could go down by the Duomo late at midnight or later and there is a little hole in the wall place that is really good that the college kids go too. Loved talking with them. All the places you go there to see are in walking distance and I don't walk too far. Vivoli's gellato was to die for and it was pretty close too-made more than a few trips there.

They then told us the rooms with the views were not available to us. This seemed to me to be the Italain hotel version of bait and switch.

The room was small by American standards but this ain't America. It had lots of storage space, a large bathroom with full facilities and a huge shower. There was also a safe in the clothes cabinet and windows that opened over the small open air courtyard. That was a nice touch since it allowed the cool late March air into the room and I had the church bells for a wake up call.The free breakfast had cereal, rolls, croissants, swiss cheese, ham, coffee, milk, tomato juice, orange juice and some very good coffee.

There were several hundred people waiting on line to get in at 9:15AM but the line for the reserved people had maybe 20 people in it! We went to have a croissant and cappuccino and when we came back at 10:15AM we went to Door 1, got our tickets (1 minute wait) then walked across to the reserved line and were in the door right at 10:30.

This isn't really a problem if you're just intending to leave in the morning and return in the evening, but if you want to pop back to the hotel to rest, drop off heavy guide books, presents and the like it becomes a chore. So when we decided to return we looked for a hotel a little which was more central.We found the Hotel di Lanzi, which looked central, looked about the right price, and we hoped that it would be okay for us. Our expectations of a hotel aren't too high, we want a clean comfortable room, friendly and helpful staff, and peace and quiet to rest in.When we arrived at the Hotel di Lanzi we were stunned at how great the location was. From the door of the hotel you can see the Duomo (though down a little side street), and it is literally 20 yards or so from Piazza San Giovanni where the Duomo sits.The hotel provided good clean rooms with large en-suite bathrooms, heating and air-conditioning available for each room, an excellent buffet breakfast, a bar, and internet access (very useful if you want to keep an eye on you bank account while you're spending too much).We got everything we wanted and a lot more, but better than all of this was the service. The staff spoke fluent English, and were extremely helpful. We had a problem with our luggage being lost by our airline and we had difficulties sorting this out, having to telephone airports in Bologna and Florence, and we seemed to be banging our heads against a brick wall, but when we explained the problem to the staff they took over for us, made phone calls and sorted everything out. This was a huge relief. This is just one example of how helpful they were. They made our stay so much more enjoyable.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay right in the centre of Florence, especially if they are on a tight budget.

We are a late 20s couple that often look for well priced but comfortable hotels in good locations. We found the hotel perfectly suited to spend a few days in Florence. It is in walking distance to all the attractions and sits a brief moment from the Duomo. Hotel room good points: Average but comfortable. Nice and friendly staff. Clean. Handy small safe in room. Bathroom worked fine, though small shower cubicle (but typical of 3 star).Hotel room bad points: Room was quite cold, thermostat not very receptive. No view at all from our room. Was a bit noisy from the street noise below. Doors are thin so hallway noise is quite loud. Very small TV. All in all a pleasant stay in a standard 3-star.

Average Hotel Stayed at the De Lanzi in November 2004. On the plus side, the hotel is in an excellent location right on Piazza Duomo. Interior of hotel is very clean, but very spartan. Nothing quaint or romantic about it. Breakfast was good, but not great. I had telephoned before arrival requesting a quiet room, and our room (which faced the Duomo) was very quiet and the beds were comfortable. On the minus side, the entrance to the hotel is really dismal -- looks like a flophouse from the outside. The guestroom was very small. For the most part, the shower water was lukewarm, not hot. The front desk staff were courteous, but not friendly. They refused to take messages from callers which was a big problem since this was a business trip. The hotel is located in a zone that allows taxis, but does not allow privately-owned cars. This is a plus if you're worried about street traffic, but a minus if you have a car or friends with a car. We paid nearly $200 per night for the DeLanzi. In May 2004, we stayed at the magnificent Bernini Palace (a Baglioni chain hotel) for about the same price. Would have preferred the Bernini in November, but it was fully booked. Note: there's also a Baglioni Grand hotel near the train station which is not affiliated with the Baglioni chain.

We stayed there based on other trip advisor reviews but got there and was completed disappointed. Although the location is good, the noise is awful and the service was terrible. We counted at least six other couples that complained of various problems during the two days we were there. Howevee the biggest problem was that we got LOCKED in our room for over an hour. We had to get the desk person to open our door the first night because our key wouldn't open the door and he tried to blame us until he had trouble opening it too and then in the morning it wouldn't open at all from the inside or the outside. The people were useless and again tried to blame us for closing the door too hard etc...ridiculous! We saw from the marks on the door that someone else had been locked in that room too and tried to force the lock to get out. There were no fire escapes and no ladders to get out. They finally let down a bag of random tools through a window on an extension cord (!) and my husband got us out...then to add insult to injury said because we got a discounted rate to begin with they wouldn't give us our money back but just changed our room...I guess because we didn't pay full rate it was OK that we were locked in for over an hour without a way to get out.
