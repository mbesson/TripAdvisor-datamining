Danielle, the receptionist, welcomed us as we arrived in the morning around 11:00. She held our bags for us as we went out for lunch; when we returned at 12:30, our room was ready to go. The bathroom was great--dual sinks and a wonderful shower. It was air-conditioned, and there was a little safe to use, also. At breakfast, it was certainly a step above the coffee and danish. There was a tray of meat, cheeses, fruit, and cereal also. the cappucino was also very nice. I think that the price was very reasonable considering we were in Rome in the summer tourist season, and certainly could have paid a higher price somewhere else.

What more could you ask?\u201d", "Author": "Lisawishpink", "ReviewID": "UR115553125", "Content": "We stayed at Trevi Collection Guesthouse for 2 nights on the 14th and 15th of June. It was our first time in Europe as a family, and we were a little nervous booking a hotel as everything seemed so expensive in Rome, and price didn't seem to guarantee a good stay! My main priorities were position, and cleanliness. As we were travelling with 2 children and wanted them in the room with us, that narrowed our choices a lot. What a pleasure the Trevi Collection was. We arrived very early on Tuesday morning, well aware that we could not check in until 2pm, but hoping to drop our luggage. The delightful receptionist made us coffee, gave us a map, found some cake for the children and upgraded us to a suite which was made available for us at 10.30am! We went out to explore while we waited and the excitement from the children when we got back and saw our room was delightful to see. The main bedroom area was separated from the 2 full sized single beds for the children by an 'open wall/bedhead. They had a little desk in their area to draw on, which was perfect. Decor was modern and lovely, and there was a HUGE spa bath in the master bedroom area. The bathroom was up a couple of steps, and the glass shower screen overlooked the spa bath. We had 2 big windows with shutters that we could open to let the sights and sounds of Rome in, but which were double glazed for absolute quiet when we wanted to sleep. The blackout curtains were very effective, and this really helped with jet lag (as did getting out into the sun and walking around on our first day rather than falling into bed!) Everything was spotlessly clean. In the morning the church bells nearby ring out a wonderful tune if you want to hear them, and the Spanish Steps are a few steps up the hill, while the Trevi fountain is 5 minutes' walk away. We visited it 4 times in our 2 days as we loved it so much. We found all staff to be helpful and friendly, and the ladies who served breakfast were delightful, as was the breakfast room. We enjoyed the European style breakfast. The apple cake was obviously home-made and was stunning and there were eggs both mornings - once an omelette on the buffet table, and once boiled eggs. We didn't mind taking the stairs to our room on the 4th floor, as the lift was tiny and antique, and we prefer to walk anyway. It was tricky to get suitcases up in one go, but as there were 2 adults, we put the cases in with one adult and everyone else took the stairs! I felt the lift was not an issue at all. The service provided by reception was great, they booked our time slot at the Villa Borghese for us and followed through to let us know, and helped with translating for us when we needed to make a phone call. They also helped with booking a bike tour of Rome with Bici e Baci, which was the best thing we did by far. We saw more in 3 hours than we did walking the streets for a whole day, and the children's legs were fresh for an afternoon at the Roman Forum. The only things we were not thrilled with were a restaurant recommendation to the Wine and Grill (The worst meal we had on our 5 week trip) and the car service to the airport which was in a very old van with no air conditioning, exhaust fumes which made our 6-year-old ill in the back seat and terrible suspension - avoid it and book for yourself the official airport shuttle which we found fantastic on the way to the hotel. These were very minor things overall as we LOVED LOVED LOVED the hotel and had a wonderful stay. Friends of ours stayed at a hotel near the Roman Forum which they also liked, but they paid double what we had paid for their family of 4 to squish into a tiny room. I can't recommend Trevi Colletion Guesthouse highly enough for families, you just have to get over the fact that it's a cross between a hotel and an apartment complex and therefore doesn't have restaurants and bars.

Location was the main upside.\u201d", "Author": "ReemQtr", "ReviewID": "UR104203428", "Content": "My friend and I (two women) stayed at the Trevi Collection for 3 nights around mid April 2011. We were really excited to be in Rome and are avid travellers who were taking time off of work for a holiday. I will truly say that we did not have a good experience at this hotel at all. I\u2019m very surprised with the good reviews of this hotel and actually those reviews encouraged us to decide to book at this hotel. Before I explain why we were dissatisfied, I will just quickly note what the few pros were. 1) Hotel is in a good location 2) Bathroom was a good size and clean 3) There is free Internet in the room but it is not Wi-Fi We got to the hotel in the evening and we had 4 small to medium suitcases between the two of us. The hotel is located on the 4th and 5th floor and the reception is on the 5th floor so no lobby when you enter the building. The building is shared between the hotel and offices. The elevator at this building is old and extremely tiny and we had to make two trips in the elevator to take our bags up. We got to the reception and checked in and the person who we encountered was not very friendly (portly, and loud man named Cheseri, I believe). He seemed to be the reception manager. We checked in and he gave us one key card and told us that our room was on the 4th floor. That meant taking the luggage back down the tiny elevator twice to our room. He didn\u2019t offer to assist at all! He didn\u2019t even offer to give us room on the 5th floor and I know they had rooms available because I saw the room occupancy chart on the screen behind him. We were tired and wanted to get to our room so we took our luggage down to our room and there was a glass door in front of the room corridor where you had to scan your key card to get into the corridor. Then when you got to your room you use the same key card to get in. You can press a button to get out of the corridor but cannot get in without the key card and your room has to have the key card in it to have the lights working. I went back to the reception and asked the same guy who checked us in for another key card in case one of us wanted to go out while the other stayed in the room. The man looked at me as if he didn\u2019t know why I would need another card. He seemed reluctant and then responded to me that he would arrange that tomorrow. I didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t do it at that time. The room size was very small for what we were paying for and I know pictures are almost always not the same as the real thing with rooms but the room was much smaller than expected. The bed was very uncomfortable! The mini-bar was stocked but the refrigerator didn\u2019t work well and therefore nothing in the mini-bar was cold. There was no kettle, tea or instant coffee in the room. I called and asked for an iron and was told irons in the room are not allowed for fire reasons. I even asked that if I had brought a travel iron would I still not be allowed to use it. I was told I wouldn\u2019t be able to. Something like that should be made clear before booking. Breakfast is mediocre with juices that are not fresh. When we checked out, the same guy who checked us in was there and he was very cold. He didn\u2019t ask us how our stay was; he just proceeded with the checkout process. We didn\u2019t have breakfast that morning, so my friend asked him if we could possibly have some coffee. The person who made the coffee was still there. This man, Cheseri gave my friend a hard time and was like you are too late to order coffee. My friend apologized and told him no need but then he told the person to make us coffee. PLEASE NOTE CHECK OUT IS BETWEEN 10:30-11am. They will not extend except for a charge. We were to leave our bags as our flight was in the evening. I asked the man for a receipt because he only gave me back the credit card receipt and he told me he would leave it on one of our bags later. While we were checking out, a European lady with her two children checked into the hotel and we were surprised to see how nice this hotel guy was with them. We were as respectful as this woman was to him, yet he treated us much worse. He even asked the lady and her children if they would like to drink anything (tea or coffee or water). He also helped the lady\u2019s daughter with her luggage! Being discriminated in any way is a very bad thing and especially when you are paying a good amount of money at a hotel, you expect a certain level of service for the value of money. This, we did not receive at all. He definitely treated us differently than he treated other guests and we do not tolerate that kind of treatment. The hotel should have someone managing reception, who is able to receive people who come from all over the world well. We will NOT be staying at this hotel again and will definitely not recommend it to our colleagues, friends, family or anyone we know.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location , hospitality and traveller friendly\u201d", "Author": "Chasman57", "ReviewID": "UR97146663", "Content": "My wife and I, along with my son and daughter just returned from a week in Rome.
