There are some tasty restaurants nearby too. The corridors are well soundproofed which makes for a great sleep. My only niggles were that the air con wasn't overtly powerful and had to change rooms because of it, and that the wifi was a shocking 35 dhs an hour when most 4 star hotels give it for free. This hotel is great for airline crew as they offer discounts for certain airlines too!", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nr Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cWrong location\u201d", "Author": "MikeJenvey", "ReviewID": "UR120581248", "Content": "I stayed one night in mid-Nov for business. It's a relatively quick ride from the airport (15 - 20 mins), which is advantageous. However, location isn't great. There are nearby food outlets, they don't seem to be \"haute cuisine\" but rather more orientated towards the local industry - lots in the immediate area - want your car tyres changed? Whilst not the most important factor for a hotel, not having a bar is rather disappointing! Yes, it's possible in UAE. Consequently, if you wanted to enjoy the night life (actually, anything in Dubai), you would have to take a taxi. Not ideal if your time is limited. The room was very well furnished & for the first few hours, very comfortable. However, when I tried to sleep, it became very apparent that there was general background noise that was quite pronounced. It wasn't the conditioning (it was off), nor the mini-bar 'fridge. I tried to sleep, but to no avail. The sound was slightly louder near the window (which looked onto the central atrium - I measured it (very handy iPhone app = Decibel Ultra), 45db average, 50db peak. For interest, 45db = a quiet office, 50db = a normal home. I tried ear-plugs = no good. So, at 0400 local, I went down to reception to ask for technical help - previously, a receptionist had told me that the noise was from a tourist bus parked outside! Yeah, right!!. An engineer came to my room & told me that the cause was the a/c blowing from very large vents into the central atrium. I opened the room window (into the atrium area) & measured the volume again. This time it was 72db average & 77db peak!! The engineer couldn't do anything about the noise: I had a very disturbed & uncomfortable \"sleep\" - as did a colleague whose room faced from the front of the hotel onto the busy main road. Note - a high proportion of rooms face into the atrium or out onto the main road. So, to me, it was a short & disappointing stay.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "medway", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "lincolnlady64", "ReviewID": "UR119965899", "Content": "Layia Plaza hotel was a very pleasant hotel with accomadating staff.

Hotel is at least 20 mins from the nearest mall and attractions by taxi - expensive for tourists coming for city tours. Internet costs AED 35 per hour - too much. All in all, good hotel.
