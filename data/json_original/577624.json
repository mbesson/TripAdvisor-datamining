The web site is great for getting opinions and helped us a lot when choosing. We stayed at Beachside with another family of 4. The 4 girls were 14, 12, 11 and 10. The house was perfect for our group. The other couple took the upstairs with the 4 girls and my wife and I took the downstairs. The house was better than we could have hoped, perfectly clean, manicured gardens and a great pool. Lots of dishes, dishwashers and BBQ made cooking for ourselves a breeze. The house is across the road from a great beach and within walking distance of a great little bar. Shopping just like home was available in town at a couple of grocery stores.We all really enjoyed feeling like we were actually in the country and not just at some remote microcosm like you feel at most resorts.Having a car is a must because this whole area is somewhat spread out. Driving was not a problem and the house had gated parking for 2 cars.This place is definitely a great place for a family/s. I don't think I would recommend just renting the top or the bottom though as a lot would depend on who was in the other apartment.", "Date": "Sep 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR294892736", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nukesul"}, {"Content": "The perfect Puerto Rico retreat We have stayed at the Beachside Villas twice in the past two years. I am convinced that there could be no better place to get away from it all on the island! The house is beautiful, and the owners and property manager have made certain that no detail has been overlooked for your comfort and convenience. Our group consisted of four adults and four kids, and the set up was perfect for us. Having our own pool was such a bonus, and although the house isn't right on the beach, it is only a few steps away (there is one house between this one and the sand) and the view from the second floor balcony is gorgeous. It feels lke you are truly away from it all in your own island paradise, yet conveniences are only a short distance away. There is a supermarket nearby, and you could prepare all your meals in the beautiful kitchens, but don't miss the Tamboo Tavern for a beach dinner that is delicious and fun. And be sure to eat from the roadside carts -- yum!You won't be disappointed if you stay at this island paradise. The hospitality is fantastic -- you will be well taken care of!", "Date": "Aug 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR850488527", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d577624-r19203186-Beachside_Villas_Rincon-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html", "HotelID": "577624", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
