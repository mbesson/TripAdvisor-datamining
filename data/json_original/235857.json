Positives: Pretty good value for the money. The room was clean and spacious. Close walking distance to a nice square with bakery, coffee shop and grocery store. The staff were very helpful and friendly. They bring you breakfast in the morning! The coffee and croissants were great! Negatives: The beds were not very comfortable. Also note that if you stay in the apartment that the staff can come in and out of the apartment at any time to use the storage room in the front hallway. Please note however that they were very friendly with us, however we weren't given the option to put a \"do not disturb\" on the door which was a small annoyance.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cThey over booked us!\u201d", "Author": "Ronim_lad", "ReviewID": "UR119179228", "Content": "We turned up, and were told that \"the hot water in your room doesn't work\", so the daughter (?) took us for a short 5 min walk to another place, where there was a room available for us. This room was above a restaurant, of presumably her friend. She was very apologetic. The new room was lovely, big, great air con, mini fridge, tv, nice bathroom. Lovely! And a view of the canal. So we can't really comment on the rooms of the Doge, because we didn't stay there. But we did go back to the hotel in the morning for breakfast. We peeked into the rooms and they were small, comfortable looking, but we definately did better in the other place. We ended up having breakfast in their kitchenette area, not the best experience, no where to sit, but at least we got some food and coffee. The mother was very apologetic about \"being fully booked\" (so no problem with hot water), and didn't charge us the additional tax that we should have paid. Which was nice. I liked the look of Doge for a short stay. Great location for the train station, pleasant walk to all the big sights.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThere has to be better places for the money!\u201d", "Author": "zak0 Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR118140612", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights in July 2011. Although the location is a bit out of the way for the main tourist sights it is near the main station and there are plenty of boats. It is a very quite area... Unfortunately the staff were very abrupt. The woman at the reception desk (a counter under the stairs) took to shouting if you couldn't understand what she was saying - going on the premise that louder means clearer... Breakfast was basic to say the least. Served in the room at a time arranged the night before (if they remember - one morning I had to go and ask) - it was a pretty poor affair. Bad coffee and 2 bits of french toast with jam if you were lucky and a stale croissant. The room itself was fine if a little gloomy. The air-con worked great. The shower unfortunately was filthy and mouldy and the water backed up at an alarming rate. More than 4 minutes and the water was up to the lip of the shower tray! There have got to be better places than this to stay in Venice for the price.

We also like to speak the language of the country we are in. Items at the top of our travel list are, in order: 1. cleanliness 2. quiet sleep on decent beds and 3. As non-Tourist-y as possible. We found all that at Hotel Doge. The rooms are very small, but space is used efficiently. We had a queen-sized bed, a wardrobe w/plenty of space to hang clothing, and our own bathroom. All was incredibly clean and the whole place has been recently remodeled. Bathroom fixtures were new, & great shower w/plenty of pressure & hot water. The family is very friendly and helpful. The parents do not speak English but the eldest daughter does and is very present. Continental breakfast is included and served in your room. An added bonus is that this place is only about 10 mins walk from the main train/bus station (Piazzale Roma) and (important to us) far away from the throngs of tourists in San Marco sestiere. It was relatively quiet from about 11 pm to 7 am, and there are many very good trattorias and pizzerias nearby. Plus, it feels like a real neighborhood.

It is near the train station wityh good river bus connections; a fair but enjoyable walk to the main sights.

My booking did not included breakfast which is otherwise served into rooms. Toilet and shower was shared - on the floor, clean and good. Hotel is located nearby railway station, perhaps not most scenic or athospheric part of Venice, but fine anyway. With direction posted on booking sites or hotel website there is no problem to find it.

The air conditioner did not work properly. People were leaving their doors open to their rooms lending a tenement atmosphere to the small hotel. The lights in our very dark room were dim and/or not working. The hotel \"serves\" breakfast but there was no common eating area and the room was so small that one would have had to eat breakfast on the bed; there was simply no table and only one chair for two people.
