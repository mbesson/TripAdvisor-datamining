My husband and I arrived in Bali for a last minute trip down from Jakarta during Idul Fitri and after staying one night in a hotel in busy Kuta, we were desperate to get somewhere more peaceful. We called the Bumi Ayu Bungalows and were excited to hear they had a vacancy. We drove over to check out the accomodations before booking the room and felt like we had walked into paradise the minute we stepped onto the hotel grounds. The gardens are beautiful, lush and relaxing. The pool is great. There are little alcoves around the property to sit and read a book. The staff is very nice and very responsive to the guests. The rooms, while not incredibly fancy, are clean and in good working order. Sitting on the balcony, looking out over the gardens is wonderfully relaxing! The location of the hotel off of the main drag was also very advantageous as we woke up to the sound of birds in the morning, not cars. It was only a short walk to the beach and to a host of good restaurants. In all, we could not have asked for a better spot to spend our brief time in Bali!", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR810468569", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "oceanjennifer"}, {"Content": "Pretty Good The Bumi Ayu may not be as great as some of the other reviews have proclaimed, but its a decent place.

A home from home. Having recently returned from another trip to Bali and just finding this site, here is our quick review of Bumi Ayu, a place where we have been staying at least once each year for the past seventeen years.The staff here are terrific and you're made to feel welcome immediately on arrival with big smiles and a happy welcome home. The facilities, dining room, reading area, games room etc are great and the pool is always spotless.Some rooms are currently in the state of being upgraded to Superior and the Standard rooms are gradually being refurbished. We have stayed with our family in the rooms with the sliding connecting doors mentioned in other reviews on this site and although we agree that it could be a problem with strangers in the next room it is the only set of rooms (three) that have connecting doors. A bit of soundproofing would fix the problem. We will, however, be booking these rooms when we return with our family.The Management and Staff are extremely proud of their hotel and will ALWAYS endevour to make your stay both a comfortable and happy one. We have no hesitation in reccommending Bumi Ayu to any of our friends.", "Date": "May 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR354400978", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Rokace"}, {"Content": "Never again! Having stayed here 2 years ago and our daughter only in Feb 2008, we thought we would stay here again!We all wanted to share a room, my husband and myself and our 20 year old daughter.We were put into a room with 3 single beds with adjoining rooms on either sides, where light could come through, and we were not issued a key as some-one had lostit!The bedspreads were dirty, the toilet ceased to work after 2 flushes, furniture shabby and the place a little scary!.We spoke with management on our arrival which was about 2400 that we would want to upgrade to a double and single bed and we assumed that we would be able to, considering the hotel was far from full. Our Balinese driver spoke with management as well to help clarify our concerns.The next morning and dare I say it was early as our neighbours were obviously smokers and we could hear them coughing through the walls, we went to management.We were told that we could not have a room for the 3 of us as they were unable to put another bed in the rooms as they had been renovated to allow for only one large bed. It was then suggested to us that we could rent 2 rooms at a cost of $140, our original price was $60! We were prepared to go up to $120 but their second best price was again $140!We then decided to check out the other hotels nearby and moved to Bumas Hotel which was great.My cousin and many of his friends who regularly stay at Bumi Ayu over the years will not be staying here anymore, even if they have upgraded.The management''s lack of consideration may be their downfall, so I will never stay here again!", "Date": "May 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR576639269", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Sally307"}, {"Content": "Great holiday       Lovely gardens at Bumi Ayu", "Date": "May 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR356849534", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "shezcayley"}, {"Content": "Nice Alcove off the Beach       Bathroom", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR575891138", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "americanaabroad"}, {"Content": "Highly Recommended We stayed at the Bumi Ayu for five days with our two young children. The two standard rooms overlooking the swimming pool were fairly basic, but comfortable and very clean. There was a single door between our room and the neighboring room which was not well sealed and so we would take the children to the beach at dusk the first days to ensure we did not wake the other guests and also put them to sleep before they returned from dinner. We were relieved when our neighbors told us not to worry as they enjoy getting up early to go for a walk before it gets to hot. The beach in Sanur was disappointing because there was a lot of algae and corral on the beach which made it difficult to play and swim in the water. There was a nice path along the beach to go jogging or for an evening stroll. The children absolutely loved the swimming pool at the Bumi Ayu and we spent many hours there. It was nice meeting the other guests, many of whom had been coming to the Bumi Ayu for years. The children also enjoyed going to the Cheeky Monkey kindergarten (on main road)in the afternoons to play under the supervision of the teachers for a few hours. We greatly enjoyed the breakfast and were surprised to find out that they did not charge extra for room service. The lunch menu was also very good and reasonable prices. We would highly recommend their burgers.The staff at the Bumi Ayu were very kind and accommodating.

I just returned from a 2 week trip from Bali, I stayed in 5 hotels, and this was the only one I disliked! The room was just plain dingy. That's the only way I can describe it. Old shower and bathroom, stained bathroom towels, ugly bedspread, dim and darkly lit room aside from some hideous florescent lighting. I was so disappointed, everything I had read on tripadvisor said how great it was! There were also a lot of european tourists here...so the place clearly has a following...but I cannot understand why! maybe because it's cheap? I paid $40 USD for the room on asiarooms.com, but i should have paid a little more for a better place! Or maybe the deluxe rooms are much, much better, so if you do stay here, its worth it to splurge on a nicer room? The pool area and restaurant I was fine with, the staff was very nice, the breakfast was good...its just the inside of those rooms that is awlful.

I have had the pleasure of going to Bali for the last 12 year and have stayed at Bumi Ayu everytime. I have looked at other hotels in the area but this is just an absolute treaure to be found. I go for 3 weeks a year with my friend Jan who lives in Perth and I live in Darwin. I also have the added advantage of going back sometimes at xmas with my family. The rooms are quite large, roomy, aircond, have TV, fridge and phone. The rooms have private balconies with some looking out over lush tropical well manicured gardens, others over the pool while some look out over a beautiful fish pond. The Nasi Goreng at the restaurant is the best you will get in Sanur and believe me I have tried them all. Afternoon tea is served everyday at the poolbar and the pineapple fritters are to die for. There is a large open air gazebo with table and chairs as well as lounges to lounge on and have a read. There is a large games room above the restaurant, the only problem is it's not aircond so during the hot wet season it can get quite hot and stuffy up there. The staff what can you say about them they are just so friendly and are so happy all the time and are a joy to be around. The only thing I would like to see is ceiling fans on the balconies as it can be quite warm when there is no breeze blowing. Within a 5/10 minute walk from Bumi Ayu you will find superb restaurants as well as markets.

I can\u9225\u6a9b imagine travelling to Bali and not staying at this small immaculately kept hotel. Bumi Ayu offers 58-rooms and is Balinese owned and operated by the family. I've noticed that people are always asking for information about good accommodation, so here are my thoughts on this delightful hotel. Before I go on, I don't work for, or am I associated with any travel agent, hotel or airline. I manage a charity which sponsors student\u9225\u6a9a education in Singaraja. [--]Bumi Ayu Bungalows is set amidst tall, lush tropical gardens which includes loads of birds. The rooms are larger than most hotel rooms. Many have two king sized single beds, a table, two chairs and the usual cupboards and wardrobe and still offer loads of space. The rooms have a TV with both English and Indonesian programs, a phone and the air conditioning is excellent. The rooms, including the bathrooms are spotlessly clean and maintained to a high standard. There are also rooms with a king sized double bed and other rooms which have inter- connecting doors, ideal for larger families. I have usually found during my trips to Bali, that it had been much cheaper to eat away from the hotel. This is not the case at Bumi Ayu Bungalows. The main courses ranged between 15,000 rp and 35,000 rp. I can honestly say the meals are great value, good size servings, freshly cooked and delicious. The breakfast is excellent and very filling, plus room service didn't cost any extra! They offer a massage service, the hotel employs three visually impaired masseurs who have gained their tertiary qualifications in this field. They massage well and a full hour costs around 50,000rp. The swimming pool is a good size, in the centre of the swimming pool an area is set a side for the children. By the pool at 3-30pm each day, coffee, tea and nibbles are served free of charge. This is a great way to relax and enjoy the company of other guests staying at the hotel.To top all this off, I never have to worry about washing my clothes. For just over 10,000 rp my laundry was washed and ironed beautifully by the hotel laundry staff. I have found all the staff to be friendly, caring and nothing ever seems to be too much trouble for them. Oh yes, to all the animal lovers reading this, Bumi Ayu has some resident cats around the property which are healthy and well looked after. I haven't seen that in Bali before. When you check in, you may see my adopted cat which I have named Onie. The Bali Street Dog Fund in Sydney arranged for her to have a badly infected eye removed, had her de sexed and vaccinated. Bumi Ayu Bungalows is situated only a couple of minutes walk to many shops, restaurants and the beach. Really the only thing missing is you!

My family and I stayed at this beautiful hotel for 16 magnificent days from August 18 thru September 2, 2006. We found all the staff to be very courteous, helpful, and they went out of their way to cater to the guest's needs.My seven-year-old son loved the huge swimming pool. As soon as he would wake up, he would brush his teeth, call room service to order his breakfast, and then jump into the pool. As soon as he saw the waiter or waitress bringing his breakfast, he would climb out of the pool and then eat his breakfast out on the patio since he was dripping wet. After breakfast, he would jump back into the pool until the rest of us were ready to set off on new adventures.The rooms were cleaned daily --this included changing the sheets and pillow cases. We always had plenty of towels for showering and for the pool. We stayed in rooms #36 and rooms #37, and we had a great view of the pool. The landscape is so breathtakingly beautiful, and that's that we went during the dry season! My family consisted of four adults, two teenagers, and one child. In one room we had two full beds and two twin beds, and in the other room we had one queen bed and two twin beds. Needless to say, the rooms are very spacious. The bathroom was also very large, and had a good supply of hot running water. The price we paid was $45.00 per night per room and a full American Breakfast for all of us was included in the price. Unlike other hotels that charge approximately this same nightly rate, Bumi Ayu Bungalows did not charge any additional fees for the extra guests staying in the same room.The restaurant was opened from 6am-11pm, and I must say they had a wide selection of meals to offer. I tried several different meals, and they were all very delicious. Their chocolate milk shakes were my favorites! Their food prices are very reasonable, and it was more convenient for us to eat at their restaurant then in the surrounding Sanur area. There is no additional cost to order room service which was a huge plus.Overall, if you are looking to stay at a very moderately-priced hotel with a beautiful and relaxing pool setting, this is the place for you. The rooms are not high on luxury, but the beds are very comfortable, room service is great, and my family and I were able to spend more of our money on tours and SHOPPING! We found the price to be a great deal since it fed the seven of us every morning. For those of you on a budget, and are looking for a nice place to stay, book at the Bumi Ayu bungalows.I was able to make my room reservations by emailing the hotel. The manager, Mr. Mayura, was always very nice and helpful by answering all my questions and responding to my emails in a very quick manner. There is so much to be said about this lovely place, that anybody wanting further information can email me directly at sandia_rodriguez@hotmail.comSandy R.", "Date": "Sep 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR146395718", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Sandiajjr"}, {"Content": "We will return       Home Sweet Home", "Date": "Jan 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR294323534", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BaliMist"}, {"Content": "A lovely small friendly hotel Our 12th visit to this little oasis in paradise; we would not stay anywhere else in Bali. We have met people from all over the world here, many of whom have become friends and, like us, are repeat guests. The gardens and pool are lovely, and the bungalows large and airy with a private patio for each one. The meals at the hotel restaurant are excellent; the quality and presentation being superior to the majority of the cafe's nearby. The staff are very special and have become personal friends of ours, hence it is always a sad day when we have to return home. We would recommend Bumi Ayu Bungalows as a wonderful friendly place to stay in Bali.", "Date": "Sep 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR430346689", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Liebevoll umsorgt im Bumi Ayu       Der Ruhepavillion", "Date": "May 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR846904336", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Ida77"}, {"Content": "Klein aber Fein       Dienst am Hausaltar", "Date": "Aug 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR260237422", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lenca"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d450825-r20812447-Bumi_Ayu_Bungalows-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "450825", "Price": "$45"}}
