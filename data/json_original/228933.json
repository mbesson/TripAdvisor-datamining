Hotel Lobby was nice, room less so. Our room was on the 5th floor but the lift only goes to the 4th floor so you have to use the stairs to reach it. Our room was small but clean. Biggest problem was that the floor of the bathroom is about 3 inches higher than the bedroom floor which is somewhat hazardous. The shower is also very small and entry would be difficult for a larger person. Breakfast was first class - lots of variety and the waiters kept the food coming. Sounds like reviews depend upon the room that they were assigned. Definitely avoid the 5th floor which makes it more of a 2 or 3 star experience than a 4 star.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nottingham", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel, nice location\u201d", "Author": "nottmmike", "ReviewID": "UR128425769", "Content": "This is a hotel coverted from three old buildings situated directly on the Canale Grande just down from the railway station, so a hotel with character.

It's worth walking over the bridge by the railway station and looking over the water at the hotel. At first our bedroom on the 3rd floor seemed small, but we later appreciated the large size of the bed with 2 independent mattresses. It was made up with sheets, a blanket and a lightweight cover with another blanket, a heavier cover and extra pillows in the wardrobe. The fridge was full and could not therefore be used for personal supplies. We found our own miniboiler useful for making hot drinks. Storeage was very good with large wardrobes and plenty of drawer space. There was also one large table, a dressing table, several chairs and a television with good picture quality. The bathroom was fully tiled and had modern fitments with large towels, changed daily. Near our bedroom was a small outdoor area with shrubs, that would be cooler during hot.weather, although it had a street and not a canal view. Staff at Reception were pleasant and efficient, but waiters in the dining room at breakfast, concentrated on replenishing the food at the buffet and provided no service. You had to find your own table and then get cutlery etc. There was a good choice of cereals, of bread rolls and especially of croissants, one plain and two containing jam and honey. The cooked food was under covers and the bacon was apparently good. The breakfast times are from 6.30 to 10 am and, at busy times, the small adjoining room was opened. This was much quieter. We did not dine in the hotel, as we found the prices off putting. The cheapest main course was chicken at 16 euros, while the tasting menu, advertised outside the front door, was 50 euros for meat and 60 for fish. Just across the road is Brek Ristorante, where young people and families eat, as well as tourists. Go to the counter right inside, if you want pasta dishes and they will be heated while you wait. There are also plenty of restaurants near the hotel, offering tourist menus.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoke-on-Trent", "Title": "\u201cIdeal Location\u201d", "Author": "goldenoldie46", "ReviewID": "UR127834089", "Content": "The hotel is only 5 minutes from Ferrovia so makes it ideal for getting from the bus or train station if you're not great at wheeling your suitcase through the streets.

Okay so back to the hotel- it is very clean so hats off to the chambermaids. Breakfast is continental although there are boiled and scrambled eggs as well fried parma ham. This being Venice they also do a range of brioche and a good fruit salad. If you like black coffee american style press expresso on the coffee maker and then place your cup under the hot water nozzle. If you ask for a room overlooking the canal it can get noisy with the water buses and other traffic. There is a terrace overlooking the canal so order an aperitivo and watch the world go by.

It was really easy to find with shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. The hotel is in a word stunning. The lobby, hotel bar, dining room and terrace are beautiful and the view is to die for. The staff at reception were courteous and polite, not the most friendly of people for sure but nice enough. The breakfast as other people have mentioned in reviews is lovely with a wide variety and plenty of it! Another plus point was that it was served from 6.30-10.30am so suitable for early birds and late risers alike. The only reason I couldn't give a 5 rating was that the room was a litle bit of a let down. Upon entering our room (507) I felt a little betrayed as the elegance and beauty of the downstairs in the hotel had not reached our room. The room was a little on the small side and I found that it if you need to shave your legs in the shower you need to open the doors and stick your leg out of the shower as there was not enough room inside! There was also an exposed pipe and the carpet was looking rather tired. Almost like a hotel of two halves- downstairs was a lovely four star hotel upstairs in the room i stayed in 2/scraping 3 stars. BUT.. that said for the price I paid I shouldn't grumble too much, besides who spends very long in a hotel room when you are in the most beautiful city in the world. I think I was just a little disappointed having seen pictures of other rooms and the downstairs of the hotel that my room did not live up to those expectations. I had a view of the rooftops of houses which to be honest is all I paid for and nice enough. If you can afford it I would pay for a better room and a canal view however if you are just looking for a well located hotel with somewhere to rest for the night then a standard room in this hotel is perfect! I visited in April and can only imagine how lovely it would be to sit out on the terrace in the evening in the summer. I would return to this hotel and recommend it to friends just bear in mind if you pay for a standard room don't expect to see a room like the ones shown on their website.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton", "Title": "\u201cA lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lucy_LouBrighton", "ReviewID": "UR127318093", "Content": "The hotel is only a few minute's walk from the station facing the canal.

Not a happy experience. First impressions of lobby and lounge are reasonable but upstairs decor is scruffy and tired and rooms look as if they haven't been refurbished for at least thirty years. I paid a supplement for a single room. The first room I was offered (201) was so small that there was nowhere to put my suitcase. Very reluctantly and under some pressure from our tour rep I was offered another room (224), nominally a double, which was better but only just. Small double bed pushed up against wall with wardrobe at end meaning person on inside unable to get in/out. The bed was hard as were the pillows and bedding barely adequate (ancient blanket plus satin counterpane) though room was clean. Fellow travelers were also unhappy with their rooms - noisy if overlooking street at front, smelly if overlooking central courtyard. From 8.00am onwards the breakfast room was pandemonium - nowhere to sit and staff unable to clear tables fast enough. Breakfast adequate but only just - cheap orange juice, tinned pineapple etc. Hotel may have canal side location but it was impossible to book a table on the terrace for dinner for any of the four nights of our stay because of \"corporate reservations\" which seemed to mean that most of the tables were empty most of the time. In addition, the quality of the breakfasts didn't inspire much confidence in the competence of the kitchen. This hotel is in the business of turning around as many package tours as fast as possible. Definitely not a good choice for the independent (or, indeed, any) traveler. The Grand Canal is such a dominant presence in Venice that you don't need to stay in a canal-side hotel to enjoy/experience it. Best feature of this hotel was its location close to Ferrovia vaporetti stop, a major interchange, outside the station. However, overall this hotel did not come close to the expectations created by its 3 star rating. Next time I go to Venice I shall look for a small, independent hotel in a back street away from the main drag of which there are many.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cDeluxe Hotel on the Grand Canal with friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "mefixer", "ReviewID": "UR126902472", "Content": "Spent a three day weekend at the hotel and found it to be a clean, well cared for establishment.

That incident aside everyone else was very nice and helpful. The breakfasts are sumptuous and if get there early enough you can actually get a table right on the Grand Canal. The Hotel is convenient to the train station and all the water buses. It is closer to the entrance in to the town than to St. Marks, so it is a fair walk to get to the great square (very nice). The hotel is also near the Jewish Ghetto and all its sights. The hotel d\u00c3\u00a9cor could be classified as slightly antiquated opulence and it takes a while to get used to all the heavy drapes and plush carpets. We took the free water taxi offered by the hotel to the Island of Merano, but the down side is that they leave you off in one of the more expensive glass factories. Once they realize you are not interested in buying they give you the old heave-ho and you have to fend your own way back to town. Still speeding along in the water taxi was quite fun.

Again you have the choice of the Alliguna for about 7-9 Euro per person and was available near the train station.

We really couldn't have been happier with this Hotel. It really went beyond our expectations. And all of this for a really fair price! When we come back, we surely will stay here again!

I enjoyed the entire tour of Italy and there is no bad location, each destination has its own unique footprint. We had a bit of luck in Venice in that our hotel room looked out onto the Grand Canal. We stayed in the Venice Principe on the first floor. Oh my goodness - how exciting to have the view of the Grand Canal. Dinner was not included on 9/20/10 so we found a grocery store in Venice, purchased a cooked pizza, wine, appetizer and dessert - returned to our room - opened the windows and proceeded to watch traffic as we ate dinner. In writing this I suppose this could sound quite strange. Really - who watches traffic while eating dinner on purpose and for fun? Rhetorical question there. The Principe hotel staff were delightful and helpful. The hotel room comfortable, clean and the view spectacular. We had three windows from the bedroom and one from the bathroom. Deep silled windows allowed you to put your drink/food down to take more pictures The view again, amazing even from the bathroom. One of our friends overslept and her luggage was late getting out for pickup, well the male hotel staff responsible for taking the luggage saw she was upset at oversleeping, he started to sing to her. It was wonderful to watch as with his singing he attempted to calm her down. Also in Venice we took a Gondola ride. The Gondola ride was relaxing and most enjoyable although I sneezed (somewhat loud) and startled our driver who made a comment - I have no idea what the comment was however the tone of his voice made me laugh and I had the shoulder/body shakes which probably didn't help him to steer. He did great though. St, Marks square and Basilica is remarkable, lovely and fascinating. The history is amazing. We toured Doge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s palace, Murano glass factory, the Bridge of Sigh's and had a boat ride over to Burano for lunch and shopping. Looking back it went all so fast.

He offered us some welcome drinks instead. We refused the 'Welcome Drinks' and strongly insisted to stay in Principe. So the manager told us to compare the rooms between Principe and the other one's. We were very angry and were directed to 2 horrible rooms in Principe (hot and no decoration inside) , my husband went with their staff to the hotel they offered and didn't like the rooms too. I asked the manager's name, but in return he asked me 'WHY', (what a so called 4 stars hotel), I asked for his name card he didn't give to me, he asked me what have I decided (Impossible!!)

We took the water bus Orange Line (Line #1) to Guglie stop (2nd stop) and then you get off, walk about 500 mtrs, turn right and cross overtop of bridge you see directly in front of you from the bus stop From there keep walking straight (or as straight as you can down the meandering foot alley of shops and stores, about 2-3 min walk tops) and Hotel Principe main entry is on your left hand side. Really nice to arrive quickly without much hassle at this hotel after long overnight flights. This was one of my concerns was ending up walking for a long distance once off the stop. So location is great. If coming from the train station you turn left out of train station and walk straight down footpath about 2 minutes. The hotel has a water taxi stop out front. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice much taxi business (cars or water taxis) on departure from the airport to here. Despite many online sites offering water taxis at 190 euros one-way, there is a depot at the airport where you can pick up the water taxis for 95euro one-way. Water bus (roundtrip was 25 euro/pers). Not bad, takes about 25 mins to get into town due to slowwwwww speeds, canal is shallow enroute to Venice Island so speeds kept a bit slower to avoid grounding out. Hotel also offers free tours to Murano island glass factories if you so desire to go there. Hotels nearby: Hotel Zecchini, Bellini, Dei Dogi, Hotel Nazionale and Hotel Belle Eopque. Hotel Adua (think its closed), Guerrini, Continental We had a superior double (2 twins pretty much always make a double in Italy), overlooking the alleyway of markets and shops down below. Obviously canal view are next price level, but there is non-stop movement on the canal day and until about 10pm, so choose your location wisely. Windows are very soundproof, only could hear foot traffic below if you open your window, otherwise completely silent. I am certain this would be the same on the canal side also. Room is quite ample size compared to some I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in during visits to Italy and Europe. Bathroom, while sparkling clean was on the small side (take out the bidet maybe!!, move the toilet and have a full size shower/bath rather than a corner shower stall. Just a thought) Breakfast was good, with lots of meats/cheezes, cereals, grapefruit & orange juice, and frizzante water (sparkling) also coffees and teas. Fresh fruits to choose from, plain and fruit, yogurt. Internet cost: Internet on TV (24 unlimited use: 6 euros), Internet on laptop (1 hour: 6 euros), 24 hours: 15 euros, and 24 hours internet and 24 hours unlimited movies: 25 euros. Downside: Beds had minimal blankets and we found the room COLD most days in Feb (while we were in Venice for Carnival). Turning on heat wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work in last 2 days as it would stay on only 10 minutes max) Today took the water bus (Line #1) down to St Marks Square and Doges Palace then walked to Bridge of Sighs. Then walked back to Rialto Bridge (takes 15 minutes by map). From Rialto Bridge to Hotel Principe takes 25 minutes (leisurely walk). Would recommend taking the bus line down and cruise the grand canal as its very pretty/picturesque seeing all the houses and gondolas. Cost 6.50euro per way for #1 line, or 13 euro roundtrip. 12 hour cost 16 euro, and 24 cost 18 euro. Marco Polo Bar: Nice smallish room with interior room as well. Venice to Treviso airport. Buses run from Piazzale Roma which is just past the train station and over the bridge, maybe about 6 minutes walk from the Hotel Principe. Bus run time from Piazzale Roma to Treviso is about 50 minutes. Cost (6 euro per person) Buses also run from Marco Polo airport (Blue buses) Front desk staff are wonderfully helpful, offering maps and directions, as well as warm cannoli (sweets) upon arrival (YUM).

The water taxi stop is right down the street but it is pricey and takes a long time to go around the canal to get to the main tourist area. By foot, it is a very long and confusing walk. This is plus if you really want to see Venice but if you just want to be in the heart of the tourism action stay somewhere closer to the Square. The hotel was ideal for us as we flew into Venice airport and the bus stop is a very short walk over a bridge to the hotel. We did not have to spend the $80 dollars for a water taxi from the airport. We only stayed one night and took the train out to Florence so it was great to be one block from the train station with all our bags. The hotel's location really saved us quite a bit of money as Venice is very expensive for public transport, especially from the airport. The rate for the hotel and what you get was also excellent compared to others. So, if you do not mind walking or taking the water taxi around (there is a pass you can buy that is good for 24 hours for $16) and want a very nice hotel outside the tourist area this is the one.

Friends who were put in a similar position taking a water taxi from their hotel were shown the back door at Murano to make their own way home once they made it clear they would not purchase . BEWARE AND BE CAREFUL - at the point of purchase they say they cannot use your Mastercard (which would give you protection) and want cash or switch. Best idea is to take the offer of boat 2/3/4 day tickets and make your own way round all the attractions as the waterboats are frequent and go everywhere.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tyne and Wear", "Title": "\u201cAmazing location\u201d", "Author": "J_on_tour1", "ReviewID": "UR23204508", "Content": "The decor in the foyer was very good with a welcome to match.

It was interesting to watch the market trader, binman and ambulance go past the window by means of boat! Breakfast was plentiful and nothing to complain about although i'm not sure how the coffee machines would stand up to the huge crowds in the summer. It seemed a full time job for one staff member on the first morning. We managed to get a good meal nearby just up the street opposite the bridge. This was also the stop for the waterbus for which we had a travelticket for the time we were there. It was good to stay at this location as the centre of venice would possibly have been more difficult to access with suitcases and the boat trip in each day was spectacular anyway. We were asked on departure whether we wanted to leave our cases which was a nice touch because usually i find its the other way around.

The hotel is very close to the train station, this saves a lot of hassle with luggage if you arrive by train. The back of the hotel does face the grand canal (the hotel faces it, but NOT all of the rooms, see more on this). There is a vaporetto stop fairly close by. The hotel has a nice lobby and a variety of rooms, our AC worked OK. There is a nice restaurant on the first floor. The free morning breakfast is good. A bar next door serves drinks and has a piano bar (more on this). The rooms are fine, decent bathrooms and overall was clean, but......the real scene at this hotel is during our stay was the terrible way people were treated by the front desk staff. They did not assign us to the room category we paid for, then tried repeatedly to get us to accept even lesser rooms. When we asked for what we paid for (100 euros extra per night for the canal view other reviewers raved about). the staff argued, misled us about room views (saying rooms with terraces had no view at all - untrue - only ours didn't) and made us go back and forth to different rooms, each worse then the other. It was a completely unecessary hostile game that seemed to be going on with many guests staying that weekend. Each time we pased by someone at the front desk was chewing out a guest. The theme appeared to be the same - people not getting the room categories they had paid for, then getting verbally roughed up by the staff. Once we accepted (at some point you just give up) and got settled into a different category room that was not what we paid for, we asked for the rate to also be changed and they said no, they still charged for the highest priced room category, there was no geting anywhere with them. While you try not to let staff ruin your stay, it did affect us and we heard from other guests who experienced the same so we knew it wasn't just us. All that aside, a few other letdowns. We wanted to experience the fun piano bar we read about but never hapened, the bartender was hardly ever there and no one ever showed to play. We were told we could have breakfast on the patio by the canal but at breakfast when we asked they said we were not allowed at the tables outside, only inside in the dining room. When we did venture out, we found ourselves mostly in the Rialto/St Marks area, which required daily vaporetto rides, so if I went back I would probably choose a hotel closer to this area than the train station. Would rather lug the luggage once then have to deal with the vaporettos 3-4 times a day. If you really want to go to this hotel, I would suggest booking the best rate available and not getting caught up in the battle and price for a \"canal view\" room, just take whatever they give you and don't argue. If you must, the prize rooms are 123 and 122, and they know this and probably won't give them to you, but go ahead and ask, you never know.

A room overlooking the Grande Canal, if you are prepared to pay the extra charge, is a definite must, especially if you can get a balcony. Full size balconies are few and far between, and there are a couple of Romeo and Juliet balconies. If you can score a full size balcony overlooking the Grande Canal (we had one in Room 122) that's the best scenario. But the hotel falls short with the rooms being tired, carpet threadbare, and the like. Strangely, however, the bathroom was completely updated and while indeed wonderful, made the room feel that much more out of sync. The breakfast room was fine as was the food. Vaporetto (water bus) stations nearby at the railway station are a good thing. But the location of the hotel near the train station means that you must be prepared for a long walk or a lengthy water bus ride to all major attractions save and except for the neighbouring Ghetto which is a must-see. Was able to book dinner at Restaurant Vini da Gigio on the restaurant's web site before leaving for Italy, and highly recommend this wonderful restaurant which is in the Ghetto area. Hotel Principe is satisfactory for one or two nights, but not more. If your goal is to be close to the railway station because you have to catch a train in a day or two, or if you have lots of luggage and do not want to travel all through Venice to reach your hotel, or if you have disability issues, or if you are concerned about poor weather or late night arrivals, then this is the hotel for you because you walk on land (no water involved at all) to get between the railway station and the hotel. If you do not want to take the vaporetto, the hotel has a private docking facility from which you can order a water taxi, albeit at a much higher expense than the vaporetto.

I booked 2 rooms, one for my wife and I, the other for the children. I have mixed feelings about the Principe Hotel. The positives: Superb location with regards to getting in and out of Venice by rail or by airport bus. The railway station is 200m from the hotel and the Piazzale Roma (where the buses leave from to go to Treviso and Marco Polo airports) is a 10 minute walk away. Very clean hotel. Ground floor pleasantly decorated in typical venetian style. Dining room is lovely with a view accross the Grand Canal. In the warmer weather one would be able to eat out on the veranda which would be lovely place to sit and while away the time. There was plenty of choice at breakfast and the food was of excellent quality. The staff were impeccably dressed. The Negatives: If you want to vist the popular tourist areas, i.e Rialto and St Mark's Square then you will need to go by waterbus, otherwise you will have a good 45 minute/1 hour walk to do respectively, which is OK the first time you do it. A couple of points about transport: not once did we have our ticket checked on the waterbuses, which I found quite astonishing. This also was the case when we visited Venice 3 years ago. The dishonest could quite easily get around Venice for free! Be aware of the \"free\" private water taxi to Murano from the hotel. You get ushered into the factory for a demonstration of glass making and get pestered by a salesman from the glass factory when you arrive. Having been there and done that before on a previous trip, we managed to escape without spending our hard earned at that particular establishment. We were allocated rooms 301 and 302. The view from these rooms were appalling - see photographs. I asked at reception if we could be given alternative rooms which didn't have blank walls, drainpipes, guttering and TV aerials as the main vista. I was told that to do this we would have to up-grade our rooms at a cost of 60 Euros per night and per room! I declined this offer and had to put up with the rooms allocated. This matter is being taken up with www.superbreak.com with whom we booked. The accomodation was fairly expensive and these rooms didn't justify the price paid. The beds in the rooms were so hard that it felt as if one was sleeping on a bed of rock. The temperature control system didn't work properly in either room. The children's room was unbearably hot and ours slightly chilly. This wasn't fixed by the end of our stay. The bathrooms were the smallest I have ever seen in an hotel. I would estimate that they measured no more than 7'x5'. In that small space they crammed in a toilet, bidet, wash basin and the smallest shower enclosure that you could wish for. With regards to the latter, it was of the quadrant style being approximately 2'6\" at it's widest. I am of average build and I could hardly move within the shower enclosure without knocking the shower tap on and off, or knocking it from side to side which altered the temperature from freezing cold to scalding! Goodness knows how any one of bigger bulid would manage - they would be lucky to be able to shut the door! Needless to say there wasn't a bath present, which is disgraceful for a 4 star hotel. Considering the fact that the hotel is not situated in a prime location, I found it to be poor value for money and not up to the quoted 4 star standard. I would advise anyone considering to book the hotel to ensure that they book rooms in advance which have decent views and facilities befitting a 4 star hotel. I would consider the bedrooms we had to be of 2 star standard at most. Finally, don't expect many smily faces at the hotel. The staff are generally abrupt and have an air of arrogance about them. We only met one member of staff who was cheerful and that was one of the male receptionists who was very pleasant on each occasion we saw him. I personally wouldn't want to stay at the Principe Hotel again. It was quite honestly disappointing.

I really didn't require any assistance from the hotel staff, so I cannot comment except they were very pleasant. They give you these very heavy keys to your room, so every time you go out, you have to drop it at the front desk. The location, I thought was great. It was on a lively street, close to the Train Station and Rialto bridge right on the Grand Canal. There were several shops and restaurants close by.

It's easily located while you travel on a vaporetto as it is smack on the Grand Canal, perhaps a 2 minute walk, if that, from the Rialto Bridge and its vaporetto stop. It's classified as a 4-star on the website I booked it through, and the lobby is certainly beautiful- marble floors, oriental rugs- everything polished and immaculate. There was a nice sitting area with sofas, chairs and tables upholstered in burgundy velvet, and the front desk area was impressive. The front desk staff were not terribly impressive, but quickly checked me in and pointed me in the direction of the elevator. Nobody offered to carry my bag. Note to those who aren't fond of trekking long distances: 1) don't come to Venice as you do basically everything on foot or via boat, 2) don't book a hotel room here without making sure you can get a room close to the elevator door because by the time I got to my room (at the end of a VERY long, winding hallway, which included the occasional handful of stairs), I was literally winded (it was especially unpleasant to negotiate while intoxicated later on during the trip). I couldn't figure out how to open the room- it had a long key and what I figured out later was a magnetic block of some sort attached to it. Nobody had told me how to operate the door. I presumed one used the key- yet the key didn't open it. After fumbling for a couple of minutes an employee saw me struggling and stormed over. Confused as to why he was coming at me the way he was, as I hadn't asked him for help, I said 'hello?'. He mimicked, 'hello?' in a nasty tone of voice. At this point, after a long flight, a long walk from the airport to the Alilaguna, and with a very heavy backpack on my back- I was cranky and sure as heck didn't need his attitude problem. 'Can I help you?' I said, still unsure of what he was doing. 'Can I help you?' he parroted back nastily, took the keys out of my hand and unceremoniously smacked the magnetic block up against the side of the door on a certain area, which activated the lock and opened the door. I muttered a thank you, but he stormed off without a word. Most inappropriately handled! I entered the room. It was a single and, as I expected for European standards, was tiny. The bed was decent but not up to what I thought a 4-star would have. It contained a very small TV, small writing desk and chair, an armoire and a window with a glorious view of nothing. At least it was quiet. There was no bathtub (I expected this, though), only a shower (with lots of hot water, thank goodness). It was very clean and decorated oddly/sparcely. Pastels and neutrals were primarily used and I can't say it was a terribly attractive room, but it could have been much worse. Since I visited in the winter, the air conditioning was never used so I'm not sure how up to par it would have been should I have needed it. I tried making a call to the U.S... there was a card on my table with instructions on how to do so, and followed the directions given... and could not get through. I tried several times before calling the front desk. They say 'follow the directions on your table'. I say 'I did', and at that point they were out of ideas. I went out and ran the errands I had to run. Later on the evening I tried to call again, only I went downstairs and made the call in front of the front desk staff so they could assist me- they could not get the call to go through either. One man did offer an alternate phone number to try, but that didn't work either. At that point I gave up. Breakfast- I slept through breakfast the first morning and only had time to grab a croissant the second. It was stale. Overall the Principe served its purpose, but I would not recommend it for anyone who has hopes of booking a room with amenities exceeding those of an American Best Western with an extra-nice lobby, or the like.

Apparently if you open up ANY window or door slightly in the room, the AC is on sensor to turn off (in which it barely works anyhow.) Not knowing this I go to the front desk to ask about it, and they have all the rooms tapped and know according to which room you are which windows and doors are open. So at this point we learned to keep everything closed, however when the maid comes in every day thereafter and she intentionally keeps the balcony door open just enough so its not noticeable but also just enough to have the AC automatically turn off all day. So after a long hot day of walking around Venice, we come into a room that was very hot and we didn't at first understand why.

Its 2 minutes from the train station or 10 from the bus station which makes it easy to find. I'd prefer not too stay in a place too close to San Marco square. First because its too touristy and second because it would be a lot harder to find once you arrive on the island! The room we stayed in was room 207 which is right at the front of the hotel on the street. I presume there are better rooms in the hotel as we would have been given essentially the overflow rooms as we came from the Gardena. However, it was big and spacious and there were no problems with it. Even though it was on the street there was no noise whatsoever even with a club across the street. This was due to the incredibly soundproofed windows. A bomb could go off outside and you wouldn't know it! Being in a room on the street was actually great as you could open the full length windows onto a small balcony. The shower was also great and the room was very clean and comfortable. Would stay there again. One thing to note about Venice restaurants. For people that must rely heavily on tourism, they really don't give much of a damn about their customers unless they are Italian. This obviously isn't true of all places but of the 7 or 8 places we ate in, most of them were very unfriendly and service was woeful. All restaurants charge you a cover charge per person, usually about 1.50. This is supposed to cover the bread they bring you. In the majority of cases we were not brought any bread yet were still charged the cover. It just seemed to us that the locals had been brought their bread while the tourists weren't.", "Date": "August 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cImpressive\u201d", "Author": "holiguru", "ReviewID": "UR3767068", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Principe last November and found the hotel really impressive.

Nice to sit on the canal side by entrance to hotel with a drink after a long day discovering Venice.

The staff were expecting us, and were friendly and helpful with the exception of the \"piano\" bar. Upon opening the door to our \"450 euro a night during high season\" room (of course we payed far less in the winter), a wall of mildew stench slammed into us. I assumed the canal or the air inside the room was at fault, and opened the large balcony windows. No use- the carpeting (unusual for Italian hotels) was completely mildew infested, and stunk like you would not believe. If you moved any of the furniture from it's position on the carpet, a tell-tale carpet discoloration would display the outline of the carpet protected by the furniture versus the exposed nasty carpet. Aside from the constant olfactory assault, the room was quite nice. Spacious, large bathroom, white towel robes, and a great balcony with a tremendous view. Minus the smell, I would have rated this place a FOUR STAR place. Downstairs, the hotel offered a \"piano\" bar and complementary breakfast the next day in another large room. This \"piano\" bar is worth skipping, unless you want to suffer the pains of the untalented hack keyboardist working in the lounge butchering classic 70's American rock tunes. Seriously- American Idol blooper clips offer more talent. The service was terribly slow, and the drinks were double the price of what drinks in any of the local establishments outside charged. Also- there is no piano. Perhaps the bar should be renamed \"Casio keyboard and positively dreadful Kareoke bar?\" Breakfast was a treat, as the hotel caters to American and European tastes- scrambled eggs alongside cold cuts and yogurt, plently of cereals and fruit. A delightful dining experience. Around the hotel are several restaurants within 100 meters, some offering fixed menus (menu turistico) while others did not. The several we ate at were overall excellent, and this hotel's location right near the train station and vaporette (water taxi) stop on the Grand Canal are big pluses.
