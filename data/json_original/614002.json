Great location on 20th street across from Phillips. One block walk to the ocean. --the Pool area-- Dirty fountain in the pool area. Lovely shade of light brown water. Broken lounge chairs in the pool area. Right where your butt would sit, there are not slats on the chairs. Dead plants in the pool area. Large and clean pool. The tables and chairs are a mismatch, umbrellas are somewhat tattered. Empty planters are used as ashtrays. Smoker friendly. --perimeter of the hotel-- Needs sweeping. Trash, debris, cigarette butts, etc...general litter. --The motel itself, the room-- First thing I noticed was the wood on the door near the locks, it appeared as if it had been broken into by the cops or someone wanted in real bad. Chunks of wood missing. The room was cool, functional AC. I saw no bugs. Maid service was a joke. Towels scarce, bring your own. The linens were dated and the maid doesn't make beds well. No fitted sheets and she doesn't know how to do hospital corners. Prepare to remake your bed. No carpet, just bare floor tile and that's ok if it was clean. Wear your flip flops while walking. There was a stove in our room. Electric and rusty on the top. Inside the cabinets were pots and pans, but the cabinets were filthy, so wash the pots and pans WELL before you use them. Best if you don't attempt it. Wood paneling on the walls circa 1970. Mismatched light fixtures. Broken lampshades. Poor choice of tv channels. Remote didn't work and had no back over the batteries. We found the remote on day 2 under the bed. Under the bed...belongings that didn't belong to us. The maid doesn't clean under the bed. Table and 4 mismatched chairs of various shapes and sizes. NO WATER PRESSURE to speak of for a shower. Dated and difficult to use faucets, especially graduating between hot and cold. Windows could use a good washing. Marked and spotty. Bathroom could use a really good scrubbing. The entire room could have benefitted from a bleach bath. Drawers in the dresser were broken and fell off the track. Just leave your things in a bag please. No hospitality at all whatsoever. No wifi signal to speak of even though it is clearly stated 'free wifi'. The best part about this motel was the pier and the docks, which you can go crabbing or fishing off of. The kids loved that and feeding the ducks that swam in there.

While the room was fairly clean, there were a few things that I would recommend they fix. There were very few outlets in this room. We had to decide between watching TV and having a light on. I also had to dry my hair in the kitchen area. Our toilet was very wobbly so it was difficult to sit on (especially my young children), the tub did not have a stopper so my 5 year old had to take a shower (which she hates!), the shower did not have a shower head, just a pipe coming out of the wall with very low water pressure to get the sand off. I would recommend you bring your own towels since they only give you tiny ones that barely cover a body. The dead bolt on the door did not work and the door barely fits into the jam so everyone would slam their doors to get them closed. The pool was in very bad condition, broken tiles, non working fountain, etc. This motel is also on the bay side so you do have to walk across Coastal Highway to get to the beach.

There's a good reason this hotel has low prices. I read the other reviews and yes, the rooms are not clean. There were some unidentifiable purple stains on the shower surround and the molding (really) along the floor in the bathroom was mildewed. The air conditioner had a puddle under it on the floor inside the room. After asking where the ice machine was (the guy behind the office counter said \"I dunno\"), we found it alongside the building and in pieces. We had to buy ice down the block for the whole week. I was pleasantly surprised to actually find a working refrigerator in the room. The Direct TV fritzed out on and off for the whole week. The wi-fi signal was also pretty weak and we were told that the best place to use it was in the office. (lol) The \"spa\" next to the pool looks as though it hasn't working in quite some time and there were beer cans sitting on the wall along side it that were there for the whole week. Fresh towels were handed to us at our door every day, although we opted out of having anyone service our room at cleaning time. Gotta say, this is not the worst room we've stayed in. It was bad, but not the worst. If you really need a place to stay and are severely budget minded and don't mind quite a few compromises, this could be the place for you. The \"cheese factor\" alone made this a memorable stay. I wouldn't stay here again, but we survived and no one got sick or anything. The only thing that really made us unhappy about our stay was the family staying in the room directly over us. These animals must've been raised by wolves and this had to be their first foray into civilization. We could hear voices of children between the screams of their parents to \"shut up!!\". The kids sounded under 10 years old. This family would come back to their room somewhere from 11:30 pm to 5 am, and immediately start running across the floor, jump up and down and yell at each other.

We had reserved a efficiency room so much to our surprise when we found 1 fork, 1 knife, 1 plate, 2 cups and a unplugged refrigerator. The carpet was filthy, there was something black on the ceiling above the door not to mention the room above us, their plumbing was leaking right over one of our beds. You could also hear every footstep in the room above. The bed consisted of a 4\" thick foam mattress but unless you wanted to sleep on the filthy carpet thats what you were stuck with. Our toilet leaked in the bathroom which led to the carpet being soaked as it leaked out of the bathroom. Just please do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to stay somewhere else.

I also attempted to ask for my money back and again \"no refunds.\" The front desk people were nice but not nice enough where they wanted to give me my money back. Oh There are no phones in the rooms! I found that to be odd. My daughter one night was walking in the room barefooted and when I asked her to show me her feet they were BLACK!! We walked in the rooms the whole time with our flip flops on. Good thing I brought my own sheets and pillow cases.

We had to waste our vacation time doing it ourselves. 3) We were to have a pool side room. Instead they put us in the blighted section of their establishment which happens to be bayside. 4) Our rooms were extremely dark and dingy. Lights did not all work. Were actually falling apart. 5) Did not service our room after the first nights stay. Actually never serviced it while we were there. When we asked for towels they asked us to bring down the old ones. There were many people having numerous problems. People were being shuffled around between rooms. Overbooking is one thing but not servicing your customers is unacceptable.

Truth is, they had booked all the rooms and did not check with their web-site provider. Their excuse \"they are suppose to fax us your confirmation and they didn't\" Like we are responsible for their inefficiency. They suggested us two nearby dirty and ugly motels, that later on i found out are owed by the same family that owns the islander. My boyfriend and I after a 71/2 drive had to go around ocean city looking for a decent place to stay. Fortunally we stop at the ocean mecca who happily accomodated us with a very clean room. Our stay there was the best. Personallyh i think they over book their most decent motel to get their nasty ones to get desperate people like us.
