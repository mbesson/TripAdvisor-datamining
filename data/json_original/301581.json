It's right in the downtown Singapore business district and convenient to shopping areas. It is suitable for business travelers and that's about 90% of the people who stay here. We were here for a trade show at the Singapore Expo, and it's a good 20 minute cab ride away. The rooms are in need of some updating. There's a nice large flat screen TV, but everything else in the room is dated. Bed is comfortable. The service at the Fairmont is really good, all staff are friendly and helpful. My favorite is the older gentleman who opens the door to Prego each morning. Always a smile and wave! Oh and yes, that's one of the best breakfast buffets around. Do go here, not to the poolside buffet. The hotel is attached to the Raffles City mall and is right about the MRT for easy transportation. It's also across the street from the Raffles Hotel (home of the overpriced Singapore Sling) and Chijmes (great walking around/restaurant options). For a more relaxing/holiday trip, I'd suggest a different hotel out of the central business area. In particular, the pool area is really small as they have to share it with the Swissotel. Again, great service but the rooms are just average.

Only the rather small pool (shared with the neighbouring Swissotel Stamford - so 2000 rooms in total) lets it down.

The top of marina bay is worth doing but try and go up early in the day otherwise it gets full and you are limited to walking around a very small area at one end. The wheel is good, and if you have younger children the fire station has open doors on Saturday morning - good fun for the kids.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGold star\u201d", "Author": "DEK007", "ReviewID": "UR127304465", "Content": "This Fairmont lived up to the hotel's reputation.

The concierge of the hotel (especially Shareen) was excellent and the rest of the staff from the morning breakfast to reception were exceptional.

It's one of those famous international hotel names that just begs you to go there and be impressed. Sadly, in my most recent stay at the Fairmont Singapore, I was very disappointed with the hotel facilities. Let me expalin. For those of you who don't know this location, it's a relatively recent addition to the Fairmont chain of wonderful hotels that are sprinkled lightly around the globe. I've stayed at a number of their other inns, and they were first rate - so let's focus on the Sngapore one, as it's the topic of this review. The Singapore Fairmont started out as The Plaza, linked to the famous NYC Plaza hotel of \"Sex in the City\" and \"The Way We Were\" fame. It was later acquired by its highly noted local neighbor, Raffles and then was recently sold to the Fairmont chain. The land and buildings, of course, belong to someone else, but the operator that is responsible for the building is the Fairmont Group. If you go into the lobby of the hotel, you'll see that it is little changed over the past ten or so years and the lobby furniture, though still in good enough shape, is due soon for an upgrade. Attached, as it is, to the large MTR hub in the basement of the adjacent Raffles City shopping mall, the buidling gets quite a bit of foot traffic and is thus subject to the kind of abuse you'd expect from such a location. But it's not the public areas that disappointed me, but instead the condition of my room, especially my toilet and shower. To be blunt: my room was worn out. The carpeting was thin in a number of locations, the walls showed cracks and the room was in bad need of a new coat of paint. But it was in the bath room, that the lack of attention to the infrastructure was evident. Big chunks of plaster were falling off the walls next to the shower stall (an odd design, that always puzzeled me since there's no way to prevent water from coming out of the shower and onto the main bathroom floor - dangerous and sloppy design), grout was missing from the tile walls and the toilet fixture was, let's say, unhappy. If you are looking to stay in Singapore, I suggest that you consider spending a few more dollars and select another hotel - for example, the Fullerton?", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cTop-notch service and a perfect location\u201d", "Author": "ilovebali18", "ReviewID": "UR124958419", "Content": "I made a mistake with my booking dates and didn't realize it until I was en route to hotel and still on the airplane .

When you take a shower, the separate tub gets wet, too; this is all the result of renovation and retrofitting to get a separate shower and tub. There are two large round swimming pools that shared with the other Fairmont property . The funny thing is that when people swim laps, they go in circles; but, if someone starts swimming straight across the pool, then everyone starts swimming straight across. The hotel location is prime because it is across from sister Raffles Hotel, near the City Hall subway stop, connects to a mall, and is an easy walk to the Esplanade and many sights.

Many of top class hotels simply charge too much as not provide a great customer satisfaction thus losing its edge in hospitality department. Fairmont hotel is well known worldwide and it is a great hotel for a reason where even Singapore location does not disappoint. Room: It is not truly modern decoration or vast variety of high-tech electronics but, it is comfortable nevertheless and it is good sized considering it is Singapore after all. Bed is very comfortable (single king) and sheets, pillows, and comforter is good quality which it should be. It is also very quiet even with other guests in adjacent room being occupied or guests walking down the hallway. Bathroom: It is large and has nice set of toiletries in case if you are lacking on certain things to pack with you. Shower is good with adequate water flow but there is a flow restrictor installed so do not expect high stream flow you get to experience at some hotels which I love but considering fresh water waste, it is somewhat selfish thing. Air conditioning: It is hot and humid country so certain old hotels do have A/C smell or problem but, not at this hotel and it controls room temperature comfortable. Location: It is next to Raffles hotel and attached to the shopping mall which has luxury shops to popular brand outlets. It also is very close to MRT so if you like to take MRT, it is right next to it. Some folks do not like the location since it is not on Orchard road but more I visit Singapore, less I care for the hotels on Orchard road area. I like less crowded roads and streets. It is very close so MRT or Taxi can take you there. Lobby: It has sizable lobby to meet or greet friends or clients if this is important to you. Food: Room service and dining is top notch but, considering so many great places to eat nearby I do not see the need. Overall impression: This is a great hotel for my taste and it isn\u2019t terribly expensive for Singapore standard nowadays. Occasionally, the hotel will have a promotion or sale so you might spend less than some other hotels.

It is right across the street from the famous Raffles Hotel with its Long Bar (and Singapore Sling cocktail), and location on top of Raffles City, a western style mall with a food court and grocery store in the basement. There is also an MRT station that provides easy access to the rest of the city. One of the best features of the hotel is the pool area, which features two circular pools (one for kids, one for adults), a bar area and plenty of lounge chairs. This area is superior to the pool area you will find at most other 5 star hotels. Another great feature is Il Prego, the breakfast buffet restaurant. The breakfast dishes were exceptional, though the staff were sometimes not very attentive to clearing plates and refilling drinks (first world problems, I know!). This breakfast was a great ay to start the day, and included the standard western fare as well as a selection of Asian dishes. My only real complaints relate to the rooms. It appears that the rooms were over-designed for aesthetics rather than function. In both rooms I've stayed in, the shapes were awkward, reducing the amount of usable space. Also, the furniture was uncomfortable (in one room there was a fainting couch that was very uncomfortable and took up space that could have been better used). The worst part related to the washrooms. The showers were designed to be \"modern\" without a door. Consequence? Water all over the place no matter what we tried. The sink is also strange, with a bowl on top of the counter, all of which is clear glass. The faucet is poorly placed such that water always splashes out of the bowl onto the counter, and because everything is clear it looks 10x messier than need be. The coffee maker uses the little pucks for single serve coffee. I have used these many times but found the systems in place here to be really defective, often requiring a few tries to make it work. Service was mediocre. I dont recall anything exceptional. One more thing: it is about time five star hotels stop charging usurious rates for Internet access. The rooms are already expensive enough! Knock it off already! Overall, you are paying for location. The rooms aren't up to snuff with other five star hotels, and the service isn't really special.

For me, Fairmont hotel is one of the best located hotel in Singapore. I booked the deluxe bedroom, as its located in South Tower supposed to be best view and newly renovated, The room and the view are delightful, but to get the best view ask for a room floor 20 and up, also room number close to room 34 as its the one facing the river. The service is Great, easy check in, very friendly staff, informative and helpful, on my check out because i have a late night flight, the staff offer a hospitality room, basically a closed common room with sofa, TV, toilet, coffee maker and fridge full of complimentary bottle water.

We were upgraded to a Signiture Roomn which although bigger , the view of the habour was further away. We much prefer the Harbour Deluxe double. We found the foyer busier than on our other visits. The Singaporean staff are always helpful and always with smiles on their faces. However, on a previous visit a Canadian Chinese lady who checked us in was quite the opposite. She wanted to put us in a hot sunny, restricted view room and because of our insistance got us, the paid for, harbour view deluxe double. She even wanted to charge more for a room which we had already paid for. We might have condesended too had we not stayed in the said rooms before. Secondly, on that visit we came across an African Parisian consiege who was abrupt and did not know where Singapore's former famous eateyr had re- located. He was still there on this visit! I think a consiege must always be a local person. Breakfast is in Prego Restaurant on the ground floor or at the swimming pool on 8 th foor. Its lovely by the poolside. Breakfast is adequate but I think the kept warm foods can be improved, although there is a egg station to compensate. Location is excellent, with the City MRT, shops, some eatery, in the complex. Walk under ground to the Marina. On street level, walk to the small local bars, cheap nice chicken rice restaurants, small bars behind Raffles Hotel for local colour.

Here is our experience and some tips Join the Presidents club before commencing stay. This will provide you at the very least, free high speed internet and local phone calls which can be useful when making restaurant reservations. Stay here for its location. It is connected to Raffles City mall and City Hall MRT station which will give you easy access to most parts of Singapore. It is also an easy 10 min walk to the malls at Marina square and Suntec city. Ask for a room in the South Tower. Rooms here were renovated and includes a BOSE system and a Nespresso type coffee machine. (3 capsules provided) Be prepared to oversleep. The bed was so comfortable that we overslept for 2 out of the 4 days we were there. From memory, only the beds at the 4 seasons (Singapore) provided a more superior experience. Expect housekeeping to visit your room twice. Once in the morning and another during turn-down. Expect genuine and warm service from the porters, door man (between hotel lobby and Restaurant) and the guys at the taxi queue reception area. I also encountered wonderful service from Julie (Business centre) who helped out in the printing of our boarding passes. Areas for Improvement While many of the staff especially those at the front desk were professional, more training would remind them to establish eye contact when dealing with guest and not make one wait while they complete the previous matter. Simple logic dictates that if one was still busy, not to invite guest to your counter and then have them wait, albeit a few seconds. While training has enabled front office staff to deliver a superior service (and they do deliver what you ask for), not quite sure how they can teach them to adopt a warmer approach towards returning guest. I find the smiles, the small talk and the warmth showered to us by the staff at Pathuwan Princess and the Intercontinental (Bangkok) missing. Perhaps, they were overwhelmed with work or perhaps I was simply unfortunate to have encountered individuals with their frosty approach on multiple days. Management must also address the issue regarding the poor design of the bathroom. (See attached pic). As the glass screen between the rain shower and the vanity area only covers a little section, the next person using the bathroom can expect a wet floor after the first guest showers. Not good for a 5 star hotel Housekeeping must have been so overwhelmed picking up soaked bathmats day after day that lapses has resulted. Forgetting to replace soaked bathmats with fresh ones can be overlooked but finding a dead roach (see pic) in our toilet after returning from a day of shopping is inexcusable. Regardless if Housekeeping forgets to flush, the vermin should never have been found on the 14th floor of a 5 star hotel in the first place. The thought it has crawled from the luggage of another guest or through the sewers is too disgusting to contemplate.

Breakfast at prego was a good spread though, for SG standards, although the gold standard for hotel breakfast must surely be the kempinski in ST Petes (but that's another story (or review). fifth, asked for an additional complementary car ticket for a friend who came with me to check in, flatly refused. sixth, no turn down service the first night i was there. not sure why. seventh, cotton balls in room had visible dirt in them! that's so not on! all in all, was disappointing. to be fair, room was decent, and view of the fireworks was great. willow spa was good too", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cGreat view, great location, excellent service.\u201d", "Author": "Handy K", "ReviewID": "UR122353016", "Content": "Room: larger than average room size, for even the most standard rooms.

Very clean, in excellent shape, excellent location, very helpful staff. The restaurant in the hotel, Prego, is decent but over priced IMO. There is so much great food in Singapore I would go elsewhere. I used the business center to print some documents and they charged me $2 per page...seemed ridiculously excessive to me, left a bad taste in my mouth. The hotel is on the pricey side to begin with, which is OK, it's nice and overall it's worth it, but it seems like something like this should be included, or at least not be such a ridiculous price. I ended up paying north of $60 to print out some black and white documents. When you pay a lot for a hotel you don't want to feel nickel and dimed, and feel like they're taking advantage of the fact that you need certain things done. Why not charge $40 for a tooth brush, then? I would recommend you ask for the view facing the city, not the pool. Great views everywhere but I faced the pool and the best view for me was to my left, and part of the view was cut off by the building itself. There was sometimes a strong pine scent at the front of the building and the lobby. I assume this was by design, and must have come through the A/C system or something. It was noticable during busier times when people were checking in, and not at other times like later at night. I found it pleasant and confusing at the same time. This had no impact on my feelings of the hotel but I felt compelled to share it nonetheless. I wonder if they change the scent throughout the year (I was there during Christmas season)? Besides the unnecessary price gouging in the business center, I came away feeling this was an excellent place to stay and would recommend it for others.

The staff and service were courteous and helpful, and the location in Raffles City is pretty good, but a few things about the room, as well as the high price, put a damper on my stay there. Due to its location and facilities, it is a decent conference hotel, but in all honesty I would not be able to wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for tourists. +++: Service: The staff was always courteous, and the front desk in particular was efficient and helpful. Check-in and check-out were a breeze, and problems/complaints were handled fairly (which I was grateful for) Location: Connected to the cavernous complex called Raffles City, with everything from shopping, eating, its own metro station, other hotels, and probably its own moon, the Fairmont is conveniently located. However, do note that aside from Mcdonalds, not much is open late, and the mall becomes a little inaccessible entrances and exits close) once the shops close down ---: Room: The room was decently sized, but I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s where the compliments end. The rooms looked quite dated and in need of renovation, with tables, chairs and doors looking a little bit worse for wear and tear. Some amenities \u2013 slippers and bathrobes \u2013 felt really cheap as well. Cleanliness: The first room they put me in \u2013 a smaller room facing the pool \u2013 had the huge no-no of having ants on the work desk. Perhaps I\u2019m a bit more stringent with hotel hygiene, but I cannot emphasize how much this put me off. To be fair, the staff was very nice about it, and asked whether they could send someone up to clean the table. I declined and asked to change rooms, which they agreed to and I was grateful for. However, I don\u2019t believe any top-notch hotel should have ants crawling up the table, and this was a huge disappointment. Bathroom: Surprisingly, the bathrooms had a rain shower, and I am still complaining! Firstly, the toilet design feels a little sparse; it reminded me more of a public toilet than an actual hotel one. The utility of it was normal, but the aesthetics left a little more to be desired. However, the utility of the shower \u2013 which had a rain shower \u2013 was quite terrible. The showers had no doors or curtains, which is fine if you have a long enough shower area. But for some reason the first room they put me in had a short shower area and no door, which meant that while I was showering water got everywhere. Suffice to say the bathroom floor got terribly wet (and a little dangerous, come to think about it). I had laid out a floor towel, but it didn\u2019t really help. The second room they put me in was fine (larger shower area). Value: The hotel itself was a little pricey. I had paid less for a room at the Four Season (at Orchard Road) which gave me a completely difference experience. Perhaps you are paying for the location, but in my opinion it isn\u2019t quite worth the difference.

The room was great, with an amazing bathroom- dual sinks and a shower with rainfall head, normal head and massage jets. The room was also huge with a kitchenette and separate living/dining room. The lounge facilities are decent and the snacks during the evening cocktail hour are more than enough to pass as dinner if you are so inclined. They do not have a cocktail menu, but do make some drinks on request during the cocktail hours. Breakfast can be taken at 3 different restaurants; Prego having a large variety, Alligator Pear the outside restaurant with some 'organic' and free-range options and the club. When we wanted to head out early we asked at Prego if we would be allowed to pack ourselves a breakfast from the buffet and they were happy to oblige, even fetching some take-away containers for us to pack! The pool was quite crowded as it is shared with the massive Swissotel but we were always able to find a pair of free deckchairs. It is mostly non-smoking, and large enough that smoke should not disturb you. We encountered no specific problems this stay, but the hotel overall, and the club specifically, did not have the same feel to it.

The location of the hotel is perfect being directly above a small shopping center and a metro station, allowing easy access to everywhere in Singapore. We arrived very early in the morning, we were understandably unable to check-in when arriving (8am) the staff allowed us to use the lounge facilities to have a shower and refresh. I left my phone number with the Staff who called me promptly in an hr to inform me that our room was now ready. This was most accommodating as this was many hours before standard check-in was permitted. We also had a late flight leaving Singapore and the hotel was able to facilitate a late checkout for us. The room was spacious, clean & modern. The nespresso machine in the room was a nice touch and beats the instant coffee available in most hotels. We also visited the pool which was large, clean and a nice tranquil escape from the humid Singapore days. The breakfast served in Pregio restaurant was very nice, extensive hot & cold options available for both the western & Asian palette. The juice station was one of my favorites with fresh combination juices available on request. Just prior to checkout, I made the mistake of taking my wedding ring off, being a newly-wed it slipped my mind and I left it on the bathroom counter. I only realized my error many hours after checking out. I ran back to the hotel and was very relieved to discover that the cleaning staff had noticed the ring and had passed it on to security. Within moments I was reunited with my lost ring and this quickly prevented my wife from killing me. The ring is worth $1500AUD so I was impressed by the honesty of the staff in returning it.

See the attached photo that I took from my balcony. The basement of the hotel connects to a shopping mall which has a food court and grocery stores/pharmacies. I haven't ever encountered so much convenience from a location before. Club level bookings get a very good lounge, with great views, breakfast include and a small buffet that is suitable for an entire dinner, along with a good bar selection during alcohol service hours (5:30 to 8pm). The gym is very large for a hotel with a good selection of equipment, and is shared with the Swisshotel next door I believe. Spa is also quite large, and guests do not have to pay extra to use the sauna / steam room / hot tub which is a great policy (compare to Mandarin Oriental where you can work out in the gym, but will have to come up with $50 if you want to sauna/steam after). Wifi is free I think if you are a member of Fairmont President's Club. Free to join, so why not? I love enlightened wifi policies (most similar hotels will charge $25 extra... so between sauna and wifi there's a competitive $75/day advantage here). Sleep quality was good with a very comfortable bed, washroom was spacious and beautiful. I had some minor problems during the stay, one of which was completely my own fault (left items behind in the room) and hotel management took it upon themselves to solve them with a full buy in. This kind of responsibility level, where you make the customer's problem your own problem, reflects the best kind of management you can hope for. Problems happen when traveling, it's a fact of life. You will encounter three types of responses, 1. a shrug, so what (useless), 2. a polite letter with regrets (done when they want to appear to be responsive but don't want to take any responsibility and care more about the bottom line than your repeat business) and 3. full buy in where management is sincerely concerned and wants to offer the best possible experience for their guests. This hotel is run on type 3 and for me this is the best situation I can hope for as a guest, knowing that whatever happens, management stands behind their product and their guest. That to me is the single biggest difference that makes a property five star. There are many pretenders but few are worth their five star rating, like Fairmont Singapore is.

The meeting rooms are really well equipped with plenty of space, built-in back-projected screen, those special flipchart paper gripper rails, a huge whiteboard and windows which go from clear to opaque at the touch of a button - very James Bond! What really impressed us was the service team, who had learnt all our tea and coffee preferences (which varied by time of day) after the first time of asking and as soon as we opened the door for the breaks, would rush to make them. We also had the usual asian hotel array of eastern and western light bites, which varied each day and were universally excellent. Nothing was too much trouble and any request was enthusiastically responded to, including recovring my reading glasses from the breakfast room. For lunch each day we were escorted to a different buffet or restaurant and enjoyed all the meals. I stayed in the hotel on the club floor and initially was disappointed to find my Presidents Club status had been rewarded by giving me the smallest room on the floor (you can tell from the fire excape notice map...). However a mumbled comment to our meeting organiser produced a spectacular upgrade to a suite on the 25th floor with enormous lounge, huge bathroom with a shower area that would take a football team, walk in wardrobe and large bedroom. The control units take a bit of mastering but do enable you to open and shut curtains (night and day versions) from your bed, as well as all the lights except those in the bathroom for some strange reason. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning unobtrusive. There are Nespresso coffee machines in each room, but they don't leave the water tank filled, so if you dont know how to operate these, I bet most people would assume their machine isn't working (both rooms' machines needed expert coaxing from the family's barrista at home to produce a cup).

Therefore we decided to have a break of 4 nights in Singapore. After a lot of agonising I decided to stay in the Fairmont for its very convenient location and it did not disappoint. We were both allocated rooms on the 21st floor, my room was in the South Tower and my daugther was in the North Tower. However, I must have stayed in a \"haunted\" room with faulty electrical wiring which played up in the middle of the second night, lights going off and on, electric curtains opening on its own accord, doorbell ringing, etc. Consequently I had to get a technician up to disconnect some of the electricity. Needless to say that I did not sleep at all that night, it all was rather disconcerting. The next morning, I requested to have a different room for the remaining nights, which of course was immediately organised and the room blocked out until the wiring system was checked out and fixed. As all this was quite an ordeal, we both received complimentary breakfast for the remainder of our stay plus a late checkout for both rooms. All in all I was more than happy with the way management solved this room problem. The concierge service was outstanding, so was reception. Breakfast was great (try the french toast with orange cream), staff could not be friendlier and making sure that everything was the way we wanted it to be. We had a beautiful stay which we will never forget, thanks to all the staff. Location could not be better, so close to everything within walking distance to main attractions, and the MRT is just literally meters away. As I am a very regular visitor to Singapore, I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in this city and can say that from now on I will make the Fairmont my hotel in Singapore. For me it is the only place to stay, both because of its location and the extreme helpfullness of all staff.

They said they will check and get back to me. Alas, I waited from afternoon till night, no sign of the cake and worse still, no acknowledgement whatsoever from the hotel on the status of their check. Another minus point is the queue at President Club. I signed up membership for the President Club in view of the benefits (one of them being the express lane for check-in and check-out). To my disappointment, I waited in queue for some time before deciding to move to the queue at the other non President Club counters that were clearing faster than this so-called express lane. Perhaps the hotel may wish to look into providing more counters at the President Club to meet up to the promise of quick check-ins / check-outs. Basic customer service is what I feel is lacking in this hotel. I agree with the previous comment by Fitzlim; just because we did not sign up for their package, we were made to feel as though we are unworthy of good customer service.

The facilities \u2013 especially for those who are particular about the bathroom \u2013 were spotless and top quality. Those who like the separate rain shower and bathtub will love this feature of Fairmont Singapore rooms. I should mention though that for just a bit more, I would encourage guests to specify deluxe rooms in the south wing: these are the rooms with superior bathroom facilities, and generally better rooms. I should also add that the evening turn-down service is MUCH MORE than just turning down your sheets: you get a replenishment of amenities, towels, bottled water, and coffee items \u2013 and the very important (in a shopping town!) full bucket of ice! For weary \u2013 and thirsty -- tourists familiar with that little irritant of having to call housekeeping for a bucket of ice (or get it yourself from an ice machine!) , and the usual 15-minute wait for the ice to be sent up, you can appreciate arriving at your room after a long day and having that refreshing little detail ready. Fairmont has an exceptional evening-service: they think of everything; it is practically like having your room freshened up twice in a day. Another tip: join the hotel chain's President\u2019s Club. If only for the complimentary internet, it is worth joining, and the other perks make it an excellent hotel club. For example, often, when you check out early, most hotels will store your baggage until your departure for the airport. Fairmont Singapore does one better for President\u2019s Club members (or perhaps even other hotel guests): it has a lounge where you can rest, have coffee or tea, freshen up, and relax before a trip. Finally, I cannot say enough about the service. From the very efficient hotel manager, to his competent admin and reservation staff who respond promptly to all emails and queries, to the front desk, concierge, wait staff, and housekeeping \u2013 the service was beyond superior. In fact, a friend of mine lost her stamped immigration card and was so worried, but the concierge took the time \u2013 despite the very busy hour of 1:00 pm \u2013 to call airport immigration, get all the details for obtaining a new card, and thereby ensuring a worry-free vacation. Many hotels pay lip service to treating their hotel patrons as honored guests. In this hotel you are made to feel and experience that warm, professional, and first class treatment. Truly exceptional. These may be odd features and services to point out, but for the discriminating traveler, it is the attention to these little details that do go a long way, and set a 5-star hotel apart from their rivals.

The Fairmont, although well located, is in a slightly quieter area, and might be better for the seasoned Singapore traveler. Personally, I enjoyed not being in the center of the universe and there is more than enough to do within walking distance of the property. There is an MRT station in the basement of the hotel, and you can go anywhere easily on this cheap and efficient mass transport system. The property itself is fairly sedate, and it is not as grand as my expectations. I have been fortunate to stay in some very high end properties throughout China, HKG, and Thailand but found the ambience here to be relatively unremarkable.With that being said, I found the staff themselves to be most gracious and there appears to be a high ratio of staff to guests, so service is superb. Dining options are numerous within the hotel itself and the attached mall. You will really enjoy eating yourself into a coma! My ultimate recommendation is to join the Fairmont President's Club prior to your visit. It's a free program, and when you arrive, you will receive complimentary internet ( $22 a day savings) and discounts at the spa.

We had two balconies, stand up shower w/ separate bathtub and plenty of space to want to spend time in the room. The housekeeping service (including turndown) was immaculate. My only minor complaint is that if you did not turn off the do not disturb sign before 10AM, you may need to wait until late afternoon to have the room cleaned. This happened twice, maybe some of my fault for getting a late start, but it kind of made you have to leave the room later in the afternoon so they can clean.

Mainly western foods, but they did always have some dim sum or Indian offerings plus plenty of fresh fruit, juices, and yogurts.

The Fairmont in Singapore is the old Westin Hotel and directly opposite the road from the venerable Raffles and next door to the Swissotel. Its located on Bras Basah Road which connects to the ever popular Orchard Road. Its too far to walk to Orchard Road but there is a Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) station just next to the Fairmont in a shopping complex called Raffles Place (City Hall Station). Those who have read my reviews in the past will realise that as a smoker, I am partial to Hotels with balconies. Every room at the Fairmont has a balcony overlooking whichever of the four sides your room faces. Being above the City Hall Station, you're either two stops away from Marina Bay (where the new Sands Casino is located) or to Orchard Road (the shopping mecca of Singapore). I've stayed here in the past when attending the F1 Grand Prix and the location can't be beat. Checking in was a breeze and extremely efficient. Got a very good internet rate but this was probably why I was allocated one of the older rooms just one floor above the swimming pool. Having said that, the Hotel has very well constructed balcony doors that cut out any sound from outside. Have stayed here previously on the higher executive floors and the rooms were much nicer. Cant fault the bathroom amenities in the room and the rain shower in the bathroom was great. As in all Fairmonts I have stayed in, the bed was extremely comfortable and TV channel selection still remains one of the best in Singapore. My only negative comment with the Hotel is the lack of wifi connectivity in the room and lobby. In the past when I have stayed at the Hotel, I got around this by using the wifi at the executive lounge. But this time, as it was a holiday, did not bother paying the premium for an executive floor and ended up not having internet access for three days.

For the bad reviews that have written, I want to point out that nobody's perfect and services lapses may happen. As a frequent traveller, I have experiened the best and the worst. Fairmont Singapore is definitely comparable to some top-end hotel I have stayed. I highly recommend that if you are celebrating an occasion during your stay with them, write to them prior to your arrival.

We were on a trip that included a few days in Singapore and decided to stay at the Fairmont. Unfortunately the Fairmont Singapore didn\u2019t live up to our high expectations. I had booked directly with Fairmont four months prior to our stay and had a reservation, confirmed in writing, for a particular category of suite that included a separate bedroom, living room with couch (as we have two young children) and an eating area. After checking in we got our or room to discover that we were in a junior suite with two single beds and no separate living room or pull out couch. The experience trying to get us moved to the category of suite we had reserved was completely exasperating and ultimately unsuccessful. I was provided a series of excuses and explanations by the manger on duty that were simply confabulation. At first I was told that there was only one suite in the hotel of the category I had reserved and that because another guest had decided to stay longer it was not available. When I pointed out that the hotel web site described several suites of the type I had reserved I was that there were, in fact, four suite of the category but they were all unavailable as guests on extended stays were using all of them. I was then told that because of the rate I had booked the category of suite was only a request. When I showed the manager the reservation confirmation I was told that it was a mistake by their reservations department, the hotel was full, and that it would not be honored. After several hours we were moved to a suite several categories below, and less than half the size, of the one which we had reserved. It had two queen-sized beds so everyone was able to sleep, however, the bottom line is that the hotel simply could not honor their own reservation. We were sent a fruit bowl and card apologizing for the problem with the reservation. While a far cry from what we had reserved, the room we wound up in did have an excellent view and a spacious bathroom. The beds were comfortable and the cleaning staff kept everything spotless. When traveling with kids we often book rooms with access to hotel lounges that supply breakfast and snacks as we find that easier than going out to a restaurant. With Fairmont this is often associated with Fairmont Gold floors, however, at the Singapore hotel access to the lounge is included with a suite booking. The staff at the Singapore lounge was generally helpful and quick to offer you a drink when you arrived. Unfortunately, and contrary to all of our previous experiences, we were made to feel unwelcome with our kids. On the second day of our stay, we were having breakfast and my three year old ran over to me while I was getting a glass of orange juice. A grim faced employee came over to me and said, \u201cPlease prevent your child from running.\u201d We are attentive parents and actively attempt to ensure our kids are not disturbing other guests. I\u2019m not sure how a 3-year-old running 15 feet to his father would disturb anyone. The next evening, we attended the lounge for an evening snack and the employee at the door announced that they had an apparently new policy preventing children from using the lounge. I told her this was news to me, contrary to all previous experiences with Fairmont lounges, and that we had been using the lounge for the past two days with our kids without any mention of such a policy. She relented and said go ahead but we were made to feel utterly unwelcome. Depending on your perspective revenge was either theirs or ours when my son was served a glass of milk that had gone off and he became ill. My wife felt so uncomfortable with the lounge experience she didn\u2019t attend again for the balance of our stay. I brought breakfast to our room from the shopping mall attached to the hotel for the next two mornings. On the upside, my wife had a pedicure at the hotel spa and reports that it was an enjoyable experience.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service, great place and wonderful staff!\u201d", "Author": "docbarb46", "ReviewID": "UR117055918", "Content": "We checked in at fairmont last Aug 17 and stayed up to Aug 21.

We heard cars, busses, trucks, etc rolling by all night. The bathroom was also poorly designed with only one sink (really need a double sink to be considered a five star in my humble opinion) , toilet awkwardly jammed in between the shower and tub, and the shower itself was difficult to operate because of excessive wear and tear (loose parts dangling that couldn't be fixed). The hotel is big (500+ rooms), busy and also a bit of an eyesore - can't imagine what design person dreamed up the exterior color scheme and largely dysfunctional balconies was thinking.

And, please trust me on this...There are two wonderful door-men, who split shift at the door by the Prego restaurant and the entrance from the hotel into Raffles City shopping mall, Ismail and Victor. Chat with them. They know all you would need to know about the city, and they are two of the nicest, most pleasant human beings you'll find in all of Singapore. They represent what's best about the Fairmont, and they truly make you feel welcome. The rooms are well-designed, clean, and comfortable. The restaurants are great, though the breakfast buffet is quite pricey.

Everyone from the check-in to the room service staff to the bellman gave excellent service at all times. I thought that in many cases the service was not only excellent, but on a more personal basis than at some of the other 5-star hotels in town. For example, I was able to leave a large suitcase at the hotel over the weekend while taking a short weekend trip, and the staff asked me about where I went, how I liked it, etc. I felt valued as a customer here and thought that this set the hotel apart. Now for the hotel itself, the rooms are great, with comfortable beds, immaculately clean, walk-in closets, and large bathrooms. The internet connection was good and there was a good room service selection. The other great benefit of this hotel, in my opinion, is that it's above a large mall that has good shopping, a good restaurant selection, and also has easy MRT access. I prefer to ride the MTR when in Singapore since the taxi situation is often difficult. Here, I could speed to my client's site at Raffles Place in less than 5 minutes without ever going outside.

So be careful how you book. If you get the north wing, you might as well stay in another hotel, as you will not feel like you are in a Fairmont. We lasted one hour in the 'Fairmont room' before moving into the South Wing. 15th floor, such a stunning view and very comfortable and easy. Great bathroom. Just a little bit worn in places, but they seemed to be upgrading the rooms during the day, I noticed tradesmen about a lot. Not noisy though. May sound bizarre but we spent hours staring out the window at the Marina Sands Hotel and the Singapore Flyer. We went to top of both, and both were great to do. I am glad we did not stay in Marina Sands, as it is much more exciting to look at the 'ship' on the top of those towers and marvel, than stay there where you could not 'see' what was on top of the hotel. That hotel was very artistic to visit, most the clientele seemed to be Chinese gamblers, as it has a casino. Fairmont is a top hotel, the desk service, the breakfast restaurant was 6 star for quality and variety (a personal fresh juice chef even) - all was romantic in the South Wing. Nice pools in the hotel, etc. We used the business centre on several occasions in spite of this being a romantic holiday... not grumbling, we did not expect to have to do business.. and the business centre staff bent over back wards for us and it was very well priced to use the computers and internet. The location was so good, we loved the 3 or 4 floors below the hotel of shopping centres, food mall, services like massage, hair cuts, etc. It is also close to Chimes with its myriad of upmarket cafes/bars. Hotel is related to Swisshotel next door and Raffles across the street (yes we had a sling) We caught local transport so easily. City Hall train station has two lines, red and green, (easy to get train from airport to city hall and hotel is literally right there above you) trains are cheap and quick and best for longer distances, better than cabs. and we got buses into Chinatown in 5 minutes from hotel. As we flew Singapore Air, we caught the free Sing Air hop on hop off bus right at the hotel, too. Noticed that the other hop on hop off buses, also stopped at Fairmont.

The Willow Stream Spa is out of this world even if you are only interested in a sauna, steam and Jacuzzi rather than an area of treatments.

My chicken curry was tasteless and the atmosphere terrible \u2013 a bit like eating in a canteen. In hindsight, I should have ordered room service. The concierge did suggest Prego so perhaps that might have been a better idea \u2013 Prego is part of Fairmont but Kopi Tiam is in the Mall.

The Szechuan Court and Kitchen restaurant in the hotel is worth a visit for dinner. Keep in mind that Szechuan dishes can be very spicey \u2013 that suited me but not somebody at the next table. Fish dishes seem to be their speciality though I had a very tastey and simple duck dish. The portions are large. I chose the mango dish from the dessert menu as so many of the dessert dishes contained chilli, snow fungus etc which I wasn\u2019t adventurous enough to try.

I returned to the airport on the metro from City Hall which was also very convenient \u2013 sing 2.90. The Raffles City Mall complex links the Fairmount to the City Hall metro so you don\u2019t even need to walk outside. The Swissotel is directly next to the Fairmont.

We went there to relax one afternoon and shortly after we arrived they started playing loud music at the pool bar.

Became an instant President\u2019s Club member (recommended to do, internet is free) and went to a spacious room, contemporary style. One thing that may turn down some business visitors: the hotel is huge and when I was there a lot of vacationers with children which makes the restaurant a little noisy at times.

The advice I got was to go to the 8th floor, however that\u2019s breakfast near the swimming pool, hardly attractive at 31 degrees Celsius if you are on a business trip. Quiet I said? I thought so, unfortunately I had some noisy neighbors, had to call the reception to see if they could quiet them down. They did and it helped. At 3.00 am that same night the hotel fire alarm went off, summoning everyone on the 20th floor to move to three stories lower. As the alarm kept going I called the reception then to hear that is was false alarm. The hotel management resolved this issue well, no complaints here.

I have been the Singapore before, as an exchange student, so it was nice to see the country/city from a tourists perspective. The Fairmont has excellent customer service and are very attentive to our needs. The room was always cleaned when we got back from our day of sightseeing. Our only complaint is an experience we had with a trip the hotel tried to book for us. The hotel booked a day trip to Malaysia for us, that went very poorly. We were told to be ready by a certain time in the morning, with our passports. When the tourist company representative arrived to pick us up, he asked if we had our 'white cards' with us, which we informed we did not. He did not seem disturbed by this and told us to get onto the bus. We didn't think about it twice, thinking that whatever it was, we could get at the company. We got to the meeting location and paid our fees and boarded the bus to Malaysia. As we got on the bus, the bus driver once again asked whether or not we had our 'white cards', which we told him we did not and needed one. Once he explained to us what a white card was, we came to understand that we needed our immigration cards (the cards you get when you enter the country at the airport, which you fill out on the plane). Unfortunately, those were at our hotel, and we were told we could not go on the trip. We were very upset by this, as we really wanted to go to Malaysia. If the hotel had told us to bring our 'white cards', or the tour company bus driver had just tried to explain to us what a 'white card' is when we were at the hotel, we could have just popped up to the room and grabbed them. Let me clarify, I completely understand WHY we needed these cards, my complaint was not that we needed them, rather that the hotel and the tour company both failed to explain to us what it was they were asking us to bring, resulting in us being unable to go on a much looked forward to adventure. The hotel restaurants are very good, albeit slightly pricey. I would recommend eating at them once or twice, but also checking out the Hokien centers, where the food is VERY good and super cheap! The morning breakfast buffet at Verde is very good, and worth the price for the choices of food provided. Check out the new Universal Studios, as well as the Casino with the giant boat on top. For culture, go to China town and India town. For family friendly adventures on the main island, I recommend going to the bird zoo/sanctuary.

IMO, Marina Bay is pretty sterile and boring with nothing interesting within walking distance. Orchard Road hotels are also not centrally located unless if your sole purpose in SG is to goto shopping malls. The rooms are dated and spartan. Fortunately, the bed and bathroom are just fine. They definitely need a new interior designer to spruce things up. The all-white tiled bathroom feels like a gym, and the bedroom color palette is real drab and stale. Service is 4 star---not quite the Starwood level of gracious hospitality you get in Asia. During noon checkout, there was a long queue of people checking in / out, yet there were a few caucasian staff members just standing around instead of helping to speed up the queue.

For some reason the front desk staff struggled to arrange use of the Spa for this, since they could not figure out when it opened in the AM. Some training is needed in this area. The desk person was mainly trained to tell me that check-in time is 2pm. Thanks for that. My room was OK, but the large TV was not working properly, and I needed to continue to get someone to come to the room and program it, so it would turn on properly. For gosh sakes, could you please fix the TV set if your guests continue to have a problem with it? The hotel has some nice restaurants, especially Szechuan Court. Prego is not the place for breakfast unless you want the buffet breakfast. They almost refuse to bring a menu out for breakfast items, and then warn that it will take 30-40 minutes for anything to come out of the kitchen. Even a continental breakfast or oatmeal? Best to skip Prego for breakfast and find the Starbucks in the shopping mall next door.

I filmed the operation of the shower and have it on my youtube page (http://www.youtube.com/AllHotelrooms). I was able to try both the gym and the Willow Stream Spa. The gym was large and equipped with nice and modern cardio and weight-training equipment. The spa area was nice and comfortable and I tried the hot and cold plunge pools as well the steam room and sauna. There was a good area for sitting and having drinks such as iced tea before or after the entry to the spa area. The shower area was quite impressive with very large showers there with nice amenities available, which were of professional spa standard.Another minor quibble was that my requested newspaper was not delivered on the first morning, which was part of the Fairmont President\u2019s Club promise, and there was no explanation given so I had to follow up and found out that they did not have that particular newspaper on the weekend.

The breakfast buffet was extensive and had a great fresh squeezed juice bar. The smoked salmon was very fishy but the staff was friendly. The baby crib was cheap, missing side pads, and of the drop gate style that is no longer available in the USA due to safety concerns. This place might have looked modern in the 80's but time has moved on but the hotel has not. The sofa in our mini suite looked like something out of an 80's garage sale. The once modern light fixture and curtain control was very yellowed with most functions since disabled. It started raining in our room on the last day but the leak was fixed by evening. Our thermostat wandered widely, making the room too hot then too cold. The location was super excellent, right by the Raffles hotel, connected to the MRT on the airport line, and in a mall with a Starbuck with free internet.

The hotel is located in the \"Raffles City,\" with its sister hotel Swiss\u00f4tel The Stamford within the same complex. The location is, like many high-end hotels in Singapore, ridiculously convenient (MRT located right below complex along with mall, food court). There's a 24/7 Starbucks and McDonald right below too for those that may need those convenience. All staffs were friendly, attentive, and extremely helpful. Although I'm a no frills type of traveler so your results may vary in the type of request/needs you may have. Some minor things I've requested were: turn down service at random hours, power adapter as I forgot to bring mine (given to me for free), and numerous key card replacement as I kept forgetting my key card in the room. Both my stay was in a high floor with decent view, so if a nice view is what you're looking for, request a high floor and you'll be able to enjoy some sights. The rooms itself are well appointed, roomy, fluffy towels, with clean, comfortable pillows, and firm bed. The bed was firm enough that another person can sleep without being disturb. No free WiFi at high-end locations continues to annoy me, but if you're in Fairmont's president club, you should be able to get complimentary internet service (otherwise a steep $13 USD or so per night). Various restaurants are available within the Raffles City complex, and though my friend and I didn't really visit any of them, we gave the Equinox restaurant on floor 70 a try (for the view). Food was average for the price, but the panoramic, ceiling-to-floor glass view of Singapore downtown and central business district can't be beat. If I recall, there was extra fee for a window seating.

The buffet breakfast was absolutely incredible - but very very expensive. We then got to wait in the hospitality suite for our room to be ready. While we didn't expect the room to be ready right away, we were quoted a time that was clearly unrealistic - so it was rather annoying to have to wait several hours longer than we were told. Once we got into our room though, it was fantastic! We were upgraded to a Deluxe Room, which was great! Although we were only on the 7th floor, we still had an amazing room overlooking the Singapore War Memorial, the Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer, etc.. The bathroom was great, and the minibar well stocked. All of the lights, air conditioning and drapes were operated via bedside control panels. We did have two minor issues - one with the bathroom lights not turning off and the other with the toilet not flushing properly - both were quickly resolved by maintenance. Overall, my major pet peeves were with the ridiculous prices in the outlets - which were easily avoided by going into the several malls that were connected to the hotel. Additionally, they had a fabulous pool and spa area - but you had to pay extra to access the hot tub/steam room/sauna/fitness centre facilities.

What I found so nice was that all the staff, from very efficient houskeepers to the numerous and very nicely presented staff on duty in the lobby, smiled and greeted you genuinely whenever your paths crossed. One example of the standard of service is when I ordered room service one night. It was only a salad and pizza however the meal was wheeled in on a table complete with complimentary small prawn 'taster' and four different types of bread. I had ordered an ice cream dessert and when I placed the order with room service the lady suggested that they deliver the icecream separately half an hour later so that it didn't melt while I was eating the main course! Sure enough, exactly half an hour later it was delivered. This standard of efficiency was repeated in every contact I had with the hotel staff. As others have said, the location is perfect for exploring Singapore and a little tip for those like me who don't go for big hotel breakfasts.

I bore with it through the 4 nights as the hotel was fully booked and their were no other rooms available. Another issue was that the ceiling outside the bathroom was leaking quite profusely for three of the four nights I was there. Something to do with the air conditioning unit. It was a bit of a hassle to need to keep calling for the engineers to come up to take a look and fix it, but I put up with it as each time I thought it was fixed for good.

I am in Singapore at least twice a year, and have tried several 5-star hotels, and the best so far is the Fairmont. I will always stay here in the future, if they continue to maintain their exceptional standards. The location is perfect: within the Raffles Mall complex, with the City Hall MRT Station right below the mall. It is a short walk (5-10 mins) to several other malls (Marina Square, Suntec, City Mall), and just 5 minute walk to Funan, the IT Mall for all your electronic/computer needs. The Esplanade, where shows and musical events are often staged, is practically next door to the hotel. The buffet breakfast is awesome, the selection wide and varied. And breakfast is until 11:00am; a consideration if you want to sleep in late. And I cannot say enough about the rooms and bathrooms: large rooms, very comfortable wide double beds with the softest and whitest sheets, well laid out bathroom with fluffy white towels and robes, and a good selection of amenities. Complimentary bottled water provided, and if you need more, just ask. An additional word about the bathroom lay-out: I particularly like the fact that the shower area is separated from the tub, but not a separate stall, so you have easy access/reach to the tub. It is a design that really works. Also, the shower includes both the usual hand-held shower, as well as a large \u201crain-shower\u201d, which is a great feature. Perhaps the only small negatives \u2013 and these are very VERY minor \u2013 are the lack of a DVD player in the room, and lousy complimentary coffee. DVD players are fairly standard in several high-end Asian hotels, which recognize the value of having a decent entertainment system for each room. Complimentary coffee: only mediocre instant coffee in sachets; other hotels already have brewed coffee facilities, using branded coffee like Lavazza. But, I must emphasize these are minor details, and do not deter AT ALL from the fact that this is a truly excellent hotel.

Unfortunately from then on we had problems with the shower with no hot water and no pressure - every time we asked it to be fixed we were promised it would be fixed. Pleading, begging, screaming didnt work; asking to be changed to another room didnt work. Finally Shaik came back from his exile and immediatly came to the room saw that the shower wasnt right and immediatly upgraded us to a suite. That was a good response but after 9 days it was a bit late. I actually showered in the gym 3 times just to have a hot shower - and the worst was Shaik admitted all my calls, request and complaints were sitting there on the system despite reception continually denying this. I guess if u go here try and get Shaik to look after u because the rest of the reception staff were like brain dead zombies (not unusual in sing) you might be ok. Even Shaik himself as manager asked them to deliver a vase 3 times and it never arrived hahaha. As for the rest of the hotel - rooms were very good size and seem to have been renovated; bathrooms were very large (but pointless when they dont work); balconies. The common areas were a little dated. Breakfast was very good with huge range to choose from (esp in Prego). Gym is very good for those wanting workout and the wet spa area was also very handy. Swimming pool was ok, tennis courts were good. Used room service and this is one area where the service was outstanding. Used laundry several times - got my initial order wrong (despite explaining 4 times) but afterwards was very good. Various eateries to choose from and we ate at the schezuan ct (both the restaurant and the cafe are very good); kopitiam - good for a cheapie but u will get the same food at a hawker centre much cheaper again. Through the President club we received free internet and for only $10 hired the fitness gear which was cleaned everyday (h/w this is a bit of a drama as no one at the hotel seemed to know how it works). Location is great and is connected to shopping centre and plenty of bars and restaurants around there (if u want service worse than this hotel try double bay next door it was so bad u just laughed). So after a 2 week stay - great first day followed by a week of absolute pain (to say that front desk serice was inept would be a compliment!) followed by 4 good days to finish left us feeling very mixed. Could have been a great stay - but after initial promises of potential room upgrade and weekly surprises that were not delivered on and then the unresolved plumbing problems we were very angry and this was softened by the royal treatment being laid put from Shaik on the last 4 days and we left in better spirits.

I have visited Singapore on several ocassions in the past 30 years and stayed in backpacker hotels right through to other 5 star hotels. However the Fairmont stood out in the reviews and its location on top of Raffles City Shopping Centre and the City Hall MRT station made it the best combination possible. Prior to making my 11 night booking I joined the complimentary President's Club and was offered many privileges free to members of this Fairmont club. It was a smart decision, we received complimentary buffet breakfasts, our room was upgraded from where we had a fantastic view over Raffles, and the new Marina Bay area and casino. So much to look at from our own private veranda. We had free internet, turn down service and bottled water. The room was very comfortable, the bed so comfy I wanted to pack it in my suitcase and take it home. The rain forest shower head was a dream to shower under after living in drought ravaged Australia. Location was great, access to the supermarket and shops underneath the hotel was by escalator, as was the MRT. WE had 12 days in Singapore and still did not manage to see everything or get bored for a single moment. High lights of our stay besides the delicious breakfasts by the pool at Crocodile Pear were the middle of the night sorties to the Mustaffa Centre a 24 hr department store in Little India (Farrer Park MRT station), and a visit to the sky garden on top of the Marina Sands Hotel. Food is cheap and delicious , getting around by MRT efficient and safe at all hours. The different ethic areas are well worth visiting, just coming to Singapore and shopping in Orchard Road is to waste a visit to Singapore. It has so much more to offer than a shopping stop over.

Our short run at the breakfast buffet before our morning flight was also delicious, especially the fruit and cheeses, catered to many international tastes and left us craving more.

The sun was just beginning to rise and we had a full view of Suntec, the Singapore Flyer, and Singapore casino right from our balcony. The view was unbeatable! The balcony makes it much easier to take pictures without having to photograph the glass window! Room was clean, bathroom spotless blanc white as usual. Only complaint - The hotel should probably check the rain shower heads as ours had green rust all around it and I didn't feel like I wanted to shower with rusty water. But water pressure is very good for a strong shower/bath. The mueller harris toiletries are still there OMG! but I think they smell less like liquid detergent at the moment.... Fluffy white bathrobes and slippers provided, as well as a in room safe and coffee/tea making facilities. We had nightly turn down service and the staff would leave a lovely fresh orchid by the ice container. Cannot praise the spa staff enough, the girls are very attentive and good at their work. Worth every penny I paid for the treatment. Hotel staff are very friendly esp the nice man with the turban who kept opening the doors for me and called the bellboy to assist me with my shopping bags! Had booked a room with breakfast at Prego downstairs. The food spread (western, asian, continental) was pretty good and refilled quickly. Most days we took the mrt everyday for a few bucks, and one day we took the Singapore airlines hop on hop off bus from suntec city around the island for less than S$8 per person, very good value. Very good location for access all over the island including chinatown, little india and sentosa. Walking distance to clarke Quay and marina bay, so we could walk to the Flyer and down to the merlion. Hotel is located right on top of the City hall mrt station and raffles city shopping complex. Only too bad that the restaurants and shops at the raffles city mall open around 10am, so we were walking all around the deserted place looking for a proper breakfast. There is a supermarket at the basement of the mall where I got drinking water and alcohol (at half the price of the minibar!!) as well as a good money changer who gave pretty good exchange rates. Check-out was very quick, and we were at the airport within 20 mins and had a very enjoyable ride with a talkative cab driver who told us everything about singapore politics! Overall, the hotel has greatly improved since my last stays. I hope the management keeps up with their standard and thank you to the Fairmont team for making our stay so enjoyable.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cnot really 5*\u201d", "Author": "MichaelofArabia", "ReviewID": "UR64252027", "Content": "Checked in at 10.30 am and was told that the booked deluxe room was not ready.

Went by taxi from the Chiangi Airport, cost SGD 27:- (approx Euro 14:-) at around 19:00 hrs a Friday early evening. We had a Deluxe room (no 1533) in the South Tower (15th floor), with a magnificent view over parts of the Marina Bay; the Padang (the park belonging to the Singapore Recreation Club); the War Memorial Park; the modern financial district with the glassy skyscrapers etc. We found the location to be nice. Had no problems walking to the areas around Clarke Quay and the Fullerton Hotel (which is an incredible nice building). We even went by feet to China Town. However, the heat was very tough (even for the locals) with daily temperatures around 35 Centigrade. Next to the Fairmont is the famous Raffles Hotel. Off course we had Singapore Slings at the famous bar, where we even threw peanut shells on the floor. Very touristic\u2026the price was ridiculous: SGD 104:- (approx Euro 54:-) for the two drinks! Directly connected to the Fairmont is a large shopping mall (there are a lot of them around), this one even with a MRT station. Very easy access; cheap to travel with; extremely clean; very well marked with signs at every station. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, instead we went down to the shopping mall in the basement of the Fairmont and hade really good coffee and sandwiches, yoghurt etc. At reasonable costs. Very nice is that the hotel has a swimmpingpool outside at the 5th floor (sharing that one with the neighbour - really large - Swisshotel the Stamford). We used it with delight! Not crowdy at all during our stay. The Chinese New Year was celebrated during our stay. A lot of shops were closed for a couple of days, and a lot of people had left the city (which could be noticed when looking at the traffic). Fine for us! We walked around and explored the city. The Sentosa Island was a disappointment, like Disney World. The two last days of our stay the business (shopping, traffic etc.) were back as normal and we could do some shopping. It was very nice to see all the large Chinese families out at the restaurants; the big fire-works; outdoor entertainment etc. The Fairmont Singapore was very nice and we would recommend it.

Modernised rooms with plasma TV and sound system. We stayed twice in the last 10 days and the first two nights were given an upgrade to a \u201cRaffles Deluxe\u201d room which was on a corner and attractive in layout if a little cramped with a large TV/stereo cabinet, desk & tables. The hotel offers a good range of dining outlets and those that we tried were very good, but Singapore being a food capital of the world, it was often tempting to eat out. The upgrade gave us access to a lounge for breakfast and pre dinner snacks & drinks (even the Moet is on the house). When we revisited the hotel a week later, we weren\u2019t upgraded but asked for a standard room in the south tower which we were given. This room was designed to the same high standard but was quite a bit larger than the corner rooms. The lobby is large and well staffed so the check in and check out process was prompt and efficient. The Fairmont is our favourite hotel in Singapore, is in an excellent location above City Hall MRT station & shopping centre and right next door to Raffles Hotel and Chijmes with it\u2019s large range of dining and entertainment. For \u201cproper\u201d local food, the Victoria Road Food Centre is 10 minutes walk away. A must do in the hotel is to visit the New Asia Bar on the 72nd floor of the adjacent sister hotel, Swissotel Stamford for cocktails or better still some champagne. The hotel regularly has a champagne promotion and a bottle cost S$77 plus tax which is a bargain for a five star hotel venue like this. There is something special about sipping bubbly overlooking Singapore from such a height although the best views over the business district towers and Boat Quay are reserved for diners in the restaurant that occupies that side of the top floors. Finally a top tip is to join the Fairmont Presidents Club (free via www.fairmont.com) and get complimentary internet (log in to charge to room as normal then discounted at check out). If you forget to join before you get there, it\u2019s no problem to log into the internet clicking the \u201ccharge to room\u201d option, visit the Fairmont website, join up and get a membership number and give that to the reception when you check out and the (expensive) internet charges will be removed from your bill.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore", "Title": "\u201cnear to Santosa.....\u201d", "Author": "Ankitjain", "ReviewID": "UR61080023", "Content": "Easy connectivity and comfortable at very competative rates.......", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cNot Fairmont Quality\u201d", "Author": "patricia_oq", "ReviewID": "UR61004423", "Content": "I am a Fairmont President Club Card Holder and travel to many Fairmont's around the world, this is certainly one of the worst. 1.

Just grab your laptop and go to Starbucks downstairs it's free. Eating in the hotel can be quite expensive as well, but there are so many restaurants to choose from you don't have to eat there only if you want to have romantic dinner.

I was thoroughly impressed with everything about this hotel and would love to have the opportunity to stay here again. It is very difficult to find anything negative to say about it. The location is great, centered in a large shopping and restaurant district, a huge variety of shops and eateries to spend your money on. Orchard Road is only about 15-20min walk from the hotel. For those who like to run/walk, the riverside promenade and Fort Canning Park are only a couple of blocks away and make for excellent places to exercise at sunrise or sunset. The trip to the airport only takes about 20 min. The rooms are large and roomy and very well outfitted with large flat-screen TVs, computer desks, mini-bar, safe, and ironing facilities. All the furniture looked to be new and the room was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. No problem at all with road noise or hallway noise. There were beautiful views from the balcony overlooking the Singapore skyline - magical at night! The internet connection was slow and expensive, probably my only complaint about the hotel. The bathroom was spacious and well-outfitted, with all kinds of soaps, shampoos, mouthwash, etc. provided. I didn't dare use the minibar as the prices were grossly inflated, as is often the case in these top-end hotels. I found everything that I needed cheaply at the local 7-11. The fitness center was one of the best that I've ever used. There was a well-equipped free-weights area and just about every weight machine you could ever imagine, all new model Cybex. A separate cardio room had a large variety of high quality treadmills, elliptical trainers, and stationary bikes. About 8 TVs were mounted on the front wall allowing you to watch whatever program you want using the provided headphones. Use of the fitness facility is free to guests. The service at ths hotel was outstanding! From the moment I arrived until the moment I left, everything was taken care of with a smile. All staff were very helpful and friendly, always happy to answer questions and assist. Check-in and check-out were a breeze - very efficient. Overall, I had an excellent stay here and would stay here again given the opportunity. I highly recommend it to all other travellers.

Stayed at this hotel primarily as we had a fantastic christmas deal with the Feed at Raffles card which got us a room at S$200 per night, together with the positive reviews here. The only slight glitch was at check-in. I had called the day prior to check in to request for an early 12 noon check in which was acceded. However when I checked in at 1.30pm, the staff said that they could only offer me a twin room with a bay view or a king room without a bay view (I had requested for a king room with a bay view at the point of reservation) at the time. However, they tried very hard to accommodate my requests and could get me the room I preferred with a 30 min wait, which I was ok with. I also mentioned at the time that it was my partner's birthday, so they said they could arrange something special if I could wait another 30 min extra. Upon entering our room, we were pleasantly surprised with a small pot of lilies and birthday balloons, and a full bottle of Moet champagne! Not sure if we got this as I was a Fairmont President Club member, but it sure was generous of them and much appreciated. One of the staff also came to our room, introduced himself and ensured that we had everything we wanted. The room was spacious and the bathroom was posh with a very nice bathtub for a bubble bath. The decor was modern, though one could tell that it was a refurbished room (the hotel has been around for a long time under different management). Amenities were plentiful, generous and frequently topped up. Housekeeping came in frequently enough (but only when we were out) to keep the room clean throughout the day, and the turndown service at night was appreciated. Breakfast at Prego's included a wide spread which was partially varied on the 2 consecutive mornings we dined.

The reception staff confirmed our check out time as 3 pm and we were given the use of the hospitality lounge - free tea/coffee/water - great for late flights.

Well, I guess my email to the hotel couple weeks prior helped but still this little gesture can make a big difference esp. on our first impression of the facility. The rooms (one with king bed and one with 2 doubles) are nicely decorated to convey a contemporary style with grace and elegance, with just the right lighting to accentuate the decorations. The swimming pool is not large but it's big enough as most guests are sunbathers more than swimmers. They also have a kiddie pool for the young one. There are 2 tennis courts also but we didn't use them. We also did not use the fitness center but it looks very decent with more than enough new equipments for a good workout. The fitness center also provides headsets to you which is nice touch. The location can't be beat whether you are on foot, or use the subway, or taxi. Raffles city is right in the complex, and the connecting underground halls will lead you to SunTec plaza, or Esplanade area. So shopping options are plentiful and it sure beats walking outside in the heat. We loved the food court on the 3rd floor of the Raffles city, as well as the restaurants in the lower B1 floor. Tried the DinTaiFung place that serves famous dumplings and chicken soup originally from Taiwan and they were very tasty and (almost) just as good as the original ones in Taipei. Overall, our stay at this hotel was a memorable experience.

The hotel really does live up to its 5 star rating, and is well situated in an established part of Singapore directly across the road from the original Raffles Hotel and directly above the excellent Raffles City Shopping Centre and adjacent train station. The entrance to the hotel is impressive and from the moment you arrive, porters are there with a warm greeting to help with your luggage.

The rooms are spotlessly clean and very well equipped and furnished, down to bedside remote control units for curtains, lighting, air-conditioning etc. The rooms have safes (complimentary), bath robes, slippers, tea / coffee and a well stocked reasonably priced mini bar. The bathrooms are excellent with white marble tiles and glass fittings, including a bath and adjacent wet shower area incorporating a rainforest shower. The Raffles Inc rooms included a nightly turn down service, with orchid flowers being left on the bed, and the ice bucket filled. We also had the use of the Raffles Inc. Executive Lounge on the 23rd floor where breakfast was served between 6.30am and 10.30am and also where cocktails and canap\u00e9s were served between 5.00pm and 8.00pm - a very nice start to the evening! We chose to have breakfast in the Alligator Pear Restaurant on the 8th Floor overlooking the outdoor Pool and there was an excellent choice of hot and cold food. The hotel has several good restaurants and it is also possible to take meals in the original Raffles Hotel and charge them to your room (reservations needed) \u2013 we enjoyed a meal in the Raffles Long Bar Steak House.

We had booked a Fairmont room on the internet (their lead in room type) and were informed at the desk that as we were early one of these rooms was not available but if we upgraded to a superior room type we could have a room straight away. This was appealing so we upgraded, however I didn't appreciate being told that the 'Fairmont' rooms are classic rooms and the explanation was that since they were first done in the 80's that nothing had really been changed etc etc trying to put us off the room and pushing us to upgrade. - has a hotel of this grade, charging over \u00a3120 for a room really not changed carpet etc for over 20 years? perhaps not, I didn't see the Fairmont rooms in North Tower. Anyway we were taken to our superior room (in South Tower), we had requested a non smoking room however the room we were shown to really stank of cigarettes and there was a bottle full of butt ends on the balcony. So the valet with the luggage rang down and arranged another room for us which was a good smoke free superior room. It was very kind of the reception to call us to double check the room was good and as a goodwill gesture they gave us breakfast included which was very unexpected.Unfortunately the internet did not work inour room the entire stay and one day we waited an hour and a half for someone to call back about fixin it- they told us we should use another cable if we had one as theres must have a problem!-not great. we tried their business centre which had its own internet problems, we eventually went to an internet cafe in little India which worked perfectly at about a tenth of the price of the business centre! (check out Banana Apolo restaurant in little india) Overall our stay was very good, the Ink bar and its staff were excellent- great cocktails, the breakfast by the lobby was very good, not such good selection or service if you take breakfast by the pool.

The raffles shopping centre attached to the hotel has loads of choice and we had excellent (if pricey) massages at the willow spa at the hotel. the rooms were kept spotless and we were able to leave luggage at the hotel until our return from Thailand in 3 weeks time. All in all a very good hotel, its just a little bit of a shame that there are few Asian accents- it reflects the brand very well but doesn't give you a true flavour of traditional Singapore.

The next morning I asked for directions to a nearby venue - the staff didn't just direct me, they actually walked me out of the hotel and all the way to my destination. This happened more than once. Throughout my stay the staff would appproach me and ask if they could be of any assistance. The room (a standard Fairmont Room) was spotless (it actually gleamed) and beautifully appointed (robe, slippers, the works), large flat screen television - even stereo sound system in the bathroom. The ourdoor pool was quite large enough to swim laps in the morning. I recommend the Italian Restaurant on the 1st Floor for breakfast - delicious. Of course, perhaps the biggest draw for the Fairmont is it's location. What you've heard is true. It's sits right on top of a MRT (Metro) hub, from which you can reach anywhere in the city - quickly and cheaply. Additionally, the hotel is connected to a very large and modern shopping mall. Besides shops, the mall contains many excellent and affordable eateries. I suggest an evening drink at the bar atop the Stamford Hotel (next door). The view is amazing!

A welcome change from the busy and noisy hotels used by tourist groups. We upgraded to a Signature room, it was enormous and had every facility a discerning traveller could require. The hotel shares 2 pools with the adjoining Swissotel Stamford with its 70 floors crowned by the Equinox bar and restaurant ,which gives the best views over Singapore for the price of a drink-though not cheap. The Fairmont was quiet, but is in the middle of everything in this growing Marina area being on top of one of Singapore's best shopping centres, across the road from Raffles, Chijmes a converted school now the home of numerous quite good and reasonably moderate restaurants. It is a short walk to Suntek City and Marina Square -more shops and restaurants,and an easy walk to the vast selection of dining facilities on Boat Quay on the shores of the Singapore River. The Fairmont is also right on top of the MTR rail system which gets you everywhere on the island, and very cheaply. Recommended things to do- take the \"Hop on Hop Off\" Bus or Hippo Tours round city sightseeing and orientation, more shopping in Orchard Road and at the new Ion Shopping complex-which has ALL the designer labels if you are looking for them, we weren't, the Botanic Gardens and its Orchid Garden, Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari (separate from the Zoo), the Singapore Flyer (their \"big wheel\") and of course take in the cultural and eating kaleidoscope of the Chinese, Malay, Indian and British Colonial culures which made this city what it is today.

We were in fact quite spoilt. The staff are very professional and quietly go about their work quietly and to a very high standard. We upgraded to the club room which I would strongly recommend. They served Moet and Chandon Champagne and other French wines as well as various spirits. Unfortunately they don't serve cocktails as they say they are limited in space. The food between 5.00pm and 8.00pm is very delicious and of a high quality. There is plenty of choices and the staff are very efficient. One guy was our particularly nice, his name was something like manu... They were dressed in special motor sports outfits due to the F! being held this week. During the day there are plenty of soft drinks and muffins available as well as tea and coffee. The coffee is not the best due to the whitener they use. It is a pleasant place to sit and take in the views. There is only one computer but was always available when we needed it. The staff at the front counter will assist you with any questions. The conciearge service could be a little better. He was pleasant and helpful enough but always on the phone when we were at the desk. The rooms are fantastic. They are spacious and have plenty of emenities. The shower is a little strange being next to the bath with no proper recess. The bathroom was meant to be large but we found it to be of an average size. The coffee machine was great but again there was only powdered whitener available so I would suggest buying some milk if you can fit it into the fridge. The turn down service was a luxury, with an orchard left on our bed each night. On arriving to our room we found a huge bowl of fruit and a special box of chocolates left for us, a very nice touch. The automatic blinds were great and easy to use the control system. The coffee machine ran out of water so we called for assistance, to our surprise they filled the system with bottled water even though the water in Singapore is fine to drink but it certainly does make a better cup of coffee. They even supply an electric jug if you want a cup of tea. They gave us a room with a view of the bay and it was even better than the view in the club room. Breakfast at Prego was great. They no longer allow you to go to the Swiss Cafe if you have breakfast included in your rates. I really enjoyed the fresh strawberries and blueberries available. The coffee here is perfect and you have a choice of various varieties such as latte and a choice of teas. The croisants were the nicest I have had. All the food was very good. We didn't dine at the club or the pool cafe for breakfast simply because there wasn't as much choice. The only fault was the selection of cold meats looked dry but I gather not many people eat them, it seems that they are provided to add the Italian touch. Try their orange cream on some fresh fruit, it is delicious. They even had a honeycombe on a stand and fresh honey was dripping from it. The breads and muffins are good but with so many other choices available we did not fill up on them. The foyer is pretty drab and not very exciting or luxurious, I guess it is just a more modern and arty style. The best thing was the King size bed. It is the most comfortable bed I have had the pleasure of sleeping in and after all considering the length of time spent in it, it is an important aspect. Check out the Willow Spa Stream, even if you don't use the spa massages available it is still a treat. The spa's are great and the amenities are of a high class, same as the gym.

The room itself was spacious, of course neat and clean and after all very well organized. I even understood the table desk remote control without endless trying. Yes, there's a fantastic flatscreen tv with a good range of programmes including e.g. HBO. The bathroom: Probably the largest bathroom I've ever had in a hotel. Bathtub, shower, scales, toiletries, you name it. The lounge: A wonderful experience. Never too crowded, always relaxed, very stylish and the staff so welcoming, smiling and helpful. Always descrete in the background but at hand in a second, just give them a smile. The lounge even has a seperate business meeting room to ensure perfect privacy for those being around not only for the delicious snacks. Here's some advice: - The internet is quite expensive - if you are not a member of the Fairmont President Club. So just sign up in the lobby. It's for free, and apart from other advantages wifi or cable internet is now complimentary. - Make sure you have a hotel business card at hand when it comes to the taxis. The hotel had been renamed several times and drivers do have their problems with the new name. - Don't miss the mall. There a several eating options. Finally, five stars for the Fairmont and a really wonderful stay.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with very good service staff !\u201d", "Author": "ConradCopperCCC", "ReviewID": "UR38423230", "Content": "Swift check in.

This was also my first stay in a Fairmont room (North Tower) which I thought was way better than the South Tower Deluxe, since the bathroom is smaller hence more space in the living area, and lounge chair fits the body angle just right. The squarish mini sofa in Deluxe rooms isn't conducive for lazing or relaxing, so a complete waste of space imo, looks nice though. Do take note the room given was on 23rd floor, so amenities in lower floor rooms could be be different. The rooms also come come with green features such as a separate bin under the work table for 'recyclables', and electricity is almost instantly cut off when key card is removed from the slot. Also during check-out, instead of printing the bill on sheets of paper, and then slotting them into an envelop/folder which most people will throw away, FS' invoices can be turned into A6 size foldaways with the logo infront and 'express checkout options' at the back.

The deluxe room is very spacious but do not give me feeling of a 5* hotel. Check-in: Is a bit slow but the hotel provides fresh fruit punch for guests waiting for the queue. Room: Stayed at the south tower (the renovated rooms), however, the room still looks old. Very spacious room with balcony overlooking Suntec city, soundproofed walls, large screen TV (not sure how many inch) with HBO, Bloomberg, Discovery channels, plus few others. Double bedroom comes with 2 mini sofa, king bedroom comes with a couch (saw loads of stains though). I would expect a 5* hotel to provide soft bed linens with higher tread counts, bed sheets are a bit rough. The room takes a while to cool and the air-conditioner minimum temperature is 20\u00b0c, which can be a bit warm as the room is quite big. Bathroom: Very spacious with bathtub and a very big showerhead. Hotel provides a lot of toiletries like shampoo, moisturizer, shower gel, shower cap, comb, cotton buds, etc. Breakfast: There are 2 floors serving breakfast, one is at Prego (1st floor) & the other at Alligator Pear (8th floor) that serves organic food. We had our breakfast at Prego, it was ok but not the best breakfast so far. Spread includes porridge, hams, salad, fruit juices, bacons, waffles, cereals, fried noodles, miso soup, scramble eggs, etc. If your room do not come with breakfast, eat else where, not very fantastic for a price tag of $40 including taxes & surcharges.

During past trips, I've stayed at the Ritz Carleton (twice), the Grand Hyatt, St. Regis (twice) and the Holiday Inn. I've always had a great experience in Singapore and felt that both the Ritz and St. Regis were as good as it gets in the world. Until this trip. I highly recommend booking the $179 SGD transfer through the hotel if you're in a group. You'll be met at your flight with an escort, taken to the JetQuay VIP terminal, and enjoy a massage in one of Osim's best chairs while your luggage is located and loaded into the hotel's waiting BMW 7-series limo. My two family members were thrilled with their massages while I enjoyed Fiji water and sent all the e-mails I had worked on in the plane. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by one of the staff, and escorted to our room, with cool towels prior to getting on the elevator, and fresh juice at the room. I highly recommend an upgrade to the Raffles Inc. floors for additional amenities (breakfast + cocktails) As a Fairmont Presidents Club member, they had free gym clothes to borrow and Internet was complimentary. I had used one of my upgrades and we enjoyed a stunning suite - if you want to treat yourself to a bathroom as big as a NYC hotel room, book a Plaza Suite - which includes two balconies and a great view of the city - we were on the 25th floor. Two modern LCD TVs provided ample entertainment - and the housekeeping was typical Singapore perfection - arranging shoes perfectly and folding all the clothes my younger family members had scattered about :) What really takes the 'cake' is that my birthday had been 2 days earlier, and they brought me a fantastic cake and had two of the staff members, including one of the managers, sing happy birthday to us in my room! They even took a photo and brought a framed print of it to me as a memento of the trip. I've stayed at Starwood Hotels around or on my birthday for the last 5 years attending a conference, and I never had any kind of special recognition... let alone a birthday card signed by a dozen staff members! We had breakfast at all three locations offered - the main floor, Alligator Pear by the pool, and the Raffles lounge, and it was excellent everywhere. I recommend Alligator Pear for a quieter experience with a smaller selection of many organic options, and the main lobby for families with a fresh juicer bar. The lounge is great for meetings but there's a 15 minute wait for any fresh eggs as they understandably bring them from the other restaurants. Overall every single staff encounter - from the bell staff, front desk staff (money exchanges, etc.), restaurant servers, and cleaning team - was exceptional. They were friendly and kind, and enjoyed humorous conversations with my younger relatives (when even I might have expected them to be less patient or gracious!) I only wish that the service and training at our very best hotels here in North America could compare. I can't imagine staying anywhere other than the Fairmont on my next trip.

Chimes is also just around the corner which is a development built around a church which has loads of restaurants and bars. The bars put up big screens to show the sport and Harry's Bar definitely leans towards Liverpool supporters. In fact, we watched the Liverpool Chelsea game on 1 Feb and the atmosphere was fantastic. After we'd won all the supporters, both Asian and European - all wearing Liverpool shirts - sang You'll Never Walk Alone and it was fantastic and very emotional. If you're a Liverpool supporter and there's a game in - usually at some ungodly hour - go there it's great fun! Boat Quay and Clarke Quay are definitely worth a visit and most of the bars and restaurants are located here.

(and after reading reviews on Trip Advisor) It didn't disapoint in any way. We previously stayed at the Sheraton Towers 4 years ago and enjoyed that, but wanted a more central location for 10 days. It was a wonderful experience, we felt so relaxed after our stay in SIngapore and that was certainly due to the Fairmont. We will definetly return next year for another holiday in this wonderful city. Many friends had said 10 days was a long time in SIngapore, but we still haven't been to the zoo, Changi or Sentosa, so there is plenty to do there! Our room was on the 21st floor (quick lifts) in the South Tower. Very comfortable and quite spacious with a view on the pool side looking out towards the Padang. The Raffles City Shopping Mall attached is lovely, with a sensational Japanese restaurant bazzar downstairs. The turndown service was great, lovely to come back each night to tidy room, soft lights and music and fresh towels. The bathroom was good, large with a goood sized bath, and a good shower that did splash a bit onto the rest of the floor. The airconditioner was silent and easily adjustable from the bedside console, as were the curtains and lights. Our room came with breakfast included and we alternated between the more traditional restaurant and the poolside buffet, service was personable and very responsive. We felt very well cared for. The buffets were wonderful, fresh tropical fruit juices individually prepared, cooked western breakfast on demand and Chinese and Malay fare with a wonderful array of pastries, the fresh fruits were outstanding. Breakfast on til 11 am as well helped jetlagged guests from Australia! The Fairmont staff were always welcoming and responsive. We had an extended checkout until 4 on the day we were leaving, and the offer of using the courtesy lounge by one of the staff whilst we were sitting in the foyer with our suitcases waiting for a taxi. Cleaning staff were always evident, and housekeeping responsive to our requests for cleaning whilst we were at breakfast. Sheets crisp and changed daily, (only on the last day of 10 days was a card left to say if we didn't need sheets changed to leave card on the bed, sure more water could've been saved!) My husband swam every afternoon in the circular pool on the 8th floor, never too crowded and for some reason a pleasant breeze blowing! Position is wondeful, CityHall MRT is at Raffles City Shopping Mall which is attached to the Fairmont. We walked every day, walking distance to the National Museum, History Museum, Peranakan Museum all highly reccommended.

Been to Singapore many, many times and this was first visit to this hotel. Booked corporate rate of SGD305 plus local taxes per night through company (preferred hotel) but not worth it. Check in was fine, efficient and friendly. Great location but really shabby decor and very, very dated. Shocked to see graffiti on one of the doors in the hall way on the way to the room. Not typical for Singapore. Room on 7th floor is large, corner room but looks like a scene from a 1980's Dynasty show, all I need is my shoulder pads to really fit in. Dated furniture, dirty marked walls, wall paper is that material like stuff....like wool stuck to wall paper. Lots of gold coloured metal lamps, dated and battered furniture. Air conditioning has no adjustable temperature setting that I can find, still quite hot and humid, not good in Singapore. No wifi and cable link costs SGD28 plus tax per 24 hours.......even though I just needed an hour for work e-mails. It\u2019s SGD28 for 24 hours minimum! Booked for 5 days but checking out tomorrow and moving to one of my regular hotels down the street for same price or less. If you get this room for SGD200ish, it's OK. If you are used to decent Singapore hotels, stick to Conrad, Pan Pacific or Mandarin Oriental. I could get the same rate or cheaper and they are more comfortable, modern and better maintained.

If anything I think the customer service has gone up a notch - certainly in the lobby area the staff seemed more attentive. I always book through a local Singapore agent and have never experienced a problem with a booking and manage to obtain an all inclusive rate. I would strongly recommend booking a room in the South Tower as these are more modern and are well worth the extra few dollars. One of the many things I love about the Fairmont is that you can step outside your room onto the balcony and take in the atmosphere and city buzz from above and the views are just amazing. For someone who used to live in Singapore I think that the location is just perfect - shopping centre and MRT attached (just 3 stops to Orchard Rd), within walking distance to Suntec City, the Esplanade, Sim Lim, Bugis, Boat Quay, as well as all of the 'just over the road' places such as Raffles Hotel and Chijmes.

Halfway through the week, it went from being called the Raffles Plaza to become the Fairmount. I stayed on the Raffles Inc. floor (25th or 26th floor) in the North Tower. It was a huge corner room with big 2 big balconies (1 towards CHIJMES and the other towards the Financial District) and great finishings. I did not see the issues other reviewers saw about tired carpeting and bathroom, everything looked renovated (and trust me that I looked). I expect to be blown away by 5-star hotels. This hotel is a 4-star level. The biggest complaint is that the internet service was not free. One had to call reception, get a code, enter it everyday (and some days it did not work, but we were reimbursed), and I don't remember the price but it was not cheap. For a high-tech country like Singapore, that is just ridiculous. Sure we had access to the internet in the business lounge, but who wants to wait around for a computer to free up and have people lurking around? I loved the mattress and the electronic controls in the room. A few disappointments when the hotel changed management: 1/ the bath supplies offered by Raffles were more exotic and luxurious than the ones offered by Fairmount, 2/ No more chocolates on my pillow! 3/The turndown service became less efficient. The breakfast and \"happy hour\" at the Raffles Inc lounge were phenomenal. All kinds of choices, and all delicious. The service was spotty. We noticed that some customers were mostly ignored, while others were served promptly. Luckily for us, we were always in the latter group.

Great location for everything, although it's faster to walk half a block to get a taxi rather than wait at the hotel door because the traffic blocks the entrance for the taxis.

The lobby has just been refurbed and is impressive. Unfortunately, it is effectively two hotels in one, the North tower and the South tower. The North tower (I am there now) is depressing and faded, with stained acrylic carpets, chipped sanitary ware and drab decor. The bed is really hard and uncomortable. I made mine bearable by using the bedlinen from the other bed in the room as an extra mattress pad. I mentioned this to the receptionist, and she said housekeeping would come to help. No-one came. The airconditioning cannot be controlled by temperature - only fan speed. It was really stuffy in the room and I woke up on my snooker table like bed bathed in perspiration. I have stayed here many times and the AC problem is immensely irritating as it is NEVER effective. There were hairs in the bathtub, and the satin coverlets were dirty. Room service was prompt, but the dish I ordered was not what I was expecting. I think this was my fault rather than theirs, but the items were not charged and there was no fuss either - so kudos for that. All rooms have balconies, but the sliding door doesn't fit well, resulting in traffic noise that requires earplugs. In summary; Rooms: Depressing, grubby, stuffy, beds like pool tables, noisy. Why bother? Better at a youth hostel. I bet the ones in Singapore are clean and well run. The South tower however, is superb, lovely beds, icy air-con, sparking bathrooms, Bose sound systems, flat screen TV, effective sound insulation - I loved staying there. On the Fairmont website there is no way of telling which tower you are in. Honestly, to stay in the North Tower is to waste your money.

We were upgraded from a \u2018Deluxe\u2019 room to an \u2018Executive\u2019 Room on the 22nd Floor. This entitled us to enjoy the \u2018Executive Club\u2019, a lounge offering all-day snacks and free cocktails in the evening- no kids allowed. We have 2 young ones so no value to us. There is also a small gym up there for \u2018Executive\u2019 guests. The room was fine- modern d\u00e9cor, surround sound, flat screen TV, electric curtains, etc.. Nice spacious modern bathroom, king-size shower. We think it a waste to have all linen changed every day but there is really no option but to have ones towels replaced every day as nowhere to hang them up, simply a large basket to throw them in! We had booked a room with king-size bed (and cot) but were given 2 doubles. Best they could do was push doubles together and make up bed with king-size linen. Coffee/tea making facilities- there is a smart expresso machine. If, like us, you drink tea, take your tea bags with you. The 2 provided don\u2019t go far! The cups are designed for an expresso from the coffee maker so you could just about use one bag for 2 cups (there is all-day coffee and tea from the \u2018Executive Club\u2019 (if you don\u2019t have kids!)). With our air con set to its lowest speed and highest temperature (30degC) we were freezing. The \u2018engineer\u2019 was assigned to fix this. The following night with the air con set at its highest speed and lowest temperature (20degC) we were in a sauna bath. The following day the \u2018engineer\u2019 returned- we then returned to the arctic and simply decided to \u2018rug-up\u2019. At least we could open the door on to the little balcony- something you cannot often do in high-rise hotels. Our package included breakfast. Breakfast is standard hotel buffet style. Seems like hotels try to outdo each other for the most obscure dishes for breakfast- you look at half this stuff and wonder just WHO would want THAT for breakfast. If you came down from Mars there\u2019d be something you\u2019d like. No particular reflection on this hotel in particular (there almost ALL the same) but is anyone else out there sick of the breakfast offering of leather for bacon and sausages that look more like they\u2019re boiled than grilled or fried? Whilst I\u2019m about it has anyone ever met one of those motorised toaster machines that makes a piece of toast (as opposed to warmed bread) in one \u2018pass\u2019? Singapore hotels cater for a very cosmopolitan clientele including many UK/American & Australasian clients. Amongst the okra sambal, the sio mai, chicken curry, steamed pork buns, chick pea curry and miso soup there was nothing as simple as baked beans in tomato sauce. On one morning only were there some soggy little hash browns. Amongst the salads, dozens of cold meats and cheeses and fruits I had never even seen before there were no mushrooms saut\u00e9ed, grilled or cooked by any means whatsoever. Take the tea\u2026 the coffee is well and truly stewed. The hotel pool on the 8th floor is great and good for kids including our littlies. There is a separate kids\u2019 pool. The concierge was helpful & forthcoming on tourist info except when we sought info on the harbour cruise. He sent us off to the Esplanade (20 minute walk) which is where he had advised the boats left from. With 2 little kids in tow we trudged the length of the Esplanade. We had another 20 minute walk to the \u2018merlion\u2019 fountain to find where the boats actually DO leave from. Whilst the room was tidy and new some parts of the hotel look a little jaded. The furniture in the \u2018lounge\u2019 off reception are reminiscent of grandad\u2019s favourite old chair you wish he\u2019d get rid of. One benefit of staying here is that the hotel is part of Raffles Square (with THE Raffles across the road) which is full of ritzy stores and restaurants aplenty). Reception is friendly and helpful, the service is generally very attentive.

Maybe they could limit the speed of the free access to 512kbps or something, but asking for more than 20SGD a day for that kind of commodity is not acceptable. - cleanliness: the room itself was quite nice, but it was not very clean. usually i am not very sensible to a little dust here and there, but the cleanliness of that room was sub-standard. for example, there was a lot of dust under the TV commode and it seemed that a guest had a bottle of coke or another sticky beverage explode on the table. the table itself had been cleaned, but the lamp and other parts of furniture were still dirty, as well as the floor where that happened (sticky dried-up drops). also in the bathroom, i would find a long dark hair everyday in the middle of the floor after room cleaning. mold between tiles in the bathroom is not much of a hygiene problem, but it would just look nicer if it was regularly bleached out (a few chlorine every 3-4 months could take care of that problem) the room cleaning staff is not thorough. additionally to finding dust and sticky stains in some places, I found two DVDs hidden by another guest under the bose radio. These were bad-quality porn DVDs, so I left them there. - room service/equipment: the staff should focus on better attention to detail: the remote command of the bose radio was missing the battery and therefore didn't work. - irritating: when you call a lift and briefly press the button, it will light up, but can deactivate if you are too quick. that happened a few times, and was quite irritating, especially because the button lit up, so i thought the life was coming... - while the bad's mattress was ok, I wasn't too satisfied with the pillows, which are apparently filled with a synthetic foam, which caused me to sweat. now the positive: - my request for a non-smoker king size room was granted without trouble. - the staff was quite friendly. - the hotel is situated right next to the historic raffles, and on top a shopping mall and above the MRT (underground) station city hall. - there are direct entrances from levels 2 and 3 of the mall into the elevators, so it is very convenient for getting quickly to the room from the mall without having to pass the lobby. - if you have to check out late, they can give you access to a complementary guest suite (no bed) to wait on your plane. - 2 bottles of water are replaced every day - i will not post a list of everything that worked as expected, you can assume the rest of standard services was provided and working well.

We had previously stayed at the Swissotel the Stamford which is actually in the same hotel-shopping mall complex as the Fairmont. We liked the Swissotel for its great location, and decided to stay at the Fairmont this time because we had a better deal for it on Expedia and it was essentially the same location. The Fairmont is quite a businessman\u2019s hotel: it\u2019s smart, clean and efficient \u2013 but somehow lacks character and charisma. The building, lobby, elevators and rooms are all modern, clean, relatively spacious, but you don\u2019t get much of a sense of occasion or opulence. There\u2019s nothing grand or magnificent about the d\u00e9cor, just functionality. In that sense, I would say this is better suited for those in suits, and maybe less so for those expecting a romantic or exotic holiday. The room was quite large by Asian hotel standards. There was room enough for a cot for baby to be moved in (at no extra cost) and yet leave absolutely plenty of room for all 3 of us (mainly baby) to run around. And the cot was not a flimsy little crib, but a large proper baby\u2019s bed with baby blankets and even a gift soft toy \u2013 nice touch. The furniture was again functional rather than grand or elegant, but at least the chairs were comfortable. The bed was definitely on the firm side \u2013 which I personally like, but which may probably not be to everyone\u2019s tastes. The pillows were agreeably large and long, but they were too soft and shapeless and failed to give good support. I appreciated the cleanliness, but the room did show some wear and tear in places: the cold water faucet leaked a little when turned on, and the carpet was well worn down in the middle of the room (even patched over in one place). The service at the front door is excellent. The porters are exceptionally warm and courteous, and instantly made us feel welcome as we stepped out of the taxi from the airport. Check-in was efficient and reasonably friendly too. Throughout our stay, I was also impressed with being greeted by name every time I called down to the front desk (or \u2018On-call Valet\u2019 as they like to call it). Unfortunately, the good service did not extend to the room cleaners. We stayed for 4-days/3-nights. During that time, we only had our room cleaned ONCE. On one day, we were out almost all morning but came back to the room briefly at around 2pm to get a change of clothes (Singapore is a hot, humid country). The room was not cleaned all morning. We left promptly after changing and did not return until after dinner. But when we got back, not only had the room still not been cleaned, but we got a little note under our door saying that it wasn\u2019t cleaned because we had a \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 sign on the door for the brief period while we were changing. After retiring to our room exhausted after a day out with baby, the last thing we wanted to do was vacate the room again at night while we called the cleaners back for cleaning (assuming anyone was still around to clean after 5pm !). Altogether we received this irresponsible little card on TWO days during our stay, suggesting it was OUR fault that the room wasn\u2019t cleaned. This is unacceptable. Why can\u2019t hotels like this just get their act together and clean the room quickly during the day? Is it unreasonable to expect that at a world class hotel, if the cleaner finds your room occupied when she comes round then she will check again later a second or third time until finally each room on her floor is cleaned? Since when has it become OK to just see a \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 sign once and assume the room cannot be cleaned at any other time of the day? Couldn\u2019t someone simply have politely phoned us in the room to ask when would be a good time for them to clean the room? Sadly, the Fairmont is not the only hotel I\u2019ve stayed in recently to suffer from this lazy attitude towards room cleaning \u2013 but I really would\u2019ve expected better from a decent hotel in a country like Singapore. Having an uncleaned room for half our stay certainly spoiled our stay a fair bit. We didn\u2019t have breakfast in our package. If you like eating, you don\u2019t come to Singapore for bacon and eggs ! Downstairs in the Raffles City Mall alone, you can find a great variety of eateries. Try Kaya Toast, Singapore-style soft boiled eggs, and Kopi-O for a proper local breakfast. The Mall is also directly connected via an underground \u2018city\u2019 to the MRT station and nearby attractions like the Esplanade and Suntec City. Raffles Hotel (home of the Singapore Sling), Chijmes, the old civic center are all literally just across the street. Orchard Road or Chinatown are both just a couple of stops away on the MRT. This convenience of location is exactly what we loved about the Swissotel on our previous trip, and what makes staying here at the Fairmont this time brilliant. With our baby along this time, we really appreciated having a supermarket and some drug stores downstairs so that we could buy all the usual baby products (formula milk, diapers etc) instead of having to carry huge amounts on the flight. We didn\u2019t use the hotel\u2019s facilities much. We were too busy seeing Singapore, tasting its excellent food, visiting the world-famous Zoo, shopping on Orchard Road and so on to bother with the swimming pool etc (we didn\u2019t even bother finding out where the pool was). If you want to enjoy a hotel like a resort, the Fairmont probably isn\u2019t the place for you. If you want a hotel as a convenient base for you to see this remarkable island, then I would recommend this hotel (or the Swissotel) \u2013 with the condition that they sort out their room cleaning service. There was a cable internet connection in the room, but there was a charge. I usually rely heavily on the internet during my trips, but as this was a purely family holiday and the charge looked rather steep, I resisted the urge to use this service on this trip.", "Date": "February 12, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fairmont Singapore", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d301581-Reviews-Fairmont_Singapore-Singapore.html", "Price": "$223 - $490*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">80 Bras Basah Rd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">189560</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "301581", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1f/81/aa/fairmont-singapore-s.jpg"}}
