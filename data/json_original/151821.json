First price is average but the problem of this type of hotels or paradores is the Island Goverment and the tourism company that do not support this type of bussiness. If these places had a good administrator and has a good deals that promote the inside tourism then things work much better.

I love the closet space also the view. For the price we paid for the rooms was expensive for the month we went .But was very clean and nice staff the maid comes daily and gives you clean towels if you needed more towels they would leave it on your bed which was made everyday. There's a coffee maker in room which was a plus. Soda machine around the corner from room. Few small ants running around in bathroom but nothing to fear all you had to do is ask for some ant killer spray and that would solve the problem . Resturant at the hotel but we never went to busy out of the hotel best choice to eat is at the plaza in Quebradilla lots of choices of resturants. Overall the room was nice and no problems . Stood at this place for 2weeks. Has 2 pools they were clean . On the other side of the hotel they have a swing for the love birds to seat and enjoy the view of the ocean.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caguas", "Title": "\u201cGood but not the best, poor service.\u201d", "Author": "traviesa694", "ReviewID": "UR62974575", "Content": "Pros: The room has a spectacular view to the ocean and parts of Guajataca. The king bed was comfortable. There was hot water available. The closet was spacious. The room overall is acceptable. Cons: The a/c was too noisy, too old and too small for a big room. Some of the lamps were not working. The TV was not working. The phone was not working. No refrigerator or coffee maker. No internet access in the rooms!! The bath curtains were dirty. The bathroom is small. The maid did not clean the room. I always leave everything organized so the maid only needs to make the bed and put some clean towels (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m paying). When we complained about this and about the TV they did nothing. Horrible service. The pool is too deep (12ft) and in the kids pool was a huge cockroach. Awful! The tennis court is deteriorated and there are no additional recreational facilities (gym, basketball, ect) The pool hours are from 9am to 5pm when in the majority is from 7am to 9pm. The dinner time was until 8:30PM, usually is between 9:30 to 10 pm! The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all inclusive offer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd did not included the drinks, they never mentioned that! We waited a while for the food to be ready and we were the only guest there! The food was ok but not great. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very boring place to stay.

The hotel was up the mountain, & the dated worn room we rented had a balcony with an exceptional view of the coastline, Guajataca Tunnel and Guajataca Beach. The room provided a clean, stiff, king-sized bed for the night, but the atmosphere was tired, dated, poorly maintained, disappointing at over $100/night. Hot water ran out during the 1st person's evening shower and was non-existent in AM. Jacuzzi tub was broken. Noise from the highway below seemed amplified into our room, and there was major party noise below us well into early morning hours. Our waitress spoke very little English, and apparently she was the cook also. The food allowed us to go to bed without starving, but little more could be added as positive. We passed on breakfast.

We chose the least expensive room and it was crappy - kind of like Super-8 in US but worse. The food was terrible - we only had breakfast there and could not even get freshly made juice (aren't we in Carribean?). The staff did not provide quality service (though one can figure that they are not treated very well). The view indeed is very nice - the hotel is built on the cliff, but there is a highway between the cliff and the beach, so there is a constant humming of the cars. Plus - you can't really walk to the beach. The closest beach is the kind surfers would enjoy (a swimmer's suicide). It's just down the hill (a short drive, though you do need to cross the highway to get there). The closest beach, however, is a 20-25 minute drive. Totally worth going there! I would recommend though finding a place to stay where the beach is. Vistamar is not worth what you pay for it (even when it is the cheapest room rate).", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cPoorodor VIstamar\u201d", "Author": "Lakehouse1", "ReviewID": "UR5424055", "Content": "We chose this place for the location and that's about what it was good for. This is a 1960's vintage hotel that has been marginally kept up. They had a nice pool, but as we were there on the weekend, it was crowded with locals drinking and partying to all hours. The signs say that the pool is supposed to close at 10PM, but the very loud music and drinking, etc. continued all night and morning long and the desk would do nothing to stop it (obviously they get the majority of their business from this activity, so the needs of the tourists are not as important). The rooms were run down - the phone did not work, there were bugs, the bathroom floor was always wet because the shower had cracks that allowed it to leak.
