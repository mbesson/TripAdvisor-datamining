There pool was clean and big. Every morning we recieved room service so we never were without a towel and the cleaning staff was also very nice. On a final note, we ate their breakfast every morning and it was probably the best part because they had everything from fresh donuts to all different kinds of toast (even applebutter!!!!!!) and cereal and a juice machine.

Our only complaint would be the hard mattresses. At least they are not saggy and do not have the multitude of questionable stains that you see at other hotels. Our solution to the hard mattress is to buy a very inexpensive mattress pad and add it to the mattress the next time we stay. I don't know if we will do that, or not...but it has crossed our minds.

My wife commented that she examined the bathroom floor (a habit unique to the female of the species) and pronounced it spotless. She said that if the corners of a bathroom floor are clean, that is a very positive indicator for the rest of the room. The room itself was comfortable with a queen bed, table and two armchairs. The wireless internet worked flawlessly. Several ice machines are available, and a refrigerator can be placed in the room for $5/day. The free continental breakfast is basic, but filling. Twelve Oaks Inn is on a quiet side street, only a block from the very busy \"strip\". Several restaurants are close-by, including a Wendy's, less than a five minute walk. We had no interest in the shows, but a number are quite close-by and a Walgreen's is just a few block east. The staff was friendly and accommodating.

It was L shaped and had alot of space. It didn't have a fridge,microwave, coffee pot or iron that you may find in other places, but it didn't matter to us, we don't usually use that anyway. Where the bed was located made it very quiet and comfortable. My husband even watched TV after i went to bed, and it didn't even bother me, because of where the bed was located.I heard no outside noise, which made it great. I spoke to the manager and he told me that not every room is as big as that one, so if your looking for space get it. But there are family rooms, king size w/ jacuzzis, and even an apartment. We used the internet coupon and paid $49.00 for our room and even stayed an extra night because of the price.
