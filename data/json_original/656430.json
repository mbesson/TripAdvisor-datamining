Having two bathrooms with sinks separate the shower/toilet area was great for us getting ready in the mornings and also for getting the kids ready for bed after swimming at night. The breakfasts in the morning were better and larger than expected. The light dinners were more like a full meal to us. We ate dinner on two of the nights, spaghetti, meatballs, garlic bread, and salad bar one night and chicken fajitas, rice, beans and salad bar the next. My wife and I especially liked the wine and beer they offered. A nice way to end a long day of \"touristy\" adventures.

The hotel is in a shopping center, and easy walk to a good pizza place/beergarden/sports bar called Oggi's, or a Subway, and some other places I can't remember. This was a fairly typical Homewood Suites in terms of the room, which was roomy, clean and comfortable and had many amenities we never had the need to use, and the great free hot breakfast. We were on the first floor, and could hear the people over us more than we would have liked, but t was not a big problem. What set it apart a bit was that the hotel grounds are especially lovely. It is right on the water (not the ocean, but still), beautifully landscaped, and with lots of paths....in fact, the San Diego half-marathon went right by, on hotel grounds.

Anyone who's stayed in a Homewood Suites before will enjoy this location, especially with its outdoor patios and waterfront location. The variety of restaurants within a very short walk is also a plus. I was pleasantly surprised that although the hotel is close to the airport, noise from planes was not an issue, even on the fourth floor. My rating is four stars rather than five for two reasons: 1) The price seems high in comparison to other Homewood Suites we've stayed at, and 2) You pay the same price whether you get a waterfront view or not.

The hotel is in a beautifully developed small mixed residential/cultural/small business neighborhood that was formerly a naval training station. You are in the city without the noise and traffic of an urban area. Many amenities within easy (1/2 mile) walking distance, including a great little supermarket (Von's); a good selection of restaurants, cafes. Everything else we wanted to do--Zoo, Balboa Park, Coronado, beaches--was in easy (10-15 min) driving distance. We had a king suite in the south building, facing the water, with a small balcony. I'd highly recommend the latter two options. There are two L shaped buildings--the north building surrounds the pool and the south building the basketball court. Suite was beautiful, large, very clean, nicely decorated, with an open plan, overlooking the boat channel and walking path. There is a large outdoor terrace at each building. The laundry was a welcome amenity and had front & top loading washer options. Our room was quiet and we were never bothered by noise from other guests or rooms on either side. Yes, there are planes overhead, but we did not find this an issue at the hotel. There are a LOT of planes in San Diego, and we found everywhere we went, every beach, every park, every attraction, had planes overhead. Some great things I didn't expect--there is a (free!) shopping service....just fill out a slip with what you need & hotel staff will pick it up. The evening 'receptions' (M-Th) were full dinners (we enjoyed chicken teriyaki; roast chicken; taco night--skipped the salisbury steak night) and surprisingly good. The breakfast was a cut above the usual hotel fare in both quality and quantity. My daughter, a hotel waffle connoisseur, found the 'make your own' here the best she's had. Staff was unfailingly wonderful. Everyone we encountered had a pleasant greeting. Everyone seemed happy and all were helpful, from the shuttle driver to housekeeping and everyone in between. If you have any forgotten necessities, the front desk will send them up free of charge (we forgot to pack a razor; they brought up some with a small can of shave cream, gratis, even though you could buy similar items in their small pantry/store).

We had a suite with a kitchen, which was great for eating in with the little one. It was very clean, quiet and comfortable. I loved the following about this hotel -1 bedroom suite allowed us to put the toddler to bed, but we could stay up and watch TV without disturbing him! -The free breakfast! This wasn't your typical hotel breakfast. There was eggs, breakfast meat (bacon or sausage), hashbrowns, cereal, waffles, fruit, oatmeal, granola, muffins, cinnamon buns, yogurt, milk, juice, toast, bagels and more! We sometimes made our son a PB&J sandwich at breakfast to take with us for our outings during the day. -The staff was great. Cleaning staff took great care of us. Front staff was good. The hosts at breakfast (Vincent, Nichole and Filli) were awesome. They really took care of us, and cleaned up the mess my young son made while attempting to feed himself. -Parking was included, and well as wifi! There were plenty of spaces available and the WiFi was fast.. What more could you ask for! -Pay washer and dryers available in each building. They were is great condition and working order. -Free supper, including wine and beer, Monday thru Thursday! We only ate the supper once during our stay, and I was very impressed with the quality and taste of the meal. Cajun chicken, black beans with rice and a very tasty/unique potato salad. There was also a selection of fresh veggies and lettuce to make a nice salad. My husband really enjoyed the cold beer... - Starbucks is within walking distance- like 3 min walk from our room-, as well as Subway and other quick-service as well as sit down restaurants. -Von's (Safeway) near-by to pick up groceries. - Cool training ship right next door to check out! -Close to attractions- we got to the zoo, Sea World, Old Town, Cornado island, Gas Lamp quarter and shopping very easily without too much time in the car. (We did have a GPS however). Possible Cons: - We had a car, so it was easy to get to and away from the hotel. I have no idea what they offer in terms or shuttles, or transit. It seems a little out of the way if you don't have a vehicle with you. -Some airplane noise. Because it is close to the airport, you can sometimes hear low flying airplanes.

There were 5 of us (2 adults 3 kids) the first 2 nights we were in a king bed suite as all the 2 beds were gone. We got a rollaway bed for the 2nd night. On the day we moved to the 2 bedroom suite the staff told us to just pack up our stuff and leave it all in the room and they would transfer it over for us. We went out for the day and the room was ready with all our stuff in when we returned including all the stuff from the fridge and freezer and the rollaway bed. There was no charge for the rollaway during the entire stay. The suites are spacious, the maid service excellent. We sat out each morning in the courtyard to eat breakfast. Its 5 minutes from the airport so you hear the planes going over when you are o/s but no noise from them in the rooms. Breakfast was more than adequate, always eggs and some kind of meat, waffles, oatmeal, yogurt, fresh fruit, cinammon buns and muffins, tea, coffee, juice. Dinner 4 nights a week the menu is posted on the fridge in your room was varied and always they were filling up when things got low. It saved us a ton of money that we could then spend on trips. Beer and wine were complimentary. We used the barbecues in the courtyard one night, the pool was great and so was the hot tub. Staff were extremely friendly and i had no complaints about anything. Used the business centre to check emails and would definitely stay here again. The only tip i would say is if you arrive late by plane and want a transfer you need to use a regular call box or cell phone and call the hotel using the local number to arrange for pick up. It stops doing regular trips around 11.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panama City, Panama", "Title": "\u201cYou won't regret your choice\u201d", "Author": "CaramutJane", "ReviewID": "UR122546977", "Content": "The Homewood Suites are in a lovely location on a river very close to the harbour.

We booked one of the two bedroom suites. I am currently a Hilton HHonors Gold member. Location: Finding the hotel was pretty easy, as it was located in Liberty Station, a relatively new development west of the airport. There are a lot of walking/jogging paths and green areas right next to the hotel. The harbor itself is also close by. There are a cluster of restaurants across from the hotel parking lot. If you go for a drive, you can get to a Trader Joe's and Vons in about 2-3 minutes. SeaWorld and Mission Beach are about 10 minutes away. Check-In: We arrived a bit early (3:45pm), so our room was not ready yet. On that note, we were able to check-in online the day before and pick the exact room that we wanted. We opted for a 4th floor (high floor) room in the south building. Hilton Gold HHonors benefits included 2 bottles of water and a 4-pack of Milano cookies. Not bad. The front desk staff was very friendly and efficient. Room: The general condition of the hotel is excellent. It appears to have been built in the past few years. Our particular two bedroom suite had nice furnishings. One room had a king bed and the other had a queen bed. Each bedroom had its own full bathroom. The king bedroom had access to an outdoor balcony with a good view facing north. During our stay, we could see the nightly fireworks at SeaWorld from our room. In between the two bedrooms was a living room/kitchen area. There was plenty of space here. Some of the previous reviews mention the loud air conditioner. Yes, I can see what they mean when it cycles on/off. However, a good trick is to keep the a/c on \"fan\" mode. This keeps the fan blower on constantly, so when the compressor actually kicks in, it won't be as noticeable. Amenities: The property has a pool by the north building and a sport court (basketball court) by the south building. The gym was small but had your normal range of equipment. There are laundry facilities. We had the free breakfast buffet each morning. It was generally a good combination of hot and cold foods. Typical choices included scrambled eggs, meat (sausage or bacon), hash browns, waffles, breads, fruit, cereals, etc. We tried the complimentary dinner on one of the nights. The menu for that night consisted of orange chicken (drumsticks/thighs cooked in an orange sauce) with salad and couscous on the side. Rolls and beverages (wine, lemonade, water) were available. It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was free. Service: The housekeeping staff did a great job and we had no issues. The other staff in the hotel are friendly and helpful. There appears to be a hotel shuttle van that goes to/from the airport. Overall we had a wonderful experience here. The price was a little on the high side, but it was the summer season, so it was expected. We will definitely be back if we visit San Diego in the future.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFor the value, nothing comes close\u201d", "Author": "scwatkins", "ReviewID": "UR117190216", "Content": "Normally, for the rates we've paid at the Homewood Suites for the past 3 years, we'd expect to get something far less clean, pleasant, and professional.

We checked in late this year and so got the slim-Pickens on rooms, but the manager was very understanding and helped us find a bay-view room above the pool the very next morning. One night the people across the hall were being noisy until 1am, so I called the front desk because my kids couldnt sleep. Within 5 minutes, two security guards were the escorting people out and there wasn't another peep. We've thought of staying at another hotel/resort in San Diego, just to mix things up, so that the kids don't get bored with the same place year after year.

It was pretty good as these go, but there was limited seating inside and outside so it was difficult to find a table at times (Maybe add a few more tables outside) And if they could change the fruit in the morning, it would give more choices for folks who don't eat meat. Otherwise, the quality of the food was good, but for us non meat eaters, some pancakes or french toast would have been a nice change from waffles, yogurt and cottage cheese.

There were no tea towels in our room the first time but the big issue was when we took a clean towel out of the pile to dry our child after the bath, it had dried faeces on it! While the front desk person apologised, we felt it needed to be dealt with with more than just an apology. This was a pretty gross thing to find. The other issue was when we checked in the second time,late, very tired after a long cross country flight, our door lock didn't work and they had to send a technician to fix it. We just wanted to put the kids to sleep and changing our room would have been a quicker solution at this late point in the evening (maybe there weren't any rooms?).

He helped by making sure that the guests had waffles in the fastest way possible by making some in the kitchen. I did not get this service at the other Homewood that I stayed at. I was then called while in my room to offer me fresh towels. I appreciated the phone call because I did not want them to bring me new towels seeing as I was checking out that morning. I did not see the point in wasting towels and their call to offer them gave me the chance to let them know that I did not need them.

In fact, our kids loved seeing the planes close up especially the Seaworld Shamu plane. We did hear noise from an adjoining room one morning but otherwise the hotel was quiet. We were in the South Building overlooking the basketball court not the pool. I imagine it would have been much noisier to be overlooking the pool. The breakfast room was busy no matter what time we went but we always found a lovely table outside overlooking the water. The Monday to Thursday dinners were an absolute bonus. One night we had an amazing chicken pasta accompanied by a salad bar and fresh rolls. Another evening, there was salisbury steak, salad bar, and mashed potatoes. Beer and wine was included as well as lemonade and iced tea. The people who ran the breakfast and dinners were always cheery and busy keeping everything re-stocked.

Upon arrival, late at night, I was told my room was not available; the previous guest had decided to stay another night.

Upon eeaching the room I didn't want, the hotel clerk called and said it would be 2 nights before I could get into my reserved room. We are in our 70's and need medical devices which have to be set up, then unassembled and repacked, so this was very inconvenient. They did move us to a different room after one night, but neither the night nor day manager offered any compensation for our trouble except to say \"Sorry.\".

The place was quiet even our two bedroom suite was facing the street and was on first floor. The room is clean and the food are fine. The overall experience was really good and I planned to go back there next time when I revisit San Diego. However, all of above experience changed after I got an email from Assistant General Manager a day after my checkout date. The email said that their cleaning folks found out some scratches on the chairs and he went ahead and placed $80 charges on my credit card. After I read the email, I started to remember my daughter's comments when we checked in that late afternoon. Our daughter is 3.5 and what I would consider a very well behaved child and gets along well with her peers and listens to adults. I had to use the chair for her to stand near the sink so she could wash her hands before we headed out for the free dinner. I pulled the chair out from under the diner table in living room and carried it to the sink in bedroom. Before she climbed up, she noticed those marks. She asked me who drew those and I told her I did not know. She said it could be babies. To be frankly, I did not notice the marks at all until she pointed out. I did not bother to call front desk to report that as I thought that should be already knew by the hotel. So after I got the email, I called the assistant manager and told him the truth. He just said he did not have power to revert the charges and we had to talk to his manager. So we left a VM for his manager. Then it took the manager five days to get back to us by email and said his investigation was marks happened during our occupancy. He did not even leave his signature with title and phone number so that we could try to discuss this further over the phone. Anyway, I replied to his email right away and explained the situation to him again but till now a week passed, no answer from him. I think the management is NOT professional at all. They don't care about customer's service and they wrongly charged customer without listening to customer's voices.

Me, my wife, 9 year old son and 6 year old daughter were here for Spring Break to attend theme parks and other attractions. Homewood Suites is now our favorite family-friendly hotel!! Embassy Suites is now our second favorite. We read the reviews here on T.A., so we booked a room at HS and were thrilled. We payed $175/night, are Silver HHonors members, and booked directly from their website (no 3rd party like expedia, hotwire, etc). The suites may seem expensive at first, but with their amenities, you can save a lot of money in other ways. Try and use AAA rate or Govt rate (if possible) when booking on the website. Our room was on the second floor in the North Building with a view of the pool and the bay! We had the one bedroom suite. The kids slept on the sofa bed which pulled out just fine and we slept on the king sized bed. There was a full size stainless steel refrigerator, stainless steel microwave, stainless steel dishwasher, and electric range with 2 burner locations. The kitchen counter tops were granite. Wi-Fi was complimentary and our Blackberries connected no problem. There were 2 flat screen HDTVs. Parking is \"self-park\" and is free. Breakfast is included every morning (7 days a week) and dinner is included (Monday-Thursday only). The wine was Sycamore Lane (red and white) and Bud Light was served from the tap. The pool and hot tub were heated well. There is a nice walkway behind the hotel which leads to a playground. There's a Trader Joe's and Vons about a mile away. House keeping was great! I recommend waiting until 4pm to check in and/or returning to the room for the evening because the suites take more time for housekeeping to turn over. You can hear the airplanes flying over head during the day, but at night it didn't matter because from 10pm to 6am, the planes cannot land or take off. We are definitely headed to more Homewood Suite locations on our future trips because this is by far the most family friendly hotel chain out there.

It was huge and came equipped with a full kitchen which was stocked with utensils, oven, microwave, kitchenette table, sink and even dishwasher. This opened out into the living room which had a huge writing desk, sofa and flat screen TV. In a spearate room was a king size bed which we both found very comfortable and another flat screen tv along with two night stands. I appreciated that the bathroom sink and mirror was separate from the rest of the bathroom. Breakfast and dinner was included in our room rate. Breakfast was great! They offered waffles, eggs, bacon, fruits, cereal, bagels, toast, juices, coffee among other items. We did have dinner on 2 nights out of our stay. Dinner was adequate, just don't expect grandma's home cooking. All this for a rate of $159 a night. I thought it was a very good value. For those who did not think it was in a central location, I do not understand what would be considered central in San Diego. Yes you need a car in San Diego because it is a very spread out city and requires highway/freeway driving to get to most places. The layout is similar to LA but on a smaller scale with less traffic and you don't want to be without a car in San Diego. It is not like San Francisco. Our longest drive was about 20 min or so to get to La Jolla, took about 10 min or so to get to the Zoo/Balboa, less than that to get to the seaport/USS Midway area and about 15 min or so to get to Point Loma/Cabrillo. We would have rated this place five stars but the only thing that brought the rating down for me was that there was a hint of a cigarette scent inside of our room but not outside. We were in a non smoking room but maybe the smoking section was on the same floor as us. The air was a little stale and my husband's allergies worsened a bit in the room.

However, that turned out OK because we were on a quiet wing of the third floor very near the terrace. There were LOTS of families with young children staying here however we (adult couple) were never disturbed by noise, etc. The suite is a good size with standard-quality furnishings. The kitchen seemed a bit more upscale with granite counters and stainless appliances. I like having the shower and toilet in a separate room from the bathroom sink as it makes it easier for two to get ready at the same time. Nice Neutrogena toiletries provided, as well as an iron and ironing board. The bed was find and many pillows were provided, however they all seemed the same (very squashy) unlike some places that now give a selection of different types of pillows. The suite and public facilities all seemed very clean. I didn't have many interactions with staff but all were pleasant. The breakfast was plentiful and the quality varied; for example the eggs were tasteless (perhaps egg substitute or very watered down?), but the biscuits and gravy were surprisingly good. There are some standard items (muffins, fruit, bread, juice) and a hot item which rotates daily. The make-your-own waffle was a big hit and tasted fine. The toaster is a joke--either nothing or burnt. Perhaps because it was late September, we were always able to get a table, though sometimes the last one! I didn't like eating with plastic forks and knives. Had the evening meal a couple times too. OK, nothing to go out of your way for but a decent way to have a bite if you've had a big lunch and don't want to go out again. I didn't care for Oggi's pizza (in the same mall complex) but it drew a big crowd every night so maybe I was unlucky. Corvette Diner would be really fun with kids--the most genuinely cheerful servers I've come across, with bouffant hairdos and poodle skirts! They do a special \"hairstyling\" that little girls love.

The night we were there the hotel appeared full and we were smilingly upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite. This suite was excellent with a king bed in 1 bedroom and a queen in the other. The 2 bedrooms were connected by a compact sitting room and a decently equipped kitchen. Because we were only there for 1 night, we didn't use the cooking facilities. However we did want to get ice and even though I searched high and low, I couldn't find an ice bucket. I ended up walking to the ice machine to collect ice with a saucepan from the cupboard. This was no big deal but on my return,I met a guy going the other way to collect ice also carrying a pan so it didn't seem to be an isolated omission for our room. It's a bit strange these are not supplied but as I say, it's no big deal. As others have commented, the'free' evening reception meal with wine and beer for the adults is of excellent quality but because the hotel was full the night we were there, there wasn't enough tables to seat all the guests. Since you were not allowed to take alcohol out of the dining area, we had to rutun later in the evening in order to get a table to eat. In the morning, it was the same story. The dining area was very full with some big parties cramped around some very small tables. The breakfast was good and plentiful but nothing exceptional. Although both the evening meal, breakfast and parking are 'free', don't be fooled into thinking that Hilton haven't baked these costs into the room rate. The night we spent at the Homewood Suites was the most expensive (in rate terms) of all the 18 nights we spent on the West coast and that included staying in some city centre hotels in places like San francisco. Having said that, the hotel is excellent and rightly deserves its high Tripadvisor ranking. It's very convenient to the airport and you can access all the major tourist attractions with ease (top tip - we were pleasantly suprised with the USS Midway museaum which is close by. If you have young bys, its a real hit as an attraction).

The front desk provided a map and directions to the zoo and the lady in the manager's reception area helped me wrap up some dinner items to take back to the room for my family. The most outstanding service was when a couple of the engineering staff helped clean beach sand out of my rental car. I even had a chance to visit with the manager while the staff were helping with my car. She is a wonderful lady who is focused on having the best hotel with the best service in the area. The suite and bathroom were very clean and everything was in great working order. The wireless internet connection worked perfectly. The small balcony was a nice place to get a bit of fresh air. Airplanes regularly take off over the hotel area, but the sound in the rooms is minimal. The pool is a little on the small side, but was the perfect temperature and plenty of fun for the boys and some new friends. There is an outdoor terrace on the third floor that overlooks the waterway and airport. The walkways around the hotel and surrounding grounds, including along the waterway provide great strolls. We ate dinner there one of the nights - plenty of good food that was replenished regularly. Breakfasts were good overall, even though I still don't much care for the Homewood Suites scrambled egg \"mix\" or whatever it is. They did have some cheese and pico to put on the eggs that made them better, though. The business center was great for printing boarding passes. All in all, this is the place to stay in San Diego as far as I am concerned. It is close to downtown, the airport, and the Zoo - and parking here is free! I highly recommend staying here.

Breakfast included eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, juices, fresh fruit, cut up melons, yogurt, cereal, high quality baked goods, oatmeal, granola, breakfast potatoes and more. They even had shredded cheese and homemade pico de gallo for the eggs. During the day, they provided coffee, tea, and watermelon juice. The evening light meals were the best we have ever experienced for included meals of this type. One evening they had excellent homemade meatloaf, assorted salads with homemade dressing, potatoes, and more. They also had cold drinks plus beer and wine. Other nights they had entrees including chicken fajitas and cajun chicken. Apparently the Homewood Suites and the Marriott Courtyard next door are under the same management. The Courtyard has a full kitchen and the homemade meals are prepared there and brought over to the Homewood Suites. The hotel was spotless and our room was spacious and comfortable.

We chose Homewood Suites because we have stayed in their accommodation elsewhere in the US but Liberty Station was not up to the same standard in terms of room quality and noise (see below), which has left us wondering why it is so high in the rankings for San Diego. Could it be the free parking? Positives: The communal areas are very pleasant - nice reception area, plenty of outdoor seating (including outdoor fireplace), swimming pool (towels provided) and gym (although didn't make use of this). Complementary breakfast was ok (standard Homewood Suites fare). Immediate locality - pleasant walkways by the waterside, shops/restaurants are handy, Vons supermarket a short drive away. Free parking Helpful staff Negatives: Noise from neighbouring rooms was definitely an issue - probably more so than the planes. I could clearly hear the people talking in the next door room, which went on late into the night. Sleeping with ear plugs helped but not ideal. When we stayed in other Homewood Suites this was not a problem so I can only assume it is due to the design/construction materials used for the building. Airplane noise is noticeable. We knew when we booked that it was close to the airport (we live near an airport in the UK and noise isn't a problem) but having stayed there I can confirm it is not that far from where the planes are taking off at full throttle, with the associated noise levels. Our room was on the side of the hotel closest to the planes (across the road from the Marriott) so perhaps this made it worse. Again, sleeping with ear plugs in helped. Not as spacious as other Homewood Suites accommodation we have used. We had a queen suite and the lounge/kitchen area wasn't too bad but the bedroom/bathroom area was cramped - when the bathroom door was open it blocked the wardrobe door and there was only just enough room to walk round the bed. Consequently we kept the luggage on the floor in the lounge. Evening meal - it's provided but not to everyone's taste. Overall this place has good points and bad points.

Free parking (usually around $35 in the city) and WiFi were a big plus. Breakfast good, but maybe more variety and an earlier weekend start time (7 AM currently) would help improve it. The location was an easy 10 minute drive to the Zoo, the Embarcadero and also had very easy freeway access. Oggi's Sports Bar across the parking lot had very good pizza and micro brewed beers. We could hear the people in the adjoining room thru the walls and knew when they used the closet or flushed toilets. I also smelled smoke at night being pulled in by the air conditioning. Also, we had pounding above us each day - maybe kids. The planes were loud at times, but only briefly. If the air condtioning was running, it totally eliminated the noise of the planes.

Overall, a very well done property with no major complaints. Within a 10 minute drive to most major attractions (downtown, Sea World, Maritime Museum, Balboa Park) and all can be reached with an easy non-highway route. Minutes from the airport. There is a central check-in and dining building that is flanked by the two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lodging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd buildings. Both lodging buildings appear virtually identical and are four floors high. The only difference is that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153North\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd building is 100% non-smoking. There is a very short outdoor walk from either building to the central dining area. Access to the lodging buildings is under 24 hour key card restriction. Rooms are generally well-insulated. Room doors were well engineered \u00e2\u20ac\u201c none of the typical slamming door syndrome so common at many properties. Although close to the typical departing flight path from airport, the in-room noise was not a problem as the AC unit has the ability to run in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mode when not actively cooling. This covered up virtually all noise. With the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mode off, we could definitely hear the rumble from departing jets. The only negative to the room insulation is between floors. We switched to the top floor after the first night due to the continual trampling sound from the occupants above us. AC unit did not do a good job moderating the temperature between the three rooms in our unit. The master bedroom (which was furthest from the AC unit) was significantly warmer than the other bedroom (which was closest to the AC unit). Given the significant amount of airflow that gets pumped through the one vent in each room, there was no good way to self-regulate the temperature. Trying to slow the airflow in the cooler room by closing the vent just resulted in the very loud sound of rushing air trying to make its way through a restricted vent opening. Very small exercise room is located in each building. Note that the facility only opens at 6:00 a.m. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not terribly convenient if one is not on Pacific Time. But, as the facility is located on the 3rd floor of each building, I suppose this reduces foot traffic noise in the morning for those residing on the 3rd floor. The free breakfast is generally well presented and is continually stocked by an attentive staff. After a week, it does get a bit old as there is not much variety from day-to-day, but the convenience makes it worthwhile. No trouble getting a table even during spring break time. Outdoor pool was heated and warm enough for kids to enjoy. Air temps were 68-72 degrees. Not a lap pool, but fine for kids to play.

Nice not to have to worry about eating out every night as Mon_Thurs a light supper is provided. No problem with parking and is free which seemed to be an issue in San Diego. Cons - beware of the room you get. First room we had was next to the fitness room and (as a previous reviewer has noted) we were woken at 6am (when it opens) to pounding up and down on the treadmill. The front desk did not seem particularly surprised when we asked to be moved. Now I know why...others have complained! Then we were moved to a ground floor corner room which was nice and spacious. However, we were then woken up at 5.45am by the children in the room above clearly jumping on and off the bed. As parents with kids ourselves we appreciate you can't keep them mouse quiet but this was ridiculous.

However, I was pleasantly surprised - it really was a good hotel in a good location. It's not a five-star luxury resort, but it certainly is worth considering for an extended trip with family. For a Homewood Suites/Residence Inn type of hotel, it is one of the nicer ones I have stayed in. The pros: 1. The hotel still feels brand new - not at all old or run-down. 2. The area surrounding the hotel also feels new - it looks like the whole area was redeveloped over the last few years, so there are newer restaurants and facilities nearby - not at all like the surrounding Point Loma area. 3. Free parking 4. Free breakfast buffets (kids loved this - waffles, eggs, the usual hot fare) 5. Free dinners (yes, free dinners - OK, it's institutional food - you are better off eating out, but there were plenty of people who seemed to love it) 6. It's about 3 minutes from the SAN terminal, but somehow doesn't feel like an \"airport hotel.\" 7. It has suites (i.e., real bedrooms) with separate living/dining room and kitchen with full sized refrigerator (also range top and microwave, but no oven). 8. Flat screen TVs. 9. Nice walking trail/lane next to hotel - seems safe 10. Comfortable beds and updated bathrooms 11. Free internet access, and free printers near lobby for internet/office 12. Had towels by the pool (why can't most hotels get this right?) The Cons: 1. Somewhat loud A/C unit in rooms - not easy to regulate temperatures in each separate room. 2. If you're next to the elevator (an -08 2BR suite), you hear it in the MBR. 3. You will need to drive to any SD tourist sites or downtown (but you'll need a car anywhere you stay in SD) 4. Not a luxury resort by any means - upscale dorm furniture in living areas, but functional 5. Not cheap compared to other nearby hotels 6. Pool somewhat small (but again, this is not a luxury resort) 7. Yes, you can hear airplanes sometimes (you are next to the airport, after all) 8. Limited TV selections - not full cable line-up (kids had no Nickelodeon, and you had to pay for Disney (?)) 9. Don't quite understand the sliding door to a 2 foot deep balcony - looks good at a distance, but practically useless. 10. Rooms are in two buildings not attached by indoor walkway to the lobby building - need to walk outside to get breakfast, etc. Not a big deal - only 20 feet or so. So in the end, we'd stay there again. Since we paid over $200/night for a 2BR suite, I would hope that non-spring break rates are lower. It's not a luxury property, not a resort, not close to tourist sites, not cheap, and not romantic - but we still really liked it.

There is great parkland immediately by the hotel, which is a big plus, so you can walk safely to shops and restaurants in Liberty Station. Recommended are Trader Joes for food and drink shopping, nearby Oggis for beer and Sushiya for inexpensive sushi. Also, walk 20 mins along the waterside park to Steals Winebar.

Everyone is friendly, professional, and caring. Check-in was a breeze and the front desk staff are very helpful. Complimentary shuttle was great too. Breakfast was okay but what do you expect for this price. At least I'd say it is acceptable. Location is convenience, and I like the Sushiya Restaurant in the park lot. The dark side - it is indeed very noisy! You can hear the flights landing and take off. If you are sensitive to noise like me, you can only sleep from mid-night to 6am, at the most. Moreover, the insulation was bad and you can clearly hear people in the next room coughing (I am not kidding!). The even darker side - cleanliness. We have two rooms and both are very dirty. I can tell the difference between dirty and dated. I'd say it is both. The floors are \"sticky\", the bathroom has molds, and the carpet is extremely dirty. This is my biggest concerns since my younger kid (2-year-old) like walking bare foot in the hotel room. Also the one-bedroom suite is so small that you cannot put the crib in the bedroom. My wife ended up sleeping in the living room (on sofa bed) with my 2-year-old. I apologize to those who likes this hotel, but I just think this is the dirtiest Homewood Suites I have even stayed in.

The hotel is in a pretty nice complex with a Courtyard by Marriott as well as several restaurants that had above average food (types: Italian, Thai, Sushi, Mexican). All the food was fresh, well made, and reasonably priced. Even the take out Mexican place had great food. The hotel chain specializes in suites and for people who need the extra space to travel with children or to accommodate different schedules it can be great. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and my major complaint was the suite was on the small size, particularly the bedroom. Still the space is well designed and there was ample storage for clothes in the closet, bedroom dresser and living room dresser. The kitchenette featured a full refrigerator, 2 burner electric range, microwave, sink and dishwasher. Also provided were utensils and dishes for 4, basic pots and cooking implements, toaster, and coffee pot. The hotel does offer the standard buffet breakfast in the mornings and manager's reception weekday evenings, but we tend not to make use of them so I can't report on that. The hotel was nicely laid out with a main building in the center offering the buffet, store, business office and front desk among other things and the North and South buildings having most of the guest rooms. Each of these buildings had 4 floors with elevators, guest rooms on all floors, a laundry room, a 3rd floor terrace and an exercise room. The hotel featured pleasant styling in all the buildings and a generally welcoming feeling. The patio between the two residential buildings featured outdoor seating and barbecues for use by guests.

It was too cold for us to use the pool, but we thought the view overlooking the river was nice. For us, the location was excellent. There are several restaurants in the complex.

It was me, my husband, my 2 yr old son and grandma. Overall it was a great experience. Only problem was the room size, like other posters mentioned. We rented a full size crib from Babies Away (the hotel only has pack n play). One bedroom has a queen size bed, the other has a full size bed. Unfortunately, since the bedrooms are so small, there was no room to put a crib in the queen size, so they had to put it in a room with double bed. So grandma slept in the queen size, while my husband and I were squeezed in the full size bed. (but the beds are very comfy) So watch out if you are traveling with a young child and need a crib or pack n play. There is NO ROOM to put in the queen size bedroom. Other than that, for the money, the hotel was great. Little noisy and not the best sound proofing, but I've realized that most hotels have almost no sound proofing. We were on the first floor and whenever people upstairs walked, we heard it. In middle of the night, they dropped something heavy on the floor and that woke us up. We heard our neighbor's 5:30am alarm as well. The airplane noise wasn't as bad as I expected, being so close to the airport. The breakfast were ok-nothing fansy. It was convenient to have since we had a hungry 2 yr old. I know some previous posters complained about the food, but come on, it's FREE - Stop complaining. What do you expect for FREE FOOD?? At least they serve free food. If you have a problem, cook your own breakfast/dinner. You have a kitchen in your room. Supposedly, Courtyard by Marriott right next door has a pretty good restaurant. You can go there and pay for breakfast if you are not happy with the food at Homewood Suites. The hotel was located in the back part of a large mall and has Thai food, Japanese, Greek and Subway. Trader Joe's nearby too, so it was very convenient. Our last day, we had lunch at the Greek Cafe and food was pretty good. Only 10 min drive to Sea World. No need to stay at old, overpriced hotels in Mission Bay area when you can stay at Homewood Suites!! Yes, it ain't the Four Seasons. It's a nice, no frills hotel which is great for families.

This hotel was similar to other Homewood Suites. I enjoyed my stay. However, there were a few things that I did not enjoy like the distance from places in SD and the noise. The Pros: Clean Hotel Close to Vons Grocery Store, Trader Joes, Starbucks, and numerous of restaurants Within walking distance to a park and playground for those with younger children Complimentary Breakfast Close to airport Free Parking and lots of spaces The Cons: Not that close to Mission Beach, downtown, and Balboa Park as I thought Not easily accessible to the highways-takes longer than you think to get to and from places The Noise-I could hear clearly what my neighbors next door where doing. Not something that you want to hear especially if you have young children trying to sleep Small Rooms-Compare to other HS that I've stayed at, I thought the rooms lack square footage and storage space. Make sure that if you are a family of 4 or more no matter how small your children are; get a two bedroom. The one bedroom suite was way too small for myself, my husband, my 3 year old, and 4 months old child. We felt cramped and we are all skinny and small people. Especially since you have to enter the bedroom to utilize the bathroom. I like how Hilton has their Embassy Suites laid out much better. Lack Of Space In Dining Area-there were never enough chairs and tables available for breakfast or dinner unless you were there before start time. Dining Area Location-The dining area is in a seperate building from the hotel rooms. So, it's a bit of an inconvenience if you have small children, want to take your food back to your room, or if you need to go back to your room for something. At other HS, I will just get my food and take it back to my room. This HS did not have any of those food containers for you to carry food back to your room...which would have helped because there were never enough spaces to eat in the dining area. I will recommend this hotel if you are doing things within the Point Loma area of San Diego. However, the location was quite a bit of distance to the places that we visited in San Diego. The next time we will stay in Hotel Circle like our previous trip. That location was easily accessible to highways, beaches, downtown, and Balboa Park.

There is a great evening walk to be had along the waterfront. Just across the parking lot is a small commercial centre with a range of restaurants. The hotel has a free evening meal (with free beer!!) from Mon-Thur. The quality is not amazing, but it certainly saved us a few $ on eating out. The rooms were a good size and clean. Good laundry facilities, exercise room and pool. Free wireless internet throughout the hotel. Cons Without doubt the noisiest hotel I've ever stayed in. It didn't start well when we were given a room for disabled people, without being told. Being 6'3\" I don't need sinks etc any lower than they already are. So, after trekking back to reception we got another room. The replacement room was next to the lift. It didn't appear to be a problem, until we went to bed. Our bedroom was right next to the lift shaft, and I don't know who was using the lift at 3am, but ti was certainly on the move throughout the night. The next day we moved room. The third room was much better. Although the final room we stayed in was quieter, it was still noisy for 3 reasons: 1) The hotel has no sound proofing. The people above could easily be heard walking around. Luckily they always stopped being noisy at a decent hour, so no complaints were necessary. 2) The hotel is almost right in the flight path for the airport. Not a massive problem as the planes seemed to stop taking off about 22:30, and didn't start again until about 6:30. 3) The absolute worst, and noisiest, thing was the air conditioning system. Each room has it's own system that feeds all the rooms in the suite. It's very noisy. This could be controlled within the suite by turning the temperature right up (stupidly there is no off switch!). However, due to the lack of sound proofing the air con systems of the suite above and below could be heard clearly, and when laying on the pillow the whole sound reverberated even more.

We have a 20 month old son and cooked a lot. It's great to have a full kitchen. The hotel also serves a full breakfast and dinners M-Th at no extra charge. They also have coffee/tea/cocoa all day long which is nice. There is a pool table, a nice pool and it's right by the bay so i was able to run along the bank and that was really nice. There's a huge park nearby. There are BBQ's and a fireplace and it really has a cozy atmosphere. The best part is the room. We had a 2 room suite which was huge! A lot of room for our son to run around in and we had a lot of room to relax. I would definitely stay at a Homewood Suites in any city!", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Provo, UT", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay for Anyone...And it's new!\u201d", "Author": "Luv2VacationForever", "ReviewID": "UR36939493", "Content": "I am going to start this review with the fact that this hotel is new.

A lovely hotel in a very attractive location we were really impressed with everything that this hotel has to offer. The rooms are fantastic and more like small apartments than hotel rooms. Ours was a one bedroom suite and along with the kitchen appliances and kitchen equipment, there was a flat screen TV in the sitting area and also in the bedroom, a very comfortable king-size bed and bathroom with shower and bath. The room also had doors that lead to a small balcony and my one suggestion would be that chairs are supplied to enable you to sit out, as although we had a smoking room for my partner, he still preferred to smoke here rather than in the room itself. Breakfast was excellent, although my advice would be to get there before 9.00am as that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when the main crowd arrive and (especially at weekends) there can be queues, particularly at the waffle making machines. Other options included scrambled egg, home fries, bacon and/or sausage patties, toast, bagels, muffins, cereals, juice, yoghurt, fruit etc. Just about anything you could want really. The Homewood also serves early evening meals Monday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Thursday and we enjoyed a few of these including hot dogs and macaroni bolognaise, during these meals they also provide salad plus wine and beer, a good option for families with ever hungry children! The property is divided into north and south buildings with an area between that had barbeques to use plus seating areas around gas fires. Each building has a fitness room, more geared up for people doing CV work rather than a weights routine, and there is also a basketball court. The pool area is very nice, although at the beginning of our stay the water was very cold, this appeared to have been rectified later in the week, and the sun beds the most comfortable I have ever used with a lovely thick mattress. Pool towels are also available and can be picked up by the pool. There are places to eat within a few minutes walk, the ones we tried were a very good Thai restaurant where we had dinner one evening, a Greek caf\u00c3\u00a9 where we had a lunch, gyros with fries and a drink, which was good, and Oggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where we ate once and went most nights for drinks at the bar. Other places include a Sushi restaurant that looked very popular, a Mexican Caf\u00c3\u00a9 plus Subway and Starbucks. There are also places to eat about 10 mins walk away where you can also find a Vons supermarket and a Trader Joes. I have to mention the staff in Oggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s who were so friendly and welcoming and made it a pleasure to visit, a special thank you to Finlay, Amy, Matt and Chris. Just one thing to mention if you do stay at this hotel and intend having a few night out in the Gaslamp District cab fares can be quite steep and expect to pay $15 each way without tips.

The large refrigerator was great for keeping our leftovers, milk, etc cool for us. It was quiet, we rarely heard anyone else in the hotel. We were on the fourth floor in a corner that faced water each direction. It didn't have the small balcony, but we didn't mind. Breakfast was something our kids looked forward to each day. There were eggs, waffles, toast, bagels, rolls, fruit, and muffins daily. Drinks were milk, juices, coffee, and hot chocolate. We tried the evening meal a couple of times. It was ok. They had nice salads, iced tea, beer, and wine. The Chicago Homewood we've stayed at in the past had a soda pop machine, pudding, and ice cream so you could have that. This one didn't have those items or as much selection in general. The dining area got crowded at times, but there was room outside on the patio too. The building we were in wasn't attached, so we had to use our room key often to get into the dining area and pool. Not a problem. The pool was small, but nice and clean. Plenty of chairs and tables. It wasn't especially warm during our stay. Highs in the lower 70's, but the pool was warm and the hot tub was nice. There are some restaurants within walking distance. Oggi's was good for sandwiches and pizza. There's also a Subway, TCBY, sushi place, and Mexican restaurant. It's very close to a Navy base, so they're there often in uniform. Trader Joe's is maybe a mile away. They had cheap ($.29) water that we bought before we went to the zoo, pretzels, etc. We went to the new Corvette Diner which was a lot of fun, but super busy in the shopping/dining area near Trader Joe's It's right next to the USS Recruit, a former landbased Navy training ship.

In Homewood, we had 2 different rooms a one-bed studio (for my sis and her hubby) and a 2-bed/2-bath for us - both in the Southern Bldg. We got an accessible room this time, the other bath had no tub. The kitchen was also much smaller than the one we had before in our Dec stay (we had the bayview room then, so maybe that made a difference?) - I thought all 2-bed/2-bath floor plans would be same : this is a small disappointment for me bec I wanted to brag to my sis about the nice kitchen (^_^). Her kitchen in the one-bed studio was similar to ours. I used the laundry room again and made sure I brought quarters this time.

Our initial experience wasn't what we expected, as when we arrived we were told that the only room available was a first floor suite, which we discovered after entering was designed for handicapped guests, and as such featured a large bathroom with no discernible break between shower and the rest of the room. Meaning that taking a shower would result in water going all over the bathroom. The kitchen was small and cramped as well. This wasn't acceptable for a family with young kids, so we went back to the desk and were told we could switch rooms the next day, which we did, moving to a much larger room on the 2nd floor. After that, the stay was perfect. As others have noted the hotel features tons of amenities to keep kids and parents entertained. Highlights for us included daily breakfast buffet (though the eggs are always overcooked) featuring a variety of fruits, cereals, as well as waffles and breads/pastries. They also rotate a daily \"meat\" dish (either bacon, sausage, or biscuits/gravy). Other highlights included the sports court which we used most mornings for a bit of basketball, a pool table, free wired/wireless Internet, free Business center, complementary popcorn/coffee/tea in the rooms, large fridges, fully stocked kitchens, pool, jacuzzi, outdoor hot tub, outdoor terraces, and the surroundings which includes the USS Recruit, a training ship built into the ground, and the bay behind the hotel featuring walking/jogging paths. Across the parking lot is a small shopping center featuring about half a dozen places to eat (Sushiya and Oggis were very good). Service was fine, we didn't have any problems, and the staff was very friendly. Rooms were clean and spacious. There is are outdoor gas grills but we never got to use them. Rooms are equipped with two flat-screen HD TVs with ample selection of HD programming and movies on demand. The only complaint about the room is that the pull-out couch is uncomfortable, but the main bed/pillows are wonderful (and they give you plenty of pillows). They also advertise a complementary light dinner Mon-Thur, though we never tried it. The location is of course ideal, five-ten minutes from major tourist hotspots including the USS Midway, Gas Lamp, Old Town, and Seaport Village as well as Seaworld and Mission Beach and five minutes from the I-5 to head north to Legoland, La Jolla and other locations. Parking was always plentiful and close by. Keep in mind this is a family oriented hotel, there are kids everywhere, breakfast is a bit crazy, and the hotel is pretty much quiet by 9:00 PM.

The room was very comfortable throughout our stay, and our son was delighted to go from a college bunk bed to a queen bed, private bath, large desk, and balcony. And free wireless, of course. Our room was on the corner which was great for lack of noisy connecting walls; the only problem was the closet in the king bed room was not really set up to hang things but fitted with a couple of wire shelves so we had to share our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closet.

We had dinner there Monday and Tuesday nights. Monday was Salisbury steaks, potatoes and gravy. Tuesday was a baked potato bar. Both nights they also served wine and beer. There is a lovely outdoor area, and we saw that some people used the grills provided. The room was very quiet despite the proximity to the airport, and we shared only one wall with another room, which was nice (we have noisy kids). The parking is plentiful and free. There is a kitchen area in the suite and it was well-stocked with plates, utensils, etc. Another service they offer that I've never seen mentioned is that they will go grocery shopping for you! We didn't take them up on this service, but I can imagine it is very useful. There are grocery stores nearby, including a Trader Joe's. There are also several restaurants right next to the hotel, including pizza and Mexican. The one downside was that we felt the wifi connection was a bit weak and dropped out on occasion. However, at one point we had to print something, and the front desk person made it very easy (he gave us a flash drive, we copied the document to it, and he printed it at no cost to us).", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "RedDeerRose", "ReviewID": "UR25538917", "Content": "I chose the Homewood Suites for a girlfriend getaway Feb 17-21.

The food wasn't the best we've had but then we did not expect it to be. The restaurant staff seemed genuinely happy to be working there. It was a little chilly the first evening we were there and the discovery of an outdoor fireplace with big comfy chairs beside it was a treat. A great place for chatting. The only negative of our experience, and this certainly was not the fault of the hotel, was the construction on the bridge adjacent to the hotel. The \"pylon pounder\" started at 9:00 am and didn't stop until 5:00 pm. We returned to the room in the afternoon for a nap and found it difficult to sleep with the noise. Apparently this construction had been going on for a month. The location of the hotel was great for sightseeing. We made trips to Coronado Island, Torrey Pines State Park and Point Loma.

Too many choices to list everything, but the kids favorites were the cinnamon buns and self-made waffles. I liked the sampling of fruits, yogurt, cottage cheese, and english muffins. It is hard to believe, but they also serve a complimentary small buffet dinner Mondays thru Thursdays. While we were there we missed the baked potatoe bar night, but had dinner on the Orange Chicken night. They also served rice, buns, salad and beverages. As long as you were eating in the lodge area you could help yourself to their beer on tap and white or red wine! Coffee/tea & hot chocolate was available 24 hrs/day.

It is almost directly under the flight path of the large jets taking off from nearby San Diego International Airport, so it can get noisy. However, the planes cannot start taking off until 6:30 a.m. and must stop by 11:30 p.m. And while there are several small restaurants around the hotel property, there are no nearby convenience stores to pick up a quick soda or snack.

There is a business center, but internet connection is available in the room, also. The only criticism we had was there was only one sink in the bathroom area and it was in front of the closet so the space was close. This could present a problem for a family with several people to get ready at the same time. I would recommend this hotel for all groups.

There is a Courtyard by Marriott next door, and a retail area that includes a good pizza place (Oggi's), Subway, Los Primos (Mexican), a Greek place, and a Starbucks. Close by is a Trader Joe's, Cold Stone, and other dining options. The property backs onto an inland waterway, so there are boats, water skiers, and birds to watch. Grass, gravel and paved paths run along the water, and connect the hotel to a large park. There is a play area about 5-7 minute walk with a play structure and a climbing wall. Tons of grassy areas. Minutes from the airport, convention center and Sea World. I do not rank this property as excellent due to the smell of the offgassing from the furniture.

My son and I tagged along while my husband was away on business. We loved the location and all of the amenities the hotel had to offer. Our teenage son played basketball there, used the pool table and swimming pool. The landscaping and outdoor areas are beautiful. We stayed in a studio suite. Friends of ours had a one bedroom suite. With the exception of the additional television I actually preferred the studio suite. I liked the open floor plan better. The location is great. Read the other reviews on that. Oggi's right next door has great pizza. Two grocery stores are very close to the hotel. The staff was very helpful. They printed a boarding pass for me when I was having difficulty, provided us with directions and took care of anything we asked of them. We ate the light dinner one evening and appreciated it. We also had breakfast there each morning. I would say if you are staying there more than a few days you may tire of the same breakfast every day. They do have a variety but really only seem to switch from bacon to sausage. I have been at other Hilton properties, Hampton Inn, in particular that have had better breakfasts. I didn't care for the potatoes or eggs they served. Having said that they do offer oatmeal and waffles and other items so we never really went hungry. Housekeeping was great. They do not have in-room safes. We used the hotel shuttle from the airport. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait. After an hour I called the hotel back and a van arrived. The van has a large green Marriott emblem on the hood and side of the van. On the side behind the Marriott logo is the Homewood Suites logo in a light color. The courtesy area is very busy at the airport and I was only able to see the Marriott logo when the van initially went around and ignored it. An hour later when the driver showed up there were no vehicles around it and I caught a glimpse of the Homewood Suites logo. I wished they would have told me when I phoned for the shuttle to look for a van with both logos on it. I wonder how often they have to return because people miss that. My husband was traveling with co-workers. We chose this property because the \"W\" hotel was sold out. They finished their work a few days earlier. The guys that stayed at the \"W\" were forced to pay for the next day because they did not give 24 hours notice. My husband checked with the staff around dinner time the night before and they had no problem with him checking out the next morning.

We need SPACE when we travel as a family, so we always look for a 2-bedroom suite. WIth this stay, Homewood has now taken over our #1 spot from the Staybridge chain. This property is located in a deceptively convenient location, about 8-10 minutes from the airport, 10+ minutes to Sea World or Old Town, and just over 15 minutes from places like Seaport Village, Petco Park, and Gaslamp District (though I'd imagine during rush hour, this could double). We were also able to WALK across the parking lot to no less than SIX good places to eat for families (nothing fancy...but a great Greek restaurant and an pub/pizza/Italian place Oggi's were typical). There's also a Starbucks and Subway there. Not only that, Homewood properties serve a darn good evening snack which almost works as a meal (meatloaf, lasagne, tacos, etc.), at least for the kids. The 2-bedroom suites are similar to other chains' 2-BDs - but the middle living room and kitchen area seemed more spacious than Residence Inn, Summerfield Suites, or Staybridge...and the property was absolutely spotless! This hotel has a better-than-adequate pool as well as eating area...though because of the summer vacation high occupancy, finding seating during breakfast was a little tough. Still, there are many outdoor tables just outside the dining area that served as a great overflow for many families. In the evenings, a few parties were using the outdoor grill to cook up their own burgers, etc. All in all, this property seemed to be planned very meticulously. On the downside: (a) meal service workers were like timekeeping Nazi's - by 9:30 a.m SHARP, pretty much every food item was put away, and when I wandered over to see what was still out and to try to get one more cup of orange juice, one worker sternly eyed me and barked out \"We stop serving at 9:30.\" During the summer, it would be great if this hotel kept weekend hours (to 10 a.m.) for breakfasts every day. The breakfast food selection at this Homewood didn't have quite the same variety or quality as a Homewood I stayed in Texas last month...but still much better than adequate. (b) Elevators are *extremely* slow...and few. A property of this size could use 2 sets of elevators per building...and they can certainly move a little faster. During room clean-up time (which may be pretty much all day), the housekeeping crew did not appear to have their own elevators, so they frequently tied up the single elevator (per building) with their carts and maintenance items. Try to get a room that faces either the parking lot (still a nice view of hills and the recently completed Liberty Landing/Navy Training Center commercial complex) or the Bay. I would opt for the non-premium (not \"Bay View\") rooms on a high floor (3 or 4) as this would keep your costs a bit lower. Try to avoid the rooms that face the between-building walkways, especially on the 1st 2 levels as there's a lot of pedestrian traffic, mostly hotel guests coming and going...but they seem very close when your room faces the walkway. At $284/night, this was one of the most expensive 2-bedroom suites we've stayed at, but considering the time of year and location, I still feel we got a good deal. And kudos to the housekeeping crew who did a terrific job cleaning our room every day, and managed to do so without misplacing or losing any of our kids' stuff (you know how 5 & 7 years olds drop or leave crayons, books, and stuffed animals *anywhere*) -- instead, they neatly arranged items they found on top of the dresser. AND, they did all of this with a very limited window of time as we tended to come back to our room several times daily, and we'd put up the \"Privacy\" sign often. Still, they found the time to do an excellent job cleaning and prepping our room every day. Oh...our suite also had 3 fantastic 37 or 40\" (didn't measure LOL) LCD TV's that kept everyone happy in the evenings. If you have a PS3 or WII or another video console, BRING IT!! On second thought, your kids may never want to leave the room...
