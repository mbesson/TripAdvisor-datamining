{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Horrible motel This is probely the worst motel ever. First of all the motel was right in front of the highway the one that runs through downtown dallas so it was very loud. The first room we checked into had no locks on the doors and it had a gaping hole over the shower. We asked the manager if we could have a different room he gave a a scoul and showed us our second it was no better. The room had a horrible stench like if a dog had died in there. It was so unbearable that we had to leave the door open. With it being in the middle of the night we had no choice but to stay there. PLEASE DO NOT STAY IN THIS MOTEL.", "Date": "Jul 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR357808729", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ADVISORUnitedStates"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d656704-r17599855-Delux_Inn_Express_Suites-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "656704", "Price": "$63"}}
