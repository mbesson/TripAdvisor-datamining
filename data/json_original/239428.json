It was a ten minute walk to the metro station, the stop is towards the end of the line so the train ride in is quite long. However, this was the closest camp site we could find to the city. The facilities were clean and there was hot water. Washing machine, no dryer. The campsite was dry and run down but had everything we needed. Staff were friendly, it helps if you speak basic spanish. There was a guard for access after midnight. Free wifi at the reception. No pool. Not recommended for somewhere you want to spend lots of time at the campsite, but good access to the city for a short stay.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South West", "Title": "\u201cOsuna Campsite is convenient and friendly\u201d", "Author": "Rojee", "ReviewID": "UR115879953", "Content": "Contrary to other reviews, we found the people were welcoming and friendly. Its location is brilliant as it is just 10 minutes walk from the Metro which puts you into the centre of Madrid in about 30 minutes. There are also convenient bus stops with one serving the airport in 10 minutes. Across the road is the most amazing and huge public park with cycling, kayaking, walking etc - absolutely stunning when we were there in the sunshine. The facilities are a little tired, but for the price this is a good city campsite.

Badly neglected facilities, tepid showers, unheated shower blocks, standing in fetid water because the showers do not drain properly and only cold water at the sinks. We paid 32 euros per night (5.70 e for electric hook up!) in mid October. Its one star rating by the Spanish camping associated is too generous. Before going I\u2019d seen others\u2019 reviews and thought they were being picky \u2013 they certainly were not. We\u2019ve stayed at hundreds of camp-sites and this is easily amongst the worst. Last year we went to top class Camping International in beautiful Aranjuez and caught the local train into Madrid and then used the efficient, clean and great value Metro system (3 days unlimited use 11.60E). NB Madrid is a lovely, vibrant city but there is a massive minor-crime wave going on so hang on tightly to your bags and wallets at all times.

The camping ground is not top quality but we thought it was reasonable being in a large capital city, the owners were helpful when we asked about the bul-fighting etc, showers were cleaned everyday and there is a great bar with free wifi!!

Madrid was on our way so we went to this campground near the airport. The place was fairly crowded but we did find a spot to put the caravan. Everything seems to be old, I'd say the whole campground needs some serious re-modelling. Very few showers, some didn't have hot water. The rest of the sanitaries were not great, either. There was a childrens playground - nice, but unfortunately populated with two large german shepherds!! No way it could be used by children. There is a small supermarket which was okay. What we didn't find was electricity - they do have some outlets (the boxes with sockets and fuses are open for everyone, no covers or anything) but they have not nearly enough capacity. People put 30-50 m cables all over to get electricity to their place - we just lived without, after all it was just for one night. Although it's near the airport you don't hear much of the airplanes, but traffic noise is present. All in all, consider going somewhere else, especially if you're going to stay for some time in Madrid (budget hotels would make much more sense than this campground, which isn't really cheap, either)!", "Date": "September 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cQuite OK - somewhat worn, but nice pine woods\u201d", "Author": "joen.dk", "ReviewID": "UR3529779", "Content": "The campsite is within reasonably easy reach of the airport, though not suffering so much from traffic noise as you might expect. There are some nice grassy pinewoods at the far end - certainly you should head for them, if you are back-packers. The ground can be hard, though, but not stony. The bathrooms are somewhat worn, but everything is reasonable. I have only been there off-season and I don\u00b4t know if the place gets overcrowded or too worn in summer. Grocery stores and restaurants doesn\u00b4t seem to be in the vicinity; their bar was closed. I went there bringing my bike, but I assume that public transport is abundant, since it is next to the much fre- quented main road Avenida de Logrono and the airport, which is now served by a metro. Though the reception closed at 22, the entrance gate was kept open after that. I would estimate that you could walk to and from the airport within 25-35 minutes. In early may there were only a few guests.
