Here's why: - It's brand new - It's modern and sleek without taking that motif too far - Its location is a great starting point for much of LA - The price is right, with a lot of extras included Every staff member with whom I interacted was friendly and helpful. My room was clean and had everything I needed, including an in-room safe and iPhone/iPad docking station. The room itself wasn't huge, but it was big enough for one or two. I loved the deep tub/rain shower combo. While the designers insisted on having a small pane of glass installed in the wall that separates the bathroom from the rest of it -- a design flourish that I wish would go away -- it was small enough and translucent enough to ensure bathroom privacy. The location itself, on Wilshire at Crescent Heights, is adjacent to -- but not exactly a part of -- the lovely residential neighborhoods or vibrant restaurants of Mid-Wilshire. The boulevard feels a bit barren here, but I walked it in the evening and in the early morning with no problem. Most people will want to drive to W. 3rd and its restaurants (this is LA, after all), though it is about a 10-15 min. walk. My opted for the parking package, which with my low room rate, still made for a great value. Internet was free, the pass to the LA Fitness down the street was free, the rooftop lounge was awesome... this is a really great place.

Upon arriving no problems checking in, get to the room, its a decent size, albeit a little small and the king size bed really feels more like a queen. Very comfy bed, however. Dim lighting, perfect for lounging--though a light in the closet would be helpful, too. My view was of the parking lot next door but even on the 4th floor you can see the Hollywood Hills, very nice. Noticed I was missing some of the bath products (brought my own anyway), so I called front desk to get some, never arrived, just figured some hand soap would be uh sanitary and useful! I noticed they seemed a little stingy on towels, too for a room meant to be shared by two. No option for pay per view movies, but plug in play options (bring your own cables) with the large HDMI tv, so bring your laptop or iPad and you are set if you got netflix! It was very quiet on the floor through out the night, which helps to ensure a good nights rest and even being directly on Wilshire, you heard very little of cars buzzing by the street. I did room service and sadly that was just okay, the service was akward, plastic cups for beer, forgot wine glasses, no condiments provided, either, howver one of the french reds that was recommended, was a great bottle! Overall, it was a good night's rest, a nice little getaway but I think the price a little high considering you have to pay for overnight valet and I think some improvement on room service is needed and fine touches as well!", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique hotel in LA\u201d", "Author": "Kit989", "ReviewID": "UR128569572", "Content": "Great boutique hotel in central La.

From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by professional and helpful staff. We had originally booked a 2 queen room but much to our delight were upgraded to a one bedroom suite. The room was ultra modern, spotless clean and had the extra bonus of water bottles and a great coffee maker with good coffee! The mini fridge was stocked well, but we didnt use the items so not sure of the cost of these. Now on to the amenities, the rooftop bar/restaurant and pool were amazing. We had lunch there on our first day, it was delicious. The pool really isnt to swim in but I guess if you wanted a dip that is what you will get! Service was great, and always with a smile and a chat. Across the road is a number of shops, ranging from cofffee. subway, a chemist, a laundry, japanese, lebanese, thai and a burger place, plus another couple of restaurants. We had dinner at the Thai place 3 times, the food was great and very reasonably priced. All restaurants were extremely busy with locals, this means they must be good! We used the public bus about 100meters from the hotel up to Hollywood, this was $1.50 each way and took about 15 min. and very convenient. The Grove is a must see, it took us about 20 min walk which we enjoyed as we walked through the local neighborhoods to get there, or you could again catch the local bus, or if you like a taxi! The Farmers Market was amazing, as was all the shops around, including Wholefoods supermarket - see it to believe it! Great food for those looking for another alternative to a restaurant.

Unfortunately, it also attempts to be a club for 20-somethings, and does not enforce reasonable behavior on the part of its partying guests. So, although it has excellent bones, I cannot recommend it for anyone wanting a guarantee of a good night's sleep. Probably, the problem begins with the (unfortunately all too common) attempt to have both a trendy hangout and a hotel in one property. The hotel has a rooftop deck with a bar and a small swimming pool. This doubles as a club at night. Sadly, the club-goers need to take the elevator to the top floor of the hotel (which has sleeping rooms on it), and then go down a short hall to another elevator to the roof. Why would you do this to your hotel guests? We had a room which was somewhat like a small suite, with nice new fixtures and a cool bath. We did notice with surprise that the carpet was already stained. However, given the discussion below, one can understand why that might be the case. While we were there, there was a multi-night, multi-guestroom party on our floor. The last night we were there, this went on until daylight. The party goers went from room to room, with accompanying door slamming etc. Not only did we complain, but other guests did as well. At one point, we overheard a night clerk telling someone that that was their final warning. As this had no effect, I can only guess that it meant the hotel wouldn't bother them again! We got no sleep that night. The next morning, we complained about the problem. The manager told us how bad he felt about the problem - apparently the night manager had left a message about it.

We basically liked the place, but my wife was very disappointed at the short, shallow pool. She needs to swim several times a week for health reasons, and felt that the picture of the pool on the website had been misleading (as they so often are). It's more of a recreational pool for people at the rooftop bar (nice view, pricy drinks, didn't try the restaurant with the celebrity chef). Otherwise, the place was pretty good. We had a minisuite with a sofabed, for which we paid well north of $200, listed as a discount rate--it was sort of a special occasion trip for us. But the main bed was big and very comfortable, even the sofabed wasn't bed--though it left a very tight passage in the room when it was open. The \"rain\" shower was excellent, and the bathroom area was helpfully divided up into shower stall, toilet room, and a sink/dressing area--though the shower and toilet didn't have opaque doors (there's a sliding door between the whole bathroom and the rest of the room). There were two giant TVs with plugs for video devices. A refrigerator but no microwave, and no radios or clocks! We had to light up our cell phones to check the time in the middle of the night. Parking was $26, plus 10% parking tax. Ironically, we had to park there because we'd driven down but were trying to do as much of the visit car-free as possible--we did that for most of it. If we'd been using the car constantly we could have parked in a two hour parking spot on a neighboring street--not on Wilshire Boulevard. Transit service is good there, with frequent buses along Wilshire Boulevard out to Beverly Hills and Santa Monica and in to Koreatown and Downtown, and good service on Fairfax Ave. (one long block away) as well. The hotel is across the street from a minimall with numerous restaurants--including pretty good Caffe Latte--but because we arrived at Christmastime they weren't open much.

The room itself was gorgeous and aside from some issues between our iPads and the WiFi, everything was great. The bed was very comfy, the television was good, the toiletries were nice and the bath was OUTSTANDING - we had a junior suite and the bathroom was incredible. We found the room to be very clean and well appointed. The one thing that was missing was a guest book with a list of amenities and room service menus - we searched everywhere and couldn't find one, but really needed one and it was sorely missed. Hopefully by now this has been rectified. Unfortunately we were on the 6th floor right next to elevator; this hotel used to be an office building so they've had to make some concessions to the original architecture, and one of those concessions is that guests who wish to visit the very nice and trendy rooftop bar have to get off the elevator on the 6th floor and then transfer to another elevator to up (and vice versa). Tipsy young folks who are having a great time do not keep their voices and giggles down while waiting for for elevators next to hotel rooms at 1am, even when the folks inside are trying to sleep, and the doors at the Hotel Wilshire are not well insulated. It was Friday night, and we had been to a concert and had a great time but we still wanted to sleep after a long week... we couldn't, though, and it ruined our night. This 6th-floor problem is one the hotel needs to address if they don't want to deal with angry guests every night. The restaurant was hit-or-miss, but it was early days so I will give them some time to work out the kinks... my British husband was miffed that they didn't know how to make tea properly, but his detailed notes for the staff hopefully were taken in and they're doing it a bit better by now. All in all a decent stay, a few hiccups but the manager O'Neill gave us his card and asked us to inform him next time we were coming to stay so he could make sure we had a better stay, ie we weren't placed on the 6th floor!!

We are not \"boutique\" hotel fans and have great preference for the new updated classic hotels but we wanted to be adventurous.... My husband and I just spent 8 nights in a big 1100 square foot suite with 2 bathrooms and a den at the Trump International Waikiki so we knew this Hotel Wilshire was not going to be close in amenities - but still it was quite a let down. First, all the employees look very unhappy. One housekeeper did smile when I greeted her on two occasions but then we leave a tip (to scale as recommended by the press) every single morning including on check out morning. The front desk is not friendly even when I am. We had a junior suite. It is decorated nicely (modern) but we found the infrastructure design really flawed. The ultra sleek bathroom has a rain shower (nice) with no shower curtain so the water splashes everywhere especially on their nice new bamboo wood floor. There's a soaking tub but the shower head that is installed does not remain directed at your body so it's not an option for a shower. The beautiful Roman shade in the bathroom has to stay all the way down because the large window is in full view of the office building and garage across the street. The living room area has an interesting look but the new upscale lighting is very dark even with all the lights on everywhere. The intro rates are reasonable but I would not stay here again because we did not feel at all welcome.

It is lacking standard quality control and the service is not indicative of a 4* hotel. I know this review contradicts those already posted so we took photos to support it. I excluded the dirty tub photo and the one evidencing the blood on the wall in the bathroom as I felt it was too repulsive to post (that is a first!). Upon check-in, the hotel appears nice. Simpson was quick to accommodate a room change when the first hotel room offered a dirty bathtub, a desk lined with dust, strings of long, dark hair left on the leather chair from the last guest and a closet that had not been vacuumed. Guests venture before you at hotels - but a GOOD hotel does not make you feel like someone just left... ** We were \"downgraded\" from the king bed that we paid for - which my 6'2\" husband was not impressed by ** When we brought these issues to the attention of the hotel Manager, he assured us he would take care of things when we left off-site for our dinner reservations. We returned late to find the blood washed from the wall, however, the remaining photos were taken after we had time to fully settle in and we NEVER saw the Manager again - NOT reflective of exemplary 4* service. I can recommend the rooftop patio/bar only if you are in your early 20's; you can expect the same lack of service/cleanliness there, too. For a new hotel, a better first impression is crucial.
