The rooms are however getting old: the beds are short and hard and need better sheets and blankets. The rooms are very clean but the bathrooms quite tight and at times short of water pressure.

One can choose to cook because each suite is carefully contained with cooking essentials including an oven. It doesn't include pots and pans but hey, you are on a holiday!

This is also useful if you're embarking on a day tour, as bus drivers/ tour directors can easily find the hotel to pick you up or drop you off. Upon arriving, we were greeting by a smiling bellman who led us past the concierge to reception. If you need anything, from a map of Vancouver to hockey tickets, the concierge is the person to see. With their can-do attitude, and efficient service, it's like having a tourist information centre right there in the hotel. There are also public computers with internet access (which can be purchased from reception), and various tourist information brochures available. Checking in at reception was quick and easy, and we were soon in the elevator on the way to our room. Our room was clean and tidy, and had all be basic amenities to make it feel as if we had our own apartment. There was a kitchenette complete with basic cutlery and crockery, a phone and TV in both the living room and bedroom, and separate air conditioning units for both these rooms. Housekeeping is quick, efficient, and unobtrusive; our room was cleaned in the time it took us to have breakfast (which is also included in the price of the stay). There is also a pub called Rosie's on Robson which provides room service to the hotel until 10pm. For the cost of an average pub meal, you get filling, good tasting food in the comfort of your hotel room.

They gave us a discounted rate for staying so long (I think it was corporate rate) but I realized that didn't include wifi so I called and they comped the internet since we'd be staying so long. When we arrived we were told that only one device was covered for wifi and it would be an additional $15/day per device. My boyfriend does this (networks) for work, and that's the whole reason for the visit. Since I'm staying with him I need to entertain myself while he's at work and I use the internet for that. So we need at least 2 devices, and that's before our tablets and 3rd laptop. We got to the room and the internet was shotty, we had to keep putting in the password. If they are charging $15/day/device, you'd think they'd be able to afford the best of the best, highest speed internet. But after the first day, we discovered this was absolutely not the case when the internet went out. We couldn't log on at all, and when we called the desk they said \"maybe it will be fixed tomorrow\",, tomorrow came and it was \"maybe tonight\" but the bf had some coworkers coming in to join him & stay in the same hotel. We all cancelled our reservations and went to Georgian Court (which was great). They were allowing guests to use wired internet at their single kiosk for 15 minutes at a time but the line was full of angry guests...it was not pleasant waiting in line to find a new hotel. That's not all, the kitchens are from the 50's- completely metal and grimy. Our fridge wasn't working so we had to ask someone to come show us how to turn it on. Being so old it was hard to figure out the little plug in the back controls the temperature. The beds were hard, but I don't mind that usually. These were bad though. The carpets were gross & grimy and the bathroom was too small for 2 people. There were no full length mirrors and the lighting was bad. The breakfast was decent at least. Fruit, muffins coffee & tea-continental breakfast. But the exercise room was pitiful. I thought it was a storage room when we arrived, but when I went to use it, yikes. It is on the ground level, with window walls looking out to the driveway where people and taxis come & go. There were a couple of outdated machines, one was unplugged and \"out of service\" sign was on it. There were white stains on the curtains (I can only imagine) and what looked like vomit stains on the carpet. This would be an ok place to stay (for less money) if you were going to a game or just wanted to party and were leaving the next day. And didn't have to shower. The shower curtains are really cheap and suck in while you shower, so you have to push them out or put weights on them. This results in a flood every time you shower and there isn't enough space in the bathroom to hold all the towels you will need to use to mop up. It feels like everything in this hotel came from a garage sale. There wasn't even any stuffing left in the couch. It's gross, I would never stay here again unless it was free. Even then only maybe. At least the staff was friendly and accommodating. I almost feel bad leaving such a bad review. The owner should stop being stingy with the money you charge people and splurge on quality furniture, flooring, internet, etc. Stop buying from old estate sales.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nanaimo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery bad customer service\u201d", "Author": "Leanne D", "ReviewID": "UR125265627", "Content": "Very shocked at how they treated us.

I was a little leery after looking at some the pics on this site but our room (#809) was really nice and appeared to have been recreantly fully updated. I knew VI had redone the kitchen areas but I didn\u2019t know what to expect regarding the rest of the unit. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that everything had fresh updated look to it. The living room/kitchen area in the two bedroom suite was definitely smaller than at other VI resorts I\u2019ve been to (only about a fourth of the usual amount of space, if that) and with only 1 bathroom, 1 living room chair, a couch that sits 3 and a table that seats 2 in my opinion it\u2019d be WAY too small for a party of 6 but for a party of 4 it was comfortable. The TV in the front room had horrible reception, very snowy. I reported it to VI so hopefully they\u2019ll get that fixed. The TV in the 2nd bedroom was fine and we never tested out the other one so I don\u2019t know what it was like. I found the beds to be firm as well but the linens seemed fine to me. The check in and out process was very quick and easy. They do a temporary security charge of $100 when you check in. It\u2019s $5 a day for internet and $16 a day for in & out parking -VERY TIGHT spaces and was a little challenging trying to find a space our 2nd night and the tax amount was around $13 for the two nights added together. We spent Saturday walking in a huge circle around Vancouver. We checked in with the concierge and let us know the safer areas vs the maybe not so safe areas. We had a huge brownie desert in the hotel restaurant the night we arrived (big enough for at least 3 to share) and breakfast there the next day, both good experiences. One thing we noticed about Canada vs. the US was how much more expensive everything was. A $3 bottle of wine down here goes for around $13 up there just to give you an idea. Also if you use US cash in stores they exchange it at 95 cents to the dollar compared to 99 cents to the dollar at the banks and most credit card companies charge an international exchange fee except for Capital One. There\u2019s a 7-11 right across the street and tons of Starbucks around. All alcohol (even beer and wine) is only available in liquor stores.

The carpet had not been vacuumed and there was food, sticky thick caramel I think, smeared on two of the walls and dribbled across the carpet. These were not light unnoticable marks either; one was about 4cm wide, 20cm long and 3mm deep. Yuk. We pointed it out to the staff member who brought up the extra towels for our family (we had to call for this as there were 3 towels supplied for a party of 4). He just shrugged and said \"New Years Eve, we haven't had time to repaint\". There was also a wall size mirror that was broken and repaired with sticky tape. Our second stay was 4 nights in a 2 bedroom suite. I'm happy to say that the room was clean this time. The kitchenette however, was poorly equipped and made it difficult to cook anything e.g. one small pot and a small frying pan were the only cooking tools supplied in our unit that was designed to sleep up to 6 people. The fridge was small with no temperature control. Disappointingly there was no table to sit at to eat either. We made one meal and decided to eat out on the remaining nights.

Starting from hallways and continuing to the room - greasy, spotty 80-s carpet which was never washed. I've made a reservation on hotel's website for a \"deluxe\" queen bedroom two weeks before our weekend in Vancouver, but the only one that was available was 2 double beds (giving my hubby's complexion, we had to sleep separately because of that). Kids enjoyed their sofa bed, although an adult would be uncomfortable, since you can feel springs by gently pressing on the top of the mattress. Beds are motel quality with very uncomfy waffle blankets, dated as well as early 80-s. (If this is a deluxe room, how uncomfy are standard rooms then?). Beds linens are, although, clean and white; we had extra pillows for all 4 of us and stuff brought us couple more. It looks like their re-painted our room a few months ago, but, gosh, change the carpets! They are scary looking.... We also had a very strange heater/cooler/fan in our room - it seems to sense changes in milli-degree, since if it is set on 70, it will turn itself on and off every few seconds. Giving the noise this monster makes, it is hard to fall asleep if it is not completely shut down. We had to turn it off for the night - thankfully it is fall outside and window could be open to ventilate the room. Kitchenette is also 80-s, kind of a military condo style (steel doors, stainless steel, everything compact and build in like on the submarine) , but has bigger than usual refrigerator and all the dishes and silverware. It is spotless clean and working just fine. There is also an electric kettle and a teapot for those tea lovers besides usual coffeemaker. We also had unexpected surprise with hotel's pet policy - although it is advertized on their website as pet friendly and no conditions are mentioned, there is a 15 dollars/day fee, plus, they will not service your room if pet is present. There is not a word about that in both hotel\u2019s guest service book as well as on their website. If you will look at expedia - it is listed there, but you had to dig for that info and, obviously, we were unprepared for that charge. As a result - no cleaning service and 30$ extra charge... Hotel location is convenient for the city visitors - both trolley and big bus tours have stop just around the corner, plus downtown Vancouver is not so huge to walk around and hotel is in the safe part of it. It is a quite noisy at evening due to he proximity to the stadiums and multiple public bars/restaurants around, so be prepared to either not open windows at night or use earplugs. On the good side there is a small, but clean pool, steam room, sauna and Jacuzzi on the first floor of the hotel. Water in the pool is comfortably warm, Jacuzzi is a little bit deeper than usual - water is just below my chin if I will sit there and I am taller than average person. The only strange, but apparently effective (and maybe \"green\"?) thing in this pool that cracks in the glass wall and gaps between doors and frames are patched with clear packaging tape. This original repair trick makes pool air warm and you do not feel draughts of cold outside air. Overall, I do not think our family will stay in this hotel again unless some major renovation will take place. There are plenty of other hotels around in a similar price range for us to try. As I see from other reviews, some rooms in this hotel were given a facelifts already.

The suites were very big with full kitchen appliances: cooker, microwave, sink, cooking pans, utensils and much more. This could all be closed off from the bedroom area which was still fairly big. The kitchen area had ample sitting. In general, the suites very big and nice and quite. Underground parking was only $11 a day which is very good for downtown Vancouver. The maids were always polite and cleaned the rooms very well each day. There is an indoor swimming pool and my nephews loved it. Next to this was a hot tub. Before taxes the room was about $175 a night which is excellent for downtown Vancouver. This came with comlimentary, continental breakfast served each day until 9.30am.

I was looking for a somewhat larger space (with a separate sleeping area from the main room) and Rosedale on Robson seemed to fit the bill at a reasonable price.

It's particularly disappointing because given the location of the hotel and its generally \"good bones\", it seems even a small investment to spiff up the hotel could make a huge difference. Pros: + Location: a few blocks from the Skytrain, about a 5-10 minute walk to Yaletown water front and in the midst of downtown. Very convenient. + Reasonable rates (about $130 a night, not including taxes) + Large rooms with kitchenettes and ample fridges Cons: - Dated, dingy rooms: Looks like the hotel hasn't been remodeled for 15-20 years. Furniture is dated and chipped and randomly placed (mismatched furniture suggests it wasn't designed for this space). A traveling companion described the \"atmosphere\" as \"depressing single occupancy hotel\". It was hard to relax in the room and we found ourselves wandering around and hanging out at coffee shops instead. - No wifi (let's just say the hotel guide still has instructions on how to use dial up internet service...enough said). - Lack of light: Perhaps a room on a higher floor have better light, but our suite only had 1 window (in the bedroom) which didn't let in much light. The living room area was perpetually gloomy and dark, even with all the lights on. - Dingy: There were weird stains on the door between the living and bedroom area and our bedspread was pretty dusty, otherwise clean given the age of the hotel. - Uncomfortable mattress: Mattress was pretty uncomfortable (saggy and could feel the springs); sofa bed was even worse. - Lack of blankets: Even though it was the middle of winter (Feb) the only blanket in our room was 1 thin cotton coverlet, which left us freezing. We asked for another blanket the next night and received a second thin coverlet (not ideal, but at least bearable). - Lack of security: The garage is open for general public parking and the garage elevators go straight up to hotel room levels, without keycard security anywhere. Having rented holiday apartments in nearby Yaletown in the past and having seen what you can get for about $125-150 per night (a well-furnished, full-size apartment), I would recommend going that route versus the Rosedale...I certainly wish I had.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood for Transit\u201d", "Author": "Itchyfeet02", "ReviewID": "UR95136835", "Content": "This was a transit stop on our way into Europe.

(not sure if it's actually part of the hotel...you can charge your meals to the room so I suppose so) The service is just about the worst I've experienced in a LONG time and the staff is rude and inefficient. They take forever to seat you, ignoring that you're standing by the door, take forever to get to take your order, though the place is next to empty and then bring the wrong meals after a ridiculously long wait! We won't be returning to the restaurant, EVER! The first time we visited, the room keys didn't work, I had to keep going back to the front desk to get them to \"rekey\" it and each time it didn't work. I made about 4-5 trips up and down the elevator while my family waited in the hall...it would have been nice if they'd sent someone up to help. Parking...make SURE you don't pay in the parkade before registering! It's very deceiving as it makes it look like you should pay and then register but it'll cost you 3 times the price to do it this way. I complained to the desk staff about it but they brushed me off.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for Money!

It was well placed for Downtown although if we were to go to Vancouver again, we would probably chose a hotel closer to the sea. We had a good street map of Vancouver (a must) and found it easily. The hotel staff were helpful and we were able to take our bags to our room before driving to Canada Place to drop off the hire car. If you book with National/Alamo it isn't easy to either locate the drop off point which is in the underground car park adjacent to Canada Place, not even the local taxi driver we asked knew where it was. Once in the car park, the signs disappear and it takes a while to locate the right area. It took us a good 30 minutes to walk back to the Hotel, take a look at the library building on the way back, it's amazing. Although we had booked a double room, we were upgraded to a suite on the 16th floor so had a brilliant view of the City. There was a well equipped kitchen, big bedroom, small lounge area and 'neat' bathroom, all very clean. We found it quieter to keep the bedroom window closed and the lounge window open for ventilation. For those that like it, the air contioning was very efficient. Meals could be obtained in 'Rosies' resturant next to the lobby and although we didn't eat here plenty of people did and, when we called in for a drink one night, the food looked good and the staff were friendly. By walking four blocks we were able to get the number 19 bus to Stanley Park. It cost $2.50 and you could return on this ticket within 90 minutes.

This was their recommended hotel for Vancouver for our budget and, all in all, we were really pleased with it as a place in which to wind down for three days following our two-and-a-half-week tour of Alberta and BC. Arriving at the hotel by taxi in the early afternoon having returned our RV to the depot in the morning, we were greeted by friendly staff both in the lobby and at the front desk. Certainly, I was more than grateful to have a porter bring all our luggage up to our room - travelling with children is never a light affair! I would particularly complement Julie on the front desk for her manner with our kids and for the excellent advice on buses, ferries, attractions, etc. The room was much larger than we'd expected, even for a suite, with a spacious sitting area (two armchairs, couch, coffee table, TV with games console) and a comfortable bedroom with two double beds (and another TV). Separating these was a perfectly adequate galley kitchen (fridge with icebox, hob, oven, microwave, etc.) and a large bathroom. OK, the decor was a little dated, but the room was clean and perfect for our needs as we intended to spend as much of the final few days of our holiday as possible exploring the city. We did have a minor problem one morning when water came through the bathroom extractor vent from the room above, but this was dealt with by the maintenance staff quickly, politely and efficiently. The hotel is located very locally for such attractions as the Telus World of Science, the sports stadia and the False Creek ferries (which will take you to Granville Island, Kitsilano Beach, the Aquatic Centre and the Maritime Museum). However, it is a several block walk to the bus stop to get to Stanley Park. That said, for those who don't mind walking, the return walk along Robson Street past one of the most eclectic mixes of restaurants from around the world I've ever seen is quite worthwhile. There is a minibus service to the international airport which runs twice each morning. I don't think this is run by the hotel, but if you do need to get to the airport with a lot of luggage, then this is probably the best way to do so - it's quicker than public transport and much cheaper than a taxi. Despite the prices advertised in the lobby suggesting it would cost around C$40 for the four of us, the driver (who threw in a brief history lesson and guided tour en route) only accepted C$20 from us - bargain!

The second time we spent more money ($30 I think) to stay in a Superior Queen suite, which was definately better.....this time we also opted for the Superior Queen, but we were a little more critical. In a nutshell, I think for the increase in price they should offer up better beds...the beds are old and uncomfortable (and squeeky) and are exactly the same as the standard room beds. The livingroom furniture is uncomfortable and ugly and the TVs are old and very small. There is only one ice machine on the 2nd floor....we were on the 20th floor....they do have ice cube trays in your freezer, but the ice had a disgusting flavour, probably from the ice tray soaking up various food smells from all the previous guests (ewww). The towels in our room were ugly mismatched brown things and not very large....and only a set of 2 (we probably could have requested extras). The bathroom is tight and needs updating. I had forgotten how the shower curtain blows in at you and that there isn't a nice curved shower rod. Also, you'd think they'd give you at least one housecoat in an \"upgraded\" room. In a nutshell, the view will be better in a superior room, but not much else.....and, if you are there for a concert you will not be hanging in your room looking out the window all day. Oh yeah, the continental breakfast ended at 9:30am the day we were there.....the morning after a concert is not the time to have to rush for breakfast! Building is not terribly secure either....don't have to use your room key to get from parking area or in the elevator. If what you want is great proximity to GM Place or BC Place at a relatively decent price, then you'll probably be happy here. If you are fairly picky (like I am), then for sure spend the $$ for the superior suite, but be prepared for it not to be \"superior\".", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middlesex, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat central location...\u201d", "Author": "EmmaDurnford", "ReviewID": "UR47628464", "Content": "We stayed for 4-nights at the Rosedale on Robson from the 22-26 August 2009. This was the beginning of a month long independent tour of BC and Alberta - mostly staying in small B&Bs - and we were not disappointed with our first accommodation, the first of two hotels out of the total of nine places we stayed. I was a bit concerned prior to our arrival by other TA reviews regarding the refurbishment (or lack of) of the rooms but my concern was unfounded. We were allocated room 508 - a refurbished suite for two. The whole of the 5th floor appears to have been refurbished. The space was brilliant with a separate bedroom with kingsize bed (spare pillows and blankets in drawers). There was a galley kitchenette (fridge/hot plates and sink) with tea, coffee and milk which was very useful for a 'cuppa' in the morning. The bathroom was very clean with good toiletries, towels and flannels. There was a living area with writing desk and TV and a second TV in the bedroom. The rooms were serviced every day. The hotel entrance is actually located just off of Robson Street and I was expecting some noise as it is in the heart of Vancouver (there is also a firestation a few doors down). However it was fairly quiet, especially as the rooms are double glazed. As I am married to a fresh air addict the window was opened a little each night and despite being a light sleeper I had no problem, although some people might want earplugs to be on the safe side. The location is perfect for accessing Robson Street for shops (30 seconds!), Gastown (10-minutes walk) and Canada Place (15-minutes walk). There is a cash-point for Visa and Mastercards situated in the 7-11 on the corner of the street which is safe and has no charge for Nationwide Visa holders. There is a pool and jacuzzi along with some running machines etc. on the gound floor (to the left of the reception) which we did not use but looked clean etc. Breakfast is not included but Rosies is situated in the hotel and is good value. Our recommendation however is to have breakfast in 'Cafe Vancouver' a turkish cafe situated on the opposite side of the road next to the firestation. The coffee is superb and they have free WiFi access. We ended up there each morning having cinnamon muffins and pastries whilst catching up with emails. In fact that is the only downside of the hotel - is a lack of free internet access. The only way to access the internet was to register with an external company and pay by the minute.

The reviews here clearly reflect what rooms you are assigned at check in. My first room had a terrible smell of smoke. I was therefore moved to another on the second floor. The second room was right above the bar and quite noisy. As it was match day this may have contributed to this. I was therefore moved to another room on the fourth floor. It was much quieter and a much nicer room which had more of an apartment feel. Both rooms on the second floor had no window for the lounge and felt slightly pokey. My room on the fourth floor had windows in both the bedroom and the lounge and felt much more spacious. Something definitely worth considering a request for at check in.

The hotel is conveniently located with plenty of shops, bars and resataurants and the football stadium all within easy walking distance. In fact, we walked just about everywhere we went due to a) the ease of navigation, b) the fantastic weather and, c) the guilt of over-indulgence making us want to take some exercise. Gastown, Chinatown, Stanley Park and many other areas of interest were all within an easy 20-30 minute stroll and when required, taxis were easy to find.

We had booked and paid for the transfer in January and sometime after that the hotel had been removed. Since we had paid for the transfer it was cheaper to take the shuttle to the nearest hotel and get a taxi from there, which we did. The driver pointed us in the direction of the hotel and, being stiff from the journey, we decided to walk. After walking for some ten minutes, with two suitcases and hand baggage each, we decided we had had enough exercise and hailed a taxi. It turned out we were walking in the wrong direction! On arriving at the hotel a porter was waiting for a taxi and having comandeered ours asked if we wanted assistance in with our bags. We accepted gratefully and he walked off without the bags! Perhaps our Scottish accents confused him. After that everything went smoothly and we had a lovely stay for six nights in this, the third hotel of our Canadian trip. Registration in the small, basic, reception area was speedy and our suite on the fifth floor almost opposite the lift. There were 2 lifts, both in good working order and we never had to wait more than a minute for a lift. The suite itself was a little shabby but spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The lounge area that you entered from the corridor had no outside window but the lighting was adequate and one whole wall was mirror giving an even more spacious feel. The seating was comfortable and the television was there along with extra storage. We also found the most comprehensive hotel guide of all the hotels we have stayed in. The TV channels were listed, all the hotel amenities of which there were plenty, and advice on where the nearest convenience store and churches were. I can't now remember what all was in that guide but I do remember being most impressed at the time. A little galley kitchen led through to the bedroom area which had two huge beds. I was starting to get used to the size of the beds in Canada which all seem enormous to me. Lots of storage in the bedroom and a wardrobe for hanging clothes contained an iron and board. The kitchen had everything I needed and was equiped with washing up liquid and some basic tea, coffee and sugar. The little convenience store at the hotel entrance supplied all my needs for the week and the prices seemed quite reasonable to me. The bathroom/shower area was bright and spotlessly clean and there was a washing machine and drier on every second floor. I used both to freshen up my wardrobe for the next leg of our trip. Downstairs, off the reception area, is Rosie's restaurant. The food was good, the service cheerful, friendly and efficient and the prices reasonable and we ate there several times. The swimming pool looked enticing but I was always so busy either writing up my journal or planning/looking out the itinerary for the next day that I didn't get round to using it. We did chat to one family who shared the lift with us on their return from a swim and they said the water was quite cool but the pool area lovely and warm. I frequently do this, pick a hotel because of its pool then don't take the time to go for a swim! I loved this hotel. I felt very comfortable here and would go back. The only drawback was the 10 minute walk to the Chinese area or the 20 minutes it took to walk to the harbour area but this was hardly a drawback as we needed the exercise and we didn't even bother to investigate public transport or take a taxi which was not expensive. I loved Vancouver. We travelled on the Sky Train, a Float Plane, and the harbour ferry which was so well organised (enter one side, exit the other, waiting times never more than half an hour and displayed on a board in the waiting lounge) We were advised to get an all day transport pass for $8 and this was well worth it. We took a circular trip on the Sky train to see the suburbs, transferred directly to the harbour ferry where there were buses waiting for the ferry at the other side to take you to places like the Capilano Suspension Bridge and Grouse Mountain. All this and the return trip for $8. Well worth it!

Don't let this put you off though. The rooms size was good although the layout could be better - the 'living' area and 'sleeping' rooms should be reversed so that you're not sleeping next to the windows. The beds were poor quality and creaked every time we moved. The room was serviced daily and to a good standard. The front desk staff were fine and the concierge even arranged tickets to our first ever Football Game - the BC Lions v Calgary Stampeders. The stadium is within a 'stones-throw' of the Rosedale and it was a great experience well worth the money. One other negative and perhaps one that the hotel management should seriously consider. We were charged (as were the other guests) $11 plus tax per night for underground parking.

The hotel had laundry facilities on every other floor and were cheap to use, although for a week stay I would buy own detergents. I found laundry facilities to be very useful, when I moved onto another suite hotel I missed this very much. The hotel is in a very good location, 5-10minutes walk to Chinatown and 10-15minutes to Gastown. Yaletown is 5mins walk down the road and the Cinema and IGA Marketplace is 10mins in another direction. Granville Island was easy to get to as well with the boats 5mins walk from Yaletown. Robson street is full of shops and popular brands with a couple of shopping malls in close vicinity. It takes about 20mins to walk from the hotel to the end of the shopping end of Robson Street. Stanley Park is a very short Bus trip away. Rosie's Restaurant and Bar had very friendly staff (In fact all staff members in shops in Vancouver are friendly!!) the food was also good but Rosie's tends to be full of tourists naturally as it is attached to the hotel. My friends loved the Swimming Pool, Jacuzzi and Sports centre and were regulars everyday, sometimes twice a day! The suite was very clean, there were two tv's, one in living area and one in bedroom. There was no noise and the A/C was controlled by ourselves which was very good. Windows also opened which I appreciated (even from the 12th Floor!). Bathroom was also very good, bright, high pressure shower, rails and door hooks. Kitchenette area had a microwave, very large fridge and crockery, cutlery and tea towels. Electric cooker was very useful for cooking own lunches, dinner or snacks. The maid service was also very good. One negative - not enough hangers in the wardrobe! As there were 3 of us in a room, I did not find it crowded as there were two double beds and the sofabed in living area turned into another bedroom at night. I had a great stay in Rosedale and would go there again. Places to visit: Must do a bicycle ride in Stanley Park. Must do Whistler. Grouse Mountain - very disappointed, can take it or leave it. Capilano Bridge was better than expected even with the high entrance cost. Dim Sum in Chinatown was great and very cheap. Chinatown was like little Hong Kong stuffed into a few streets.

Our room was a one bedroom suite which had a main bedroom housing a king bed, one chair, a small dresser, a small desk, a TV, and a very small closet. A small hallway with a minikitchen (stove, small fridge, microwave, cabinets) separated the bedroom from the living room. The living room had a pullout double couch (NOT comfortable for an adult, but my five year old slept on it no problem), a couple of lamps, small desk, small dresser, and a TV. The bathroom was small, but clean, and had a shower/tub. My only concerns with the room were 1) very poor water pressure in the shower, 2) limited number of towels and they were small and flimsy, 3) room was a little worn out, with worn carpeting and looked like it hadn't been updated for a while, 4) our room faced a large construction site where building began at 6 a.m.! This made for very early wake-ups every day... We spent a lot of time in the hotel pool, which is indoors. It is small, but big enough to play around in. There is also a hot tub, a steam sauna, and a dry sauna in the pool area. The exercise room is right next to the pool and is very small, especially for a hotel of this size: there are two treadmills, a broken exercise bike, a recumbant exercise bike, and a stairstepper. The hotel itself is right smack in the middle of downtown, and we walked anywhere and everywhere we needed to go, including Stanley Park, Granville Island, Gastown, and all around the downtown area. We are very active in general, however, so people with limited walking ability or poor tolerance may not do as well. There are tons of restaurant options nearby, including a cafe/bar in the hotel itself. There is also a small store right next door to the hotel which offers a limited number of groceries and personal care items. Public transportation is abundant and easy to access from the hotel. I found the Aviawest office as well as the hotel front desk to be very helpful with information on local sightseeing and directions. One item of note for those who stay in the timeshare portion of the hotel is that housekeeping does not tend to your room if you stay less than 7 days. Consequently, we accumulated a ton of trash (which my husband would slyly dump into the housekeepers trash bag when she was servicing the room next door) and we had to keep reusing our flimsy little towels for both pool and showering use.

Enjoyed undisturbed use of the swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi (only saw two other people in there during our stay). Ideally would have preferred a room higher up but even then I don't think the views would have been that great due to location, proximity of other blocks and the amount of construction going on locally.

Unlike some of the previous reviews, we found our room to be quite enjoyable. Maybe not a 5-star, but a high 3-star anyway. We weren't in town for the hotel, in any event! The service was excellent. Housekeeping was very prompt in bringing extra bath towels and did a great job on taking care of our room. Check-in was easy due to our decision to arrive a day before the concert. As noted, because the hotel offers these packages, event days will see lines for reception, elevators and tables in the pub/restaurant (Rosie's). Factor that into your schedule and make appropriate plans. We booked into a corner room on the 17th floor. While the room was quiet, the height helps by being away from street noises and the view of downtown Vancouver was pretty cool. The pool is, basically, a lap pool with a bit of a wider portion at one end for splashing with the kids. There is a small exercise room with standard hotel equipment. For some reason, I didn't end up using it, after the concert! While the room was a little dated, staff were in the process of renovating, on a room-by-room basis.

Arrived at 5pm after 24 hours of travel from Australia and were given our room, got a corner one bedroom suite which was a little cramped, had to move the furniture to pull out the sofa bed. All of us wanted a shower of-course, but it didn't work properly, water came out of the bath spout as well. Rang down to front desk (Doug, not terribly helpful!) and were told someone would come up to fix it, we also asked for extra towels, shampoo etc since there were three of us. After half an hour rang back down since no-one had come up. Housekeeping finally arrived then the maintenance guy, he couldn't fix the shower but said it would be fixed the next day (no offer to move us). We made do as we were very tired and just wanted food and bed. Went downstairs after showers only to find that Rosie's was closed for a Xmas party so we went up to the MacDonalds just up on the corner (also a Subway around the corner and a 7/11 across the street. The hotel has their own grocery store as well). The next day when we got back from sightseeing the shower STILL didn't work. Different person working the front desk, this woman was actually helpful so she offered to move us. We got a room on the same floor, much nicer as it wasn't a corner room so there was more space. You still had to move furniture to get the bed to come out though. The kitchenette is good for using the fridge, and if you want cereal for breakfast, but in a room that obviously sleeps more than two, there's only two place settings and a frypan, and a couple of bits of cutlery. Had to scrub the frypan before using it (also washed cutlery since I wasn't sure it was clean) so I wouldn't recommend cooking here, we only attempted it once. The rooms were cleaned daily, but they only provide shampoo (no conditioner) and some lotion, and it's all in little sachets, which aren't very big. Internet charge was ridiculous so we used the little internet place right next door, their rates were much better. Overall I was very disappointed, and would not stay here again, I don't know if they've changed management since we stayed last, but the service was much better the last time.

The location was excellent. We had a great view of the Vancouver Public Library across the road and could even see a little bit of the mountains in the distance. It was in easy walking distance from the main downtown area and we walked up to Stanley Park from here (though that is a couple of kilometres away). The pool was clean but cold and there was also a hot tub. There was also a free breakfast but personally I'm not that keen on muffins which was all there was on offer. The hotel restaurant was reasonable. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and there were two tellys (one in the living area and one in the bedroom). Now for the minus points. My main complaint would be that the living area had no windows (they were in the bedroom) so the whole suite was rather dim. The suite was also rather small. We booked a Family King which said on expedia that it slept up to 6 if you requested the bunk beds. We didn't request bunk beds, but I thought we would get some extra space. Instead we got a king sized bed in the bedroom, a sofa bed in the lounge and definitely no room for more beds than that. The kitchenette was a waste of space since the only stuff provided was cuttlery and two bowls so you couldn't cook there. The charge for wireless internet was extortionate so we went without. I might stay here again if I could get a special offer price like we did this time, but at full price I would try somewhere else.", "Date": "October 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLooks better on paper\u201d", "Author": "poppyfield123", "ReviewID": "UR5964832", "Content": "We (3 friends and I) chose to stay at the Rosedale because we wanted to all share one place to cut down on costs (rather than 2 twin hotel rooms) but still having loads of space and good service. We chose a 2-bedroom suite. The concierge and reception staff were all excellent - very helpful and friendly. The suite was a decent size for 4 people and was very clean but the bedrooms had all the windows so the living area had no natural light apart from the little bit that came through if the bedroom doors were left open. This was fine for us because we were out early and back late but if you needed to be in the suite for any longer it would probably get very depressing. Another problem was with the sofa-bed. We'd chosen the 2-bedroom specifically because it had 4 separate beds (including the sofa-bed in the living area) but none of us could sleep on the sofa-bed because of the awful noise the fridge made only a couple of feet from the bed so 2 of us ended up sharing a bed in the double room. Rosedale really need to spend a night on that sofa then rethink they're 'sleeps 6' statement about the 2-bedroom. I don't think there would be enough room for 6 people in there anyway - there was room for 4 but only just. Another thing as that, although this may sound like the perfect place for a family of four with the double and twin rooms, I wouldn't recommend the restaurant if you have kids with you. One of us was under 19 at the time and looked it. The law is the law so we were expecting to be put as far away from the bar as possible but thought it would be fine as it's meant to be a 'family restaurant'. Well they obviously don't mean families with children! We were put in the furthest corner away from all other human contact and right next to the kitchens where we couldn't even see the light of day never mind the bar. Then the wait-staff proceed to treat us like some sort of a disease. To add insult to injury the food turned out to not only be over-priced but awful. I haven't had that bad a burger in a long time and I sometimes go to Burger King (no offense to Burger King but when you've only paid \u00a31.99 for it you don't expect it to be gourmet). It wasn't located in a BAD area as bad areas of cities go but we (4 young women) didn't feel comfortable walking back at night the last few blocks after you get out of the busy area of Robson Street (east of Granville Street-ish). The kitchenette was also very definitely an 'ette'. If you just need it for breakfast like we did then it's fine but not for any bigger meals. The hotel was clean and fine for a couple of nights stay if you're travelling with a guy but I wouldn't recommend it for single or female-only travellers or if you're looking for self-catering. The best thing about this hotel are they're reception and concierge staff - some of the best there are!

The hotel itself was perfect- the room was very clean and airy, with all the facilities we needed. The televisions and latest hotel movies were great for getting over jet lag. The staff were very friendly and helpful, with housekeeping every day- they even washed up our cutlery which was unexpected! The spa and sauna and steam room was perfect for relaxing the legs after a day of walking. The only slight disappointment was the swimming pool which was a little small. The thing we miss the most is Rosie's Diner. We loved this place as all the staff were so friendly and really made us feel at home. The food was great and reasonably priced.

One tip is to buy books of 10 bus tickets at 7/11 shop opposite as the tickets are easier than paying every time you use a bus. The no 15 service that stops at the Library opposite gets you into downtown quickly with links to other destinations (e.g Stanley Park -no 19).
