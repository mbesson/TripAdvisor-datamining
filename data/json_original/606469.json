Hotel is not far from subway station Artigues - Sant Adria, so the whole Barcelona is easy to access.

Hotel is clean and easy access to Metro Artigues-Sant Adria (L2) from hotel made our stay comfortable to travel around. Cost is affordable and worth for the money.

Hotel room and bathroom are very small but the important that they both were clean. There was a small TV on the wall which was showing local channels only. The staff didn't speak english, but if you know few words in spanish thats enough to get your key and pay the invoice. Subway is a 5-minute walk. You will get to city center (Passage de Gracia) in 15 minutes. Buy 10-trip subway card for only 7.85 EUR, it's also valid for busses and trams. Minus: The hotel is located right near the highway, we couldn't open the window in the nights because of traffic noise and dust. I would recommend this place for young people who are coming to travel Barcelona, this is definetely better place than youth hostels.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cvalue for money\u201d", "Author": "kostaskostaskostas", "ReviewID": "UR98671066", "Content": "friendly staff, near to metro station (10 minutes walk ),value for money, clean hotel,small rooms, easy free parking near to hotel (under the nearby highway)", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - I recommend it!\u201d", "Author": "190666", "ReviewID": "UR79118350", "Content": "My daughter and I were moved to this hotel as although we had booked a citybreak (the clue is in the title), our original hotel was located some 30km outside of the city! After complaining to our tour operator, we were offered, and took this hotel, and we are mighty glad we did. It is located in a small suburb just outside the city, but the metro is less than 5 mins walk, and its easy to use. The hotel is very clean, and the owners are extremely friendly - they will do anything they can to help you. Although our room was small, it had everything we needed for a three night stay, and as it was located right in the centre of the suburb, the cafe culture was just outside the door. The downside might be the noise, and the motorway is only about 20 yards away, but it did not bother us. The menu of the hotel cafe is limited (pizza); continental breakfast is available for 7 euros - but we did not partake. There is a lift to carry those heavy suitcases, and a safe which you can use for around 4 euros per night. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, and go back again.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money + inexpensive parking\u201d", "Author": "aLucky", "ReviewID": "UR63638140", "Content": "Stayed there for 3 nights.

We wanted somewhere near the airport as we were heading north the next day. We had problems finding the hotel's location prior to booking so we used the Barcelona City Council map to locate the street, only to discover that this was a different street of the same name. The reason was that the hotel is not actually in the City Council's area but in the adjacent administation. The area is is Sant Adria de Bessos which lies just north of the city centre although the hotel is only 2-3 miles from the heart of Barcelona. As it turned out the location was fine for our purpose. It takes about 25-30 minutes driving from the airport on fast urban clearways. From the airport head into the city and then head towards the coast on the Ronda Littoral. The hotel is located within a stones throw of this road, although a more detailed route description is needed to get from the slip road to it. 'Google Maps' site is quiet good - punch in the hotel's postcode for directions. The hotel itself is modern and clean and the room size is adequate. We found the staff to be amenable. We had prebooked breakfast and they asked what we would like. They were happy to supply extra toast and coffee. The hotel is located on the edge of Sant Adria's shopping street, no more than a small suburban centre really, but useful for odds and ends. The Ronda Littoral is on a raised flyover across the street from the hotel so it is possible that some rooms may get traffic noise. Our room was on another side and was very quiet. Don't expect good views from any aspect. They also have a small annex just around the corner where one of our party stayed - she said her room was fine too. It is possible to park beneath the Ronda Littoral for free if you come by car - useful as most hotels charge a fair bit for parking if they have anywhere. As for using it as a base for the city this would be possible, and it's very economically priced for people on a budget. Public transport links are very good too-it's served by bus, train and tram with good services into the city centre and the airport . (If you've not been to Barcelona before, buy the ten trip ticket which gives integrated travel on the different modes including interchange within 75 minutes of starting your journey, and more than one person can share the ticket (all for under 7 euros). It's sold from kiosks in the metro system and is valid from the airport on the rail link (but you will need to ask for it at the airport station ticket office).
