The location was perfect. Out of the way, quite, but close to the 76 strip as well as the colored routes to get around Branson and miss the traffic. Peggy Heiser, General Manager, was the main reason we came back to the Brick House to spend our long Labor Day vacation. Peggy is friendly, helpful, and her warm personality makes you feel like your staying with family (the good kind of family). The rooms were clean, well kept, and very spacious. The outdoor pool is in the back and is very private from the steet. We will be back on our next trip to Branson. :)", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bakersfield, CAlifornia, USA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value, Excellent Comfort, Excellent Service\u201d", "Author": "Sara s", "ReviewID": "UR139506884", "Content": "I booked this hotel because of the reviews and the photos of the rooms and pool. I was not disappointed! As a matter of fact it was more than I expected. The photos do not do the rooms justice, they are simple but so very comfortable and clean!!! I looked and looked to find a flaw, there were none. They were sound proof as well because I stayed next door to a nice family with many kids and once we were in our rooms I couldn't hear a thing. The indoor hallways were newly carpeted and painted and smelled really fresh. The beds were so comfortable as cited and the bedding was very homey, not at all like a hotel. We had a flat screen television with good selection and we used the WIFI which was very fast, we requested a refrigerator and microwave and they were delivered by friendly staff within minutes, literally. They were not overly busy and when I asked why the front desk associate who was very polite and knowledgable by the way explained they were new owners and Managers and had not the opportunity to build the business up as they were only open a couple of months. Trust me when this secret gets out there will be a waiting list to get to this hotel....very well done!", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "Shelly R", "ReviewID": "UR139421133", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights in August.

We spent one night here and was very impressed with our warm welcome upon reception. They were updating and we could see very nice newly installed carpet. We had a pet and was given one of the pet rooms on the 1st floor which was one level down. Pet fee was $25. The room itself was very clean (including the bathroom with NO MOLD/MILDEW)--no pet smells! The furniture was nice, the beds were very comfortable, and we could not hear people in neighboring rooms. This is not an upscale room, but geared to comfort and room is practical. There was a continental breakfast with donuts, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee, juice, hot gravy and biscuits, and a waffle maker for waffles. The biscuits and gravy weren't the best and the donuts tasted as if they had been frozen--other than this, it was pretty good as far as selection. We were out the main traffic area and could get around with ease. Plenty of places to eat and the Tanger Outlet was easy to get to, only a few miles away. We definitely would stay here again if we had our pet with us.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waynesville, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cHidden jewel\u201d", "Author": "Fred P", "ReviewID": "UR134441966", "Content": "This hotel is just a little way from the 76 strip.

In my opinion, the beds and pillows were quite comfortable. I needed a hairdryer and iron/ironing board. I called the front desk and she had it to me within a couple of minutes.....literally. The breakfast room was very spacious and had several breakfast foods to choose from.....biscuits & gravy, waffles, cereal, bagels, fruit, juice, milk, coffee.
