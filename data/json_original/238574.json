{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great staff, but too much noise at night Harry and his Philippino colleague Ju-in who work on reception are two of the nicest people I've met on a hotel reception anywhere. Informative, helpful and friendly. Also the actual location of the hotel is good in that it's central and overlooks a canal with nice views.However I hardly managed any sleep at all here. Rooms aren't all ensuite, which means people going to and from the lavatory on the corridor at night and opening and closing doors. Also the shower room on the corridor has a noisy high pitched shower. The hotel is very narrow and small so sound carries a long way. I was on the top floor of the hotel but not on the top floor of the building. There's an attic apartment. Heaven knows who lives there but they lived hellish hours - some guy came in around 0230hrs but then was in the shower at 0600hrs, again another noisy shower. Their footsteps thudded around on my ceiling. Maybe this was an apartment part of the hotel in which case it's not a noisy permanent resident - i suggest check first by calling hotel. Also find what floor you're on as it was 2 nights running. Bang on the ceiling for me - the only reason i didn't was because it might have been a one-off guest rather than a long termer. The hotel is near nightlife of Rembrandplein which means taxi pick-ups and gatherings of people around outside late at night on and off. Noise. The rooms themselves are OK - small but clean enough. No breakfast included in the price. no night time reception,it's closed. Guests are on their own, although i had no problem with that. Despite friendly, good service i would not stay here again.", "Date": "Sep 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR868789986", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Batsby"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d238574-r10007676-De_Admiraal-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "HotelID": "238574", "Price": "$110"}}
