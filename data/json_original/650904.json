If this is the sort of thing you look for in a city break, then Trastevere in Rome is where you want to stay. If that's the case, then this hotel is absolutely spot on! Trastevere is full of locals eating and drinking good quality products at fair prices, none of this plastic multi-lingual nonsense you will get in the touristy parts of Rome. Location wise, it's smack in the middle of Trastevere, with all the main bars/restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk. It's also only 10-15 minutes from the Piazza Navona where most of the tourist attractions are based. Vatican is a ~30 minute walk if you fancy a stroll through such a beautiful city, although buses are readily available. Ruins and Colosseum are equally about 30 minutes eastwards. Pretty easy to get to this hotel from the airport, get a train (local, not express) to Trastevere station and then get a tram towards the centre. The \"staff\" (probably the most human people I've ever seen working at a hotel) at this hotel are incredibly friendly and accomodating. I'm a pretty cynical person and treat any kind of recommendations with skepticism, but all the recommendations the hotel gave us in terms of restaurants and bars were spot on! They also pointed things out on a map we could take with us which was used more than the guide book maps we had. This hotel is effectively an apartment converted into 5 rooms and a kitchen, and although the staff are only there until ~6:30pm, you have keys so no worries about staying out late. Upon arrival, there was the legendary carafe of red wine on our bed, which was very quickly consumed after a day at the vatican! The room we had was very basic (Blue Room), but the beds were possibly the most comfortable I've ever slept in, had A/C, were very quiet, free wifi, and a laptop with internet. If you're visiting Rome, you won't spend much time in your hotel, so anymore in your room would be wasted in my opinion. Just a kitchen with a fridge, but there is an Espresso machine that is free to use, and the hotel provide you with tokens to have a Coffee+Pastry+Juice at a lovely cafe around the corner (also a nice bar in the evening!). To sum up, if I were to visit Rome again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again as it was perfect for our needs, extremely accomodating, and very reasonably priced.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "thebearandclaire", "ReviewID": "UR127939509", "Content": "The accommodation was very good & the service superb.

We booked online for three nights, and ended up staying for an additional three nights. We stayed in two different rooms (the Marilyn Monroe room and a slightly smaller room with a canopy bed that was as awesome in its own way). The rooms are all decorated uniquely, but both were exceptionally clean and bright. There are flat screen televisions, free wi-fi, and a laptop computer in each room. The location was excellent. Trastevere is a cute, vibrant neighborhood that has tons of shops and restaurants. Best of all, Trastevere doesn't feel touristy but it isn't far from all of the tourist attractions. It is an easy walk to the Pantheon and other sites across the Tiber River, and when we didn't feel like walking, we hopped on the #8 Tram or a bus, both within a 3-5 minute walk from the guesthouse. It was very easy to get here from the airport using public transport (a combination of a train to the Trastevere station, and then the #8 Tram towards Argentina). All of this, and I didn't even mention the best part - Maria and Fabrizio were extremely friendly and helpful. They gave us many tips about our stay, ranging from how to get from point a to point b, how to get bubble wrap to wrap up our olive oil and wine to take home, storing our luggage while we took a side trip to Naples, opening hours for stores, best views of Rome, and many recommendations of places to eat. All of their tips and directions were spot on, and really made for a great stay.

We chose the Marilyn Monroe Room, and this was the best decision. The room was bright, large and comfortable. Although we are at the front of the building, this was mostly quiet as the building is actually just behind the main road. You get a laptop in your room with free wifi and if you have a wifi enabled device the passcode is in the room ready for you to use. We returned December 2011 again chose the same room and still not disappointed. The hotel had changed hands and some changes had taken place \u2013 for example the fridge that is still in your room no longer works, however this was not an issue for us as we where out all day. As the hotel is room only with no restaurant attached you are provided with breakfast at a local caf\u00e9, this included a pastry, hot drink and cold \u2013 This became an experience rather than the normal breakfast feeling you get. We were welcomed warmly with a hot and cold drink, shown our room and to our surprise a bottle of wine and biscuits left on our bed. As always the hotel was extremely clean and quiet. The staff are polite extremely knowledgeable and always happy to help with any needs we had. This included information on where to eat and booking it for us. We had wonderful food and drink whilst here and if you like your food, history or architecture you will not be disappointed. The hotel is 25minute walk to the coliseum 50minutes to the Vatican and all other areas no further \u2013 in my opinion although you will be tired at the end of the day it is worth walking everywhere as you do see more on foot. Trams pass on your door step frequently (every 10mins or so) buses can be picked up and taxi\u2019s near by if required.

Easy train/tram ride from FCO airport. Love the neighborhood and we were welcomed by Alex and Maria. The room was clean, quiet and we felt very comfortable and given plenty of privacy. Fabrizio, Alex and Maria were always willing to answer any questions and help with anything needed. Fabrizio went online to help me with soccer tickets, which is not as easy as in US.

They're also always on hand to help with booking restaurant or museum/gallery tickets, which we found really handy given our Italian is non-existent. Value: for the location, service and size of room, I really cannot imagine finding anywhere comparable to be cheaper in Rome. Sleep quality: the communal area (the reception, kitchen and library) is adjacent to all the rooms so you might get slightly disturbed if you're a light sleeper. Cleanliness: room is serviced daily so no complaints here at all. Location: now this wins the day for me. Being on the west bank of River Tiber, Trastevere is markedly less touristy than Tridente, Monti and Centro Storico. Instead of monied locals and eateries/bars that cater for them, you get a youngish, local crowd who enjoys general merriments at local pubs/bistros off the main piazzas. Cafes and supermarkets can be found within 5 minutes walk. For first timers in Rome, a gentle 20 stroll will take you to the Roman Forum and Colosseum; taxi to the Vatican costs less than 10 euros; catch a tram from the main road right by the hotel, and you will be in Piazza Navona and Pantheon within 10 minutes. Room: quirky but functional. The laptop is a good idea on paper but sadly it does not work properly so care to bring your own. Wifi is free and reliable which is worth a mention! Things to be to aware of: 1) the hotel is located in an old building that looks rather unpromising with a rather small sign of the hotel so do look hard! That said, Maria or her colleagues will send you a very detailed email with various ways to get there; 2) there is no lift but only one flight of stairs to climb; 3) the reception is not manned 24/7 so don't lose your keys (one each for the front door of the building, door to enter the hotel and room, so it is rather secure!). My restaurants of choice are too many to mention here but you can't go wrong with these two: Lunch - you can pretty go anytime and have a good, hearty and well-priced meal at Capranica. Close to Pantheon. Dinner - Da Francesco. Go there. Expect to queue. Well worth it. Enjoy.

Fabrizio and Maria are perfect hosts, very sweet, very smart, very helpful and never intrusive. The fact that they are only there during the day makes the place feel more like your own--which wears well over a long stay. We stayed for 5 nights. The rooms are very minimal but function well. The location cannot be beat. One block off Viale Trastevere--the main artery through Trastevere, yet on a quiet side street. A few blocks from the Tiber and a bridge that crosses right into the Jewish Ghetto area--and all very convenient to Piazza Navona, Campo dei fiori, the Pantheon--and, going the other direction, Testaccio.

Please be clear this is not a 24 hour hotel with all the impersonal service normally associated with these establishments. The Bed and Breakfast/Apartment was exactly as it appeared on the website. It was welcoming, very clean and well planned. All rooms are en-suite. We had three rooms all had showers. I think there are five rooms altogether. All rooms had a laptop which easily connected to the internet, a safe, a hair-dryer, good sized towels, plenty of clothes hangers, air conditioning/heating and a fridge. The beds were very comfortable and we all slept well. If you needed a coffee or a hot drink there is a small kitchen for your use, with a complimentary selection of teas, coffees and milk. There is also a wide selection of reading material and guide books. You have your own keys and can come and go as you like. There are no restrictions on timings during your stay. If I were to be super critical I would have liked a large mirror in our bedroom (Marilyn room), But this is just incidental and nitpicking. It is within easy walking distance for most of Rome's major attractions and very near the Tiber. I think the nearest bridge was Ponte Garibaldi. There are numerous amounts of bars and eating places within steps from the building. Once we found our bearings we also discovered we were within very close walking distance to Ponte Cestio over the island Tiberna and there you have it, The Roman Forum, Palatine, Colosseum it's all there! Amazing. Maria and Fabrizio were there all day, just not in the evenings. But then why do you need someone in the evenings anyway? We felt very safe and the staff were not at all intrusive. They will help you with anything you need and answer any questions you may have. They give a very helpful street map of Rome. Recommend eating places that will suit your individual tastes. I suggest you take these recommendations they were by far the best out of the local eating places we tried. There is a friendly little bar at the end of the road where you can have a drink and wait for or meet the rest of your group. yes there is a little noise from other rooms/apartments but in reality not very much and I would be surprised if you could find anywhere completely quiet in a central location in Rome! All in all I thoroughly recommend this accommodation. Nothing is too much trouble for these wonderful hosts with their delightful accommodation. On a further note I was and still am, amazed at how friendly the majority of the Roman people were. This is most unusual for a Capital City.

They know all the best restaurants (take their advice, trust me!), they are happy to book museums, reservations, taxis etc etc. You just wouldnt get this personal service at a major hotel and it made our stay so easy and trouble-free. Breakfast is across the street in an authentic coffee shop where you share the bar with dozens of locals popping in for a cappucino and a chat. This is a great touch! What we loved most about this little hotel is the fact that it feels like you have your own little apartment in the excellent Trastevere district.

We were at the Marilyn Monroe (red) room. It was room number 1. - Walking distance to Billa (grocery store), Ai Marmi (pizza place), Take (japanese), so we were all set. - Breakfast across the street. You get a croissant, a juice and a coffee. Very friendly. Only DH drank coffee, but they allowed the rest of us to have 2 juices instead. - A/C was sufficient. - Safe in the room. A small fridge. A table and 2 chairs. There is also WI-FI. Cons: I am nitpicking here. These are all relatively minor issues. - Rome was 'hot' in July, so walking was awful. Because of that, the place did not seem as convenient to go to sites. Had to take the tram (very little wait) and then either take a bus (which takes forever to arrive, as much as 20 minutes) or a taxi (which cost 10 euro of so). We returned to our hotel after lunch everyday, so it was a hassle for us. If you are the type that stays out all day, then this is a non issue for you. - You have to lock your room with a key even when you're in the room. We felt safe, but as a mom, felt uncomfortable because was wondering what will happen in the event of fire. You can't exactly just go out, you would need to grab the key and manage to unlock it while you're panicking. - Bells are ringing from a church nearby early on weekdays. I think it rang for about 200 times. It wakes me up and then I just fall asleep again. It did not wake up the rest of the family. - Curtains are sheer.

am writing this review on the basis that those who read it will be arriving in rome as a tourist to do sightseeing as i was. getting to the hotel is not simple the first taxi driver i spoke to at the rome rail station said it would be 40 or 50 euros , i rejected his offer because i knew it was only a few miles to the hotel.the second taxi driver didnt quote a fare so i took a ride on the basis that the price would be in accordance with the fares schedule that is dispayed in his cab .the fare was 16 euros.this taxi driver didnt know the location of this hotel and endevoured to ask other taxi drivers as he was driving ,if they could give directions but he had no success.i ended up having to give him my map to show him where we were going.as it was he dropped us off on trastevere ave and we had to search for the hotel entrance ourself , luckily i had checked google map closely and found it. not a good start but i was prepared for this because other reviewers have had similar problems finding this hotel.now i know that this is not the fault of the hotel but it is something that prospective customers need to be aware of and that is why ive mentioned it. the hotel entrance is difficult to find because the street that its in, crisogono st, is so small only fifty metres long .once you locate the street its hard to see the hotel entrance because the signage is poor, its a plaque of about six inches by ten inches on the wall.the door to the hotel is a door such as you would find leading into a block of flats it does not look like your normal hotel entrance.use the intercom to gain entrance first time. once into the hotel you quickly realize that this hotel is in fact part of a block of flats , it looks to me like it has been converted from a large flat into a small hotel. once in the hotel it is clean tidy cheerful.the reception area is the area shown on their website as a communal area.the staff sit here and do their administration work. the staff are only in the hotel 8am to 5pm , i didnt find it a problem, you get a key to the entrance of this building plus a key to the hotel door itself which is on the first floor and you get a key to your room.three keys. my room was room five it was nice it was clean the bathroom was nice as well.no complaints at all. my last night was in room four its smaller than room five but just as nice to look at but it has one fault-the central heating boiler is located in a cupboard above the door to the bathroom and its very noisy, i was in rome at the end of april so the heating only went on at night, i turned the radiator off in my room but could not turn the boiler off so i had my sleep interupted til about 5am.i have to say that if id discovered this sooner i would have told the staff but it being my last night they had gone home for the night by the time i discovered the problem. the staff are superb multilingual very pleasant easy going helpful people. the area around the hotel is a bit scrappy and untidy , its not well lit at night but i felt safe so did my wife .there are good restaurants all around but when in rome check your prices before you eat or drink because there are scams going on , one menu for locals and another for tourists.this may be for the benefit of the different eating habits of the tourist but i noticed a big difference in price so i dont accept that it benefits the tourist at all, tourists are here to do as the romans do and that means we should be able to eat the same food at the same price and drink their drinks at the same price.this trickery is not just in the central tourist areas it exists all around.very disappointing indeed.watch out for charges for water, if you ask for non carbonated water sometimes restaurants bring you a designer bottle that has been filled with tapwater the lid is off when served and there is no label on the bottle and they try to charge four euros for it but dont tell you , they just put it on your bill !again i know this is not a hotel issue but its an issue with sorounding restaurants. getting to the sights is easy by foot back and forward across the bridge. if i were going to rome again i would choose a hotel on the other side of the river and i would choose a hotel that had a proper reception area and public area and a bar or restaurant so i had somewhere i could sit and have a drink after

Luckily the reviews all spot on and it was beyond my expectations. The Room: Very spacious, Large bed, TV, Computer and internet access, Free WIFI, welcome bottle of wine :) minibar. The Decor was gorgeous and the bathroom was very modern and funky. The rooms very extremely clean and housekeeping cleared up the rooms everyday. THe view just looked out onto a backstreet-nothing amazing but this didnt bother us, if anything it was quite nice to be backed on to a small street as Rome can be a very loud place so we slept well. Location: I cannot fault the location. The hotel sits on the other side of the river from Rome. It takes 15 minutes to walk to the Pantheon and the Coliseum Alternatively you can take a tram half way then walk the rest. Being in Trastevere you are more in the heart of where the locals live. Cheaper food and tastier than the main tourist restaurants within Piazza Navona etc...which are expensive and the quality of food isn't as great. There are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from just 5 minutes from the hotel. It is lovely walking around this area in the evening, a buzzy chilled out atmosphere. Breakfast: Breakfast is included and was served not in the hotel but across the road in a small quaint cafe. You are given a breakfast voucher to exchange and will get a pastry of your choice, coffee and a beautiful glass of fresh orange juice. The Staff: Were amazing, warm and welcoming offering great tips on restaurants, attractions and transport. Thankyou for making us feel at home and treating us so well. Tips: Our favourite restaurant was called 'LIFE' you can type it into Tripadvisor and lots of good reviews will pop up. Food was lovely and the desserts were amazing. It was quite well priced considering it was just off a couple of roads from the spanish steps. Go on the ROME FREE TOUR they offer 3 free tours and you just tip the guide at the end of the tour. The tour meets at SPANGA outside mcdonalds. If you type it into tripadvisor it should pop up. The guide was excellent and gives you a great insight into Rome. Take the train to Pompeii, we only paid \u00a355 for two return train tickets. It takes two hours to arrive in Naples then its a 25 minute metro journey to the site. You can take teh shuttle bus but this takes a good three hours and costs \u00a350 per person (min) not including entry fee. The train is a great way to see amazing views of Naples, Mount V and the coast.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arhus, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!

WRH Trastevere is a wonderful place to spend your holiday or business trip in Rome. First, the basics: it's a cozy five-room guesthouse one flight of stairs up from street level in a small residential building. All locks appear sturdy and secure. Rooms are smartly furnished, clean and comfortable (although some are quite small and a bit lacking in closet and drawer space), and all have private bathrooms. Neighborhood is quiet, at least by big-city standards. WiFi signal is strong, and each guest room is furnished with its own computer. TV too, although we never turned it on. The common area is cute and functional with coffee, tea and snacks always available, as well as a small library containing tourbooks and other reading material. (One possible downside is that we only got one set of keys to the building and the room, which could be complicated if my companion and I wanted to go off on separate adventures for part of our trip. But I suspect if we had asked we would have been given a second set of keys.) Maria and her crew, all fluent in English, go way above and beyond to make sure you can find the place, to welcome you warmly and sincerely when you get there, and to ensure you get the most from your visit to Rome. Maria clearly loves Rome and loves Trastevere, and she wants you to love them too. The hotel isn't staffed full time; nevertheless you always feel well taken-care-of (but never smothered). And the rates are very reasonable. As others have noted, a bottle of wine and some snacks awaited us in our room when we checked in. Prior to that, Maria had emailed detailed instructions for getting to the hotel by taxi or bus from the train station, and gave us a cellphone number to call if we ran late or needed help. Although we arrived after hours, Carl tracked our train status online and was there at the door to greet us when we arrived in Trastevere. About a week before our arrival we got another email from Maria with suggested day-by-day itineraries for exploring Rome, which were quite helpful. When she gave us her dining recommendations they definitely weren't the sort of commercial arrangements that some hotels have with the local restaurants, but rather the places where she herself likes to go out to eat -- yet tailored to our taste and desires. When we asked where in the neighborhood to buy bus/tram tickets, Maria gave us two and wouldn't let us pay her for them. (Compare that to other hotels that would charge you a service charge for buying a bus ticket from them.) Then she answered our question, once we had the two free tickets in our hands. Breakfast is served at a neighborhood cafe a short walk away, paid for with a voucher from the hotel that you're given at check-in: one voucher per guest per day. It's the typical Roman breakfast of a sweet roll, juice and coffee. Nothing special, but you really feel like a local there tossing down your espresso with the townies on their way to work. Newsstand next to the cafe has foreign newspapers: the Int'l Herald Tribune and the Financial Times are same-day while the other British papers are one day late, as is typical throughout Rome. My companion and I joked that Trastevere is Italian for \"Brooklyn\" because that's what the neighborhood feels like: very close to the city center but wonderfully apart from it; a real neighborhood, built to savor with long stolls and al fresco dining, peopled by earthy old-timer natives, hipsters, professionals, expats and more. The small number of tourists mainly show up at night for the restaurant scene, or stop by briefly during the day to see the artwork in some of the neighborhood churches (a Bernini sculpture two blocks away; 12th-century mosaics depicting the life of Mary a bit farther). Many locals will tell you Trastevere is \"over\" but although I've never been there before I didn't feel that gentrification has necessarily spoiled its fundamental character and charm. There's something in Trastevere for everyone. Despite being across the river from the city center, Trastevere is amazingly close to many of Rome's essential sights: Campo di Fiori and Piazza Navona, the ancient Roman ruins, Capitoline Hill, the Pantheon and the Vatican are actually closer on foot or by transit to Trastevere than they are to the more traditional hotel districts around Piazza Spagna or Via Veneto. The neighborhood is heavily and freqently served by public transit (including to the airport), the Tiber is bridged every couple hundred meters, and there's a taxi stand just a block from the hotel. What a great way to see Rome.

We absolutely loved the city and that had a lot to do with Trastevere and our stay at WRH. Maria, one of the owners (?) of WRH, emailed me a couple of weeks before our trip to find out when we were getting in and to offer some tips for where to go and what to see. Such attentive hosts at WRH! She also gave us great directions for getting to the hotel but, unfortunately, I lost them. Thankfully, our taxi driver was able to figure out where to go...it took him a bit but he figured it out eventually. Yes, the hotel is in a very nondescript building on an alley/small street but once you get up to the hotel, you will be pleasantly surprised. And once you get to your room, you will be thrilled. And once you start walking around the neighborhood, you will be ecstatic! Our first night there, we walked through Trastevere, stopped and got a \"birre to takeaway\" and walked to Piazza Navona for a cocktail outside. We had the BEST time walking and then people watching. And Maria had a great recommendation for dinner that night in Trastevere. The restaurant was called La Scala and we sat outside and enjoyed the nightlife of the neighborhood. We packed all the sites into one day the next day and had another fabulous dinner in Trastevere the next night. (We could have spent the entire time in that neighborhood and been happy as clams.) Our room was a haven to come \"home\" to both days/nights. When we first arrived, they had a bottle of wine waiting for us with a \"Happy Anniversary\" card for our 1-year anniversary. Such a nice touch. It meant a lot to us. And the canopy bed was beautiful and so comfortable. It was a very roomy room and we felt completely at home there. And the service was incredible! Maria was there the first day and got out a map and pointed out a bunch of different restaurants/ bars to go to and sites to see. I can't remember the gentleman's name that was there the next day but he was equally great. We actually saw him out at a bar later that night and chatted with him for a bit. Really good people. And they both spoke English perfectly, which was great for us since we didn't learn a lick of Italian before we went. (Everyone knows English but it would have been nice to have known a little Italian just so we could embed ourselves in the culture a little more.)

Here are some insights into our experience: Location: The location is within walking distance to all of the major tourist attractions (about 20 minutes to the Pantheon or 5-10 if you take public transportation). The location of the hotel is in a great non-touristy part of Rome so we felt like we had a more authentic experience than we would have if we stayed in other neighborhoods in Rome. There are many great restaurants close to the hotel and public transportation is just steps away. As stated in other reviews, the entrance to the hotel is non-descript and doesn't reflect the quality of the hotel. Hotel Accommodations: The hotel is very clean, modern, and large for European standards. As soon as we walked through the doors we were glad that we had booked a room here. An unusual, but very welcome surprise was the fact that the rooms all have central air conditioning, a must have on a 90 degree plus day. The laptop computer located in the room and wireless internet provided free of charge was a nice bonus. Staff: We were immediately provided with great insights for restaurants and directions on how to get to them. Prior to our trip we purchased a Rick Steve's book on Italy, but after receiving local recommendations we never referred to the book for destinations to eat and were never disappointed. Before we arrived, we were sent a helpful email asking us if they could assist us during our stay by booking museum passes, which we took them up on. This hotel is probably not best suited for larger families; however I would suggest to anyone I know visiting Rome that they stay at the WRH Trastervere.", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in Rome\u201d", "Author": "California86", "ReviewID": "UR35582568", "Content": "After reading the glowing reports about WRH Tavestere on Trip Advisor, we reserved a room for our June 2009 week in Rome.

Ingrid | December 2008 On my third visit to the stunning eternal city of Rome & my mother\u2019s first, I spent many hours in search of the hotel which felt right for us. I am quite picky however was not after a 5 star property this time. Although we wanted to be central, we weren\u2019t after being in the heart of the touristic areas of the city, which sometimes tend to diminish its charm. I found a gem named wrh-trastevere, which is a converted apartment in an old block located in Trastevere, which is a stone throw away from the river and a 15 minute stroll from the city centre [the first landmark being the gorgeous Campo de Fiori]. The place has been renovated up to very high specifications, giving it a warm, contemporary feel. We absolutely loved it and what we loved even more is the hospitality received by the owners \u2013 Alessandro, Maria and Francesco!! W E L L D O N E guys and T H A N K Y O U!! We arrived at the hotel at about 1030hrs am and found Alessandro to greet us. He offered us an espresso, talked us through the map of the city, suggested a couple of typical restaurants in the area \u2013 made us feel very comfortable and welcome! Although we had been informed we would not be able to check in before 1400hrs, our room was ready by 1130hrs. This doesn\u2019t happen often in hotels especially when they\u2019re running at full occupancy so this was an added bonus!! The room was exactly as the photos & description on the website so no surprises there. The idea of placing wifi enabled laptops in the rooms is brilliant!! The bathroom was lovely with hot running water at all times, excellent power shower & toiletries topped up daily. Always impeccably clean as was the bedroom. I must say my biggest fear must have been the beds however both the mattress and pillows were very comfortable and the duvets very warm and cosy. The constant air conditioning contributed towards our comfort and warmth in the room and lounge area. Oh and there is also a bowl of sweets which is refilled every day ;) !! They really have thought of every little detail!! Even though the reception is not manned 24 hours a day, Alessandro, Maria and Fabrizio leave a note in the room and in the reception detailing their contact numbers in case of emergencies. As they live close by, there is no reason to be preoccupied. The area and apartment block are very safe and we never felt threatened! In the reception area there are a few tables and chairs and a kitchenette with an espresso machine, kettle, hob, fridge \u2013 all at one\u2019s disposal. It\u2019s a lovely little lounge area where one can help himself to the delicious Italian coffee [on tap - another plus point] or make himself a cup of tea whilst reading one of the many magazines, books or guides on Rome made available by the owners. There are also facilities to cook yourself a meal, but with all the local restaurants of Trastevere serving typical Roman specialities, it would be rude to do so! Even though the facilities are available, breakfast is not served at wrh itself, however you are given vouchers to be exchanged at a typical Italian Bar called Bar Lelli, which is just across the road from the hotel on the beautiful tree lined Viale Trastevere. An excellent start to your day with traditional Italian cappuccino or espresso, juice and a fresh [cornetto] croissant. My personal favourite was the chocolate one \u2013 mmm divine!! The service at Bar Lelli was excellent too and the gentlemen who worked there would recognise us every morning and also remembered that I drank my cappuccino without cocoa on top from the start!

If you want to experience the true city of Rome and meet friendly locals, WRH is an excellent option. It is still in the city center and close walking proximity to all sites. Further, it is just steps away from the tram, bus lines and a taxi stand. It starts with the great staff, which include Fabrizio and Alex, both of whom speak Italian and English. SInce they own the hotel, it's more than just a job to them. They really want all of their guests to have a pleasant stay and will do whatever they can to ensure this is accomplished. The rooms are simply furnished and have everything one could possible need. As a traveler, my only requirements are that the room be clean, bed comfortable and that the shower be hot. WRH met all requirements and in fact, exceeded in shower requirement due to the modern, \"rain-style\" showerhead that offered a perfect spa retreat after a long day. One reviewer commented that the shower head did not offer a good shower experience, and I simply must disagree. It was excellent. There were also plenty of wall hooks for towels, so not sure why this was also an earlier complaint. As for the transparent glass door dividing the bathroom from the rest of the room, this does exist. Ours had a funky string curtain closing off most of it to the room, but it still allowed for some visibility. If you're not comfortable with this, than maybe you shouldn't be sharing a room with this person anyway. We were not bothered. The free in-room laptop with wi-fi was great and useful even though we brought our own Mac which also picked up the signal just fine. The rooms were spotless everyday with the usual clean towels. Breakfast entails tickets to redeem at a coffee bar across the street, which is a pleasure in and of itself. I have used such coupons elsewhere on travels, and they can get mixed reviews since the proprieters may look down on them being redeemed at their establishments, but this was not the case with WRH and the corresponding coffee bar--Bar Lelli. Every morning, we got free coffee of choice (Cappucino, Espresso, etc.) and a baked good per person/per room. It is not typical to have a heartier breakfast than this in Rome, so if breakfast is your big meal of the day, you will have to find it elsewhere...maybe back at home. Trastevere is one of the few neighborhoods left that is not a tourist trap. Since locals live in this neighborhood and dine here, the food often is much better than in other areas. Some recommendations include Mani di Pasta, Roma Spasita, Enzo, and Frontino. I do agree that the hotel is a little hard to find, but only just a little.

But, the proprieters are so lovely, so conscientious and have put together such a beautiful, perfect little hotel that I couldn't resist. The hotel is really more of a small guest house, at the top of a flight of stairs, in an old roman town house in Trastevere. There are just 5 rooms but there is a roomy, relaxing lobby area and while the experience is quiant, it is totally free of any of the usual, suposedly charming, European pensione idiosyracies. You keep and carry your room keys with you. The staff are friendly but not overbearing or overly chatty. the rooms are newly and immaculately finished in a sort of 'up scale Ikea' style - clean lines, modern designs, but full of beautiful details like a red mosaic tyles or crystal chandelliers. We stayed in room 5, which I saw pictures of on the hotel website and requested specially 9they were more thna happy to reserve the exact room I requested though this is a very big room and has an 'upgrade' price. Room 5 has a big iron canpoy bed, a small table, day bed / sofa, full closet and big bright roomy bathroom. It was actually more space than we really needed for a 'city break' weekend during which we only stopped back at the hotel to shower for dinner and sleep. I had a chance to look at some of the other rooms which were much smaller but certainly would have served our purposes for the weekend. The included breakfast meant free coissants and coffee at one of the bars / coffee shops across the street. The bar in question was unfortunately quite horrible but at 80 euro cents for a cappuccino anywhere else in Rome, this didn' bother us. The hotel is just off of Vialle di Trastevere, a major (but not noise) thoroughfare that crosses the river and leads right into the historicalcentre of Rome where all of the more famous sites are concentrated. You are about a 15 minute stroll to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, 20 from the Trevi Fountin, Roman Forum and there is nothing you cannot see in walking distance. We even walked easily to the vatican. but the best part of the hotel and my reason for being so thrilled to fianally find such a nice place in Trastevere is that Trastevere itself is a winding cobbled allyway old neighborhood jammed pack with a variety of fun, romantic, young, hip, elegant (everything) bars and restaunrants and my first choice for a breakfast stroll, evening cocktails, great dinner and / or 'night out. Before you leave this hotel in Trastever MAKE SURE you go to the pizzaria on Vialle di Trastevere immidiately in front of the hotel - it has big while neon signage, you can't miss it and it is the best pizza I have had anywhere in the world (and that includes extensive travel in Italy and years of living in NY!

I must admit that our cab driver had a difficult time finding the hotel and that the hotel could have been better advertised from the outside. However, as soon as we set foot inside, we felt comfortable. The rooms are very modern (Ikea style, which can be explained by the fact that one of the owners is Swedish) and are equipped with all desired amenities (including the all important laptop and free internet). Food is a very important part of our trips and the best restaurants we had during our stay were all located within minutes of the hotel (within Trestevere) and were recommended by the hotel staff. Therefore, do not hesitate to ask for, and follow, their recommendations. If we ever go back to Rome, we will definitely book with WRH.

Rather than squeeze us into the available bedding, we brought a sleeping bag with us and the kids loved taking turns sleeping in it. The room was sparkling clean as was the bathroom. The shower was fabulous with a rain shower head. Flat screen TV and laptop all worked out great. Minibar, safe, soap, shampoo, hair dryer, and daily maid service all included. The lobby has a 24 hour cofffee/tea machine as well as larger refrigerator and sink. The lobby is up on the first floor of the building with all of the rooms coming right off of the lobby. The location is fabulous. From the airport, we took the train to the Trastevere station and then the tram which took us within two blocks of the hotel. If we did this with three children anybody could do it!! From the hotel, you can take the tram and be in the center of town in five minutes!!!! Make sure you get the METROCARD when you are there for unlimited bus/tram/metro service. The down side would clearly be the noise. The outside noise of motorcycles, construction, churchbells and people seemed to be neverending. We did not experience any noise from within the hotel itself, just from outside. Also, the breakfast was a little underwhelming especially with three growing children: a hot drink, a cold drink, and a pastry.
