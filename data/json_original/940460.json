A choice of cereals, several cold meats, hard boiled eggs, bread and rolls, some salad, croissants, cakes and fresh fruit are complemented by fruit juices, tea, coffees and chocolate.

I had considered Motel One around the corner, but for about 15 euros more, the Holiday Inn Express has bigger and much nicer rooms. The hotel is fairly new. The rooms are quiet, pleasantly, if minimally, decorated. I booked a double bed. It was fine for one, a little cramped for two - a queen size would have been better. The bathroom was big enough and the shower hot plenty of hot water at all times.

There was no individual climate control, but the temperature was fine. I don't know how it is in summer. The window could be opened if necessary. My room had a small fold-out sofa, a good workdesk, and enough light for reading on the sofa or in bed. The wifi was excellent.

We picked the Holiday Inn Express (City Centre-West) hotel for it's location and price, and were very happy with our choice. The hotel is located on a fairly busy road but we were not disturbed by noise at all despite having a room facing the road - the soundproofing was excellent. The room was very clean and large enough for the three of us, with a well-appointed shower room (powerful shower even on the 7th floor). Comfortable bed, with a choice of pillows, and our son slept like a log on the sofa bed. The complementary breakfast was great for the room price - the usual selection of meat and cheese with various breads, as well as cereals, fruit, yoghurt and pastries. Signs in the lifts warned guests to expect queues as peak breakfast hours, but we experienced no major problems, on weekday or weekend mornings. Access to the city centre sights is easy - just 15 minutes or so on the U-bahn (U2 line). The nearest station, Wittenbergplatz, is only 5 minutes walk away. Located on the south side of the Tiergarten and within a few minutes walk of Berlin Zoo and the Kurfurstendamm shops (including KaDeWe, the Harrods of Berlin), there are plenty of opportunities for longer walks and retail therapy nearby. There are also loads of restaurants and cafes to suit any taste and pocket nearby. However, anyone looking to visit the Reichstag and it's iconic glass dome should note that it is currently closed to casual tourists - due to a terrorist threat - but you can (apparently) apply for permission to visit 14 days in advance of your trip. Something that wasn't made clear on any of the Berlin tourism websites I looked at prior to our visit, which was most annoying. Plenty of other sights to see, of course! In summary a great hotel at a great price, and one we'll recommend to others. The staff were very friendly and helpful and even let us check in to a room much earlier than advertised when we arrived quite tired and emotional after a 3am start, thanks to Easyjet - although I expect this depends on whether they have spare rooms free on arrival.

As Berlin sights are spread out, you will need to move around, so staying at a convenient location is a big time saver, and this hotel is perfect in this sense. As far as the hotel is concerned, it is a typical Express by Holiday Inn, brand new, well designed and functional. Despite the central location, it is very quiet, even in a front room. They do charge for Internet and (obviously) it is not cheap. The continental breakfast was OK, apart from the coffee; what's the point of an espresso machine if the coffee is not up to it?", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walldorf, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat location great hotel\u201d", "Author": "-C_h-e_s-s_y-trip", "ReviewID": "UR81382332", "Content": "It is very centrally located, very close to the Kadewe, the metro station and the pedesterian zone. very nice hotel, small but modern, trendy, colourful, brand new and non-smoking :) The first non-smoking hotel in Berlin and in none of the rooms of this hotel has never been smoked.

A grocery store was less than one block away. The biggest plus for this hotel however was its staff.

On first impressions its a very modern new clean hotel. We arrived slightly early and had to wait to check in which wasnt too much of a problem. The reception staff were ok but not very helpful in terms of giving suggestions re places of interests to visit etc, however they were pleasant on other matters. I used the hotel bar once during my stay and there was internet access which could be used at a charge. Travelling from the airport by train was straightforward taking about 45mins, however once in the City of Berlin finding the actual road was a bit tricky as we didn't have proper directions. Berlin itself is a very interesting place the social changes and developing infrastructure is exciting to observe, with good shopping centre. The former East side of Berlin particularly is progressing and what is even more fascinating is the changes in such a short period of time. I was left with an overwhelming sadness though as the enormity of the atrocities really comes home to you when you visit the places of interest. The holocaust memorial, check point charlie the museum, the sachsenhausen concentration camp outside of berlin, the plaza and seeing remnants of the wall was a reminder of the situation as it was back then, brandenburg gate all accessible via the train/metro and reasonably priced travel. The city tour buses were also good and value for money I found the walking tours very informative but you could quite easily get around Berlin on your own steam with a good map. I was glad I came here but not sure I would return I think perhaps its a place everyone should go once in their lifetime to remind ourselves of the horrors and dangers of extremism. To talk about the pros and cons of the hotel seems a little trivial when you consider that the history of this city is relatively recent which makes the visit here even more poignant.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "mela123", "ReviewID": "UR32963243", "Content": "Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express one night with my mom.

Ok, so the little bathroom amenities were in absentia and we only had those impossible to squeeze wall mounted soap shampoo combos. They did the trick and we were exceptionally comfortable. Breakfast was absolutely superb with crisp, flaky croissants, wonderful artisan breads, the usual array of cold cereal, butter, cheese. Very very nicely presented and all delicious.

The \"double bed\" was too small for two, and the mattress was uncomfortable. The bath was functional, but it's cleanliness left much to be desired: several drops of recent blood as well as a few pubic hair on the floor of the toilet cubicle, suggested that the HOUSEKEEPING WAS INADEQUATE.

The train station is a five min walk across from the airport. We stamped our tickets and boarded the train. At the Zoo Station we turned left and walked towards Berlin Zoo, after the Zoo we continued walking up the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and the hotel is easy to find. From the Zoo station it is approx a 15 min stroll.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "V\u00e4ster\u00e5s", "Title": "\u201cNon smoking heaven in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "Laban1", "ReviewID": "UR15368676", "Content": "Stayed in this brand new 158 room hotel for 3 nights and got a very good deal: \u20ac 62.00 per night including a buffet breakfast with a minimum 14 day advance non-refundable reservation. The entire hotel is non smoking which is absolutely wonderful. Location is very good on Kurfuerstenstrasse, about a 10-15 minute walk from Bahnhof Zoo station & Europacenter & 5 min from Ka-De-We & U-station Wittenbergplatz.. Bus 100, which runs from Bahnhof Zoo to Alexanderplatz stops 1 block from the hotel. It's a fairly quiet area, mainly residential and with a god mix of different restaurants. Enjoyed an absolutely wonderful dinner at Indian restaurant \"Mumtaz\", only 2 blocks away. Highly recommended ! The hotel opened early April this year. Rooms are of average size, equipped with flat screen TV & coffee maker. Beds & pillows are on the firm side, bathrooms are small but well planned & functional. Safe deposit boxes are available free of charge at the front desk. No restaurant on premises, only a bar and a breakfast room. A parking garage is available if you drive. The overall experience was very positive except for a disorganized breakfast service and uneven food supplies. They constantly ran out of bread, boiled eggs, cold cuts, clean cups etc and there was appearently no one in charge of overseeing it all. Instead you had to tell the staff to add missing items which they gladly did but it should not be up the guests to ask for this. Maybe part of growing pains since they only had been open for 2 weeks. Would definitely return !", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Express Berlin City Centre-West", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d940460-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Berlin_City_Centre_West-Berlin.html", "Price": "$70 - $308*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kurfuerstenstrasse 78</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10787</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "940460", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7d/c3/7dc3a4865f5f832fb0975f8bf1acd89b7large.jpg"}}
