The neighborhood was decent although a bit far from the city center, but close to metro stop so it was not difficult to get around. The only drawback to the hotel is the continental breakfast that is included. The coffee was horrible and all we were given to eat were rolls and croissants.

When we inquired about the WiFi access he told us we had to pay and continued to mutter under his breath. Never once during our check-in process did he provide us with a map or welcome us.

Near the Hotel you have some Mini Market where you cab buy something extra if need it .

Some of the front desk staff were very nice and helpful...others not so much. The cons....The beds were incredibly hard and the pillows flat. The toliet clogged up daily and we had to call the front desk. We were given linen cloths not towels for the bathroom. Which I thought may have been a cultural thing. But once we got to Florence we had nice fluffy towels! One night we had booked at tour that didnt arrive back until late. When we arrived the doors were locked and we could not get inside.

The room we stayed in was beautiful; well appointed, functional, and very quiet. Undoubtedly, the owners have incurred considerable expense to make it so. The pleasure of the physical beauty, however, is quickly negated by the experience of having to deal with some members of the staff. With three notable exceptions, which I will duly praise later, I found the staff to be only superficially polite, having the thinnest veneer of an agreeable personality. A condescending attitude towards the guests is not conducive to repeat business. Telling a guest that his coffee only \"seems\" cold because the guest, obviously, doesn't understand how a thermos bottle works is just wrong. When the response to even the simplest routine requests is a frown and the quickly worn-out phrase \"We'll see what we can do\", that is also not conducive to repeat business. Maybe they are under a lot of pressure, maybe they are just tired, bored, or ill, but whatever the reason, the guest deserves better. Three members of staff were conspicuously different; Luis was a delightful, charming, man, a joy to work with. Bernardo was a soft-spoken, mild-mannered, somewhat easily flustered by deviations from the routine but having a very pleasant attitude.

I did not find the neighborhood to be shady at all. It was not glamorous, but there were no bad vibes about it either, so I really do not understand anyone else\u2019s concern about the \u201cbad part of town\u201d. The hotel itself is quite small, as are the rooms, however, as I understand it, that is pretty much the norm in Italy. On the other hand, our room was clean, and had a somewhat simple elegance to it, especially due to the marble finishing and tasteful furniture. The beds were comfortable, we cooled off thanks to the air conditioning (although they only turn it on after 1 p.m. from the reception, as they state that it is cool enough before that time) and the bathroom, although almost incredibly small, provided us with everything we needed. The bath towels were a bit shocking though, as they were not towels at all, but were, in fact, made of something that resembled table cloth material, however, they did get you dry in the end. The only downside was that the changing of the towels was random at best, as we were left with the same large dirty towel for three days in a row, while all the others had been changed. The room was nice and comfortable and the small balcony with a table for two was a very nice surprise, although we did not get to take advantage of it during our trip. The best part of our experience with Hotel Donatello was the place where they serve breakfast. It is a lovely setting at the very base of the building (under the street level) where they have a small terrace with tables and seats surrounding an artificial fountain (just a wall with water running down on it, but the sound of the trickling water is very relaxing), and everything is covered by these beautiful climbing plants with large pink flowers that gracefully fall into the water or on the ground as you enjoy your meal. They also have very nice replicas of Roman statues set on the walls on one side, and a view to the garden on the other side (where some of the neighborhood cats like to perform tricks for you), which really completes the look to perfection. There is also indoor seating available that is just as inviting, although I was not able to part with the romantic atmosphere I could enjoy outside. Breakfast is very simple: bread rolls, croissants, butter, jams and honey and you can serve it with any type of coffee (although simple coffee and some milk proved to be the best choice, as the other types of coffee weren\u2019t really all that strong), black tea or orange juice. Breakfast itself was fine, but everything that was available was sweet and we were pretty much fed up with the same jam and honey every day considering we had been eating the same thing for our whole six-day trip there. A simple saltshaker or a small piece of cheese would have probably done the trick, but when in Rome, do as the Romans do. The service was great, particularly the receptionists, as pretty much every customer staying at their hotel came down to ask questions about sights and how to get to them every day and the people working at the front desk were very friendly and helpful and spoke various foreign languages, making communication very easy. They answered all of our questions, googled the information we requested, provided us with a map of Rome on our arrival and underlined all the places we needed to see, as well as how to get there, they pointed out streets on the map when we wanted to go shopping and even held our luggage for free when we checked out on the last day.

Even in the metro there is virtually no info on trams.

When asked they have provided us with a room with double bed (although the booking said only twin beds are available). The area is not at all bad as other reviewers suggest, it's not touristic but other than that there are small 24/7 shops around, supermarket, internet shop and good restaurants in 3 minutes of walking distance. When booking I was somewhat cautious about the noise from the railway line but we had a room to that side and there were no problems because of that.

Sound insulation is quite bad, yet that didn't disturb us too much.

As I said, our room was very cozy and the bathroom facilities looked new. Bring your own towels as Europeans use bath sheets. For us, Americans, its weird to use a sheet to dry off. I cant express how friendly the staff was. The continental breakfast was decent. We took advantage of it since we were traveling on a budget. The location of the hotel is excellent.

Our room was ready by 10 and we were shown directly to our room by a very friendly lady. Overall the hotel seemed newly re-docerated with a very modern but Italian, fresh clean feel to it. Our room was small however this was the only complaint- it was perfectly clean with nice new bathroom facilities, we had a lovely balcony and a very comfortable double bed. The room had its own safe and provided water in the mini-bar. It had shutters and big balcony doors which were double glazed so all noise and light was blocked out. There was little choice for breakfast (croissant and bread roll) but again staff extremely friendly and restaurant very clean and new. Its location for us was perfect-within walking distance from the colosseum and 5 min walk from Manzoni metre station.

First, location is at least a 10-15min walk from Termini, seedy crowd, homeless sleeping on the streets after hours or early morning please note. The pics of the front entrance shown are decieving, there's only a 2x2' sign w/ the hotel name, underneath is the sliding glass door entrance. Safe, secure, but as mentioned w/ a few other posts, not located in the nicest of areas, a couple of decent restaurants & made use of the Supermarket at Manzoni which has anything you need, this is a plus, much cheaper than buying a soda at the restaurants (.65eu compared to 1.50-3.00eu). As for the staff, I'd say it depends on who you are lucky enough to have at the front desk. I booked & prepaid thru the web & upon check in was handed a map, male scribbled in pen for 30secs to show the highlites & was escorted to my room. (Asked a female working the desk 1 day prior to leaving to arrange a taxi for me, said the hotel taxi was 50eu, otherwise I would have to call my own. Later, asked a male the same question, he said no problem, will call you a taxi upon checkout (early a.m) will be here in 5mins (took me to the airport for 40 eu)..While the rooms are nice & generally clean/comfortable, size is small as are the double beds (I'm 5-8 & feet hung over the edge, tried to push them together, but everytime I turned, the bed moved & made noise on the marble floor. Walls are thin, could hear next room's conversation. A nearby couple was cking out early one morning & decided to roll their luggage down the marble stairs (waking everyone else)..Shower (no tub) is at most 2x2' (everytime I moved, my elbow hit & turned off the water). No washcloths, just a small towel for shower. My TV was a 12\" w/10 channels (satellite?), obviously made in the '70s w/ a button missing. There is a small minibar-fridge. No fan or air conditioning, couldn't change the temperature, which led to opening the bathroom window (bars on the outside luckily), which in turn let in the noise from the street. As mentioned in other posts, Italians honk car horns at every opportunity, so not sure there's really a \"quiet\" hotel room in the city..Never tried the breakfast here..saw the seating area outside for use as patio, but no one ever sat there. While the trolley & bus run in front of the hotel, good luck trying to use either one. Maybe early morning or late nite, otherwise packed. Just as well, walking is best of course.

We went as a group of three couples and had a warm welcome by the always friendly and effiicient staff. (Always impeccably dressed too, but this is Italy)! A recent and unusual downpour had left one room with water coming in and this was sorted out immediately. However, the road outside is not for light-sleepers. My husband and friends had to buy ear-plugs on the first day due to the ceaseless noisy traffic. There is a normal (long) road outside the hotel finishing at a round-about and the Italians like to sound their horns the minute a light changes. The centre of the road is used for trams which are also noisy. I had no trouble sleeping but the rest of the group did although I was woken each morning in time to catch breakfast early. Trying to use public transport in the first part of the morning is useless. Trams and the metro are like the underground in London - people queue to get on but can't. I was stood waiting next to an Italian woman and we both laughed when the doors of the tram opened to reveal potted people - the same shape as the door that had just encased them. To call a taxi was hit and miss although the hotel sorted this sometimes. Our room, number 408 had a hairdryer but this only works for a few seconds as it cuts out due to over-heating. Do I sound miserable? Sorry, I was not. I like the willingness of the staff to help, with a specially written out mini-tour for our last day. I liked Rome. I love the poeple, the food, the architecture and I felt safe when out and about. Of course one taxi driver took us round the long route and it helps if you speak the odd word of Italian (as I know this saved us having a large taxi fare one evening). We are tourists after all and I am sure it is the same everywhere. However, my husband found the hotel claustrophobic as it had no lobby, seating area or bar. I understand the restaurant is being re-furnished and is in the early stages of this but it also meant there was no bar. Being someone who only needs four or five hours sleep he was reduced to running up and down the marble stair-cases and through onto the busy street when the doors where open. The rooms are small and not a problem but they seem smaller as this is the only space available in the hotel apart from the stairs and breakfast room (open for breakfast only). Our last day meant leaving our bags with the manager. We returned for 2.30 p.m. and asked to use the toilet before the airport. We were told no - I don't think they had any other than those in the rooms - and were asked to go down the street to some public loos. It is a 10-15 minute walk to the Colosseo and there is a good restaurant round the corner but we would not stay here again. It is great is all you want is a crash-pad and don't mind noise but in this respect this is really a bed and breakfast rather than a hotel. We saw homeless people sleeping in the street and it seems this is on the outskirts of their China town. Not a problem if the hotel has more to it, but this was sadly not the case.

He was helpful, however, in giving us the lay of the land and suggesting things to do. Things went a little sour at the end of our stay. We left our bags in a storage area for the day while we went exploring. When we returned in the afternoon, one of our big backpacks had gone missing.

He was extremely unhelpful and unapologetic. I asked if there was any way to get in touch with the individual he thought had taken our bag and he looked at me as if I was crazy. He insisted that this wasn't his problem as he had just come on duty at 1:00 and we had left our bags earlier in the day. After much frustration and going around in circles with the man at the desk (probably about half-an-hour), a light seemed to go off with one of the housekeepers and she remembered moving several bags to a different room. Our bag was there and all turned out well, but even as we were walking out the door the man at the front desk was yelling after us that this wasn't his fault because he didn't come on duty until 1:00.

We had a double room with private bathroom for around \u20ac165 per night , breakfast included. This was quite expensive considering the hotel is not exactly very central. We left it very late to book accommodation so didn't have many options. The hotel itself is quite nice, the rooms are spacious and extremely clean. We also had a little balcony which was nice to sit out on with a pizza and some wine at night. There was air conditioning in the room which was very welcome. The big downside for us was that the elevator wasn't working for our entire stay, and our room was on the fourth floor. After spending the whole day walking around Rome it is no fun walking up all those flights of stairs, or going up and down them just to get breakfast. It certainly wouldn't be recommended for eldery people or anyone with small children or babies. The owner told us the elevator would be fixed in \"a couple of days\" but there's no doubt he's been saying that for the past while back. There are renovations going on (still) throughout the hotel but we didn't hear any noise early in the morning etc. The breakfast is served in a nice little courtyard and included a croissant, a scone, coffee, and some biscuits. You would definitely need to get the metro , or a bus , into the centre of Rome from this hotel , particularly as you would do so much walking around the city during the day. The nearest metro stop is Manzoni and was also \"under construction \"... The next closest was about 10 mins walk away , but the metro is only \u20ac1 and is very frequent so we used it quite a lot to get around. It closes at 9pm though so we had to get a taxi back to the hotel a couple of nights which cost \u20ac8 from around the spanish steps to the hotel. The hotel is in a fairly quiet and isolated area, it didn't feel unsafe , just a little bit out of the way. The only places within walking distance are the Colesseum and maybe Termini too. The staff were fairly helpful, it's run by a husband and wife, we really only dealt with the man, who had good english and had no problems giving directions for anywhere we asked. For anyone going to stay in this hotel , the best ice cream parlour in rome is down the street from the hotel, Freddies palace. Not to be missed.

It was to us, like seeing New York or Phila. Again, the Red bus proved beneficial to see sights for only 12 Euro, the metro is one block down, colliseum a few blocks up the street, ruins everywhere within walking distance. Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to see the Vatican or Sistine Chapel since the weekend was free to all and the Ques were over two miles long. We did hear the Pope speak and give a blessing in St. Peter's Square, and the Pantheon was well worth the walk. Awesome.
