My boyfriend & I had a great time. The hotel was a good base to explore the old town, the creek & easily get cabs ( or the open top bus tour!) over to Jumerah Beach area. The service was great, we were met at the airport ( although they did add an extra charge for this on at the end!) & were able to check in at 0800 & go to our room. NB this is important after a night flight from the UK which lands at 6am! The room was big. Huge bed & TV. A large separate kitchen area & bathroom. The room was clean, although the bathroom was a little 'tired' in places. Maid service daily was a high standard. The buffet breakfast was very nice. Something for everyone I'd say- cereal, fruit, toast, croissant, muffins, cooked breakfast, & some Indian selections. Pool area on the roof was great. Good views & clean.

I stayed here in Feb 2012, and made the booking after a cursory internet search. I would say that this is solidly 3 star establishment with some things a bit better, and some not quite there. I paid DIR1770 (including taxes) for 4 nights including breakfast, which computes to around US$120/night. Note, this is not particularly cheap, and there are recognized good class hotels available that charge this sort of price. I arrived at the apartment hotel between 6-7am and waited until around 11 for a studio apartement to be ready. I was given a room on the first floor facing the front ie overlooking Al Rolla Street. After about two minutes in this room, I realized that it wasn\u2019t go to work out \u2013 too noisy. So I grabbed my bags and went downstairs again. I then waited several more hours until about 3pm, when they gave me room 615 on the 6th floor. This was a lot better, with minor traffic noise from Khalid Bin Al Waleed Road in the distance and some loud music until the early hours from somewhere on Wednesday night only I think it was. The staff at Reception, one male and one female trainee, did not excel themselves during my 9 hour wait. I got the impression that the male staff member was also doubling as telephone operator, and consequently his attention was constantly distracted by the phone. My room was fine. Furniture and fittings were all to a good standard, the only negatives being minor scuff marks around suitcase stand, and mildew marks around aircon ventilator, otherwise everything was clean and in near mint condition. The windows did open, though they were a bit jammed and I had to get the maintenance guy to assist opening them. There are 3 units of plumbing in the apartment that have a plug, - kitchen sink, bath, and bathroom basin. You will be lucky if all 3 plugs are functional, - in neither of the rooms I was shown, did all 3 work. The aircon worked fine, but cools only - ie it is not thermostatically controlled, so I was a bit cold for a couple of days, given the time of year. The network internet in the room works well, and was included in room rate. Somewhat surprisingly, the plastic card in the room next to the door did not control the electrics, which was out of sync with the otherwise decidedly minimalist and economy-minded flavour of this hotel \u2013 a temporary glitch I suspect. The kitchenette was clean and had the necessary hardware \u2013 and included the basics in the way of cutlery and china etc. But don\u2019t expect extras like washing up liquid, tea towel or sponge. The bathroom, c/w bath, was okay too. Each room has its own water heater. If you like a bath, watch out \u2013 water heater doesn\u2019t quite manage a normal size bath, not in Feb anyway. I managed only by topping up with 4-6 loads of hot water from the kettle. If like me, you like to use the stairs even now and then in lieu of the lift, be prepared to negotiate your way past used meal trays, which seem to stay on the stairs for a long time. Not to mention, old newspapers and old telephone directories. Breakfast was very well attended, but like many things in this hotel, breakfast was only \u2018just enough\u2019. Chunks of melon and watermelon; and then the hot food was heavy on starch and staples like baked beans, sausage and scrambled egg. Pretty much the same every day, but sufficient to get by. It is definitely not worth buying breakfast if it\u2019s not included in your rate. Near the restaurant are rest rooms \u2013 if you are male, be prepared to wave an arm around in the air whilst using the urinal, otherwise the lights will go out before you have finished. The clientele in this hotel whilst I was there was I would guess around 80% subcontinent, balance Arab, European, Chinese etc. In general, the clientele were somewhat demanding, so the Filipina restaurant staff looked decidedly battle-worn by the end of the breakfast session. I didn\u2019t ask, but I assume that this hotel was alcohol-free, and this would be in keeping with conservative ambience of the hotel. If you want an environment that is a bit more lively at a similar price, try the Imperial Suites Hotel over the road. I would say that the Hotel Management at Rolla Residence was good in regard to attention to detail. For example, whilst I was staying at the hotel, technicians were busy fitting 2 security cameras to each floor.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Patna, India", "Title": "\u201cgood for family\u201d", "Author": "ranjan1967", "ReviewID": "UR125298972", "Content": "Recently in dec 2011 we six family visited Dubai.

The metro is within walking distance; as well as the abras (water taxis) on Dubai Creek to get to the Gold & Spice Souk, although during the \"warmer\" months the 20 minute walk might do you in.

When we arrived, we were told that we had to stay for the first day at another hotel, as due to some sort of miscommunication, they had given our room to someone else for the first day. We had no choice, and the hotel very blatantly asked to move to the other hotel. It was obvious they had to provide us a drop at the other hotel, but they refused to provide so. After a lot of quarelling, they did provide it. When we reached the other hotel, for about an hour, the hotel's General Manager refused to give us a room, saying that he is not answerable to Rolla Residence's last minute requests. So we were left stranded over there, for about an hour or so, after which they did give us a room. We were told we had to come to Rolla Residence back by 2 PM the next day. But the hotel we had to stay in for the first day ahd its check out time at 12 Noon. So we requested a pick up from Rolla at 12 Noon. Again, they whined and refused, but finally sent a pick up at 12 30 PM. When we reached Rolla, at 12 45PM, they said they will give us a room in 2 minutes. But they took a good 45 minutes to do so, again, we were sitting idle in the hotel lobby. We got the room finally, but one day (for which we paid the money) was totally wasted in moving in and out of the other hotel and the other troubles accompanying it. The hotel room, was good, clean and spacious. No complaints. But we never got hot water. Even after notifying the staff twice. The breakfast has a good menu, but lacks taste. For example, Baked Beans on toast lacked salt and acidity, whereas the Sambhar prepared was too acidic. The public bathroom attached to their coffee shop was exhausted of soap and bathroom paper rolls, and it seems that the person who has recently used it did not how to aim correctly, and the hotel authorities did not know how to clean it properly. We were so overhwhelmed by this turn of events that we did not even feel like trying their amenities, like the swimming pool or the steam/sauna. So no comments on that.

The one bedroom room was large and very clean. I slept well. There is a small kitchenette area which is useful. The pool/gym areas on the roof are small and not fancy, but were adequate. The price of the hotel compared well for the ameneties on offer. Check in was easy etc. Didn't try breakfast. The hotel is located on a side street close to a number of supermarkets. Getting a taxi in my experience is not easy anywhere in Bur Dubai, and on checkout after waiting over 5 minutes with no taxis in sight, the doorman got me a lift from a local who was outside the hotel. Hence I really don't agree with the taxi comments provided in the previous thread. Locationwise is good for the Dubai Museum, Bastakiya, the Dubai souk and across the creek on an Abra to the main souks in Deira. A 15-20 minute walk to these areas. In mid October this was just about feasible but during hotter times you would need a taxi. This is not a tourist area, but a bustling, busy city centre. When you do walk about, don't expect to see many other tourists doing the same thing.
