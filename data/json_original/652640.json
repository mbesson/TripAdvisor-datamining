We both surf and do not really care about a fancy room with a view or anything like that since the only time we intend to spend in the room is to sleep and shower. The location is perfect if you want to check the surf at Jobos literally by lifting your head off the pillow in the morning. It's also a short drive to a number of other spots on this area of the island. Our room was very small but did have a balcony (which we never used since our boards took up all the space on that side of the room and we couldn't open the door). Beware, there are NO amenities here. Nothing in the shower, no hair dryer, no ice/vending, nothing. Luckily, I was ok being really low maintenance in my appearance on this trip since we spent all of our time at the beach and in the water and everywhere you go is so casual that I just didn't care. We never ate at the restaurant, so I can't speak to that (no breakfast and they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays fyi). We arrived on a Friday evening and the ocean deck bar was going off. We were exhausted from a long day of travel so decided to grab a drink there.....turned out to be a pretty crazy, party atmosphere and that one drink quickly multiplied; it was a fun night. If it's not the weekend though, do not expect anything to be going on anywhere. Overall, this place was fine for us and our needs, but we are pretty low maintenance (and on a budget). If you require the nicer things in life, I would probably look elsewhere.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glastonbury, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cDinner with a view\u201d", "Author": "Kelly H", "ReviewID": "UR124643579", "Content": "The food was just adequate, good by Puerto Rico standards but the view is spectacular.

There is a stretch of restaurants along Jobos and this place seemed like a nice option compared to nearby spots- turned out to be the worst food and service we've had in our lives and we've travelled the world.... Empty restaurant yet waited an hour for cold food- not lukewarm but COLD. Ordered grilled shrimp skewers and a burger, sent the shrimp back to be brought back out microwaved still not even hot. Burger was cold and inedible.... Offered to pay for the 2 drinks we ordered since we could not eat the food. This was totally not an option with the manager who was so friendly when we came in- he literally said he was going to call the cops on us for stealing!!! We couldve walked out at any time but waited to speak to the manager and reason with him for our dissatisfaction in food we both only took one bite of. He made a scene yelling at us saying we were stealing from him and refused to let us leave the restaurant until we paid for the food which was awful and uneaten.

When I saw the place, i thought.....it doesn't look that bad. I really wanted a room with a good view of the ocean so the lady at the front desk gave me keys to 2 rooms and let me decide on one. The first room we opened had the sound of running water. My husband and I walked in and the floor was flooded. We went back to the bathroom and thought the shower was running. Ok, so we won't be staying in the first room. We moved on to the second room. When we walked in it smelled moldy and felt very damp. I looked around for a minute and saw a pile of bugs in the corner, i think they might have been termites. I touched the bed and it was damp, even under the top sheet. I went back to the office and told the lady about the flood and requested a refund. Neither room was acceptable. Apparently a pipe in the toilet broke in the first room.

Also, took long walks on the beach at night, quite peaceful. Not many tourists at all. Just be careful ifi you intend to swim, if you walk down where the surfers are, DO NOT swim there...nearly got swept away by strong current.

First of all, the place is a dump. It is next to a some spooky house that looks like it burned down years ago, but was never taken down. The beach is not for swimming. It is only a surfers beach, so I had to travel to the other side to go swimming. The rooms are not clean. It was apparent they never changed the sheets. I found human hair on the sheets, piillows and on the floor. The rooms were damp and smelly. The restaurant worker told me that there were no ice machines in the hotel and that I could walk down the road to the store to get some ice, but there were no ice buckets in the room. The bar which is next to the hotel is not owned by the hotel, but it is local and the customers are very local. Not a safe place for a group of girls to hang out. My overall experience was terrible.

I made a reservation for Valentine's Day weekend since I wanted to spend a few relaxing days with my wife. We live in San Juan and traveled about two and a half hours to Isabela. Approximately 10 mins from the hotel (5:30 pm), a lady called and informed us that the room was no longer available since someone at the reservation desk made a mistake and there were no other vacancies. We made the reservation a week in advance. This was an awful experience and confirmed the lack of professionality from hotel staff. I will also give them 0% in customer service skills since there were no attempts or interest to help us. At least, they could have called a day before, offered us another night at a lower rate or even recommend a nearby establishment. There was no interest whatsoever in rectifying this situation.

The room we chose had a great view of the public beach area and the surfers, although a bit further away than other accommodations. It had been freshly painted and looked clean. The bed was really hard and the tv was way too far up at the ceiling so it was hard to watch unless you were lying down. We don't have a TV at home so it was no big deal to us, but it might be to some. The decks off of the room were great and had a beautiful view. The popular public beach area was a short walk and there were plenty of places along the walk to stop in for a drink. We did not eat in the main restaurant, but ordered food from the bar area outside. Best meal we had in Puerto Rico- outside of San Juan. Live music - playing 80s rock started about 10:30 or so.

Using the Go To Puerto Rico website I located the Ocean Front and the price seemed reasonable and the location attractive; I booked two nights. Upon arrival from Old San Juan I was a bit wary. The directions were horrendous and after getting lost several times I located the establishment. It is right on a busy street and you must park across the street after registration. It it is set up a bit like a brothel with a bar on the 1st floor and a long hallway on the 2nd floor with rooms on both sides. I knew I was in trouble when a large sign stated that no barbecues were allowed on the balconies -- the balconies jut out 2 feet from the room & a chair doesn't even fit. The food in the bar/restaurant was passable and they do have a nice open-air bar next to the hotel. You cannot charge anything to your room and payment is up-front. The view is beautiful but you cannot swim on the beach -- take your pick as to why: 1) the surf is too strong, &/or 2) all the trash washes in right in front of the hotel. When I retired to my room for the night the A/C didn't work, the TV was out of order & there were bugs in the bathroom. There wasn't anyone on duty to address these issues. Needless to say I only stayed 1 of the 2 nights (but I'd paid ahead & couldn't get a refund). When I woke up the next morning I headed over to Mar Hau & thank god they had vacancies. Mar Hau is the best in the area, cheaper than Ocean Front, the food is better (the Mar Hau restaurant is a certified meson gastronomico), and has an ideal beach location. I would only stay at the Ocean Front if my car had broken down & there were absolutely no options.
