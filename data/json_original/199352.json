{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Geat Hotel I and my wife are from the US and just stayed at the Ambassador, Frankfurt. We were on the 3rd floor and found the hotel to be quite nice. The hotel staff was friendly, spoke English and was very helpful. Rooms were clean, modern probably newly renovated and well taken care of. We were concern about reviews of the red light district, but was never harassed or felt threaten. In fact, the accommodations/ assistance were better and general threat level less than any of our trips New Orleans Bourbon Street. There was some street noise but, not bad. Its close proximity to the train station worked out well for our travels. I would recommend staying there and will again when returning to Frankfurt.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR154988679", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pete581"}, {"Content": "Would return..... Location is excellent.... Everything within walking distance.... Top floor of the hotel has just been renovated, and I'd recommend you to request a room up there.... However, bathrooms are see-through (v.European according to porter)..... But much more up-to-date than older rooms..... Rooms were old-fashioned, but clean which is the main thing....

From the train station to the hotel it is an ok area. I read on here it was sketchy, but did not get that feeling. If you go past the hotel you go into the financial district. I never saw other than one location for the red light district, never saw a hooker, or other rif raf. There is a great Irish bar one block away, Mc Donalds and other eateries at the train station, and even a starbucks. The hotel was very clean, and the front desk staff was very curtious. The bed was typical European, and the pillows are firm. It is an older hotel, but has style to it. The internet was down for wireless, but there is a terminal in the lobby you can use, and the staff said if I had problems I could use there terminal in the office. I would equate this hotel to an old holiday inn with new furnishings. There is an alevator, vending machine. There are papers there in the morning, however, there are no irons in the room, so bring your own if you need it. It takes about 5 min. max to get there from the train station, I left every morning about 7am while it was dark and cam in at 12 to 1 and had no problems. If you are expecting luxury this is not the place, but if you would like good clean curteous service this place will work.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR288991688", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jbaflyer"}, {"Content": "It's \"OK\" for a Night The property has really nothing wrong with it.

You can easily walk to all major Frankfurt sites, the river, the main shopping district, or the financial district - or take the train or tram. The hotel itself is absolutely well designed, extremely comfortable, and the staff are incredibly nice and service-oriented. I will definitely stay there when in Frankfurt from now on. I saw some reviewers expressed concern about the neighborhood. While it is true that the hotel is near the red light district, you DO NOT have to walk through those 3 or 4 streets.

We got a taxi from the airport and when we got to our hotel we nearly died! it was right in the middle of the red light district!!! It was a sleezy place but i suppose a safe place as there were police everywhere! Not many lively bars around mind you we did stay midweek in February. Oreillys Irish bar was good craic and the food was really nice there.The Brazilian bar next door is also good craic but i suppose it depends what company your in. There is alot of american idiots (sorry soldiers) who are based in Frankfurt and will at any chance they get try to annoy you! Please steer well clear of them!!!! Took a trip on the tram to Sachenhausen, it was lovely , would have preferred to be there at a busier time though as the pubs were dead.
