Stayed at Moongate for 4 nights. It was clean and roomy. If you are looking for luxury, find another hotel. But if you are looking for safe, clean and cheap, this place is great. I read the reviews about noise, but it was extremely quiet for our stay. About 9 a.m. there was construction next door, but that didn't matter. I suggest you bring your own wash cloth, we never got any. The beds are typical hard as a rock mexico beds, but everything was clean, and the shower had great pressure and plenty of hot water. Over all we enjoyed our stay, it is in a good location and the front desk is friendly and helpful.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey City, New Jersey, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat value - if you don't mind the noise\u201d", "Author": "honjohito", "ReviewID": "UR101676144", "Content": "Great price (had to check in across the street at Tukan). Location is great. The noise was too much! We had room 11 at the back.

Once we wised up, closed the windows and turned on the A/C to drown out the noise, it was ok. Bed was hard and the springs easily felt. Shower had good pressure and hot water. Did not try the Tukan beach club (the front desk didn't tell us where it was, but we thought it was right at the end of the road, so we didn't ask). If you're there to party, this place will work for you.

Hotel is located on main touristic street in Playa DC.

Arrived at noon, check in at Tukan front desk (accross the street from moongate) was fast, paid in advance, gave us remote control, 3 towel cards, and room key. They gave us the best room #6, terrace overlooking 5th ave. this room is the one that is pictured on thir webpage. AC, 2 full beds, plasma TV, table and chairs, terrace had a hammoc table and two chairs. The room did not have a telephone or mini fridge. Nicely decorated, firm mattress, a small closet, clean nice bathroom, hot water all day and night. Room and fresh towels cleaned daily. Moongate is part of Tukan hotel and we had free use of their beach club (next to tukan). Thank god for that...since Kool and mamitas only had 20 loungers out while we were there, everybody was packed on the beach in front of the beach clubs with NO shade. We had no problem finding a spot at Tukan beach club especially mid week. No food at the beach club, and drinks are only for people who get the all inclusive, but you can buy next door at Kool. You can even bring a couple of water bottles or soft drink with you from the store. No biggie...we did it a couple of times, the bartenders didn't bother us about that, as a matter of fact on saturday a group onext to us brought a vodka bottle and juice to make their own cocktails. I will definately stay there next year, this little hotel is right smack in the middle of la 5ta, basic rooms with the basic accomodations, waht more do you need. I only heard \"noise\" from about 6pm to 9pm, when the jazz band played at the restaurant in front, but it was when I was relaxing on the hammoc anyway, so it was perfect. there is construction next door, and they start about 8am....but nothing earplugs can't fix. After reading a couple of reviews I went prepared with my earplugs..only used them 2 nights. The swimming pool is in front at el Tukan, we only used it 2 times...it's small, but clean. The hot tub was being remodelled while we were there. We had breakfast at LA ceiba (buffet restaurant) everyday, basic breakfast buffet that included, Toast, pastries, orange juice, milk, coffee, eggs, chilaquiles, beans, hot cakes, french toast, and a on-site chef preparing omelets and eggs, It was good but not spectacular.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Value": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queens, NY", "Title": "\u201cSimple and Easy\u201d", "Author": "I_get_fly", "ReviewID": "UR25908509", "Content": "Simple and Easy. The Moongate is part of the El Tukan properties. The Moongate itself is a building with arched doors/windows, however, we were told that the rooms were not available in that specific building. Instead, they gave us a room on the corner of 10th Ave and 14th Street, a 1st floor Villa style room. Accomodations were simple. I paid $54 per night and stayed 3 Nights. The location was a perfect springboard to all the prime locations. 5th Ave is a couple hundred feet away, as the avenues go by 5's when they are really just the next block down. Had full water pressure and hot water the whole stay, room service provided clean towels and made the beds, cleaned the garbage. Security was always around and the area is extremely safe at anytime. It is a 5 minute walk from the beach.

There is a room with a balcony over 5th which looked nice to chill out and watch people but we went across the street to the Living Bar and did the same. It's a good spot for anybody to stay. The bad I guess was the construction which is everywhere in Playa because it is really growing fast. I think 8am was the time they would start but that got us up and out to adventure.
