Some noise depending on your unit but we were so tired we slept well. First room given to us (405) was designed without any thought clearly; the bathroom area does not have a glass door and the floor ledge wasn't raised so the entire bathroom was flooded and threatened to reach the carpeted floors. Requested for extra floor mat and even so, both were soaked. It was horrible because you're walking in and out of an extremely wet, slippery and messy bathroom. The hotel was obviously trying its luck with this room, and that wasn't a nice impression really for the number of stars it had. Can't imagine if we were stuck with that slushy and messy bathroom for 3 nights. Spoke to concierge & they changed to another room with bath tub and jacuzzi, room was slightly bigger as well and it made up for the awful 1st night experience. Breakfast was fantastic; various types of ham & salami, cheeses, cakes, cereal. Staff were helpful and courteous but even so, that didn't change the fact that they tried to trap us with a room which was clearly not meant for staying in with the shower they had.

The bathroom was also very compact, bigger people might have a problem to fit into the tiny tub. The shower pole fell off the wall, everything was badly maintained. The sealing between the tub and the wall looked like used chewing gum and was about as useful. The internet which was placed on a little desk in the small anteroom did not work. The carpet in both rooms looked filthy. Breakfast was served in a little room in the basement, selection was alright for Rome, you had to get your coffee yourself from the coffee dispenser. The bell boy and receptionists were friendly but we had the feeling that they did not hear our complaints for the first time but were obviously instructed to tell the guests they will take care of the issues - but they did not. The hotel claimed to be a \"4 Star Superior\" which is not justified at all in our opinion. Our impression was that the owners do not want to make any major investments in this hotel although the potential was definitely existing. They have tried to \"tart-up\" an old lady (which might have seen better times) and position it as an elegant hostess (Boutique Hotel). We will definitely not recommend this place.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201csmall but comfortable\u201d", "Author": "lorjim", "ReviewID": "UR113656886", "Content": "We found Boutique Hotel Trevi a comfortable and luxurious hotel, very centrally located on the doorstep of the Trevi fountain.

There was a small elevator but as I am claustrophobic I was relieved to see the hotel had central open stairs up to our room. The breakfast room is in the basement and the buffet is quite substantial. What made our visit was the staff. They were all so friendly and accommodating. The front desk gave us advice on restaurants, shopping and generally how to get around Rome and the serving staff at breakfast were very attentive. While there are crowds outside the hotel door( and I mean crowds, the Trevi Fountain is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Rome) the hotel is very quiet inside and we had no problem sleeping.

When we arrived they said they didn't have rooms for us in the hotel but that we would be switched to a sister hotel \"very close, 5 minutes\" We asked if we could walk since we didn't have that much luggage. He laughed and said \"No, very close 5 minutes by car\" Then he proceeded to lie about the new hotel's location three times and we come to find out it is past Porta Pia and about a 15 minute taxi ride away. We never would have booked this hotel since it's too far from city centre. He then kept trying to make it sound better with lies like, \"You'll like this new hotel better, it's newer\", \"The Trevi Fountain is closed at night anyway you can't go see it now\" (IT's an outdoor fountain, it doesn't close!\" Finally we agree to go to the new hotel for that night only if we can come back in the morning to stay in the original hotel for the remainder of the stay. He books us a taxi to take us to the new hotel and we had to wait for over an hour for the taxi to come, then when two small taxis came instead of one van taxi to take all six of us, he sent them away because he didn't want to pay for two and told us they weren't our taxis, which was another lie. THen he called another taxi and it took another 45 minutes. When we finally were in the taxi he laughed and said sorry for the inconvenience, yeah right. The next morning we had Thomas Cooke call on our behalf, since we booked through them. Luckily we were \"upgraded\" and were able to stay at the original hotel for the remainder of the trip.

In addition, room only had one single wardrobe which had a pull out rail, which meant we couldn't unpack for the entire stay.

The lower floors would be looking into other people's windows of the buildings across the street so I'd recommend asking for a higher floor (there are 5 floors in the hotel, i'd ask for 4th or 5th floor) The only inconvenient thing about the hotel was that taxis could not drive you to the hotel-the closest they could park was at one end or the other of the street. This really wasn't a problem, though- the hotel staff is obviously used to it, and the driver that we hired (Romacabs-excellent- i'll review separately) had no trouble finding it. He called the hotel when we got there and they sent bellhops for our luggage. The hotel itself was great. The front desk staff were friendly. When we first got there (early in the am due to flight) they were happy to store our luggage until they got the rooms ready, and gave us early check ins, which were most appreciated! The rooms were exactly as they appear on the website (charming, not cookie cutter!). Although they are somewhat small by american standards, they aren't too small for two people and their luggage. The only down side-the bathrooms have a tub/shower combination that i think was inserted over the original fixture, with a shower curtain and for some reason it tends to leak, wetting the bathroom floor significantly- not a huge problem but one that we experienced in both rooms so i think it must have something to do with the construction of the bath/shower combination. They had all the standard bath amenities except robes- slippers, hairdryers, shampoo, bath gel, soap, lotion, shaving kits, toothbrush/toothpaste kits, mending kits, shower caps,anything used replaced daily) Flat screen plasma TVs, internet (we didn't use, had our blackberries so can't comment on speed). The beds were very firm (which i liked, one of our sons didn't). We had a king bed room and one with two twins for our sons (the \"king\" was really just two twins pushed together but that was OK, there was no \"gap\" between them) Beds were long enough for us ( my husband and teenaged sons are 6'5\", 6'2\" and 6'1\" respectively so this is a problem sometimes) Closet with nice hangers, full length mirrors, writing desk, safe, mini bar- good housekeeping services done timely) Breakfast was downstairs in a small but charming area, standard continental fare. You could also have room service delivered free of charge. The area seemed to be very safe and was well-traveled. We never felt any hesitation or worries about walking around in the area at night and were never hassled by anyone. There were several little pharmacies and grocery stores in the area to pick up drinks, sandwiches, snacks, etc. and several inexpensive, casual and good restaurants on the little side streets once you passed the obvious tourist restaurants (which may have been OK too, we just didn't try them) The hotel staff was nice about recommending some local trattorias and we had some great meals there! All in all- we had a great experience there. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants a boutique hotel experience right in the middle of the action and conveniently located to all the tourist sites (and the best gelato in Rome, San Crispino!) :) I would not recommend it if you are looking for a secluded spot that is \"off the beaten track\".", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - small rooms, overall it was above my expectations\u201d", "Author": "yanka7", "ReviewID": "UR56889628", "Content": "We didn't expect much from the hotel, as our main criteria for selecting it was the location.

The bathrooms both had a bath with shower, towel heater, large sinks and mirrors and storage space underneath for nick naks. ( very clean). Pairs of slippers were also left and plenty of condements which were replaced everyday. Each room had a mini bar. We only drank fizzy drinks which were about 3 Euros however it costs about 2.50 euros to buy the same drinks from a shop so we felt this was good value. The service was lovely, all the staff were polite and friendly - always saying hello. Beds were comfy - best nights sleep i've had in months.

We arrived in Rome at about 10am and got to the hotel at around 10.45am. The hotel staff held our luggage for us as we could not check in until 2pm. I also had some medication which needed to be kept cool. The hotel staff offered to keep this medication in the room which had been booked for us.

The location of the hotel was second to none and truely excellent. Right in the middle of all of the attractions and close enough to walk. There is a supermarket literally 5 minutes walk away for any essentials and the Trevi Fountain is less than a minute away. The hotel staff offered to book us on excursions but we didn't take any of these. My advice for Rome would be to que up for the attractions and not to go with tour guides outside. They offer to skip the que etc but in all honesty, we didn't wait for more than 5 10 minutes in any que anyway and so paying the extra amount would have been a waste of money. The main attractions all offer audio guides as well at a cheaper rate and so I would personally take that option. The room was very clean and was nicely laid out. It could have been slightly larger but then to be honest, we didn't really mind as even when we were relaxing in the room, there was more than enough room to do so.

So that means that everybody knew about my problem and did NOTHING. That night was horrible. I felt like sleeping on a street, dressed and freezing. And that was, by the way, a 4 star hotel.

Only, I believe, if you are used to the the Las Vegas \"palaces and pastiches of Europe\". When you go to Rome/Italy, you go for the culture, history and way of life. In such a historic centre, you cannot expect a huge Hilton/Sheraton/Marriott/other American import (these are all available on the outskirts of Rome, but then where is the atmosphere??!!) This is a beautiful boutique hotel in the centre of Rome - 20 paces from the Fontana di Trevi. It has been very tastefully restored - our room looked over the main street, wherer we spent loads of time looking out of the window observing the tourists walking by - and was wood pannelled throughout with all mod cons such as plasma screen TV, internet, mini bar etc. Admittedly, the prices in the mini bar are a bit high, but check out the shop opposite the hotel where a lovely lady from the Philippines will sell you wine and open it for you to take back to your room - a much better prospect! We are serial visitors to Rome, having good friends living on the outskirts, but until this trip, we had always stayed with them or family. This time we were complete tourists, and can say that for reasonably fit people, all the major attractions are in walking distance (although at the end of a days walking the jaccuzi bath came in handy!). Fontana di Trevi - 20 paces (so near that after the first few times we stopped looking!); San Pietro - 1 hour walk which you must follow up by a visit to the top giving a spectacular view of Rome; Colluseum / Palantine/ Forum - (combined tickets valid over 2 consecutive days 12 euroes - a fantastic bargain) 15 minutes; Spanish Steps - 5 minutes; Piazza di Popolo - 15 minutes; Via del Corso - 2 minutes. I could go on........this place is so central, it is fantastic. Now a bit about the staff - all brilliant. I can highly recommend one of the concierges who knew everything. First night we asked for a recomendation for a good restaurant. He directed us to L'archetto (3 minutes walk) which we discovered was a restaurant we had visited a oouple of times before and loved - reasonably priced with a brilliant pasta and pizza repertoire. We then asked him to recommend a patisserie as we were going to visit our friends and wanted to take a small gift. No problem - out comes the map - \"we are here - you need to go here - and here is a chocolate shop in case the patisserie is not what you want\". Needless to say it was and we enjoyed the cakes that evening with our friends. All the staff in the hotel were charming and helpful - I guess it is all down to making a bit of an effort - speaking a few phrases in Italian and having a smile on your face! OK - breakfast - which some of our American and Canadian cousins have commented on! The breakfast room is in the basement, but is well lit and cheerful It is small (only about 16 tables) but at reception, when you check in, we were offered the option of breakfast in our room for free (!! unheard of!!) if we required. In the event, we went down to breakfast every day, and the only time we had to wait for a table was on Sunday morning. But hey - no problem - we went out for a short look at the Trevi, came back 10 minutes later, and hey presto! Table available we were on holiday after all! Good choice of meats, cheeses, bread, pastries, fruit and all the cappuchino you can drink - this is a continental breakfast - not American or British! When in Rome......... Occasionally, there was a slight smell of sewage - but then this city has been here since Roman times and so probably some of the drains have been too! You have the same thing in Venice - these are ancient cities so cut some slack! A tip ref getting coffee and food - don't stay on the main drag to the Trevi where an espresso can cost 3 euros - eeeekkk - come out of the hotel - turn right - at McDonalds (ugh) turn right - walk through a fantastic painted courtyard. On the right is a bar with espresso at 80 cents, on the left is a restaurant with house wine (very decent) at 10 euros a bottle, and the to the left of the restaurant, Michelle Pizza with (alledgedly) the best sliced pizza in Italy (we sampled and it was excellent!) at 1 euro per 100 gramms. So no need to spend a fortune! And a last thought - there are loads of street artists, but look out for the girl who is there at night. She makes the most fantasic paintings using spray paint - a bit like Rolf Harris - \"can you see what it is yet?\" at 10 euros each. Just go and watch for a real treat and to admire creativity. Oh, and another last thought - look out for the Gatti di Roma in the ruins - if you love cats they are fab. And one final - the ice cream - wherever you go - even in December - is FAB!!!!! This hotel was comfortable, beautifully decorated, location second to none, and the staff fantastic.

My bathroom had this smell as did the spot outside the breakfast room. I am not sure what was up with that but I am so glad I don't have to smell it anymore. Second, the breakfast was good however one day an Italian family came in and took the toast basket. I asked the lady for some toast and she gave me about 8 pieces of toast. I had 2 pieces and took off. She ran after me and asked if I wanted my toast. I thought it was kind of odd. Third, it is a huge tourist spot. There are people everywhere. Be aware that getting out of the door can be hard. Fourth, the internet is insanely slow. If you are hoping to upload pictures, think again, It is about the speed of a 56K modem for 8 euro/24 hours. Fifth, the shower usually caused the floor to be flooded. I don't know what the deal is but I found it best to take the shower head off to shower. Otherwise, water leaks out onto the floor.

We repeatedly requested the management to address this issue, but they were not really interested; their answer was that the air conditioning did not work when it was hot outside! We spent the (sleepless) nights trying to cool down by draping ourselves with wet towels! The only one who was any help was the one harried bellboy, who turned on the AC at 6:00 AM, when he arrived at work. It would go off again almost immediately, however.

If you get up early enough you can have your fountain photos without the tourists, alternatively, go back late at night \u2026a great time to get a gelato and appreciate the fountain lit up. You can walk to everywhere from the hotel so I can not recommend the central location enough. We found the hotel easily enough after catching the Leonardo Express train from Fiumicino airport and then 2 stops on the Metro to Barberini. From the Metro it is a short walk, just look out for the hotel entrance opposite the Blue Ice gelato place. We were early so our room wasn\u2019t ready so we left our bags, had lunch and on our return they were already in our room. All the staff are professional and courteous. The hotel is in a pedestrian area so you don\u2019t get any traffic noise. As we had requested a room on a high floor prior to arriving we didn\u2019t get disturbed by the tourist noise. Our 4th floor room was a good size. It was beautifully decorated and very clean, there is a maid service daily. The view over the roof top opposite is charming and the shutters, windows, black out curtains and sumptuous drapes all ensured a good night\u2019s sleep. There is a flat screen TV on which you can choose to listen to albums from contemporary artists for free. There is also a safe and mini bar in the room and plenty of wardrobe space with proper hangers. The marble bathroom had a Jacuzzi bath and powerful shower.

There is a variety of cold continental buffet choices which are topped up continuously. There is a choice of juices and hot drinks and even Kelloggs cornflakes available if you fancy. We can recommend using the Antico Forno, go left outside the hotel towards the fountain, handy for good lunch snacks and drinks. The gift shop opposite the hotel entrance is expensive, buy your booze and pasta gifts at the airport instead. I would recommend all the usual tourist sites but just incase you are a cat lover, can I just mention the cat sanctuary at Largo di Torre Argentina. They look after the city\u2019s abandoned cats and do a fantastic job. The cats are so friendly and love all the attention you can give them.

Another good choice near the Spanish steps is \"34\" at via Mario de Fiori. Also try Sabatino at the Piazza S. Ignazio, it looks like the locals eat there.

Cabs are in abundance, the hotel will call one for you if walking 2 minutes to the cab rank is too troublesome, or just stay local, plenty of tratorias, pizzerias and restaurants and cafe's / bars on the door step.
