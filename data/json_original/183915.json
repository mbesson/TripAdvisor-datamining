The hotel is in excellent shape and the service was great for a 3-4 star hotel. The rate was very reasonable for the location. We had free breakfast every day which was very good, however, the waiters were a little slow. The room service and dry cleaning service was fast and cheap! The staff was friendly and always ready to serve you. There is a restaurant about 2 minutes walking distance and more restaurants with a little shopping center about 10 minutes walking distance. The hotel also offers free airport pick up and drop off.", "Date": "Mar 20, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR658261567", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "poor value for the peso little hot waterlittle water pressureno thermostat in the room the bar was closed for remodeling the free breakfast was american food not mexican. the doorman told me that there were bars and restaurants within 3 minutes walk, there was not anything I found within a 10 minute walk.
