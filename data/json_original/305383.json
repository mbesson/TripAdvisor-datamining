A friend of ours who is from Hong Kong recommended Eaton Smart to us as that is where he chooses to stay when he's there. We couldn't be happier with our choice. Firstly, Hong Kong Island or Kowloon?- is the first question we asked ourselves... Kowloon is so much better! And the hotel is in a really great part - Nathan Rd - a 2 minute walk to the Jordon MTR, Kowloon is more authentic, more organic and interesting. We booked a club room so we got the E lounge included in our daily rate. BRILLIANT! No need to pay extra for breakfast when you've got the E Lounge \"continental\" breakfast... They provide you with hot breakfast options including eggs, hash browns, mushrooms etc.. PLUS yoghurt, toast, fresh fruit, smoked salmon and cheeses etc etc.. really really great value. In the evenings you can go down and have wine or other alcoholic beverages for free as part of the package. The room itself - the bathroom is quite small but functional, the room itself is also on the small side but that's pretty typical for hotels in Hong Kong - it's still very functional and comfortable with plenty of storage space for clothes and bags plus we also had a couch and a large desk included as well. We also had views of the buildings and the night life outside. The bed was a touch on the hard side but again this is quite common. The staff - extremely helpful and friendly, happy to chat and give you any advice or info.

Airport Express K1 shuttle stops outside the hotel, and requires you to carry your bags across the small lane before you are met with the lousiest and most completely and utterly useless concierge/bellhops you will ever meet. Not only did the bellhops not offer any assistance until you have carried the bags to them, they will drag your bags for you for a mere 10m before \"depositing\" them in the lift and pressing the Lobby button for you and leaving you alone with your bags once again. There were 2 of us travelling with 4 bags + 2 handcarry after a month-long holiday in the USA, so those empty bellhop carts and bellhops (primarily) would have provided very good assistance (and would have received a good tip too!). Check-in was another completely useless and cold process. There were only two queues opened when I was there and each of the staff is serving one guests each. It took a 15 minute wait before I was served, in a very cold manner. As Vicente came in hard and strong the next couple of days, we were pretty much immobilised in the hotel. We were intrigued by an advertisement in the lifts which proudly proclaims that their Chinese restaurant chef is a 1-star chef (whatever that means!). We went there on the night Typhoon Signal 8 was hoisted at about 9pm, and received one of the coldest welcome from the staff. Food tasted like it was out of the sewage. What completely peeved me was the check-out. There was a note on the desk after checking-into the room which says that guests receive at 15% discount when dining in the chinese restaurant. At checkout I presented the note and perused the bill and noticed that I did not receive the discount. I asked the check-out staff, Karen, if the discount has been applied, and she called the restaurant who verified that it has been, although I repeated to her that no it has not, to her persistence that she has already \"double checked\" that yes, it has been. I asked for her to present the restaurant bill to me which she initially told me she cannot show me, and thereafter told me to wait. I did. For about 20 minutes, until I can no longer hold it and wanted to get to the airport. I received an email later from Karen saying that 1) I did not present the discount note (which I did, she returned it to me without looking at it) 2) the discount has not been applied. 3) to come back to the hotel so that she can refund the discount to me I sent it back to her, disgusted, and asked her why did she claim that it has been all this while then? Am I also expected to return just to get the discount? I am not unhappy about the 10USD or so discount, but merely a matter of integrity and the lack of respect shown to me from another fellow human being claiming that I am a liar. Received another email from the manager to apologise for the inconvenience and that the staff Karen has been counselled, and that they will refund the discount into my credit card which I used at check out. Bellhops, once again, at checkout, was completely useless.

Pretty sweet a thought I must say. Had free access to EClub and we go there almost every day. There is cocktail party every evening but we always miss it. Had breakfast there for about 3 to 4 times. Small place but food was replenished fast. However, when it's raining, the place will be very crowded and almost to a point the staffs were not able to handle the overwhelming crowd. Some of the staffs became a lttle impaitent when the crowd came. Generally a good place to have a coffee or drink anytime of the day. Pool was really small. Too small I must say. We only went there once. ABout a 5 mins walk from Jordan MTR. Very convenient. RIght opp the entrance of the hotel is a very very good restaurant called Cui Hua. We ate there 3 times! Go there for breakfast/lunch/dinner! They serve very good food. And I am totally missing it now. Walking distance to Temple Street and we even walked over to ladies street once from the hotel. One incident that happened during our stay was that my hubby cut his leg in the bathroom. Prob the facilities are getting old, the rubber of the door stopper came off and my hubby accidentally stepped on it and cut his foot. We called for a band aid and it took quite a while to come. THankfully he stopped the blood while waiting for the band aid to come. We feedback to the person who brought us the band aid about the stopper but nothing was done. Feedback again during our check out and hopefully they will do something about it so that no one else will get cut again. A pointer to note is to speack English if you can.

HOTEL 1st thing to say is that I have stayed at lots of hotels where the rooms are described as small. My experience has so far been that those reviews have been from people that must be used to large rooms. So I took not too much notice of the reviews saying these were small. However, we had a delux superior room, dont be fooled by the title, read this as 'small & standard' This was the smallest room I have ever stayed in, that includes travelodge and similar standard hotels in UK. (see photo) That said the bed was not too small and the room was comfortable and cool. there is not much space, so some juggling suitcases etc will be needed nor is there much wardrobe space. We did not eat at the hotel, however there is a cafe where if you show your room key you get a but 1 get 1 free offer on hot drinks. LOCATION If you have not been to HK before you should know this to help you make a choice. basically you can stay in either Kowloon or the HK Island. This hotel is in Kowloon, there are attractions on both and I dont think it makes much difference, public transprt is cheap and easy to use to get from one to the other. everything is sign posted in English NATHAN ROAD. This is where the hotel is. Its a long straight street which is I guess the HK 'Oxford Street' It takes about 20 to 30 mins to walk from the Hotel to the Harbourside. You can also get a Bus or the MTR (the tube / subway) The hotel is about 5 min walk from the nearset MTR. I can see no disadvantage from staying at the hotel GETTING TO HOTEL (from Airport) You can get here many ways and this only reflects what we did as I think it was the cheapest. We got the Express Train from the Airport. Took about 30 min from airport to Kowloon. Cost 70 HKD per head From Kowloon we got a Cab to Hotel. This took 10-15 mins (traffic is mad) and cost us 40HKD (10 HKD excess for the bags). We did this in reverse on way back. You could get the MTR from Kowloon to the nearest station to the hotel, this would take longer and only save you about 20HKD (less than \u00a32) GETTING AROUND Everyone we met spoke great English. We got an Octopus Card at the airport (this is like a Oyster Card in London) It cost us 150HKD which is broken down into a (50HKD) deposit and 100 HKD on the card. you then touch the card a the turnstiles on the MTR or on the bus and it debits the fee from the card. To add money you insert the card into a machine and add cash, its simple with English instructions. You can use the card to pay for food etc as well at a lot of places. As we left HK we gave the cards back to the info desk and you get the cash on it refunded (less a small fee, which I think was 9HKD) The MTR is clean and easy to navigate, its all airconditioned as were the buses.

Upon check-in, we were upgraded to Deluxe rooms on the same floor (16F). Although we arrived at 4:00pm, 2 rooms were not ready, and we were given free welcome drinks (beer/wine/cola) at the T Bar while waiting. Next to the T Bar was the E-Point (internet area) with 6 PCs (big screen monitor) and a printer. The reservations people made an effort to get us to book the E Club rooms, but we were in Hong Kong to eat and shop, so we did not need hotel breakfast and evening drinks. We had a great time tasting the best Hong Kong dim sum, noodles, pastries and desserts on both Kowloon side and Hong Kong island. Eaton Smart had 7 elevators, of which 4 were glass-wall type which looked out north at the Nathan Road - Gascoigne Road junction. The 16F rooms were quiet, small but well laid-out. There was a big work table with glass top and an executive chair. Room had Hitachi LCD TV, free wifi, fridge, safe, coffee/tea, kettle, safe, ice bucket, free 2 bottles water daily. The concierge on GF had a refrigerator with more free bottles of water. There was an ice machine along the corridor, but could be easily missed. We asked housekeeping for iron and board, and they were delivered within minutes. Bathroom had long bath, magnifying mirror, hairdryer, shampoo, toothbrush, etc. The sliding door was difficult to close because it had no handle. The full-length mirror outside the bathroom was a good feature. On 21F, there was a small swimming pool, and a gym. We had an 8:00pm flight, but had to check out at 1:00pm. The concierge stored our luggage while we went for more food and shopping. When we returned in the evening, we were allowed to use the shower on 21F, and changed into clean clothes. There was only 1 shower cubicle each in the male/female changing rooms, so had to queue with the other guests. Eaton Smart is next to Nathan Hotel and Novotel Kowloon. The Airport Express K1 bus stop was just across the back lane, and the bus brought us to Kowloon Station in 10 minutes. From the hotel, Jordan MTR Station was about 250 meters away. To get to Hong Kong island by MTR: Jordan-TST-Admiralty, only 15 minutes needed. Location is excellent! Crossing Nathan Road, you will reach the north end of the Temple Street Night Market. A bit further west is the Jade Market. Eaton Smart offers free tours (on certain days) of Temple Street and Jade Market, but this is useful only for first-time visitors.

Not sure which location was best, originally we booked in wan chai, until we heard it was something of a red light district...not exactly what my 4 year old daughter, my parents and myself were after. Scouring the Internet and comparing hundreds of hotels we finally settled on eaton smart due to the price, and the fact it had a pool, which my daughter loved! We took a bus from the airport, which was cheap and fairly easy to navigate, but we had a few lost moments when we couldn't seem to find Eaton, only to discover the concierge is down a side street. After that, we were dealt with promptly at reception, and managed to get a room on the same level as my parents. The rooms themselves, sure..they were a bit dated, but they had everything you could want..and if it didn't, a phone call to reception would result in whatever you requested being delivered 2 minutes later ( in my case, an ironing board) (and then an adapter, which I later discovered was actually supplied in the desk drawer...oops). The hotel has a gym and a pool, as stated above, which are both kept immaculately, and when we were there it was never busy, which was nice. But the best bit about the hotel for us was the Eclub, you pay slightly more to get an Eclub room, which I believe are bigger than standard (rooms in hong kong are notoriously small, but I found ours plenty big enough for myself and my daughter). Along with the larger room, you get access to the Eclub, a lounge that is THE reason this hotel stands out...included in your room rate is free buffet-style breakfast,all day tea, coffee and nibbles, and evening drinks and canap\u00e9s that more than makes up the price difference between a standard and an Eclub level room. In the Eclub lounge there is also free access to the computers printers and Internet, but there is free wireless Internet throughout the hotel, and the staff in Eclub were very helpful with suggestions on what to see and do.

Hotel is in a great spot and has easy access to the main attractions.

We stayed in 4 different Hotels & also spent a night on an overnight train from Beijing to Xian. All of our hotels we booked had 4 or more stars or so it read. Some even reading 5 stars. Eaton Smart was the worst & the most expensive. We booked a deluxe room from the 4th June 2012 to the 11th June 2012 with flight centre. Negatives- 1) not worth the room rate 2) Late checkout rate 3) slow check in 4) no explanation when checking in regarding re activating the room card for our late check out 5) Size 6) Bathroom 6) bed 7) Towels 8) Noise during 1 night 10) Price of a can of soft drink Positives ; 1) delicious food at the buffet 2) reasonable location if you don't want to be across from the harbor .... I emailed the hotel prior to arriving informing them when I was arriving & the reason for my stay. I requested to have the room until 6pm the day of checkout. I got a prompted email saying this was not a problem however at a fee. A fee of almost the complete 1 day room rate when I only wanted it for 5 extra hours. We checked in around 5pm. Check in was very slow. We are given our room card without an explanation that on the day of checkout we need to re activate the card as we have paid for a late checkout. The room was extremely small. There was nowhere for each of our suitcases. There was a cupboard however it was not wide or long enough for the smallest of our suitcases. We ended up putting 1 suitcase under the desk However with the suitcase under the desk the chair couldn't go under the desk which gave us no other choice for it to stay next to the bed. Our other suitcase, we put suitcase on the stand blocking the entrance from the bedroom. There was nothing deluxe about the room. The round aircon duct was partially hanging of the roof & the safe didn't work. The bathroom had been recently renovated. Poorly renovated must I add. The grout between the tiles around the bath was coming away from the tiles, the toilet roll holder was coming off the tiles, behind the toilet roll holder was a filthy dirt or some kind of mark not to mention the holder was covered in dust. The roof had some kind of oil which had dripped & dried in the corner & the shower curtain was mouldy. The beds & pillows were hard but the blind kept the sun out if you wanted a sleep in. The towels were small & rough on your skin. On the last day I request from the cleaner extra towels which she kindly handed over without any issue. During our second night I was woken at 4.20am by loud thumping noise coming from above my room. I let the noise carry on for a further 20 minutes & called the front desk. No answer. I called again. I advised of the noise & was informed that security would attend. I stood at my door for 10 minutes waiting for security. They didn't come despite the noise still going on. I got back into bed. The noise was loud, loud enough that I called the front desk again at 5.00am. I was put through to the duty manage & informed that early that night there was an air conditioner problem. I asked how long the noise was going to continue for. I was told until at least 6am. I asked why they choose to fix the air conditioner issue at 4.20am rather then earlier that night. The manager couldn't answer. The manager offered to move me to another room, just to sleep & could return to my room when tge noise had stopped. I was certain no matter what room I was in the noise would still be heard as it was ridiculously loud & grinding. Plus I didn't want to move rooms for a few hours to be moved again when I had possibly fallen asleep. Later that day my husband & I went out & returned to the room to find a bottle of red wine. I thought that it was a nice way to apologies for the noise. The wine got the better of me & I goggled it. $8 US! Is that all they could afford considering I had paid $7 for 1 can of coke?? My husband & I did eat at the buffet. Paying the same price as we would here in Australia approx $55. The food was delicious the only positive thing the hotel has about it. Wing a staff member from the gym within the hotel was polite & gave great directions & Shamar from the bar made great cocktails. The location is within walking distance to Temple street night market & between Salisbury Road & The ladies market (1.5km either way).

I stayed there on June 5, 2012 because Agoda.com offers me a reduced rate with applied award points. So, it was a great deal. The first time we stayed there we were upset because they would charge us a luggage storage fee. This was not really traveller's friendly. We often fly in and out of HK but we need to do business in China so storing extra luggage in HK hotels before we return home was a plus to us. But if hotel charges us a fee for storage, then, it is not good. We would not have gone back there if it wasn't for a great deal. To be fair, the hotel room is a bit small if you compare it with the room at Nathan Hotel which is just right across the street. However, their rooms are more updated. Although small, they are well designed. At this stay, we noticed that it offered special breakfast deal. We decided to try. To my surprise, they served me gluten free bread when I asked. Now Eaton Smart is on my good list! The hotel now also offers free tours to the night market, jade market, and free Tai Chi class. That is a super deal.

We have no complaints. Our room was on the 15th floor and found the room spacious and clean. Everything was kept clean throughout our 6 day stay. Found the staff throughout the hotel to be very helpful and friendly, especially the Eclub staff who go that extra mile. We had access to the EClub which we felt was worth the money. Having free WiFi in the room is a plus and tea and coffee facilities. We ate breakfast both in the EClub and the Metro Grill. Both having something for everyone. The Eclub does serve hot food at breakfast but on a smaller scale from the Metro Grill, which you would expect. The Eclub serves drinks and bites between 5pm & 7pm, which is lovely to have a drink before heading out or after a busy day. People have commented on the price of drinks in the hotel bar but we felt it was on par with other 4* hotels we've stayed in. We arrived from the airport using the Airport Express then the free shuttle bus. As the hotel is the second last drop off it does take a while especially as we arrived into the city at 5pm. However, used the bus back to Kowloon station and it only took 5/10mins. We also used the check in service at the rail station which made travelling out to the airport more relaxing. Our return flight was late at night and the hotel allowed us to use the swimming pool and showers for changing on the day of departure. I feel that this is something that most large hotels don't offer. The hotel is constantly busy with functions and weddings but never felt overcrowded. This was our first visit to Hong Kong and loved it. The walk to Jordan station only takes 5/10mins which was not a problem. It does look like they are planning to open a new station just outside the hotel which would be great. Loved the location of this hotel which made eating out in the local restaurants more enjoyable as we felt they were not full of tourists. Getting around this city is stress free and very cheap, UK take note. We made trips to Macau and down to Stanley. Unfortunately it rained when we went to Macau so felt we didn't enjoy the island as much but did venture into one of the casinos! The bus trip from Central station down to Stanley is great, stunning views and a great market when you get there. A bit westernised but still good. Make a visit to the Ten Thousand Buddhas. This is amazing but the least signposted which made it more difficult to find. The climb up to the top in mostly in shade so even on a very hot day its not too bad. When visiting the peak make sure you do the walks, great views of the city. We visited the Chin Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Gardens, this was lovely but remember an umbrella even on a sunny day as there is very little shade.

Taxi from airport approx $230HKD (that inclu tolls, and luggage fees) almost the same price if taking airport express/shuttle buses - for the convenience when traveling with a family was worth it. Taxis readily available in front of hotel and pretty cheap by western standards and pretty honest by Asian standards. Used combination of MTR and taxis, so an Octopus card is also an essential. Given its close proximity to MTR the location is ideal for a starting base for all your sightseeing needs - if I wasn't pregnant with toddler in tow we probably wouldnt need to use the taxis as the cheap public transport is more than sufficient to get you where you want to go.

On a sociable note, make sure you take the harbour ferry, make sure you take the tram to the peak (unless misty or foggy as a waste of time) wander the markets and also take the walk down the \"avenue of stars\" by the harbour. Also go to the gardens and temples (sorry cannot remember the names) you will find that the gardens/temples are a sea of tranquillity in an amazing high rise city.

Surprisingly, about 90% of the reviews were extremely positive, a good sign for me to book this hotel! Although there were some negative reviews, these were mainly complaints in relation to the small size of the rooms which to us is irrelevant as what mattered the most for us was to stay in a centrally located hotel with clean comfortable beds and bathrooms. Check, check and check! The research paid off! The closest MTR is Jordan exit B1, a mere 5-min walk from the hotel.

In addtition to the great tasting coffee and pastries, u get a free coffee when u purchase one if u present your room access card. As to the service, I agree with other reviewers that the staff at Eaton were all attentive, courteous and professional in everything but i have to mention that our reservations agent Billy Wong was exceptionally outstanding!

Our room was ready turned down and ready for us. Check in was a breeze - one receptionist taking our passport details whilst the other preparing the credit card deposit, room key and transport of our luggage to the room. We got a large room - 3 person located on floor 16. The room had 2 single beds and in a seperate lounge area was a sofa that pulled out to a small double bed sized bed. The room was the largest that I have stayed in on the multiple trips we have done to Hong Kong. The only real complaint was the carpets were a little worn in the room - other than that the toiletries supplied, the linen and beds were all of a first class nature. This is compared to the Langham and Novotel hotels. We used the E Club on level one - very spacious, relaxing, nice chairs and lounge area that couples as breakfast and evening cocktails area. It is open from 7am - 11pm - continually staffed with some awesome knowledgeable people that really make your time in Hong Kong a memorable visit. From organising day trips, altering flights, altering transfers - all was done without any problems. Marilyn who is a regular staff member in this area goes out of her way to assist you, make you feel welcome and ensure that your every need is met. The food was great in the E Club - breakfast every morning had a different offering available. Hot breakfast, large array of hot fresh pastries, juice, good tea and coffee and a range of cereals and fruit to get you off to a good start. Come 5pm - an open bar - drink what you like! Complimented by some great nibbles and warm food to make the day sweep past. The Jordan railway station is a safe 5 min walk away. The Temple Street markets are 2 mins walk away. Some amazing restuarants and places to eat in close vacinity. I would make mention of a trip to Mongkok - we found a great money exchange lady - not that difficult to find really - just head towards the Langham Hotel when you exit the metro (2 stops from Jordan). Her address is 525 Shanghai Street - basically on the corner of Shantung and Shanghai streets - there are two banks on these corners and she is just south of them. The rates were the best in Hong Kong - sometime 5% - 9% better than other areas on the street. She offered currency changes for all units of currency (commission free). We were lucky to get $8.04HKD for our dollar (Australian dollar). As we were leaving to head to Europe she happily changed our HKD and AUD to Euro for us at the awesome rate of $0.79 Euro. Temple Street markets have a great variety of clothes, electronics (I would recommend the world traveller adapter that can be used anywhere in the world - pick one up for around $50HKD). Some great toys and souvenirs available as well. I actually think the quality and prices here are now better value than the markets in the Mongkok area. The street food is the best food and tastiest that I have encountered in Hong Kong - from Cantonese, Chinese, Seafood, Indian and Japanese there was a variety to tempt your taste buds all at reasonable prices. Drinks were ridiculously cheap - local beers for around $3AUD for a 750ml bottle. I would make mention about the lads at the concierge - arranging transport. luggage storage and general information about things to do and places to see - if Marilyn and her staff in the E Club didn't answer your questions then these boys did! The pool is heated - on the roof top - with awesome views. The gym is very spacious and have free weights, machines and all the amenities of any modern gym. The equipment is new and good standing - the shower and locker room large and great to use after a work out. A great place to stay and at a reasonable rate of around $240AUD per night - breakfast and E Club included. This rate was offered directly by the hotel after an online enquiry directly to them. They offered and arranged private transfers and communicated very well throughout our reservation process. I will post some photos for you to enjoy.

The night market is a few blocks away and we walked all the way to Tsim Sha Tsiu and back along Nathan Rd. It may be slightly pricey for the size and all that but we were often out at 8:30/9a and back around 1a so we just needed a decent, clean place to sleep and we really love that it is so well located and convenient. The Jordan MTR is just a few blocks away as well. Every morning, we got to try out different places for breakfast b/c it's all within a 5-7 mins walk from the hotel.

The Concierge is there to guide you on which bus to take and where are the stops it makes. unless you have the budget to take taxis all the time, I find taking the bus better and more convenient than walking up and down MTR escalators/stairs. and yes, book the club rooms if you want more room space. it has a huge bathroom with a bath tub. allows access to the club floor with the unlimited drinks and free internet. club floor also has buffet breakfast. or, you can add additional HK$ 50 if you want a wider buffet selection at the Lobby Floor. Normal buffet rate at the lobby floor restaurant i think is HK$ 150 plus Just don't expect the club room to look exactly as the website photo :-) And no complaints on hotel staff. customer service indeed.

The check-in staff were pleasant and efficient and our room was upgraded without asking. The staff in the restaurant were excellant and the food and coffee good.

We had paid for a full breakfast to be delivered to our room in time for our early departure. This had been paid for through our travel agent in the UK when booking the hotel stay. On checking in however, we were told we could only have what they termed a breakfast box. We reluctantly agreed to having this delivered at 4.30am to our room in time for a 5am check out and decided to take the matter up on our return to the UK. The breakfast wasn't delivered and on checking out at 5am we advised the gentleman on reception that we would be claiming a refund through our travel agent on our return home. We were offered no apology and the gentleman stated that we would not get a refund. He insisted that we wait for the breakfast box which (after he had made a call in Chinese) arrived a few minutes later while we were still discussing the matter. I declined and pointed out that we were on our way to the airport with luggage, didn't wish to carry anything else and would get something there. The gentleman was quite argumentative and we were left with little alternative but to take the rather heavy bag which we discovered later to contain stale sandwiches and pastries and other items which we had to discard.

There are great local restaurants nearby and also a 24 hrs McDonald's across the street which we regularly visited for a quick snack. Room: Stayed at Eaton Smart for 5 nights in a Superior Room. Although the room was small with one side desk and chair we were able to fit our 2 large suitcases and carry on comfortably in the room. The beds were comfortable and clean. We got a room on a higher floor with the view of the church, we found it to be very quiet and didn't hear any noise from the street. Bathroom was clean and decent size. You also get 2 free small bottles of water each day. We decided not to upgrade to the EClub as we did not anticipate on spending lots of time in our hotel room and eating out was a lot cheaper. Fitness Room: One of the requirements for us when traveling is a hotel that has a gym. We found that Eaton smart had a great, clean facility on the 21st floor and consisted of a cardio room (included: 3 treadmills, 2 bikes and an elliptical machine, and wii video games) and a weight room with full set of weights and machines. Towels were available at the front counter along with change rooms and showers for men and women. The only thing about the fitness room is that there is a fragrance machine that automatically sprays scent in the air, so if you are allergic to perfumes and strong scents it can become very difficult to work out. I noticed this on two occasions when I tried to work out during my stay. Lobby was very clean and updated. The check in desk is very small but the employees were very nice and provided great customer service. We arrived later in the evening so check in was a breeze, check out was also very quick.

What impressed me was that the room comes with an umbrella we can use. I guess the hotel knew that it was a rainy season for Hong Kong that time, and so provided their guests with an umbrella. The room is sort of small compared to the other hotels I've been to. But as I've read on some reviews, the 3-star or 4-star hotels really had small rooms. For me, it was spacious enough to accommodate our luggage and other bags. There's a cabinet beside the entrance door where you can put your medium-sized luggage. You can also find a small safe and the coffee/tea tray. Our room has a view of Nathan Road. The bathroom is clean and small, but I think, is ok. Although tall people might have a problem taking a bath because the ceiling is really low. You might need to request a room that will fit this need. The shower is not attached to the wall. For me that is convenient to use. If you have valuables, like laptops or other electronics, you can entrust them to the reception. I didn't lose my laptop when I left it to them overnight. When you get inside the hotel, you'll have to ride an escalator to get to the second floor where you'll find the reception and check-in. It's not that inconvenient, because you can ride the elevator when you need to get out of the hotel. It will bring you to the ground floor. The hotel is very near an 7-11 convenience store, McDonalds and Starbucks is just across the road (in Nathan Hotel). We did not try the food in the hotel, because just a few walks from the hotel, you'll find lots of restaurants. It's also very near the Night Market in Temple Street. The hotel is situated in the middle of Jordan Station and Tsim Tsa Tsui Station. The hotel all-in-all is OK for a short or long stay. I did not find any problems in our stay here.

We took the red-eye flight from Singapore and got to the hotel at around 7 am. We were pleasantly surprised that our rooms were already prepared so we could check in, leave our luggage and start our adventure! The hotel staff were always helpful and pleasant, and even the cleaners made it a point to greet whenever we crossed paths along the corridor. We found the concierge (positioned at the street level) was especially helpful. I recall two occasions that they helped us: First was when we needed some directions to get to Ocean Park. The man at the counter readily pulled out a map and a printed set of instructions that not only gave clear instructions how to get to Ocean Park, but also other places on interest around Kowloon and HK Island - buses, MTR etc. Secondly, we bought a camera that had a warranty that covered only HK and China and we wanted to change it to an International Warranty. The concierge helped to call the agent, clarified the steps required to get this done, and pulled out a map to show us how to get to the agent's service centre to do it. Fantastic! The hotel is situated at a very convenient location and we had no trouble at all getting around ourselves. Do get an OCTOPUS Card as soon as you can from the nearest MTR station (in this case it was Jordan) - you can use this card for almost all your rides (MTR, buses, tram, Star Ferry, Peak Tram etc.) and also for shopping/food outlets. You pay HK$150 for a start - HK$50 is the deposit, HK$100 for your use - this was enough for us to use throughout our stay. On the last night of our stay we brought the cards back to the Jordan MTR and got a refund for the deposit and whatever remaining money in the cards (note a small refund fee of HK$7 will be charged). All very convenient! Temple Street was just about 5 mins walk away, opposite from the hotel - very nice stuff there and we went there almost every night to browse/shop/eat and have our yummy HK desserts. There is also a nice restaurant on Nathan Road, opposite from the hotel were we could 'yam char' for breakfast with the local people - really nice stuff there! The rooms were small, as expressed by other reviewers here - but comfortable. Any way we were out most of the day so the beds were basically for us to crash into at night - and they were very comfortable for that! Do ask for the renovated rooms - they look a lot nicer and more well equipped. My kids got an older room and did not have a wardrobe/kettle - not that they needed it, but still these should be standard, right?

Here is why I religiously stay at Eaton in HK and I refuse to go to 5stars in both sides of the harbor: (1)to me, it is important to feel easy and comfortable when I walk into the hotel. I don\u2019t want big chandeliers and red carpets, and I do not need to see a Bentley parked in front. Only one thing matters: Desire to please, and smiles. Eaton staff, from concierge to reception to room service, will welcome you and try to make you happy. I have not heard a \"no\" from them. And I am a difficult guest. (2) Location. Take a taxi, take MTR, take a bus, walk. It is really convenient, especially for tourists. You do not want to be in the middle of the TST mayhem where people would follow you to the hotel lobby, but you want to be in a comfortable 10min walking distance or a 2min taxi ride. Night market is right across, Mongkok is 10min walk, etc. Airport express shuttle stop is at the doorstep, every 12 minutes. (3) Their gym is nice, and open 24 hours. Go up anytime. Well - if you are an early bird or suffering from a jet lag and want to have a run at 3am, you can do so at Eaton. They also have a small pool next to gym. (4) Good breakfast, combined with healthy choices and other stuff. You will not find the sheraton variety but you will not be disappointed. (5) Rooms are clean, tidy, in good shape. Yes, they are small - but this is HK and you want large rooms go to kowloon shangri-la or go to macau. Overall you have to define what you are looking for in your HK trip. If you are looking for value, go to Eaton. You would not be disappointed. If you want to be pampered with luxury and pay the premium, go to Peninsula or Island Shangri-La.

We were there in October where the weather was a little changeable (Typhoon season so a bit unpredictable) When we booked it, the intention was to use it as a base as we had planned to spend some quality time with friends and family and therefore wanted to just have somewhere comfortable and clean to rest our heads in between going out. Suffice to say it exceeded our expectations in many ways. We arrived from the UK pretty tired after our flight from the UK at 7.30am and the hotel kindly offered showering facilities in the gym so we could freshen up before checking into our room. After a quick wash and brush up, we wandered down Nathan Road towards the Star Ferry terminal whilst waiting for our room to become vacant. At lunchtime we returned to find we had been upgraded to a superior room which was modern, clean and comfortable - plus a decent size which is often elusive in big cities. The staff were very good - always attentive and polite and willing to go the extra mile if required. Although we didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on the food but we did have the odd drink in the bar. There are vouchers in the room for free cocktails etc so keep your eyes peeled! Location wise, although both friends and family are residing on Hong Kong Island and therefore we had to trek down to the Star Ferry or grab a cab to meet up, we found Kowloon to be quite lively and a good base from which to explore. Both HK cabs and the Star Ferry are ridiculously cheap so it's really easy to get around. We used the MTR once too and again - very reasonable, clean and seemed very safe too. In terms of things to do - there's just so many - I can't even begin to list them but any of the markets are definitely worth a visit (flowers, birds, goldfish etc) as are the restaurants and bars / clubs. That said, I must mention the Spring Deer restaurant and the Blck Brd bar as a couple of highlights. If you get tired of the city - head out to Stanley for a breather - you can get a bus from the station in Central (6X)- dead easy and good for a day out.

This also included free internet access in the club and a free evening drink. A nice bonus for suite users. The room itself was reasonable - the bed & sofabed weren't the most comfortable - I was fine but my partner suffered a bit. It also could have been cleaner - the main areas were fine but parts out of easy hoover reach were visibly dirty.

Normal Extra like in room safe etc. A couple of negatives are that the rooms are quite small, and there is no view from your room, however we were not staying there for the view, and great views can be had only a short taxi ride away. The hotel itself was clean and tidy, breakfast was good with a wide choice of western styled breakfast foods with freshly made eggs of every type at the egg station, as well as a big selection in eastern local styled food. The hotel has good looking restaurants but this is by sight not trying, we ate street food/ local restaurants each evening which was great. The best thing about the Eaton Smart is its location, and the staff. Location wise your on the Nathan road easily walk able to various markets, and your close to local eateries, not surrounded by big expensive international styled restaurants. You are also only a 5-10 min taxi ride ( $. ) from the star ferry to central ( $2-3) where you have the choice of everything. The staff were amazing here. Every time we asked for info they would not only tell us what we wanted, they would mark it on a map and tell us the best way to get there.\u00a0Very helpful, professional, and made us feel very welcome. Great job Eaton Smart, your staff are a credit to the hotel industry, and we will be back on our next trip to HK. Thank you! P.S. a little warning for anyone new to HK. All over the city are tailors and camera shops. There are great bargains to be had, and tailor made shirts suits dresses etc. however you will be asked \"please come look at my shop and fine quality!\" after a while it is tedious, but if your not expecting it you could feel uncomfortable. Always remember there first \"best price\" is normally 30-50% too high. Firstly establish that the price includes delivery, then the quality of the material, then haggle. Better to go in very low and come up. They expect this and it's part of the game! My price for 6 shirts started at HK$4200 plus delivery but we ended up agreeing on HK$2570 delivered for premium high thread grade cotton.

His new wife could not go with him so I got to go along. Since living in Tokyo as a kid in the 50's and 60's this was my first time in Asia. Needless to say I was a bit apprehensive about going to Hong Kong. However, our stay at the Eaton made the trip a wonderful experience. First, location. The Eaton has a great location. It's on Nathan Road which turns out to be the main drag in Kowloon. The shopping was great. From the super expensive stores at the south end to the more reasonably priced stores in the north end. Huge selection of reasonably priced asian restarants: chinese, thai, vietnamese. My son and I had a great time eating at very, very reasonable prices. Also, a 24 hour McDonald's is right across the street. Nathan Road is a great transportation hub. Subway stations and bus stops close by that take you all over Hong Kong including the airport. Again, simply a great location for food, shopping and transport. A perfect location. Second, service. Everyone at the hotel is very helpful. We had a slight problem with the toilet and they responded within 5 minutes and had it fixed within 10. Every request was honored quickly and completely. The front desk personnel spoke english very well. The other staff was not as proficient in english, but sufficiently so to respond to all of our requests. The maid service was excellent. We stayed nine days and the maid service each day was right on. The staff always seemed to care that our stay was very comfortable. We felt much sincerity. Also, they give tours of nearby shopping areas. My guide to Temple Street Nite Market, Quincy, was a real delight. A very nice young man that made sure no vendor cheated me. Again, the best service I've had in a very long time at any hotel, anywhere. The room was very nice. It was not as small as I expected. Smaller than a room in the USA but not by much. The beds were heaven. The bathroom had a shower and bath. The room had a nice flatscreen tv with many international channels. The room had free high speed internet. Just a really nice room. Third, value. My son said the room with two beds was about $190 a nite. Since I did not make the travel arrangements, I don't know how that compares with other hotels in the area. But we were very pleased with the price considering the quality of the room for the price we paid. Oh, huge point. The price included the breakfast buffet for both of us. The buffet was simply magnificent. My god was there so much great food. Western and asian food. Huge selection. And all of it so very good. We had such great, full breakfasts every morning, we did not need to buy lunch. That saved us some extra cash. I did not eat any other meals at the hotel other than breakfast. However, my son's MBA class had a variety of lunches and a couple of dinners at the hotel. He reported that his meals were just as good as our breakfast buffets. Overall, just great food of all Western and Asian types. Summary, our nine days were simply wonderful. We enjoyed Hong Kong very, very much. The Eaton really made our time in Hong Kong just perfect. My son and I have agreed that if we ever return to Hong Kong, we are definitely staying again at the Eaton. Location, Service, Staff, Food, Transportation, and the Rooms were great.

Since our last stay, the Eaton has been taken over by the Langham Group and \"upgraded\" The upgrades do not extend to rooms but only the public areas. That's OK because the rooms are fine. The Eaton is not the hotel it used to be. Langham seems to be looking for the young market. The T bar has been made over where your mixed drink will now be poured from a terrible \"post mix\". We all know how bad that stuff tastes. Its called making things easy for staff and not being bothered about what sort of drink you are pouring for the patrons. My drink, the one and only was flat and when this was mentioned we got, \"sometimes the staff don't notice this\" That's a good answer. All new staff were young staff except for a couple of familiar older faces. A great lady we nicknamed Eartha Kitt on account of the sound of her voice once worked there and poured wonderful drinks. She did not miss a thing and actually chatted with the guests, which was nice. The new younger staff appear to us to be temporary and on their way to doing something else. Maybe they are students but we knew they were a bit offhand in the way they did things. They do not have the experience necessary for a four star hotel. I suppose they have to start somewhere. The new Bose on wall lifestyle speaker system has been added and it predictably sounds thin, hollow and with an annoying treble emphasis. These things always do but cool and designer looking they are. Just don't turn them on. The computer music played is awful and not in keeping with the atmosphere. It is fast paced, funky and not at all relaxing. It is played too loud and destroys the atmosphere. Young people will love it as they shout out a conversation above it. But the big mistake is the new cool looking furniture in the atrium eating area. How could the management let the trendy design consultants fit the place out with chairs too low for the tables, around the sides of this area. Most people eating there had cushions under themselves to get their elbows above the table level. It staggers me that the hotel manager has never noticed this. Well anyway, we will not stop at the Eaton again. It was once a nice hotel to stay at combining old world feel with modern facilities. It is now another stopping off place for young travellers who don't notice or care about the nice touches. We are disappointed more than upset as we had a connection with this hotel that we enjoyed.

On the plus side, the location of the hotel is excellent, right opposite Tsui Wah restaurant, which is a popular Hong Kong cha-chan-teng which serves good food at very reasonable prices. It's a rather long-ish walk to Jordan or Yau Ma Tei MTR, but it's only slightly troublesome during the hot summer days due to the humidity and heat. It should be more enjoyable during the cooler seasons. Transportation is a breeze, and there's no lack of food and even shopping. On the negative end, the hotel staff was rather overwhelmed on the day we checked in, and we were told to wait a good one hour (3pm instead of 2pm) for the room to be prepared after arriving from the airport, despite checking in on time with our entire tour group. We decided to have lunch during this interval, though some of the other travellers were not very happy and were still berating the staff when we left. Our room was on the lower floor facing the road, but the sounds of the traffic were barely audible. We could, however, hear our neighbours talking, even though they were not very loud. The room was small, barely big enough to fit the queen-sized bed and our luggage, but it came with a suite which was quite clean. It looked quite old. On the morning of the second day, I noticed a slight itch on my calf which later turned into three ugly red bumps (in a row)that itched like hell. I had a suspicion the bites were bed bug bites, but since I didn't do a check of the room, I couldn't tell for certain (yet). For precaution's sake, I tried to ensure everything was clean and bed-bug free as much as possible before packing up to leave. Apparently, the bed bug must have hitched a ride in our luggage or clothes, because 2 months after we returned, I noticed my wife was getting bitten frequently; and just today we had to throw out our barely one-year old wooden bedside table because I found a bedbug residing in the crevice, surrounded by it's own fecal matter. We hadn't travelled since the Hong Kong trip, and the bites had only started after we returned, so the only place we could have gotten the bedbug from was Eaton.

Free interent was great - 6 computers in the lobby. The bar area had a good atmosphere and there was also an outdoor area to be enjoyed. The rooftop pool was great for a cool off after a days touring. Would recommend this hotel. Whilst in HK we travelled by MTR, public bus and ferry using the Ocopus card which is so simple to use and very very cheap. We went on the Star Ferry; took the Big Bus Tour of Kowloon, HK Island and a night tour; went to Stanley, Ladies, Jade and Temple Street Markets; went to Macau where we saw House of the Dancing Water at City of Dreams - fabulous show; went to Lamma Island for a very different perspective and hired bikes to ride around the island which has no cars; went to Ngong Ping 360 by cable car - well worth it and the view was spectacular; went to the Peak by tram which also has fabulous views and saw the nightly Laser Light show on the harbour.

I have read some reviews saying rooms are small, but it depends on what you want. I assure you the club rooms are plenty large enough and well appointed. The suites have a very large bedroom as well as seperate lounge room. Can comfortably accomodate family of 2 adult and 2 children in either. It is just a matter of knowing what and how to book for best value for money. I always take the E Club option because for a relatively small amount extra, you get breakfast, all day access up to 11PM, hot food from 5.30 to 7.30 as well as free cocktails, mixed drinks, bubbly, wine or beer. It works out to be great value and an excellent venue just to unwind and meet people. The staff down there are the best and the mangement down there do their best to make sure you are comfortable and smiling. They will even go out of their way to introduce you to other guests so you are never alone, unless that is what you want of course. Extremely professional, friendly and caring. The T Bar at Lobby level and T Garden areas are great as well. Recently renovated, it is a great atmosphere, once again with attentive and friendly staff. You have a good range of food either from the lobby restuarant or just order from the bar or garden area. Not too expensive. But if your budget is really tigh, just pop across the street and there are a couple of local restuarants where you can get good quality food which is really \"cheap as chips\".

But it wasn't that big of deal! Maybe they were really that busy. Room was not very big, but very clean! Sheets are changed every day! Our room had a twin bed, desk and chair and some nightstands. The big Flatscreen tv on the wall had a nice selection of channels. There wasn't much closet space. We had to remove the coffee/tea maker and the tray from the closet to put in our clothes. It's a reasonable size for 1 person though. The bathroom was nice. Not that big but also very clean with a shower (no bath). The ceiling was quite low, so tall people should watch out! Lots of nice amenities (shampoo, conditioner, bathrobe etc.) Overall the staff was very friendly. The staff at the Metro Bar/Lounge were the best. Always smiling and welcoming us when we arrived for breakfast and/or diner. The hotel is very conveniently located between 2 MTR(subway) stations. These are only a 5 min walk away from the hotel. The area around the hotel is great. The streets are always bustling with people. The only problem we had with this hotel was with the Internet access. At the ceck-in counter we were told that wired internet access was included in our booking. After we tried to log in we still had to choose from options which all stated that we had to pay for the internet. We then called the 'can do operator'. She told us that we just had to choose one option and it then wouldn't appear on our bill (which doesn't make any sense btw) It was never mentioned that the free wired Internet acces was for only 1 computer. Which is outrageous in 2011!!! At checkout we were billed for the use of Internet anyway, because apparently we used more than 1 computer, but we refused to pay and then it eventually was removed from our bill. The fact that you have to pay for WIFI or internet in a 4 star hotel in a city like Hong Kong we think is nothing less than ridiculous!!!! Its 2011 and almost everybody in Hong Kong including the tourists have WIFI devices like iPhones, iPads and/or other smartphones, tablets or notebooks. The fact that the hotel staff didn't even know their own 'rules' about the internet acces made matters even worse. Hopefully they'll fix this and make wired Internet and WIFI free for everyone.

I ask them to debit my credit card (they had the number and all necessary data and they confirm it). As it was a Sunday they argued that I can contest the payment after and that they will need three days to clear my credit card and be sure that they will be paid. During that time they wanted to keep the only money my daughter had on her. I proposed to send the scan copy of my credit card, passport and an agreement to pay all expenses but they refused. The person I had on the phone has been closed to any service but stocked to procedure and even asked me to come in Hong Kong from Bangladesh as a solution to the problem.

The eggs benedict from room service is excellent! A late night hamburger and fries was also greatly appreciated. During my stay I also tried the restaurants Metro and Yagura. All were reasonably priced and of the quality that you would expect from a 4 star hotel. The service was excellent in both.

At 85GBP per day, I am confident that we could negotiate a longer term leasing arrangement to support our relocation.

The guys at the ground floor were always ready to call a taxi as quick as possible, the waitresses in the restaurant and bar (garden) area were serving you with a smile, the girls at the reception were giving all the required information (making restaurant reservations, giving directions, ...) and the management did everything to fullfill extra wishes. Overall I can say that this hotel is very good located, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff is suberb.

We stayed for three nights on the last leg of a China trip. The first thing we noticed was how strange it was to be surrounded by Westerners after two weeks of travelling through parts of China when we were, at times, the only Western faces around. While we were there, they were remodelling reception. The building work didn\u2019t disturb us, it just meant it got a bit buy around the temporary desk and some of the bars were shut. However, we upgraded to a room which would give us access to the E club \u2013 I can\u2019t recommend this highly enough. The E club serves breakfast each morning and canap\u00e9s and drinks at cocktail hour. \uf04a It was a great addition and meant we could grab a snack before heading out \u2013 meaning we could take more time choosing somewhere to eat as we weren\u2019t starving. The food was very Western in style though, and so, you could have filled up on the canap\u00e9s and skipped dinner, but we didn\u2019t want to miss out on a whole city of food outside! We had one of the rooms with the floors to ceilings windows. Although these are deluxe rooms, they are quite small due to the layout with that big curved window. However, the bed was comfy and everything we needed was there, so the space didn\u2019t bother us too much. There was plenty of room to move around anyway, and we had the view up Nathan Road to look at. Location wise, the hotel is great. Right on Nathan Road, walking distance to the metro stop to head anywhere in the city. It\u2019s also walking distance to the Tin Hau Temple and Jade Market and Night Market which I really enjoyed. We also used the rooftop swimming pool a few times. The pool is lovely \u2013 small but clean and there are views from the terrace to the harbour which was great. There\u2019s also a gym which we didn\u2019t use. The pool doesn\u2019t have a bar or refreshment area but no-one minded us taking drinks up there.

If you are travelling as a couple and used to sleep in a king size bed- DO ask for twin bed. My parents weren't too happy with the double bed as they were always awakened by each other when one was tossing around. Remember to add in the request if you need a smoking room as they are pretty limited.hey have connecting rooms if you are travelling with family. Paid around HKD 800 for 4 nights under linger for less package- inclusive of breakfast and free internet access. Front desk staff was attentive. But took a bit tad long to check in as we had a long day travelling and it just became too tiring for me to deal with the paper works at 11 pm. Make sure u check the invoice for any extra charges as they tried charging my sister's room for things she didn't order from the breakfast room. Staffs seem a little bit blur on the internet charges- it was meant to be complimentary but told my dad it was chargeable even though it was clearly stated on the package. Male staffs seem moody- should smile more. Location: Fantastic. Opposite is the K1 route free airport express shuttle bus which takes u to Kowloon station where u can take the airport express train to HKIA. Tsui Wah- a famous local cafe is just opposite the hotel which opens till late serves good and cheap food. Must try the ' lai yau chu chai pau'- butter bun and milk tea.

They have a egg station where u could request for types of eggs u like. Great service from the staffs. Very courteous and attentive. Internet:- It was free for us in the room which uses ethernet. No wifi in the room. Only available in the lobby for hotel guest. But they do have 5-6 computers in the lobby for guests. Nice T-bar with delicious complimentary welcome cocktails.

It is a nice hotel, but our experience was mixed. I would definitely recommend it, but I also have a few criticisms/comments. First, we arrived very early in the day (8:30 a.m.) and they were willing to accommodate us and allow us to check-in early, but they only offered us a smoking room. If we wanted to wait for a non-smoking room, we were going to have to wait until the afternoon. We decided to take the smoking room because we were very tired and wanted to rest. The room smelled of smoke (no surprise there), but the real problem was that it was old and dingy. Apparently, the smoking rooms are not renovated yet. So, it was fairly depressing. We asked about paying for a better room, and they offered us a club room immediately. They quoted us a price, but failed to mention the 10% add-on (which isn't a tax but really is just a \"service fee\" that should be included in the rate because it is nothing more than additional money for the hotel). So, in reality, the room was 10% more than they quoted me. I took it before I knew that, so it ticked me off a little bit. But, the room was very nice and came with access to the club room. The rooms do not have internet in them, and so you have to go to the club room for the internet access. The club room is nice, but they have limited western options for food. They have an espresso machine which I liked a lot, though! Across the street from the hotel is a McDonalds, and a Starbucks is right next to it. They also have a very good coffee shop int he hotel, that has pastries and coffee. The Temple Street night market is also right across the street. The highlight of the hotel was the rooftop pool. It is small, but very clean and well-kept. It looks like a pool in an old Roman villa and it was a blast for me and my son. Even though we were only there one night, we went twice to it. He really enjoyed it. I had one other glitch while I was there. The concierge arranged ferry tickets for my son and I, and they booked the wrong class. I think it was a language miscommunication. I told them I wanted VIP class, but they booked first class instead. When I received the tickets and told them they weren't right, they initially tried to get me to take them and indicated they had purchased what I asked for. When I held my ground, they releneted and exchanged the tickets for the right ones. So, they remedied it without much difficulty. All in all, it was a good trip with a few caveats. They really should finish renovating the whole hotel. Also, they should be clear about their rates and get rid of the 10% additional charge, which misleads people. Finally, they should add more western food to their club room buffet. Other than that, I was pleased with the hotel and would stay there again.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, we'll be back for sure - EXCELLENT VALUE\u201d", "Author": "Sean_AustinTX", "ReviewID": "UR113957066", "Content": "My kids loved the hotel itself, including the pool.

On top of that, the hotel is nicely renovated. The room is very clean and the front desk and concierge has very friendly staff to assist you in whatever you need. Other than their excellent hospitality, they are also located at a great location. It's a favourite location for me because it's near the MTR (within 5-7mins walk) and there are many great eateries and restaurants around Nathan road. 2 streets away from Eaton there is a Nathan Congee shop or something like that. It's a very traditional shop that sells great congee and noodles. I recommend the century egg congee and abalone congee, beef brisket noodles, and poached liver and kidney in special sauce. And then a street away there is Starbucks, and next to it there's a Chinese Restaurant called Dao Xiang (\u7a3b\u9999 in Mandarin).

The breads were fresh too and my husband was happy with the hot foods selection.

I used to stay there every month when I travel for Business, that's how I got my 1865 Voyager Status. The hotel then underwent renovations and I stayed at other hotels instead. Now that the renovation is completed, I was anticipating going back to the Eaton. My sister and I travelled to Hong Kong on 8-11 Jan 2011 and we chose Eaton. The rooms were very expensive - a standard small room costs almost 1800HKD a night without breakfast. I though since it was newly renovated, its probably worth the price. Besides, I was given a SUITE Upgrade voucher for my membership status, I figured that I'd use it. The horror began. Check in was ok, Eaton's service standard has always been good. The horror began when I opened my room door. The so-called suite was PATHETIC! Ok before I go on, please bear in mind that the normal going rate for a suite in this hotel is 3685HKD a night! I was expecting something grand, but NO! Instead the so called suite was so pathetic and in my opinion a piece of $#%@ that in my honest opinion, a Deluxe room would look nicer. What's bad about the suite: - The furnitures were OBVIOUSLY old and worn and tired! - The bathroom was so small and the ceiling was peeling - The carpet and curtains were old and dusty. I have very sensitive nose and I immediately got sneezy and itchy eyes - The TV in the room was pathetic - The phone on the executive working desk was not working....same for the lamp, not working! - The sofa was spoilt. The whole damn thing would 'sink in' and my butt hurt!!!!! - The hair-dryer....was the biggest joke! The whole damn hose fell off. (their hairdryer are the ones mounted in the bathroom walls)We called housekeeping....they fixed it. Then, still....the power of the hairdryer was so weak! It took like 5 mins for the hairdryer to heat up, then at the rate the air was blowing weakly, it probably will take 1 hour to dry your hair! We asked for a seperate hairdryer (standalone ones)....no difference! Takes time to warm up and the stupid air was blowing so pathetic....come one folks! A hairdryer is not expensive! Why can't you invest in a decent one for your guests who are paying so much? I was totally horrified and disappointed with my stay. I am a Voyager member, a loyal guest of the Langham brand and I feel like I am being treated like crap! Even with a suite upgrade, that place was like a pig sty! The bed was small and hard as stone! What puts me off even more is the cost of the room! For that price I pay and to get such a room? No way! That's a ripoff! I dont care even if I am a member of the hotel's loyalty program...I won't go back there again. Its totally not value for money for the price I pay. I will stay at Harbour Plaza 8 Degrees for my next trip. The hotel is new and much cheaper. Although the location is not great theres free shuttle bus and taxis in Hong Kong is cheap! At least the furniture and room is clean and new and not eerie....at least I see value in the money spent instead of feeling like a sucker. The last time I stayed there I was given a E club upgrade and it was fantastic. The gym rocks too! All new equipment Sorry Eaton Hotel.....you look like a cheap skate budget joint now.

After quite a delay, my husband's beer came followed by our food but my apple juice was no where to be seen. We could see staff being very attentive to other guests and serving them several drinks before we noticed someone walking to the bar with some apples. By now I had been waiting maybe 30 minutes. I went to the bar to ask if my drink was on it's way and was given no apology, just told that it was coming and took time as it was fresh. Eventually my drink came after I had finished my food and still no apology.

Firstly, the location up Nathan Road is good and central to Mongkok and Jordan MRT station. Secondly and most importantly for us, was the convenience of upgrading to a Club Room which gives you access to the excellent E Club on the 1st floor. Here you have free internet access, continental breakfast (more than adequate) and best of all free drinks and snacks from 5:30 to 7:30 each night. Being able to go somewhere to relax and have a drink at the end of a day's sight seeing was great. The staff are fabulous and very accommodating. I had emailed ahead to see if I could get some gluten free bread for breakfast and they had it there each morning for me. Thirdly, the Eaton is value for money even paying that bit extra to stay in a Club Room. The rooms are bigger than the standard ones which is a welcome benefit. Check out was at 12 noon which is better than the usual 10am. Currently there are renovations going on but besides a cramped check in counter, it isn't a problem.

Usually we stay on HK Island, but as Kowloon was less familiar to us, we thought we\u2019d have a change and use the Eaton. We enjoyed our week in the Eaton. I agree that our deluxe room was smaller than I would have wished, but actually quite functional once you got used to it. Good bed, fairly quiet in the corridors and, on the 15th floor, no hint of traffic noise. Apparently no wifi in the room, but you could I believe cable-connect your laptop (at a bit of a steep rate it would seem) in the room. However the basement internet area offered free computer internet access. Also free use of room safe. Room was cleaned thoroughly and very efficiently. The hotel is in a good location, fairly close to Jordan MTR. OK, it is annoying having touts approach you about suits or watches every time you head for the MTR, but that is a fact of life anywhere on Nathan Road, and probably only on Nathan Road and nowhere else in HK. The Eaton is close to Temple Street night market, the Jade Market, and Ladies Market (by MTR) in Mong Kok. The main problem at the moment is with the lobby being rebuilt, temporary arrangements for reception/lounge are in place - so initial appearance will undoubtedly be better soon! Not sure if it is directly as a result, but the breakfast dining area, caf\u00e9 , bar and internet caf\u00e9 can be a bit cramped just now at peak breakfast time around 9.30 am. Under the circumstances the staff do exceptionally well, and it is amazingly slick the way tables are reset after breakfast and the area reverts to a Japanese Restaurant and bar in the evening. The breakfasts on offer should cater for all tastes and are as good as any. By the way, I would also recommend the Japanese restaurant (Wagura?) in the hotel. Not the cheapest, but really excellent food. I am not a fan of \u201croof top pools\u201d in general. The Eaton\u2019s is nothing special \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t bother. If you really want to sun- bathe in Hong Kong, get yourself over to Cheung Sha Beach in Lantau, or even South Bay on HK Island! Concierge staff and waiters were brilliant, very helpful. All in all, this is a good quality hotel. Of course there are classier hotels in Hong Kong, which has some of the world\u2019s finest, but not at the Eaton prices! If you want a similar hotel on the Island, there is the City Garden. It too is perfectly OK and good value, but in my view The Eaton is in a better location and is perhaps better set up for Western tourists. If you are not that familiar with Hong Kong and are looking for ideas of what you you can do beyond the standard Star Ferry/ Peak/ Aberdeen/ Stanley Market trips (great though they are), and you are prepared to be a wee bit adventurous and do a bit of exploring, I would recommend the following: On Kowloon side: - visit the Chi Lin Nunnery (free) near Diamond Hill MTR station. Oasis of peace amongst the high rise blocks! - stroll along Bird Street, (not far from Prince Edward MTR) and see the locals walk their caged birds by the hundred. Next to the beautiful displays in the nearby flower market. On the Outlying Islands : - visit the stilt village of Tai O on Lantau (ferry from Central to Mui Wo then bus). Take the launch out in the bay to see the pink porpoises. On the way back stop for a beach walk at Cheung Sha. - take the cable car up the mountain to Po Lin Monastery on Lantau (start from Tung Chung on the MTR) - do the Lamma Walk from Yung Shue Wan to So Kwu Wan. (ferry from Central) The walk is a bit hilly in places and takes a couple of hours. But worth it for the views and the wonderful seafood at So Kwu Wan before getting the ferry back from there. Enjoy Hong Kong \u2013 it can be a magical spot - and the Eaton\u2019s a good hotel from which to explore and provides really good value.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Isle of Man, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn oasis\u201d", "Author": "Kinswick2", "ReviewID": "UR81642682", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay at the Eaton Hotel.

I got a call and note to have the problem resolved. This shows that they actually have service standards. Not bad. The rooms are usually clean, except for once I do not know why the bathroom was so smelly. I actually put up with it since it was only for 1 night, LOL. The bathroom smelled of crap. I think the crap from upstairs came down or something. If I had stayed longer I'm sure I would request for a change but it was only for 1 night and I decided to 'live with it'. Everything else was great. To be honest I never tried the breakfast there. I usually get free breakfasts with my room rather but I always wake up late! I tried the buffet lunch and it was awesome. One thing good is the always change their room service menu once in a while. Its great...I always go back to see a different variety on the menu. I love the fitness center! Its 24hours! I usually work out alone in the gym at 1am and its just me! The hotel is undergoing renovations now and its a bit inconvenient. At the mean time I may choose to stay at the Langham instead until the renovations are completed.

By walking for only a 5 minutes, you can reach Jordan MTR that takes you everywhere in Hong Kong. Walk for 5 min, you can reach Temple street. There is a free shuttle bus K1 from Kowloon station that drop you right in front of the hotel with only 30 minutes journey. The bus will pick you up in front of the hotel in every 12 minutes. It takes about 10 minutes to go back Kowloon station which I think is an added advantage. It means you only paid for HK140 for the airport express for 2 persons in a single trip compare to the taxi fare that cost HK280. It was a warm season in August. The hotel is so considerate to provide free cold water at their main entrance in the freezer that you can have a cold water anytime you like. They can also provide extra services especially anyone who has late flight. You can visit their gym or swimming pool at 22nd floor after checking out and take a bath before leaving.

The Eaton Hotel was one of the first ones I stayed in after a period of time I did not go to Hong Kong. We booked a Club Room during that stay and just loved it. The E-Club was fantastic and the rooms felt pretty spacious for Hong Kong and had enough space for a larger family. That experience was not forgotten as it was just incredible. Three years and many different hotels later, we finally decided to return to the Eaton but decided to enhance our stay by booking the Suite. When we first arrived, I expected to have the same private check in/out at the E-Club or somewhere else but to my disappointment, it was gone. There was no more private check in/out and the lobby was in renovation, so we had to line up for a long twenty minutes to check in at a very cramped temporary lobby. However, the service still felt the same as before. Check in was done fairly quickly and we were off to our rooms before check in time. The room was pretty large, but felt a little squishy because of the layout. The suite was a little bit over 400sq ft which is pretty small for a suite, but large for a room in Hong Kong. There was a queen sized bed, which looked smaller than a queen, and a sofa bed in the living room. The sofa bed felt pretty hard, but I slept very well that night. The room looked a little dated, but it was very clean and bright, unlike the Nathan rooms at the Nathan Hotel. The bathroom was clean, but I disliked the sliding doors. The view from the living room was great as I liked looking over Nathan Road at night. Overall, I was pretty happy with the room. After settling down in our rooms, we decided to head back to one of our favorite clubs, the E-Club. This time, the E-Club felt more private as there was a glass sliding door that can only be opened by inserting your room key. Not all rooms have access to the E-Club, but I heard it can be added on separately. They still had the drinks in the refrigerator, the snacks and food on the counter and all the service we loved during our previous stay. However, one thing that changed was the service. The service was very personalized and excellent. They would always come to check on us if we wanted our plates cleaned or if we needed to print something from their computers. They had free wifi in the club and computers that you can also use if you didn't bring one. One thing that wasn't present during our previous stay was the iMac. I enjoyed the evening cocktails which consisted of foods from restaurants in the hotel. I missed the breakfast though, so I can't comment on that. Overall, I thought that the E-Club felt the same as before if not, better. I have no comment on the swimming pool and fitness room, but I know that the pool is pretty small but located on the rooftop. The service was a little all over the place during this stay. The E-Club was fantastic, but the Front Desk staff was a little mixed. During check-in, I thought that she was nice and very courteous. However, the one who checked us out was not very pleasant. She said we couldn't stay at the E-Club until our flight which was pretty late at night even though I made a deal with one of the Reservation staff. She also deactivated our key at 12:00pm when we requested to have a late check-out at 1:00pm. After a pretty short talk-over with her, she gave us the access to the E-Club but she looked pretty unhappy with that. I would have given the service a three out of five, but the E-Club staff made up for it. I hope that the service would be better once the new lobby opens. The housekeeping staff was pretty fast too when we called for pillows. Overall, my stay at the Eaton was fantastic. It was almost like my previous stay and I hope that things will be a little better once the new lobby opens.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nottingham", "Title": "\u201crooms are very small\u201d", "Author": "dollar1055", "ReviewID": "UR74900371", "Content": "staff friendly. rooms very small, some rooms are overlooked so you have to have the blinds down and put the lights on in the room.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cWould be great...except...the fire escape was blocked\u201d", "Author": "JonasCh", "ReviewID": "UR73888032", "Content": "We booked the hotel through Hotels.com and got a pretty good deal, we wanted 2 rooms since we have 3 children and needed the space, booked a e-club suite, which was included breakfast and free access to the club.

I'm glad to say we made the right choice by picking Eaton. Upon checking we were given free upgrade of both our rooms. One was to a club suite which was the real deal up on the 13th floor. The other looked like a deluxe double on the 10th floor. We would of had 2 club suites but they were short on rooms apparently. The location of the Eaton is very good - it's on Nathan road in Kowloon, I'd say about half way up or so. It's about 20 min walk to Star Ferry and the Jordan MTR station is about 2 mins away. Both rooms were incredibly clean and I can't fault the house keeping staff at all. No traffic noise whatsoever in either rooms. There is a rooftop swimming pool which is open till around 10-11pm (there is a conflict of info on their website, in the elevator and on the notice board up there). You can see a lot of Kowloon from up there; it's a sight to see. It's not the biggest pool ever but we never had a problem with it being too busy. Along with the pool they have a 24/7 gym which is actually a pretty decent sized gym for a hotel with quite a variety of machines & free weights. It is staffed during the day and then in the evenings you are on your own. (not a problem if you know what you're doing). On the lower ground there is a restaurant and a coffee shop area. Within the coffee shop there are 4 computer terminals which give 20mins free internet browsing, after your 20mins is up the machines will log you off. We found these very useful for a quick check of emails & the usual social networking sites in the morning. Just be wary they do get busy and some people will simply re-log back on after being logged off after the 20min period but the staff do try and enforce it as much as possible. You can get a basic breakfast in the coffee shop - bagel or croissant. I had a bagel most mornings, as far as bagels go, it was pretty good & light enough for breakfast. We found the staff to be very useful at the hotel. On the first night we couldn't sleep no matter how hard we tried so we went out for a few beers from the local 7-11. When we got the beer bottles back up to our room we realized we didn't have a bottle opener. Epic fail. We went down to reception and they advised us they would send us one up. Just moments after getting back in our room the guy was at the door opening our bottles.... service or what. Very impressive. (at 4am in the morning too!) By far the coolest feature of the hotel has to be the glass tube lifts where you can see Kowloon road in action, very cool. There is a 7-11 across the road from the hotel which never seems to be closed, there is also a Starbucks on the same road & a Mc Donalds across the main road. They are doing some building work on the hotel - I believe they are re-doing their reception/lobby area. Although there was a bit of noise during the day (why are you in the hotel during the day anyway?) the actual disruption was not seen whatsoever. This didn't affect our stay in the slightest. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I'd come back here with no hesitation. Hong Kong is a really lovely city and I'll be back in a couple of years.

Our one bedroom suite was tastefully decorated in modern Chinese style and the king sized bed was very comfortable. The solid wood shutters on the window were great for blocking out the lights and noise from Nathan Road, so we could get a good night's sleep. The bathroom was small but an excellent shower with good water pressure. The airconditioning worked very well....which was a relief as the weather in Hong Kong in July is very hot and humid.

Apart from breakfast, we ate at the hotel twice - a dinner in the Japanese restaurant and a dim sum lunch in the Cantonese restaurant. The meals were of a good standard, with prices reasonable for hotel restaurants (although eating outside the hotel was much cheaper). The service in the Japanese restaurant, though, was a bit erratic...probably because the current refurbishments have placed an extra burden on it as the main casual restaurant is temporarily closed. The only down side was that the current refurbishments have meant that reception is temporarily located in a cramped area on the ground floor. Check-in and check out are very slow as a result.

You have an audio tour guide telling you what to see and when as you get driven round the mad streets of the city on an open top bus. They offer 4 trips and we did all of them. The Green route is great as well as the Kowloon night tour. Go and see the light show down by the harbour at 8pm every night. Also go and do the Peak Tram visit and combine it with a trip to madame Toursords. My second best tip would be to buy a \"Lonely Planet\" guide for Hong Kong. It reccomends all the best places to go to and also eat.

Situated in the heart of Kowloon, you're away from the really busy parts of HK (Central, TST, Hong Kong St.) so you can really enjoy the city at your own pace. The hotel staff was very attentive to my needs. They are responsive to all requests and make sure your stay is worthwhile. The rooms are typically small in HK, and this hotel proved to be no different. There are many amenities that come with the hotel (Happy Hour at T-bar, rooftop pool and gym, business center) but unless you take advantage of them, the value of your stay isn't maximized. Buffet is great - but pricey. The sushi restaurant on the LG floor is also stellar but pricey. But it's cause there's affordable, tasty meals sold just minutes away at Temple Street Night market. There is a 7-11, a late night food joint open till 3am, and a 24 hour McDonalds right next to the hotel. If you take time to explore, you'll find some cool things hidden around the area. Convenient location if you wanna get around fast without dealing with busy city people. Everyone in the hotel speaks English - so as a Chinese guy who doesn't speak any Canto or Mandarin, this was a user-friendly area. Taxi drivers are a bit harder to communicate with sometimes. The staff is friendly and will cater to all your individual needs. Just be sure to let them know. Chinese hotel culture tends to \"leave the guest alone\" for the most part so make your requests early and clear. The lighting is very modern. I was very impressed with their chic furniture and art. And there is an innovative button inside where you can set it to DO NOT DISTURB or MAKE UP ROOM so Housecleaning can do their thing at the appropriate time.

The room was situated on the 13th floor overlooking Nathan Road. We could hear just about hear the traffic but it low enough to have a good night sleep. The room was small by UK standards but having stayed in HK before, I knew what to expect for the money - in order to get a larger room expect to pay significantly more! The room was nicely decorated and the bed was comfy (see pictures). It looked as though the room had been recently renovated (perhaps in the last 1 or 2 years). The room had a network connection for a computer (internet connection) however it was not free (in fact the internet price was on the steep side).

A mere 3 stops away from the central part of the city on Hong Kong\u2019s subway, the MTR and, a comfortable walk from the harbor and some of Hong Kong\u2019s most spectacular views. Famous Temple Street night market is also just a mere few blocks away. Getting to Eaton from the airport is pretty easy and relatively quick. You have the choice of the taking the Airport Express right into the heart of Hong Kong (journey takes approximately 24 minutes), then transferring to the MTR (the red line\u2014Tsuen Wan) to the Jordan stop. Eaton is a few blocks north of Jordan, right on the main thoroughfare, Nathan Road. Alternatively, and perhaps more suitable after a long flight, Eaton provides shared shuttle or personal luxury car service from the airport directly to the hotel. See one of the attendants under the Langham (Eaton is part of Langham hotels) signage as you exit baggage claim. Eaton\u2019s lobby is on the 4th Fl. There\u2019s also a restaurant with outdoor sitting and a bar on this floor as well. The rooms are on the smaller side but adequate with internet connection (extra charge), iPod/Phone dock and complementary bottled water, coffee and tea. The outdoor pool and fitness center are on the top floor.

The cost at this writing is HK$138 (roughly $18 USD) if it\u2019s not already included in your reservation. Tips: Eaton has partnerships with most major airline mileage clubs, so you can earn miles for your stay (500 per night with AAdvantage).

From the airport you can catch a cab for around 220Hk dollars or take the express train to Kowloon. Once there you exit to the buses and take the K1 bus to the hotel ( via other hotels) for free if you show your train ticket. We went to Stanley market on the bus from HK Island which was worth a visit, sit on the right hand side of the bus for a spectacular view of the coast on the way, a different HK with beaches and a seafront.

Unfortunatly these rooms are very disapointing when it comes to space, I have never seen a smaller hotel room, hardly any room for hanging clothes, a tiny bathroom, almost no room between the beds and a very small window. We were straight on the phone to see if we could upgrade to a larger room. We were in luck as they had a twin club room available, unfortuntly it did cost us an extra $770 HKD per night, but it was a price we were willing to pay. The new room was much bigger with a couch, heaps of floor space and a much bigger bathroom. The club room also came with entry to the E-Club which made it extra money worth it, you get breakfast (we didn't use it as we already had it included in our original room rate), free drinks and snacks all day and at 5.30-7.30 alcohol and snacks from the restaurant which was enough for our dinner most night.

There was a few problems with our stay, the shower blocked and we had to have it fixed although this was done straight away. The other thing was that the beds were really firm and a very thick doona.

This was awesome value, because a drink alone in the bar near the lobby was around $5.00 AUD.

If I'm with husband we'd stay either at the Renaissance Kowloon or the Nikko. Have stayed in the Park Hotel and the Butterfly on the Prat and am not impressed. Was here by myself a few weeks ago and Eaton going rate online was US $95 per nt so decided to give it a try even though it's in Jordan. It is not my favorite HK hotel, and I will come here from now on whether by myself or with husband. The rate was so great for what you get. Last 2 times I paid $130 for the Park Hotel and $145 for the Butterfly (at corporate rate too!) and neither comes close to the amenities at the Eaton. In fact, the Eaton is the same caliber as the Renaissance, but better! The interior designer definitely put lots of thoughts into designing this place. The hallways are modern Zen, which is so nice when you're in a noisy buzzing city. The room decor is incredibly tasteful. FIrst thing I noticed was the Ipod player. Sweet! Was in the standard room and room was small but the layout was so well thought out and functional, unlike the Renaissance where rooms are also small and you're always squeezing yourself like toothpaste to get around the room. From bathroom to desk to bed to the placement of the outlets and the refrigerator, all were functional so you immediately feel relaxed upon entering the room. The bathroom was marble and porcelain so it's an upscale feel. Well placed hair dryer (in many hotels you have to scavenger hunt for it). Good quality bath towels. Leather desk chair. Big flat screen TV. No curtains--you get a wood panel instead--such as great way to save space AND keep room clean (you always wonder if hotel curtains that looked 100 years old were ever cleaned). Very nice bed linen. No icky bed cover. Very quiet. I just can't say enough about the room. The lobby was on the 2nd floor and the staff was incredibly nice. There's a restaurant with outdoor seating also on the 2nd floor by the lobby so sitting outside you're shielded from the noise and rush of the streets. They have a very nice gym and an outdoor swimming pool on the top floor. The pool was not big but the pool area was very tranquil. I went to take a look and there were people lounging and reading by the pool. I so wish I'd brought my bathing suit. The location was quite convenient. Just 3 blocks from the MTR. There's Starbucks right across the street in the Nathan Hotel. There's also a diner across the street where you can get a nice breakfast much cheaper than the hotel breakfast rate. HOWEVER, I have to give Eaton's room service two thumbs up. I came back close to midnight one night and hadn't have dinner. They offer their regular extensive menu throughout the night, not just the late nite snack menu. Plus they have great vegetarian options!!! I had the most incredible tasting veggie curry in the wee hours delivered to me. It was delicious. Yes still hotel room service rate but it's great to have such quality and accommodating option when you need it at odd hours.

We also had the E-Club Access this is the best way to go at the Eaton, breakfast was 7 to 11am and had a good avriety different each morning with a great coffee machine, after 11am cakes & bickies and drinks were available all day till 5:30pm, then it was drinks and canapes, the drinks were red,white & champers, or most major spriits and they refilled them as quick as you could drink them. The canapes usually consisted of 2 hot dishes like chicken and dumplings and lots of breads biscuits and cheeses. This finishes at 7:30 just ion time for the shopping or dinner if you can fit it in. The staff at the E-Club are incredible, so helpful and friendly. Location you are 2 blocks from the ladies market and electronics area, 2 blocks from temple street night market one block from Jordan MTR and far enough from the \"tailor madam\"and \"copy watch\"people. The concierge is great full of knowledge, there is a very cheap laundry the Grand laundry just 2 minutes from the exit. $59HKD for 14Lb of laundry. The staff on the front desk need some lessons from the other staff of their attitude would be my only complaint.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "china", "Title": "\u201cToo Expensive for what you get.

I looked for the Hotel Slippers but there were none. There were NO Toiletries whatsoever including NO SOAP. I went out to the corridor to look for cleaning staff but could not see any. I called the Operator and asked for housekeeping and told her we were missing the basics above. The Operator told me she would let the Housekeeping staff know and they would bring the items to the room. I was in the room for the next 2 hours and NOBODY arrived. I called the front desk next and told them about it and they said someone would be up. I advised them i would go out for dinner and was told my basic essentials would be sitting in the room when i got back. I came back late and there was still nothing in the room, NO SLIPPERS, NO SOAP, NO TOILETRIES. I had to go on a Witch hunt and find some. This is NOT SERVICE. You cannot tell a guest you will do something and not follow it up. Its becomes a downright lie. Upon checkout i advised the front desk of the circumstances and they just had a look of indifference and i got \"Oh Sorry\". That was it. For this the Hotel Gets 0 out of 10 for me.

We waited for 45 mins before one of our three rooms is ready. And there was not even a single person to help us with the luggages. The lady at the check-in was unfriendly and not helpful; we had to constantly check if our rooms are ready as they were so inefficient at clearing the queues. Worse, one of the rooms stenched with smoke even though it was a non smoking room! When we requested to change the room, the reception was unhelpful and we were turned down flatly, giving the excuse that the hotel was fully booked. Although they sent someone up to spray the air freshener, it was hardly of any use. In the end, we had to bear with the smell and constantly open the door (every 30 mins) to dispel the smoke stench. The rooms were incredibly small; hardly any space to put our luggage. The bathroom can't even stand 2 persons! And with our two children in tow, it was unbearable. The shower was also not appropriate for children as it had a very short extension cord. Amenities were average. No slippers, no newspapers, no toothbrush etc. Just one small bottle of shampoo, bath gel and a soap. You can forget about the swimming pool and gym; tidy small and cramp that I don't even find a single person there. Contrary to what most claimed that the location is superb, one has to walk 4 streets from Jordan MTR which takes about 10 - 15 mins. You might think 10 mins is nothing but I know of other hotels which are even more strategically located near MTR. In Hong Kong, there are lots of hotels which are 3 mins walk away.

These run frequently between the station and a loop of 6 hotels of which the Eaton is one. Cost for train and bus is $120 HK. ~ Hotel is ideally placed in the middle of Nathan Road. A ten minute walk north takes you to Ladies Market and the Jade Market. A five minute walk south takes you to Temple Street Night markets. The hotel is also well within walking distance of the ferry terminal, waterfront and Avenue of the Stars. ~ The hotel itself has a concierge area on the bottom level, and reception is on floor 4, so the impression you get when you arrive is not the best. Once you are inside and at reception the impression does change markedly. ~ Reception staff were very pleasant and informed us that we had been upgraded to a Deluxe room which was a bonus. ~ The Deluxe room overlooked the Nathan Road and the view was excellent at night with a mass of neon on show. The room was small, however did not lack in facilities, there was also a nice touch with an Ipod docking station next to the bed. ~ Linen was changed daily and room was made up each day to a high standard. The corridors and room also looked like they had just been renovated. ~ Hotel is within easy access of Yau Ma Tei and Jordan MTR stations so travelling about the mainland and HK island is also very easy.

The hotel was excellently located on Nathan Road only a short walk from the Jordan MTR station and a 10-15 minute walk from the Star Ferry Terminal. If you take the Airport Express train there is also a free shuttle bus included in the proce that takes you from Kowloon Station to the front of the hotel. The first room we had was a recently renovated one and although small was very nice. Breakfast was good with a wide selection of food and we never had any issues getting a table. The breakfast room staff were friendly and efficient. Check-in was fast, friednly and also efficient. Now to the negatives. The room noise is quite bad and I'm not talking about from outside. The way the television is mounted into the wall means there appeared to be only a thin strip of metal between the back of your TV and the back of the TV in the adjoining room. This means that if your neighbour wants to watch TV all night, you get to listen to it. Same deal if they use the iPod port in their clock radio. This brings me to the other issue. I'm not sure if it is a Hong Kong thing but we had a few issues that were handled the same frustrating way. Our first room had a broken toilet meaning everytime it was flushed raw sewage came up into the toilet stinking out the bathroom. We raised the issue the next morning as it was late when we realised what was happening and were told someone would fix it while were were out for the day or we'd be moved to another room if it could not be fixed. We returned and the toilet was still broken and there was no message or note to suggest anyone had even looked at it. We went back down to reception and were asked if it was fixed...we said no and they then moved us to another room which was one with older decor but a working toilet. Our first night the TV noise became an issue as our neighbour decided to watch movies all night. At about 11pm we called reception to ask if they could request the neighbour turn their TV down. We were told they'd investigate and get back to us. Half an hour later and no update and no reduction in noise we called reception again to which they asked \"Has the issue been resolved?\". We said no and they finally sent someone up to tell our neighbour to turn it down, which they did. As it turned out we had a different room the next night due to the toilet issue so looked forward to a quiet night. Our optimism was misplaced as our new neighbour was a fan of dance music which penetrated the wall and drove us insane. We went through the same routine as the night before. First request for assistance ignored and again being asked if the non-action had resolved the issue. After being told the hotel could not tell guests to turn their music down until 2am (?) by the duty manager they eventually asked the neighbour to turn it down and told me we would get a free breakfast for our inconvenience whcih was duly removed from our bill. The frustration at going through the routine of asking for assistance, being ignored in the hope it would go away and then eventually doing something just got too much. At checkout we were then told we had to pay for a breakfast they could not provide because we had paid for it as an add-on to our accommodation booking. We went on a day trip that meant we left before the breakfast opened and after some haggling we had the charge removed. Overall, the hotel is in a great location and had it not been for the broken toilet issue our experience may have been a more positive one. Looking at other reviews we were perhaps just unlucky. We aren't people who generally complain without reason but feel the minimum requirement of a 4-star hotel is a quiet and comfortable sleep which we could not get for a few nights.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGood Find!\u201d", "Author": "jphnyc", "ReviewID": "UR38766454", "Content": "I visited Hong Kong for two days with my mom.

If you like to walk, then you can stroll down Nathan all the way down to Tsim Sa Tsui and the promenade that looks out to Central Hong Kong's skyline in about 20 minutes time (well, longer if you end up stopping by the numerous stores on that street).

Size is a relative term. When you are in one of the most crowded cities in the world the term size is relative. Hong Kong is a very efficient city and little expansive. Take a window seat in the plane as landing on a airport which is built on partially reclaimed space from sea is a good experience. The airport is one of the best in the world with respect to design,efficiency and experience. The immigration process is very quick and smooth. Before you realize you are at the door steps of a metro (within airport) which is waiting for you. (6 Minutes frequency). Though it is very fast and convenient I suggest you take bus instead, for two reasons. You can see most of the Kowloon Island on the way to Hotel and it is economical. However, you learn fast that always you should have correct change in Hong Kong for transportation. Octopus Card is a must which is a kind of credit card you can use for all modes of transport like ferry, tram, bus, MTR (metro train) and most of the shops including 7 to 11. Pick up few maps of he city which are available in the airport. As you come out of the airport walk to your right to bus stand. I suggest take a seat on the upper deck to see the city(Most buses are double Deckers). Bus has a electronic display which clearly indicates current stop and next stop and other important places near the stop. Incidentally Eaton Hotel is displayed and the stop is right at the door step of the Hotel. Initially I was at a loss to find the main entrance of the hotel as the hotel's reception is on the 4th floor. You can reach the reception by elevator, escalator from different points. Check in and check out is very quick. The staff is very professional and courteous. I have booked the room through it's website which was quick and reassuring. Queries were answered promptly. ( They could not accept Debit card and I had to book the room using Credit Card). Room was bit small comparing to other hotels in different countries. But the smart design, clean sparkling bathroom, attractive toiletries provided, gadgets like light controls with Ipod dock next to bed, well stuffed fridge, hair dryer, weighing scale, pressure plumbing, LCD TV,.....you would not miss a thing. I suggest you use items in the fridge and replace it from the 7to11 store which is at one of the entrances of the hotel. Basically Hong Kong is a model city for it's transport system. Generally, where ever you stay it should not be a problem to reach any part of the islands(Kowloon and Hong Hong). There are few bus stops in all directions near the hotel. Famous MTR point is just few buildings away. Hotel is surrounded by many attractions like Temple Street, Ladies Market, Jade Market, TST, Star avenue, Kowloon Park, Star Ferry, Malls, etc., all within walking distance. It's a great experience to have simple breakfast at nearby Australian Dairy. You can see reviews of the place in Travel Advisor. It is really crowded with locals and totally crammed, but you will have a different good experience of Hong Kong with local population. Adjacent to Kowloon Park there are many high end Shops with branded merchandise. You can go to Macao from the Star Ferry dock. Using very inexpensive tram service in Hong Kong is a good way for sight seeing and relaxing. Good value for the money and total satisfaction is how I would summarize my stay at Eaton Hotel Hong Kong. (Actually it is in Kowloon Island) However, poor TV reception is the only negative aspect which I can recall and it could be an isolated issue to my room.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cSuperb location\u201d", "Author": "kitkat_UAE", "ReviewID": "UR37223911", "Content": "Superb location, clean rooms, accomodating staff and airport express free bus transfers.

The breakfast buffet in this hotel is worth the money if you cant be bothered to trek out and find food, there is a good selection of fruits, breads, pastries, meats, cheeses and a hot counter with bacon, hash browns, and the obligatory 'egg' chef who will do any kind of egg you would like. ALso a good selection of asian and chinese breakfast items. If you dont have Breakfast included, just outside the hotel at the end of road literally 25 metres is a starbucks and just across the road (nathan road) there is a McDonalds. If that doesnt foat your boat the hotel is about 100m from the tube station are there are a few shops in there that sell juices and breads and things. I personally think this hotel is in a great location in Kowloon. YOu can walk the length of the nathan road to the avenue of stars in about 25 minutes which we did a couple of times no problem, otherwise jump on the tube and For about 40p you can get off at Tsim Sha Sui which is right by a mall for eats or shopping. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from temple street night market, which is literally across the road and we ate there 2 out of our 3 nights...great seafood and veg dishes. The market is ok too for wandering around. The gym at the hotel i thought was great, had a cardio section with cycles, 2 treadmills and a cross trainer, and a weights section. More than enough to keep the rust off! the pool is lovely too for a half an hour escape! I would thouroughly recommend this hotel and would stay here again!", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location for shopping\u201d", "Author": "AustraliaKylie", "ReviewID": "UR34714324", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights but actually used the room for 7 days.

Metro Bar & Grill restaurant on hotel 4th floor is recommended. Hotel location was excellent, right on the main road Nathan Road in Kowloon, seconds away from shops, restaurants and a couple of minutes away from the Jordan MTR train station. The hotel looks exactly like the photos on their website!!! Only issues with hotel was; 1) We found the staff and the food on the lower ground Main St Cafe in the hotel were below standard & let down the rest of the wonderful hotel facilities & service. The service at Main St Cafe was terrible because the staff didn't seem to want to be there & were rude & unhelpful on more than one occassion. The food in particular the mushroom chicken pie was very dry, tasteless & gave us food poisoning. We asked them to warm up the pies and the pies were still cold so we had to ask again. The muffins were also dry and tasteless. We recommend the Starbucks cafe which is 10 seconds away from Eaton hotel around the corner. The staff there are friendly, efficient & the food is better than the Main St Cafe - wouldn't say its the best Starbucks food we've had but it is good. 2) On our last day when we paid for a late checkout room wasn't cleaned or towels at least changed even though we requested it AND we were woken up at 5 am in the morning by a hotel staff member banging on our door by mistake even though we had the do not disturb button on. 3) Hotel has free umbrellas however umbrellas are on a first come first serve basis and most guests failed to return umbrellas at the end of the day so we waited 5 days for an umbrella. To ensure fairness for ALL guests we suggest hotel has a procedure put in place for umbrella usage and return so all guests can have equal opportunity to obtain an umbrella. Otherwise bring your own. *** Travel tip: catch the airport express train from Hong Kong International Airport to Kowloon station for $70 Hong Kong dollars per person. From Kowloon station Eaton Hotel is only 5-10 minutes away so you can either take the free K1 route connecting shuttle to the hotel OR a taxi. Note the free K1 shuttle took at least 1 hour because Eaton Hotel was the last drop off. However a taxi should cost $30-35 Hong Kong dollars and is the quickest option. **Travel tip: the MTR is fast and easy to use. $4 Hong kong dollars per trip for an adult.", "Date": "July 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SouthLeics", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again! and again!\u201d", "Author": "PhilFox47", "ReviewID": "UR33139004", "Content": "Really enjoyed our stay here.

Pity the view was of the back overlooking a few old buildings, nothing exciting. The bathroom was tiny and old, even though it was clean. For the price we paid, I was rather disappointed with the room. It was quiet though, and we couldn't hear anyone or the traffic. On our last night, the bathroom stunk a bit and we couldn't sleep because of the smell - it smelt like sewerage. The saving grace was access to the e-club. Breakfast was nice even if there wasn't a lot on offer - toast, bread rolls, croissants, pastries, cold meats, a variety of cheese, smoked salmon, cereals, boiled eggs, fruit platter, apple and orange juice, and tea and coffee. Everything was fresh and topped up by the attentive staff whenever anything got a bit low. The fridge contained soft drink, juice and water, and you could grab a drink at any time, even if you were heading out for the day. The evening cocktail and canapes was great. Even though they didn't offer cocktails in the technical sense of the term, you could get beer, wine or liquor. The food consisted of a selection of finger food from one of the hotel's three restaurants and all were very high quality and delicious! We relaxed in the e-club before and after our day out. The staff there were great - very friendly and attentive, they would clear your plate/glass quickly and help you with any problems. There was also two windows pcs and even a mac pc with internet access available, and a bunch of newspapers and books to read. We ate at the Japanese restaurant on one of our nights there. It was pretty expensive and I probably wouldn't go there again, but it was quite nice food. I don't think the location of the hotel is THAT great. It is on Nathan Rd in the middle of Jordan and very close to the Temple St night markets and Jade markets.

We had two rooms, one an executive room with a double and divan for our daughter, the other a standard twin. Both rooms were unrefurbished. We were informed that only the deluxe doubles were available refurbished, so these didn't meet our needs. The older rooms were not bad, just a little dated versus the boutique style of the refurbished rooms, the carpet could be declared somewhat worn but that would be nit-picking. In fact the rooms were perfectly okay, clean, beds comfortable, quiet, well-serviced though somewhat small as others have observed. There was a curious smell on our floor, though not in our room. The e-club was a great benefit with breakfast, daytime drinks and snacks and evening drinks canapes available free. We only found it occasionally busy and certainly not cramped as others have commented. Free wifi and PC/internet access made this a regular place to visit. Nicely done. We ate twice in the cafe-bar restuarant. Not cheap but we voted the food of high quality. Drinks in the bar are ridiculously expensive if you drink outside the happy hours so watch out before you order (an average \u00a37 per drink for a round of beers and soft drinks). The Main St cafe in the lower basement was also good (a million times better than Starbucks on the corner - Avoid!) and also had free internet access. Service in the hotel was good and couldn't really be faulted. The gym was well-equipped and even if the rooftop pool was small it was pleasantly refreshing. The location is right in the heart of bustling Kowloon and a very different location from many of the other hotels (more expensive) in the more touristy parts of the city (Kowloon and Hong Kong sides). The Night Market and Ladies Markets are within strolling distance. Access to Metro, taxis and buses is perfect. A taxi ride to the harbour front for restaurants, sightseeing, hotels and Star Ferry is $18HK or less than \u00a32 (and this is the most expensive way to travel).

I did a half day tour and overheard some people saying how small the rooms were at the Eaton - they obviously hadn't gone the suite route!!! My room had a separate lounge area with TV etc and then a bedroom with another tv and a fantastic iPod docking station. Bathroom was perfectly adequate - a tad on the small side but all in all I couldn't fault this hotel. The only thing that's a little confusing is the layout of the reception and exit which are on different floors. If I was going to HK again I'd definitely stay here but definitely do the suite-route. I'd booked the room on the third day as \"day-use\" which meant I had it until 6pm. As I wasn't being picked up until 9pm I asked to keep it another couple of hours and this only cost $50HK (about \u00a310) - totally happy with that. Oh, the only complaint was that the bed was the HARDEST I've ever had and that, for me, was a negative point. Finally, I checked out the gym and pool and as always they aren't as great as the hotel website would make out - equipment dated and the gym was tiny so I didn't bother using it.

The Eaton was a great place to stay for that. We stayed in a two-room suite -- clearly all the rooms in the hotel are comparatively small, but the two-room gave us plenty of space for the stay. (Note: if you travel from the US you'll need a plug converter and adaptor, but don't worry, if you didn't bring one there are about twelve electronics shops within a two-block radius). The room was clean when we checked in and was kept spotless throughout the stay. Lobby and other public areas were small but very attractive and always very, very clean; and the lobby atrium really does give the hotel an elegant feeling. The pool is small but the area is pleasant, and they even heated the pool for part of the stay! Hotel staff was uniformly courteous and the concierge was always able to set us up with restaurant reservations -- if our choice wasn't available, they came up with a good alternative. Food and beverages were pretty good -- the hotel's Cantonese retaurant was pretty authentic (even the locals were eating there), its Metro Bar and Grill was a little thin on entree choices but everything we tried was tasty. As part of our package we had access to the E Club, which I recommend; the continental breakfasts always included eggs and meats as well as the usual, and the complementary Internet access (three computers) was really useful. The location, however, is one of the Eaton's best features. Two blocks to the Jordan MTR station; but it's a pleasant walk all the way to the waterfront. In between (once you get past the tailor touts), there's Kowloon Park and some good shopping. Temple Street Night Market is just a block away across Nathan Road. Taxis are constantly passing by the hotel's driveway (altho' if you can't get a taxi in Hong Kong, you either aren't trying or you're someplace you shouldn't be), and are really inexpensive. In short, you can get anywhere from the hotel without any trouble, and the hotel itself is a fine place to rest after each day's adventures.

It was great to come back after a day out and have a few drinks before heading out again or having an early night. The Internet access was always useful for checking out places to visit, comparing shopping prices etc. Staff were also fantastic, always happy to assist.

We were supposed to stay at the Excelsior on Hong Kong Island, but moved to the cheaper Kowloon side. We all took rooms with access to the E club lounge, which is definatley worth the money. All email and phone calls to the hotel prior where answered promptly. We arrived at the hotel at about 9 am after a overnight flight, we were sent to the 1st floor E club lounge, and asked if we wanted breakfast whilst check in was completed. I requested that one of our 4 rooms booked could be made available to us that morning. After a pleasant buffet breakfast we were presented the keys to all the rooms. This level of service continued through our stay with recommendations for restaurants, booking high tea at the intercontinental (amazing views!) and booking a mini bus to take us all back to the airport. We stayed in Club rooms, which were small but adequate, we weren't in the rooms much. I requested a non feather pillow from house keeping and that was provided promptly. If staying with the access to E Club, make the most of the drinks and canapes served from around 5.30 to 7.30, some nights we made this our dinner, with champagne, wine, spirits, dips, crackers, cheese board, mini wraps etc etc. We would definitely recommend the hotel and will stay there again, we liked staying on the Kowloon side and it is within easy walking distance to the Jordan MTR station, or a 20 min walk down to the star ferry.

Overall, we were not impressed with our stay at all, and most likely, we will not stay there again. The hotel itself is well presented, but the room we stayed in was so worn out that it definitely should not be part of a 4* hotel. We stayed in the E-club's executive room, but the room had feeling of an ordinary 3* star hotel witch need to be refurbished. I have attached few pictures: the table lamp fixed with the tape, the plastered wall, mold on the wall, leaking windows, and broken lamp. All these do not provide the level of comfort everyone would expect from a 4 star hotel (especially proclaimed to be the best 4* hotel in Hong Kong). I also have to add that air conditioner was extremely noisy and did not provide any real help in the +35 C, and the cold and hot water was so similar in temperature that it made any shower really uncomfortable. The TV in the room was very old CRT with very poor quality of picture. The room service one of the worst I ever seen, during 10 days of our stay no one even tried to dust bed side tables or clean glasses. The E-club lounge is very small and often just overcrowded, with a very limited amount of snacks. Overall all it would have been more convenient to pay for the room only and purchase breakfast separately from a restaurant. The Business Centre provided extremely poor and very expensive services. E.g. to print A4 page cost HKD 10. The Internet is rather expensive too with a daily rate of HKD 130 or weekly HKD 700. The free Internet access in E-club was for 20 mins only and could not cover needs of business travelers. The location of Hotel is rather uninteresting and little bit unconventional unless you are planning to spend every night in Temple Street Market. The nearest MTR station is about 7-10 mins walking time from Hotel. Overall the hotel is extremely overrated and I can't understand the excitement of some reviews here. Very ordinary hotel, with very ordinary facilities, in a very ordinary location.

Close to all the shops and many points of interest, such as Temple Night Market. I walked to most of the places except to TST or when I got really tired. It is not too far form metro stations. Some have commented that the location is a bit too \u201ctouristy\u201d. There is some validity to that. Room and Facilities: I got a really bad room. Room was small. I am ok with that as it is in Hong Kong. Though it was clean but room needed updating. There were dirty marks on the wall and holes as well. Carpet was very much worn out and dirty. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom had nice soft towels and toiletries. There were complementary water bottles. I would rate my room as a 2 star establishment or three at best. Mini bar had all the usual snacks and drinks. There was a regular cathode tube TV with CNN station and other basic channels. Luckily the room did not smell too bad. The scent in the room was a bit strong. Might be problem for some. Common areas, such as the lobby, were a bit small but adequate. There was outdoor space as well, which I think is a bit unusual for HK. I did not use much of the amenities therefore cannot comment on those. Services: A strong point of this place. There were people waiting at the elevator on the ground to help you. Front desk folks were nice, efficient, and polite. I found that the service was at 4-5 stars level. There was no iron and iron board so I requested them. They brought those requested items within 15 minutes. Again, the iron and the board were really old. I was very impressed with the services. Recommendation: I would recommend this place for location, service but not so sure about the room. Other tips. If you like Dim Sums, I recommend Ming Court at the Langham, which is the sister\u2019s property of Eaton. The Dim Sums were amazing. I have a bit of affinity for Asian food. However, I was very disappointed at the food in HK. Not saying that it is bad because I am not native KH. Therefore cannot judge. Just very different from what I have in LA. Did not taste good to me.

We arrived at the hotel at approx 9am and I didn't expect to get a room until early afternoon, but was told the room would be ready in 15 mins and was offered breakfast whilst we waited. Once we got to the room, there was a bottle of red wine, fruit and flowers waiting for us. This was a really lovely touch by the hotel staff. The club level is definitely worth paying a little extra for - the rooms are larger, and the breakfast is great - it saved us a lot of hassle (and money) looking for a suitable place to eat in the mornings. They also serve drinks and snacks from 5.30-7.30pm which was adequate for a light dinner. Overall, I was very impressed with the staff at the Eaton - they were very helpful and friendly when we asked for directions/maps/recommendations etc. This hotel may not be in the same league as the likes of the Langham or Mandarin Oriental, but for the price I thought this was excellent, and the location was perfect.

I did a lot of research on this site & others on this holiday as it was a surprise 40th birthday present for my girlfriend & the Eaton in principle appeared to tick all the boxes. The first good thing about this hotel is its location. An excellent base for exploration, just off Nathan Road where buses run frequently and cover all of the key areas in Kowloon; and also 3 minutes from Jordan Metro. A lot of the big attractions are just a short walk or bus/metro ride away, such as Kowloon Park, The waterfront, plus the main museums & markets, I booked a deluxe room & we were on the 18th floor. Check in was simplicity in itself, reception & concierge were very helpful, friendly and informative. The room itself was very clean and well presented. The bed was firm, spacious and comfortable. The a/c was fully adjustable. The flat screen TV, the remote control light panel and the I-home Ipod player was a really nice touch. The rooms are not oversized but I personally think its all relative. If you are going to stay in it 24/7 then you probably get cabin fever. We were out exploring most of the time and when in the hotel we chilled out in the ample spaced Planters Bar or the lovely garden area, so room size was not an issue. The food in the main restaurant was first class with a choice of buffet or al-a-carte. Some other reviews say that it is expensive, but I believe that you really do get what you pay for. The steak was sumptuous & they even had a chocolate fountain..! The buffet breakfast was diverse and the restaurant staff were usually on point. The 24 hour Gym is not very big but it has all the things in it you need for a total cardio-physical workout and I could find no fault. The complementary towels, bottled water & fresh fruit again was a nice touch. The Pool was open and even though we did not use it, it was in pristine condition.

The rooms were spacious by HK standards and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend the \"E Club\" option, which gets you a room on a higher floor, plus breakfast and afternoon cocktails and hors d'oeuvres in the 1st floor E Club room. This is a very nice facility - cozy and comfortable. Breakfast is called \"continental\" but the choices offered were far better than a run of the mill continental breakfast. In the afternoon the cocktail hour sees waiters delivering complimentary glasses of wine or mixed drinks to you on your sofa while you enjoy a newspaper or browse the internet from one of their 3 terminals, or using the free wifi if you have your own computer.

The location is good, next to Kowloon shopping. The MTR is 5 blocks aways, small walk, but can be very hard in the hot and humid HK weather. The buffet breakfast was really good. Not a lot of choice, but the selection and the quality was really good. I liked the local seasonal fruit a lot. There are lot of local eatery around so do not spend too much here. The restaurants around are really authentic and cheap. There is a money exchanger on the other side and they have good deal. Better than your ATM rate. The Taxi is 270 HKD to the airport, but take the Train, specially when you are leaving as you can check in your laugage at the Train Station. (only on Cathay/BA and some other).

I liked the digitally controlled lighting in the room and the ice machine on each floor was especially handy. Being in Hong Kong there was no need to stay in your room alot apart from to sleep and change so the space was not so essential to us anyway. We didn't have breakfast because we were jet lagged the whole time so only got up about 11/12ish everyday. We did have lunch a couple of times and afternoon tea at the hotel restuarant on lobby level. It was excellent, the service was good and the food delicious and reasonably priced. The hotel has a good location a few mins walk from Jordan MTR and can catch buses just outside. There is no need for taxi's as the MTR service is impeccable, clean, airconditioned and modern. Plus if you like shopping there is always an abundance of shops- food and clothes- in each MTR station. Star Ferry is a must and very cheap! So is the peak which has stunning views, excellent restaurants and shopping- we went there 3 times out of our 10 days we stayed in HK!

There is an excellent restaurant, The Coffee Room, hidden away on floor 4 which we only found on the last night, and very well priced. They also have their own chinese restaurant downstairs which we didn't try but also appears to be a fair price. Alcohol was expensive but it appeared to be in all restaurants. There is free internet access on LG floor by the coffee/snack shop. Would recommend getting the Airport MTR to Kowloon station (book online and it only costs about \u00a310 return each). This is so easy to use and is geared up to travellers with baggage. At Kowloon either get a taxi if in a rush or the free Airport Shuttle bus, marked K1, to the Eaton.

The subway is 5 minutes away and you can catch a bus to the star ferry outside the door. The hotel is about 15 minutes away from the night markets.

The room I got was pretty small, but keep in mind that Hong Kong hotels are rather small relative to what you're used to in some other countries as well as to hotels I've stayed at in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities in China. The bed was fairly firm, but again, keep in mind the beds in China and more so in Hong Kong seem to be a lot firmer than in North America etc. so that's par for the course. The hotel is rather non-descript on the outside but it has a nice patio and a roof top pool. The gym is rather small but serves its purpose for those that need some cardio (if you're looking for a heavy weight lifting workout you'll be a bit disappointed but can still maange a decent workout). Foot massages are offered in the fitness centre for a reasonable HK$200 and was quite good (but painful - I like it that way but you can ask for a softer massage). TV in the room is the old tube style and smallish but again, why be in HK if all you plan to do is watch tv? Safety deposit box is smaller than what I'm used to (most hotels in China are big enough to fit my laptop - this one wasn't) but not a big deal. Location is good - you're on a side street just off of Nathan Rd (HK's main tourist strip) and you're about a 5 minute walk to the subway station (Jordan station, I believe). You can walk down to the Park in about 10 minutes and the waterfront in about 20 minutes. You're also close to the night markets on Temple street (Mong Kok area - north of the hotel). There's plenty of shops along the way so if you're a shopper you'll enjoy the walk downtown (south). You can take the airport express train to TST (one stop before Central) and then it's a short walk (5+ minutes with light luggage) or if you're more daring, you can take a city bus from the airport that will take you along Nathan road - buses are super cheap and there's a spot to put your luggage too.

My first time, I stayed in Mong Kok so I wanted to try a different location since I wanted to explore more of the areas I didn't get to go to the last time. Most of my planned destinations were going to be more in the south (Victoria Peak and HK Island + a day trip to Macau), but I still wanted to eat and shop up north, so I thought being in the middle of Kowloon would serve me best. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect spot. The MTR was just a few minutes away around the block, and getting here and there was so convenient. I stayed in the \"Eaton Room\" which wasn't the largest room I've ever stayed in, but it wasn't the smallest either. For a single person like myself, it was just right. I'm sure 2 people it wouldn't be a problem either, unless you enjoy playing catch with a football. It had nice, neat, modern, and stylish decor which made me feel relaxed and comfortable. It also had features, such as iHome (great to plug my iPod and charge/listen to my music), a flat-screen LCD TV and broadband internet access (I didn't have a laptop so didn't get to use). I had a queen bed with feather pillows which were quite comfortable and clean looking which I could really appreciate. Next to the bed was a small desk and chair setup for gathering my documents and looking over my trip dossier. The bathroom was also clean and bright with a modern and stylish sink. Suffice it to say, I was very pleased with my accommodations. I got to use the pool upstairs which was enjoyable. I was taking swimming classes the semester before my trip and I was glad I got to practice my strokes. It's a pretty small pool so I'm not sure what it's like if there were more than 3 people there. My time spent there, I was always by myself so I couldn't complain. Next door to the pool area was the hotel gym. It had a good amount of equipment and free weights to use. Again, the times I used it, there wasn't anyone there so that was cool (no waiting to use equipment). Lots of tvs to distract you and a nice view out the window when you're taking a water break. After, there's a little changing room at the side with lockers and where you can shower. My choice to visit HK when I did was unfortunate because some big tech convention was going on and as a result, hotels all over were booked up and prices weren't what I would have preferred. My costs for 3 nights (including 15% off for 3 night stay) was 3740HKD + 486.20HKD=4226.20HKD ($542.10, or $180.70/night). Kind of pricey for my cheap [--], but it was bad timing on my part plus I deserve a treat one in a while. Probably better rates on a non-convention weekend. But, again, the centralized location and features offered at the Eaton made my stay worthwhile. The hotel overall was very nice and appealing.", "Date": "August 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "L.A.", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected!!!\u201d", "Author": "okidoki44", "ReviewID": "UR8517201", "Content": "I had read many reviews of the Eaton Hotel on Tripadvisor, not quite convinced that it was the best selection, but I booked it anyways in hopes of a good choice.

I made reservation via the hotel web-site in May. Between May & July, every time I checked back, price had gone down. I cancelled & rebooked 3 times for better rates - saved HK$3,887.2! Airport Transfer : Our Executive Rm. package included complimentary shuttle. We were told we had just missed one, and the counter staff was nice to offer us bottle water while we waited. They tried to charge us for 1 person (HK$130) but we refused as it was clearly stated in our reservation that we were 2 adults & 1 kid. They ended up asking us to sign for the bill charged to the hotel. The shuffle was fast & comfortable. Check-in : As we arrived late at night, the e-Club was closed & we checked-in at the reception. As other trip advisors have mentioned, the receptionists were not very friendly. Room : When we entered our \"Executive Rm.\", we were absolutely stunned. The room was small, old, smelly, and looked nowhere close to the photo shown on the hotel web-site. Instead it looked exactly like a Std. Rm. I called the reception, but like other trip advisors' stories, the hotel was full & they could not do anything until the next morning. When we went for breakfast at the e-Club, I talked to the receptionist there, and she promised to move us to another room on the same floor. Our new room was indeed on another side of the corridor, seperated by a door which read \"Executive Rms\", and it did look like the photo on the web-site. Although the hotel insisted the first rm. we stayed in was an Executive Rm., but we really thought it was just a slight larger Std. Rm. Our new room, although much better, was still quite small, esp. the 2 twin-size beds. We had to move the sofa in-between the 2 beds in order to sleep 3. Food : On the third morning when we had breakfast, my husband drank some skim milk which had gone bad. E-Club's manager, Mimi, was very professional. She came to our table to appologise and told us if we experienced stomach problem & needed to go see a doctor, the hotel would reimburse us. In general, breakfast at the e-Club was of good standard. On some mornings, we saw management-looking personnel going there to make sure things were in good standard. However, outside breakfast hours, we rarely see any snacks, refreshment, or fruit there. We were never there in the evening when alcoholic drinks were served though. Sometimes, when we returned in the evening, we felt like visiting the lounge to relax & had a light snack before going to our room, but there was never anything in the e-Club, not even cookies. Restaurant : the Chinese Restaurant there was good, even for locals. Recommend to go for dim-sum during lunch time. Location : Jordan Metro Station is within walking distance, about 4 - 5 blocks away. It is a convenient location esp. for visiting the night market (Temple Street). Wing On Dept Store (a traditional dept. store) is just across the road. However, it is not a very \"central\" location. A better tourist location would be Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) on the Kowloon side, or Causeway Bay on the Hong Kong Island. Eaton is moving from 3-Star to 4-Star standard, but not quite there yet.

Made the reservation as we had read previous reviews (seemed ok) and we wished to stay a few nights in Kowloon, near the tourist attractions such as the Temple street night market and Nathan Road. Let's begin with the good stuff: * The entrance (reception, lobby as well as the restaurant) are renovated and of good standard. Nice first impression * Location is good if you're looking for a stay in Kowloon near the tourist attractions. On the down side: * Unfriendly staff. * The hotel is only partly renovated, the rooms that haven't been renovated are poor. Nothing to recommend to people with asthma or allergies. * Does not meet the standard of a 4-star hotel. Need more improvement in terms of service and room standard (including the renovated rooms). This is our story... At arrival (late at night), we were happily surprised as the person at the front desk told us that we had been upgraded to a superior room. However, as we entered the room it did not seem \"superior\" in any way. The room was of poor standard, very old and had a funny smell. We stayed in a non-smoking room but the smell of the carpet told us otherwise. Also the air was very \"mouldy\". I suffer from asthma but normally this is not a problem when travelling as long as I have a non-smoking room. Since we arrived late at night, we went straight to bed upon arrival. Shortly I started having breathing problems. We called the 24-hour front desk and we were told that they would send someone to our room to clear the situation. After a while a person came to our room. It was a bell boy (who hardly spoke any English) carrying an airfreshner spray! Since it was late at night, we decided we'd better continue the discussion in the morning and keep the room (we were told that all other rooms were occupied hence a transfer was not an option). I slept in the bath tub that night, since the bathroom had no carpet and therefore less of the strange smell. First thing in the morning we went to speak to the person in the reception. Although we politely explained the situation, the receptionist did not seem interested in assisting us in any way. We had already made the payment for three nights and the message we got was more or less \"take it or leave it\". After some more discussions, we were informed that the hotel is under renovation (no information about that when making the reservation). The floor with our room had not yet been renovated. Although we were willing to pay extra to get a renovated room, all we were told was that \"all rooms are occupied, sorry there is nothing we can do\". Then, when we asked to speak to the manager, the receptionist suddenly managed to find us a renovated room with no additional charge. The lack of information of the ongoing renovation when making the room reservation, the hassle with changing rooms and the unfriendliness of the staff surely bring the rating down for this hotel. I might sound like picky and critical guest. I enjoy travelling and I have stayed at various hostels, b&b:s as well as fancy hotels and have never had any complaints about the rooms. In this case I felt mislead and I was not at all impressed by the way we were treated when we asked for assistance.

We were then asked to wait in the coffee shop for an hour so they could find us a room. Not a great start. We were allocated a room which looked out on to Nathan Road, the view was nice but the room was very small. I haven\u2019t been to Hong Kong before so I don\u2019t know if this the standard for rooms in Hong Kong. We had just about enough room to walk around with two suitcases on the floor. This didn\u2019t really bother us as we didn\u2019t spend much time in the hotel. Another annoying aspect of the room was that the TV only had one channel which we found quite odd and we could not find the remote. We later found out that there was no remote in the room and had to request another in order to watch the TV. During our stay at the hotel we needed to use the internet, so we went to the business centre to use the internet, what we were not told at time was there was free internet stations in the caf\u00e9 on the basement floor and therefore we paid to use the internet. We stumbled on the coffee shop later on in our stay where we found the free internet. The main reason we chose this hotel is for the location. The location was perfect, a 5 min walk to the nearest MTR (Jordan) and a 10 min walk to Temple Street night market. When using the MTR, it works out cheaper to get an octopus card which you can buy for HK $100 which a HK $50 deposit which you get back when you hand the card in. The MTR is so easy to use and found ourselves using it to go everywhere. The ladies market isn\u2019t as publicised as Temple Street but I definitely recommend going there for better bargains and cheap knock off\u2019s. The market can be found opposite Mong Kok station which is 2 stops from Jordan. Another great find was the outlet centre which is outside Tung Chung station, again we stumbled across this on our way to the Lan Tau. Overall, this hotel is good if are not planning on spending a lot of time in it. The rooms are small and the hotel staff although friendly, don\u2019t really do much to help you.

For Hong Kong, the standard room that I had was pretty small = for two people for more than 1 night it might get a bit crazy in there! Nice comfortable snuggly-pillowed bed, big plasma on the wall, dressing table/desk, nice cool radio alarm clock with ipod dock (looked cool but after 5 mins of trying to figure out how to use the alarm I gave up and used my phone). Compact but modern, tidy room with all the usual (shampoo etc). (dont get me wrong, have stayed in rooms half the size for twice the price in Paris, but you know what i mean...) Door staff and reception staff were really friendly and helpful (arent they all in Hong Kong?). It is an excellent stopover hotel - business or pleasure. Well kitted out for business (tho not wireless, had to plug latop in but it was really simple to get logged on) and excellently placed for pleasure. Its about 2 minutes walk from Jordan MTR station which is only 3 stops from Central = you get all the convenience of being in a very accessible location for everything in Hong Kong without paying HK island prices. Oh, and had the best pleasure/pain foot massage experience via hotel-provided service on 21st floor. Well worth it. Only drawback; pool is weeny and there's no spa. Foot massage was in a kind of communal lounge area. So, if you're going to mix shopping with chilling by the pool, this is not your hotel.

The club room came with it's own 1st floor staff, free internet, and free drinks and food from 6.00pm to 8pm. American breakfast on the 4th floor was so, so. Ist floor staff were great and more familar with western requirements. You can book in and out through this reception. Location was central ,a choice between the two MTR subway staitions, still had you walking a couple of blocks either way. Temple street markets across the road, with general night market in one street then food the next. Everone was getting into the food if you new what to get. Again we decided to go it a lone regards tours. A long walk to the harbour stopping at most of the large department stores, then a Star Ferry to Hong Kong Island then a bus to the Stanley Markets and repulse bay was achievable but a full day. Another trip along the same lines to the Peak just about coverered what you could see in a short time.

Booked the executive room. Great for space not much of a view though. If you get the 180 degree window room, ur looking over part of Nathan Rd. If you get the slighty bigger room, u have no view at all. I stayed 1night at the slightly bigger one but then asked to move to the 180 degree window as i wanted some kind of view. Very nice bed, comfy! Bathroom is nice as well, only one thing i didnt like about the bathroom is they have shower curtins and not glass ones. The E club was very nice. Very cosy. Worth the money. Breakfast is nice varietly. Afternoon snacks with free alcohol is lovely but if your there for few nights, the afternoon snack becomes abit boring as they dont change much. Loved the all day coffee! All day internet access. The coffee shop down stairs are GREAT for buffet lunch. Cheap, Cost HK $88 + 10% surcharge.( worked out to be like $Aust $15 each) You get a good variety and a world of desserts!!! Fruit juices self serve. Dinner at the same place will put u back HK $238 + 10%. However dinner time you get more variety like cold crabs, oysters, yabbies, and heaps more. It also included one main meal u choose frm the menu. Did i mention a world of desserts....... =) I personally think the buffet was enough without the main! Drinks not included. Starbucks is a 30 sec walk. Heaps of shops close by. Temple Street night market is 2min walk. Jordan Station MTR 5mins walk. One thing u might like to note is when u check in they freeze the WHOLE AMOUNT of ur stay plus about HK200 more (incase u use room service or mini bar) in ur bank account. (like u have pre-paid it) but if you dont use room service or mini bar they realease the extra amount. But yeh loved hkg and the hotel. Would go back even if its just a stopover.

They don't charge any extra fees and they give you the true exchange rate. Temple street is only two blocks away. There's plenty of restaurants and shops all around. The street vendors only deal in cash. There's even a great laudromat a couple of blocks away. Why pay 50HKD a shirt at the hotel when you can get all of it done for 37HKD.

I booked a Superior room which was on the 14th floor. This was certainly high enough to escape any ambient noise from the hotel or from the traffic down below on Nathan Road. The room was of a decent, but not exceptional size, the double bed was large, clean and comfortable if a little on the firm side. The bathroom was clean and well-stocked with toiletries and two fresh bottles of water every day (a nice touch I thought). There is a free-to-use safe in the room for storing your valuables. The room also has a TV with channels showing English Premiership football and BBC World for those who like a taste of home. There are three restaurants on-site that feature varied menu choices from traditional Cantonese/Chinese food to more western style dishes such as fish and chips, pasta, steak sandwiches etc. There is also a buffet service available. The food is good and the prices are quite competitive (expect to pay around \u00a325 for a main meal for two, with drinks). There is also a coffee shop with complimentary internet access. If you prefer, there is a Starbucks just around the corner, and numerous other restaurants within 10 minutes walk. Access to the on-site gym is included in the price and is fairly well-equipped with treadmills, exercise bike and a cross-trainer, plus a good selection of free weights, although a little light on weights machines. There is also an open-air swimming pool adjacent to the gym which I didn't use. The hotel and restaurant staff are courteous and friendly, always keen to help - although I didn't really have any cause for complaint during my stay. The location of the hotel, whilst not particularly central, does not pose a problem due to the proximity of the Jordan MTR (subway) station. You can buy a card at the airport for HKD300 (about \u00a320) that entitles you to a return trip on the Airport Express train and unlimited MTR travel for 3 days, so this worked out perfect for me. The Jordan MTR station is a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel and from here you can journey pretty much anywhere you want to go in Hong Kong.

We booked a REGULAR room (HK$1,950 /night)in this hotel by Cathay Pacific Holidays in a package deal for eight days flight/hotel/transfers/sightseeing and a 6 over-nights stay in this hotel. We were also looking for a perfect central location to discover Hong Kong for several goals like visiting and shopping centers,streets,markets also good spot for (transport) nearby subway entrances.(MTR- subway and taxi is very cheap .we paid taxi's from HK$20 to HK$25 for 2 - 4 km) By reading several positive and negative reviews we found out that a better deal would be the E-CLUB THE LUXE (HK$2,570 /night) because of little space in the room in the regular room prices are not always including breakfast. Calculations via their own home site Eaton-hotel Hong Kong (early bird rates starting of regular HK$855 Eaton club de luxe roomHK$1413) we found out that a better deal would be the E-club the luxe room because of including breakfast and many extra's like all day free coffee/tea/internet acces in a especialy the e-club lounge for e-room members. We most say that altough the booking was a fixed booking for the regular room they organised changements without problems with helpfull informing and very clearly informing the difference in pricing and conditions. Good quick reponse on e-mails send by us to this hotel enquiry/reservation site gave us the impresion that it is a well organised hotel management.. Easy acces to the information home site of Eaton-hotel Hong Kong . E-CLUB lounge Private check in/out service Proffesional great service staff controled by e-club manager Mrs.Mimi Cheung and her assistant Mr.Angus Yip (like PA's to all quests with helpfull tips and following up all requests )We feel very 'at home'although we were far away from home/Holland. Europe In the club lounge (1th floor)even incl. alcoholic drinks between 18.00 and 20.00hrs -the happy free hours-every day also including fine snacks and appetizers are free! Calculation of some drinks a day and great breakfast pays the difference rate regular-eaton and de club luxe with' pampering' 6 stars service included! A complement is to see that even 10 minutes before closing down the breakfast buffet (10.00a.m. and weekends until 11.00a.m.)they started again to fill up the dishes/plates with new fresh items if it has just started/opening breakfast.Many times we have seen something else in other hotels. Free acces on three spots in this lounge for internet-communications in all privacy . Manny LCD's buit in the walls and a fency furniture together with using a lot of wood materials in the decoration of walls etc gave high class impresion right from the moment you walk in this lounge. This lounge is an extra free service exclusive for E-club room members including all services for tourists/business men who appriciate the personal toutch and to have a meeting point . Telephoning is better/cheaper in the lobby than in the hotel rooms .(offen all the prices in Hotels are excl. service tax 10% and government tax 3%) e.g.using telephone in room HK$95 for one minute call to Europe was out of norm.range! So we only used the free internet acces E- Club de luxe room; This is not a 4 star spacy room but a 6 star, with all luxe-facilities incl.great views, good bed -not hard or too soft-, coffee/tea maker, luxery warm interieur/furniture, internet acces (check the rates) -nice badroom(all items are there ) plenty of place to put your clothes and presents you are going to buy!.........(Took some photos) Roomservice incl standard every day fresh fruit-plate and respecting 100% privacy rules.e.g. We made a mistake instead of putting the sign 'make up my room' we turned this sign at the door in the morning by leaving the room with 'do not disturb'..Nobody did come in the room until we came back late in the afternoon. We found two letters who were slipped under the door into the room with requests to contact the staff for reporting on what time we would like them to make up our room!!!. Ther was no minus item to find exept that this room had a '\u00f3ld fashion' tv set for such a luxery room.So really nothing to complain about. Great room next time we ll take this kind of room again. By informing about the renovations which is going on, they told me that this is taken care of and changed into LCD/Plasma's . We could stay whole day in the room but we came to see Hong Kong and wanted to see also some other Hotels We have been talking to other guests who stayed in the regular room and as we are planning for a group an Asia non-profit tour in 2007 we asked Salesmanager Fanny Tang to show us the other rooms to make a comparisation . We found out that the regular rooms w'e have seen were a lot smaller as ours (as many hotel-rooms in Hong Kong)and that this hotel is actulaly in an second stage of renovation making the reglular rooms bigger by extending/ajusting half of it 's size extra by sacificing one room to every third room to get back space for upgrading these regular rooms. Good thinking because we are as european traveller used to bigger room/facilities. If you do not mind a smaller room and just looking for a good location and reasonable price without using their breakfast facilities then this kind of room-regular- is very value for the money in this very safe Hong Kong area. Transportation facilities from/to airport-hotel; -Taxi;This hotel has own counter Eaton limousine-pick up service point B04 in the arrival hall of the airport. (HK$490 one way)30-45minutes drive. -Subway (MTR) from airport to kowloon via central-station,changing direction admiralty-station to 'exit'Jordan'station(nathan road) .5 minutes walk to the hotel -Bus; about HK$130,-one way -VIGOR services- We took the limousine one time and the bus the other time . Comparing pricing the pick up/drop off service by bus right to the hotel it is much cheaper and also good alternative for not walking around in the subway with suitcases. Regular room; Price value is okay if you only sleep in this room and furniture standard is not so bad as I have been reading in reviews. Without renovations these rooms are still okay because the hotel keep up the rooms in good condition by many checks. I asked also to show me the difference between renovated and not renovated-rooms .Nice of them showing this without commercial goal these rooms. New renovated rooms are better and more sophisicated with a big toutch of warm furniture by using a lot of wood and I have seen the TV- LCD's build into the wall.(Took some photos) Even the regular room is okay for tourists or businessmen but we liked the eaton club the luxe room more.(best value for money object compared to others as the Kowloon hotel or Shangri-La in this area. We checked ALL the restaurants inside this hotel Restaurants (inside Hotel Eaton) PLANTER's BAR(4) Good international dinner with nice live music. Drinks a bit expensive (e.g. a glass of red wine ca HK$ 70). Veal chop / Lab chops,drinks ;dinner two persons here incl services ca HK$550 not cheap not expensive but okay considering ther is a band playing with different kinds of good music Okay also for a drink with your parner or all by yourself to sit at the bar in the evening just to listen to the music/show.

Take the Star ferry ( HK$ 2,20 ) central to get back to the mainland (Kowloon- Tsim Sha Tsui) . Good very cheap alternative boat-ride on a (1957) ferry boat and have a great experience and a great view on Hong Kong waterfront-view. You will be arriving by boat at the bus station but you can also take a walk back to the hotel passing by Salisbury road left to Hangkow road and right back on Nathan road .(So you will walk by many nice shops and restaurants) Walking up to the hotel another 15 minutes. A taxi ride from this bus station(boat-Star Ferry exit) to the Eaton Hotel is about HK$ 25-30 Sightseeing Tours; Take a busride tour to discover Hong Kong at least one time during your stay by daytime . We took supercity appetizer by Vigor ToursLtd departing at the hotel Kowloon at .09.00hrs am to be dropped of at 14.30hrs . Not expensive and good value for money. See Hong Kong island ;the peak the beaches the shopping center causeway bay by bus, a short stop in a juwelery factory jade items and 'expensive''nice 'things' -leave your credit card at home?!-and get a lot of information from the english spoken guide history and helpfull tips what to do and see in Hong Kong and a you will have the opertunity for a boatride in the harbour between' the old scene floating boats' Don't take; the Aberdeen Night Cruise (Spendid tours) (HK$560 p.p.) including \"night cruise and ' dinner:'' You will be 'dumped' on the roof of a boat in the evening to have some 'free'drinks. Afterwards you will have dinner at the Jumbo floating boat in the middel of the harbour of Hong Kong for an quick-asian-european tasting meal and afterwards a quick stop only!(!)half way up to the peak and then quickly be brought back to your hotel. No value for the money. Instead of this take the Star ferry ca HK$2 and a good restaurant in the top of one of the buildings to overview Hong Kong. There are so many of them. Or dinner/lunch Aqua roma/ Aqua tokyo jap+italian dim sum sunday brunch 29th floor One Peking. Best coffee in town -Starbucks coffee 1-13 D Aquilar Street Central HK - Pacifific Coffee nearby hotel Eaton on Nathan Road 5 minutes walk (direction-south)to the waterfront One last tip ; write down the name of the hotel or destionation in chinese language (by concierge hotel) because not all taxidrivers understand englisch and ask before you go 'on board'of this taxi an estimation rate of fares to this point. If you have problems in Hong Kong call the consumer Counsil Hotline for assistance or multilingual Visitor Hotline HKTB. But.......I don't think you will need this because all the people we have met in Hong Kong were so polite and very friendly, very respectfull so I cannot make another conclusion that we 'll come back to Hong Kong and staying again in the same Hotel Eaton-hotel on Nathan road again. Same room, same place, another time......Writing this review at home in Holland I feel a bit home-sick allready!......Can't wait to come back soon to Hong Kong! With the help/service/tips of the staff by staying in this hotel it created an impact even more then an experience beyond expectatations............................We lived our dream!

It was clean and basic and that's all. Three things I did not like about the room. 1)Curtains: They have only canvas curtain so you either shut it and have darkness or open it and get sunlight. They should introduce lace or sunlight passing curtains. 2) AC: The AC didn't turn off , so I woke up freezing in the morning. 3) TV Channels: There was not that many options. I had to ask them to change my room because they first put me in an connecting room, where I could hear all the conversations in the next room.

We only eat breakfast in the hotel as we have our favourite restaurant on Austin Road that we go to each night, but what we did eat was fresh and enjoyable, with no complaints at all. As people have mentioned you are close to everything from the Eaton but everything in Hong Kong is nearby. Taxis are a definite cheap way to travel especially if you are tired after a long day. Otherwise grab the octopus card and use the trains. Temple Street Nite markets are 5 mins walk and the Ladies market about 10 mins the other way, the jade market is just beyond the night markets but only open days, worth a visit.. Also the rooftop pool is a godsend after a long day walking, it was closed one day while we were there, reason being they had a thunderstorm warning and do not believe in taking chances, we were notified once it had been re opened and allowed to enter for a swim.

No spare rooms available to relocate, so housekeeping did special cleaning of room to remove as much smell as possible. Was acceptable after that. The food, especially the breakfasts, were fabulous with every type of food available to suit any taste. The cocktail bar very enjoyable for a few drinks and some entertainment.

Excellent transport via buses and taxis make getting around so easy and cheap. We did walk from the hotel to the harbour which took about 30 minutes, but we were shopping along the way. Walking and using the buses gave the best view of the city & what was on offer. We didn't get down to the trains except to pick up the Octopus card - a real MUST HAVE. The Chinese Restaurant in the basement of the hotel was a special treat for our last night.

The room was very clean and looked brand new. There were the usual complimentary tea-making facilities, a mini fridge and most importantly, a safe to store our valuables. What more could we ask for? The queen-sized bed was comfortable although a bit on the hard side. There was a bathtub in the bathroom which came in handy if you wanted to soak your tired and aching limbs after a day of walking around sight seeing or shopping. There was also a central console beside the bed which allowed you to control the lights, television and also to indicate on the sign outside the room whether you wanted the room cleaned or otherwise. Television channels included CNN, CNBC, BBC and a variety of sports channels in both English and Cantonese. There were also Korean,French, Italian and Spanish channels to cater to tourists who did not understand English or Cantonese. One feature of the hotel which we really appreciated was the ice- making machines located on every floor. This came in handy when we wanted ice cold drinks after a long hard day of shopping.

Yes, the room is small but most families in Hong Kong are living in two-bedroom apartments under 17 sq. m. Don't expect anything short of a very lavish waterfront suite to be any different. I loved how quick the hotel was to get to: at the airport, have the HK tourism desk write the hotel name and address in Cantonese, then take the airport link express to Kowloon, and a 10 minute taxi ride later gets you right to the front door. Without two or three pieces of luggage, it's five minutes from the MTR. All the staff were very polite and helpful: the bell boy who helped me to my room almost refused to take my tip; the man at the business centre let me use the internet above and beyond the suggested 1 hour limit; a serviceman was sent immediately when I complained that the internet port in my room was not working; and the spa staff on the fitness floor were really wonderful.

Eaton hotel surprisingly is a very good hotel. We got standard room in 9th floor, it a is soundproof rrom as our room facing the large and noisy Nathan Road. We can use 4 free internet boots in hotel's Aroma Cafe. We just need to order coffee (they serve ILLY coffee) or juice. We had an free early check in at 11.00 am. We were happy for this. The room size is OK, but definitely not spacious. But warning, they charge you local phone. Better to use the 2 phones at the lobby which is free of charge if you dial local number. The half day tour is definitely a tourist trap. The bus take you to Jewelry Factory, and the bus' tour leader persuade me to buy something, which is OK if you have desire to do so or has interest with jewelry. But no for a budget traveller like us. From Eaton hotel we can walk to Jordan MTR station or Yau Ma Tei MTR Station. It is only one MTR station ride to TST from Jordan. It took us about 10 minutes to both stations as the hotel is in the middle of two stations.

The Aroma Coffee Shop is not the place I would go for an espresso as it was served to me in a huge 8-12oz cup (I cannot remember the size exactly). I had my breakfasts the following days in the SB Coffee shop (45 seconds walk from the hotel). In one sentence; if you are looking for a hotel with 24 internet availability for free or low cost, it is not the right place. If I knew we had to pay an additional 10-15% of the room rate for the internet I would had gone elsewhere! The only place where the internet is FREE at the Eaton Hotel in Nathan Road is at the Aroma Coffee Shop where they serve Espresso\u2019s in 12oz mugs. Next time I would check-in in another hotel. Additional tips in Hong Kong, please take the train and from the station take a taxi, it is much faster than taking those bus shuttles. The buses would have to drop many people in many hotels. So if your hotel happens to be the last in the list, you might be doing a 1 \u00bd hour trip from the airport to your hotel. There may be a difference of HK$10/20, but it is much faster than the bus.

The Room. HK is increadibly hot and humid at this time of the year but so the air con in the room was a godsend! We had a room on the 12th floor which ahd a view down nathan road and over the lobby lounge below. There have been complaints about the size of the rooms but we stayed in a standard room and didn't find it small at all! The room was nice and clean but the walls were a little grubby just from general wear and tear. The bathroom had a bath and shower and an automatic hair dryer. There was also a retractable washing line across the bath which came in very handy when we encountered our first tropical rainstorm! Hotel Staff and Facilities. The hotel staff were pleasant and courteous at all times. We didn't really engage with them much as we were out of the hotel for most of the day. We did not visit any of the bars or restaurants in the hotel but they all looked very nice. The swimming pool on the roof is very nice! The pool is quite small but at the time I was the only person using it which was fantastic! Location. For me the hotel was in an almost perfect location (ok, I would have prefered a hotel overlooking the harbour but who wouldn't?). Jordan MTR is a 5 min walk away and using our octopus cards we found it very easy to get around. We were one stop away from the TST area which contains a multitude of bars and restaurants and also the avenue of stars (which is the best place the see the light show). In the other direction, it is a few stops away from the Chi Lin Nunnery (highly recommended) and also various bus routes into the new territories. Also, temple street market is just round the corner. All major tourist attractions are easily accessable from this hotel. Overall. Extremely happy with my hotel choice and would go back again any day!", "Date": "July 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3554625", "Content": "If you are looking for a hotel that is central to everything then this is it. We stayed here for 7 nights in June and were very impressed with all aspects of the hotel. We decided to upgrade to an executive room and it is well worth it, floor to ceiling windows, with great views of the nightlife of Hong Kong. Breakfast is included with this room in the Aroma Cafe and though it is only a continental breakfast was more than adequate to start the day with. Internet access is available and we found it quite easy to get a machine. The pool on the roof is wonderful, although only small it serves its purpose of allowing you to cool down after walking in the heat all day. The bathroom was more than functional and served our needs. The room itself was excellent, although small by Australian standards it was quite well designed with all the mod cons and more than comfortable. As the hotel is away from the tourist area of Tsim Sha Tsui you are not hassled by tailors each time you walk out the door. Jordan MTR is about a 3 minute walk and we found that by walking up the back streets (Chi Wo Street) this brought you out at the entrance to the MTR and was much more pleasant as there were no crowds this way looking at the shops, also a great noodle bar up this street. The Temple STreet night markets are another 3 minutes away and fantastic. The MTR can easily get you to Mongkok (much cheaper for shopping) and over to Hong Kong island for sightseeing. The staff at the hotel are courteous and polite at all times and when we had questions they were answered quickly and things arranged exactly as we had expected. I booked with this hotel direct and found i got a better rate by going through them direct, and all with no hassles. There are so many restaurants in the area to choose from it is unbelievable, but for a great one go up Nathan Road till you reach Austin Road, turn left and past the car dealership. On the right hand side you will see a restaurant with yellow vinyl seats, the waiters are great, the food is fabulous and so cheap all we ever seemed to do was eat. The Eaton seems to be central for everything, you are right in between Hong Kong Island and Mongkok and Sham Shui Po, the markets in Mongkok are easily reached with a pleasant walk up Nathan Road and you can either get the MTR back or a taxi for about $25HK. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is travelling to Hong Kong, but organise transfers to and from the airport with the hotel as it is cheaper than getting a taxi and just as easy.", "Date": "June 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lismore Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat mid range hotel\u201d", "Author": "HB00763", "ReviewID": "UR3504947", "Content": "Stayed at the Eaton in May 2005 in a standard room.

The room was not great considering the price, very small w/twin beds (hard as a rock, but if you've travelled in Asia, you'll be used to that), dark & sort of stinky, but a very large nice bathroom. Internet service was the sketchiest I've ever encountered. While it was only available an hour each day due to some \"technical difficulties\" (and believe me the jet lag had me checking email at ALL hours) we were charged for a full 24 hours of service each day- even though they admitted the service was down for 24 hours, we had tried to log on, so we were charged...no appologies.

The rooftop gym and pool are small, but nice. Plus, there were rarely more than 3 or 4 people using any of the facilities, so it served as a nice tranquil getaway from the loudness and energy of Hong Kong. The bar was a pretty fun place, and the happy hour from 5:00-8:00 serves 2-for-1 drinks (as do most bars in Hong Kong). Didn't try any of the other restaurants at the Eaton. Looking back, we would have preferred to stay on Hong Kong Island, but I would assume the hotels there are at least double the price. If you can find a similar hotel on Hong Kong Island for the same price, I would go with that. Considering it takes about 10 minutes on the MTR to get to Hong Kong Island, it's really not much of a hassle.

Having been to Japan and know that in densely populated Asian cities, hotel room sizes are small when compared to hotels in the US & no views unless advertised. I did not expect the Eaton standard room to be different. I found the room adequate for 2 person and a very nice decent sized bathroom & regular size bathtub. Room & bathroom were very clean and well maintained. In-room internet (ethernet connection) cost 100 hkd/24 hrs and very slow when connecting to US for email but very fast using yahoo HK and searching pages in HK. Location and convenience adds to the hotel's advantage. coffee shop at ground floor of hotel, Starbucks across the street on one side, Mcdonald's across the street on another side, 7-11 (visited often since there are no supermarkets in HK like the US) two blocks away, Temple street night market (much better than Stanley Market which took hours to get to) 2 blocks away, MTR 5 min walk, Star Ferry 20 min walk, numerous restaurants, inexpensive to moderate all along Nathan Rd just outside hote. For tourist shopping just walk south on Nathan Rd, for where the locals shop, just head north on Nathan Rd. Fom the airport,Taxi is 300 HKD to the hotel, so if there are 3 or 4 people it is cheaper than the express train. March was still kind of off season and hotel rates was around 80 us on the internet. Snce it was not Yahoo Travel or Expedia, I was relieved to found reservation was properly made at the hotel. Check in took 5 min. Almost everyone at the hotel spoke English, some better than others and the betters ones I found at the front desk, concierge, and hotel operator.
