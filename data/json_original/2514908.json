We stayed 11 nights. It was our first time to the Paris, and this hotel seemed like a good choice for the Opera District. I was interested in the hotel, particularly with its long history, once known as Le Salon Indien du Grand Caf\u00e9. I studied cinema in college and found this fact interesting, since this is where Lumi\u00e8re brothers first screened exhibited in 1895 a new medium - known as film, for the public. I presume not far from where they now serve breakfast there. So cool. The staff was very friendly. I do not speak french, and I tried to politely get by. The staff would talk to me in English, as it was obvious I was not speaking their language so well. I really enjoyed everyone I came into contact with there, they all were very patient and polite. The lady handling my dry cleaning, the front desk staff, the concierge, and even the staff you met at breakfast - all very pleasant. The breakfast was incredible. A diverse selection of french baked goods, to miso soup... to fresh juices and cheeses. The tea room was fun - they have a wonderful selection of teas and macaroons. The hotel is not far from other locations - you can walk a different direction each day and see so many things. We visited the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz Carlton, the Cartier store - amazing what is on display there as you can guess, many great coffee shops and retailers. There is a nice wine shop across the street with a huge selection. I believe three levels. We took home a bordeaux which was excellent. There is also a nice perfume shop downstairs, a few doors away, called Divine i think. I found cuban cigar vendor not to far away either, which my wife wasn't too happy about. The rooms are not huge, but they are absolutley fine. You are in Paris, not Texas... you should to set your expectations accordingly. They also have security cameras in the halls, I thought that was a nice they are looking out for their guests.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baku, Azerbaijan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in excellent location\u201d", "Author": "Nazim S", "ReviewID": "UR126676794", "Content": "This is a perfect 5 stars hotel in the centre of Paris, near Galeries Lafayete, all necessary transport hubs and the Opera.

I called to confirm my room request and was assured that it was reserved. Upon arrival, this request was not fullfilled and my room was not ready. We arrived at the hotel at 2pm (we are A Club Gold Sofitel members which includes early check-in.) We were finally able to check-in at around 5pm. We paid for a club sofitel room which allows you soft drinks, newspaper and baked goodies daily. When we did not receive the latter of the three and when we informed the front desk of this we were were told you only get a welcome gift and champagne. I had to proceed to explain that this was not the case and our amenities included this. I expected the same helpfullness I received at my last stay at Hotel Scribe. I wonder how many people pay for this service and never get it. If it were my first stay at Scribe I wouldn't have known. Once, again our wonderful concierge Mairie shines through. I also spoke to her before my arrival (she remembered me from a year before, wow.) and asked her to make several lunch and dinner reservations and was perfectly accommodated. She will be the reason we come back. Audrey, the guest relations manager, is also a star. She handeled a very difficult situation dealing with theft on the Paris tranportation system. She handeled it with utmost grace and professionalism. The pastries are not made on the premises and be careful which one you choose, because their looks may deceive you.

I am very picky about rooms and usually stay in 5 star hotels when I go away. I chose Scribe because I felt it was the best choice for the price and for the location. I would have loved to stay at Crillon or the Ritz, but I needed two rooms for my self and my children (20,17,16).. We chose the club rooms because they were bigger and included the mini bar... Ok well the hotel is lovely, clean and great location... we were there for 9 nights 10 days which is a long time!... The rooms were large, our king size bed and room was large and very nice... my kids room was large twin beds, and we had a spare bed brought up. It was located near alot, we walked to many locations... The restaurants are nice around but very similar...not great. The rooms were cleaned every day (we did tip 30e for each room to make sure we got extra towels and extras). Next the concierge was nice... not extremely helpful but answered our questions when we asked. Franz at the front desk was nasty and rude...when our card didnt work 2 nights in a row he didnt offer to bring my husband up to our room, but then a euro couple had the same problem and he fell over himself to bring them up..(hmmm?) they are extremely nice to euro people..as for americans they are ok, but not extremely nice...maybe they tried with us because we dropped about the cost of a small kia there for a week for the whole stay! The second night we did ask them if the bar was included in the room and they said yes... Later found out that only included soft drinks..nothing else, so we got hit with a big bar bill from the liquer and snacks we had...My main concern was the cleanliness of the room and the size. The Scribe club room is great for that. We didnt eat in the restaurant, but had the breakfast included everyday. It had alot of food and different choices that were very good. The only thing is that once again we had the staring from all the other guests as if we had three heads when we were having breakfast. (what is it Americans in this country?)

The exterior or the hotel is pleasant enough, however the inside lacks charm and elegance. The lobby was unimpressive and boring at the least, with horrible dark green sofas. The bedroom had no real day light and was painted in a sombre light ashen grey, which I found quite depressing and made the room appear even smaller than it was. The accent accessories such as pictures and lamps were insipid and uninteresting. The hanging storage space was an ironing cupboard, and the toilet area was so small that with the door closed it felt like a prison cell. Air conditioning not working in room, hot water not working on 1st day also not working, and a second notice came through on 2nd day that hot water would be off from 2-5 that day in whole of Paris. Housekeeping was cordial and did sort out hot water on first evening. I would site these issues as unacceptable for a hotel with a 5 star rating as well as highly annoying. I found the front/desk reception mostly unhelpful. As mentioned Cupboard hanging space small, with about 6 hangers would be okay for a business trallever, both not a couple. Bath is not very practical for people who would struggle to get out of bath as steep drop to floor when stepping out of bath. Breakfast seriously overpriced in hotel (approx 35 Euros per person) and we had to go out to eat, no restaurants nearby the hotel as other guests have commented, so needed to walk a fair distance to find somewhere reasonable. Room service, no special attention to detail as other hotel, for example, turn beds down, chocolates on pillow etc. This hotel is overpriced, impersonal and service not at all up to standard. I would not stay here again. I stayed at the Hotel du Louvre 2 years before and although the hotel was slightly dated, at least staff was courteous and helpful, the ambience was pleasant and it had much more of a personal touch and an old worldly touch of glamour and style you would expect form visiting one of the most opulent and lavish cities in the world.", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington State", "Title": "\u201cA nice hotel within a 15 minute walk of most sights\u201d", "Author": "hmarti24", "ReviewID": "UR63925149", "Content": "Hotel Scribe is a reasonably priced and comfortable hotel within walking distance of the Louvre and very close to shopping.

We arrived in a private transfer car ( ATS shuttle service - fantastic service from CDG for 55Euro) at the hotel , had our bags quickly carried inside, check-in quite fast and pleasant. Our room was a very pleasant luxury room with a nice opening pair of french doors with a lovely view of the street - very pretty - especially at night. The bed was very plush and comfy. The bathroom was a bit of a surprise only because of the small size, especially for this grade of room - but it was adequate and very clean. There was not much wardrobe space if you wanted to hang your clothes - I took out the nice plush robes so we could fit at least a few of our things into the robe. Overall the room was very enjoyable and comfortable. The other parts of the hotel were also very elegant and pleasant. We were , however ,a bit disappointed with the Restaurant - very expensive and very little choice. We felt like we were out of place when we could only have a main and some mineral water! ( very small quantities, very trendy sort of food). Breakfast was also a great expensive at 32euros and we felt a bit isolated as no staff came to help or explain what was on offer - we therefore only had it the first day and opted for room service the other days as this was a much cheaper option. We tried to get lunch the next day but apparently 2:00 was too late. We found it very hard to find any reasonable cafes in that area. Ended up spending too much on what we would consider to be a very mediocre meal - but it is Paris after all. After the Scribe we had an apartment on I'le ST Louis and the food situation there was far different - a very lovely part of Paris! The other problem that we felt at this hotel is that the staff were a bit standoffish and superior . Also you have to pay for internet which is a shame in this day and age when even travellers like to keep in touch with home by email!

I raised the fact that all the 5-star properties I had experienced, had the extra things like bottle of water, turn down service, etc. No that I particularly wanted those extra bits, but that is what distinguished them. Given the lack of furnishings, as well as the lack of those extra items, I genuinely was curious as to how they could compare themselves to the other 5-star properties such as The Ritz etc. They admitted that they weren't in fact 5 Star and said \"but we're trying to get that status\". So!! They have not altered their rating in any of the hotel sites which is a misrepresentation.

It was a great area but don't expect to see 'affordable cafes' along the main roads for breakfast/lunch as compared to Notre Dame area. It is definitely close to Opera Garnier and Galleries Lafayette, further up would be Au Printemps coupled with ZARA, H&M, GAP, Uniqlo stores in surrounding areas. The BED was really superb! It super comfy and we had no problem falling asleep. Room size was small but it's still much bigger compare to Tokyo hotels. What I liked from the room beside the bed: the lighting was perfect, the design of separate toilet from bathroom, the wardrobe and mini bar was concealed in cabinet doors, the sound proof walls really worked unlike some hotels so you've no noise disturbance at all. Minus point from this hotel as other mentioned was the Bathroom / Shower area. Major problem was the Shower Area. It maybe due to wrong design, due to its unfixed glass partition, there was a gap which caused the water spillage to the floor A Lot. Second major was bathtub position was too high for ladies to climb out and it's definitely dangerous when the floor was wet. I highly recommend ladies to have someone to help out when stepping out from the bathtub. Our trick to avoid messy water spillage was turning the shower not too powerful and showering inside the bathtub area; to avoid splashing of water to the wall and in the end cause water ran unto the floor too from bathtub corner. It's troublesome but worth to try instead of having wet and slippery floor. For amenities, it lacked of the essential items; such as toothbrush and toothpaste but loved the Hermes Shampoo & Body Gel, Bathrobes and Slipper provided. The Hermes shampoo and body shower gel. Staff were friendly and fast check in and check out process but didn't really interact much during our stay. Breakfast was on -1 floor and served simple continental/american buffet style breakfast. A bit expensive but worth to have if you're having an early day out as not easy to get breakfast in surrounding areas. Overall, a great hotel and loved the room minus the bathroom... We didn't regret staying here for our memorable Paris trip. PS: As of 26 Oct 2009, location of Roissy CDG Bus at Rue Rivoli has moved, it was on opposite road from the old ones.

I'm so glad we chose this hotel. The St. Germain area now seems so touristy (and on this particular weekend a huge techno music parade was happening creating mobs in the streets). The Opera area a lovely and seems to be filled with more locals. Another plus for this location is the transportation from the hotel. The Roissy Bus runs directly from CDG to Opera (Rue Scribe) - literally one block away from the hotel. It's a one hour nonstop bus from CDG to Paris. Cost is about 9 Euro per person/one way. This is a great plus for this hotel. The hotel is also very near to both the Opera and Madeliene metro stops. Galleries Lafayette is only about 2 blocks away. The Louvre is about a 15 minute walk. The Seine about 20 minutes walk. The staff was lovely. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready. The woman checking us into the hotel took us to the Spa so that we could freshen and change into comfortable clothes. The rooms are a nice size, considering this is Europe. The beds are amazingly comfortable. The TV has English channels like CNN and BBC. The bathrooms are very modern. (Instead of a shower curtain, it does have that little glass shield that unfortunately allows water to spray all over the bathroom). We didn't dine in any of the hotel restaurants. We were just eager to get out into the Paris streets and try some other restaurants. There are many, many restaurants around the hotel. There is the small spa available.

I imagine this is what everyone thinks of as French country or \"peasant\" food--great roasted chicken, awesome vegetables---etc. We tried beef, seafood and chicken---all great.

We were in a 'Luxury' Room - Room 544. The 'Luxury Rooms' have views of the avenues. The standard rooms look into the courtyard and are quite smaller - we saw one from the corridor. There was a very comfortable king size bed. Flat screen TV with several UK channels. Free tea and coffee facilities. The room was immaculate and large for Paris. The bathroom was large with a separate shower cubicle and a separate toilet closet. There were Hermes toiletries. The lobby and lounges are lovely with crystal chandeliers. However, it is calm and relaxing and not overbearing like some of the Paris 'palaces'. The staff were courteous and helpful. There is a lovely relaxing tea room as part of the hotel where we had lovely tea and patisseries - the best we had in Paris. It also has crystal chandeliers and is on 2 levels - a spiral staircase takes you to window seats overlooking the avenue. Paris was boiling hot and very crowded. The hotel was a lovely calm and relaxing oasis from it all. We retreated to the hotel at about 3.00pm each day we weren't at Roland Garros and it was lovely to sit in the calming lounge after the frenzy of the city. There were a couple of issues that we would like to see changed: i) The tea room was closed on both the Sunday and Monday. This was ludicrous for a 5 star hotel in a capital city and it meant we couldn't enjoy it for 2 days. The lounge served a more restricted choice of patisseries. ii) Towels. We had one bath towel each per day. They did bring new ones at night, but I would rather they had spares in the bathroom as it meant if we bathed at night we had to use the same ones again in the morning. iii) Wardrobe space is very limited.Tiny in comparison to the size of the room. iv) Breakfast. At 34 Euros each it was extremely limited and the same very day. The hot food was inedible for us: limited, greasy and very poor quality and the same every day. The scrambled eggs were runny like soup and the bacon and sausages greasy and under cooked. Very limited choice of coldmeats and cheese - the same every day. After several days we were sick of it and could only manage some toast! At 34 Euros each!Last year we also stayed here and they had crispy Dim Sum as part of the Japanese breakfast buffet. But they were gone this year. There was only a bowl of soup and rice. Breakfast simply isn't worth it here. Also the tea water was never boiled so the tea was undrinkable. The coffee though was lovely. v) Room Service. Our room service meal was very poor. One anaemic omelette that appeared to have been made of powdered egg. Once stone cold club sandwich and cold french fries. For over 60 Euros it was very very poor. Throughout our trip we found the food to be of a very poor standard across Paris. The same menu in every restaurant and poor quality and undercooked. It was pretty dreadful compared to London or New York. It was as if everyone survives on baguettes and croissants! The quality of meats and cheeses is dire! It is also extremely expensive and nothing we ate was worth it. The tourists have to put up with it and it is as if Paris restaurants don't care and are in a timewarp. I would stay here again if they resolve the above issues as it is a lovely hotel in a great location. Otherwise next year we will try the Intercontinental Grand which is virtually next door and looked lovely. But I have no expectations for food even there as every menu is the same - I really do think that Paris has been taken over on the restaurant front by other cities where numerous great Chinese, Indian and Pizza places abound.

The mattress was luxurious, comfortable, and bed linens were of high quality. Our room looked out on to the street and was fitted with two glass doors, the second one had basically sealed out all street noise from the room. The room was furnished elegant furniture and was tastefully decorated. The hallway walls were lined with black and white historic photos on large, seemingly cloth pieces of wall paper. Very nice. The washroom was elegant and highly functional. Our room had an enclosed glass shower and a large soaker tub. The vanity was very elegant. Nice touch with Hermes bath products in the washroom. Public areas of the hotel were luxurious: very nice lobby where the concierge desk is located and nice sitting area adjacent to the check-in desk. The little cafe / library near the entrance with the spiral staircase is charming. One area of the hotel that we feel could be improved is staff service. In general, compared with other 5-star properties we've stayed at, staff at Hotel Scribe could be more friendly. On many occasions, we walked by staff and received no greeting, no \"hello\", not even a \"good morning\". For 300+ Euro per night, I suppose we expect more of a welcoming attitude from staff. We had the feeling that we have to appreciate staying at the hotel, rather than staff appreciating our patronage as paying guests. The small gym had three cardio machines and a few weights. If you're looking for cardio exercise, the gym will suffice. If you want to do weight training, the gym will limit you. What we didn't like is the heat that was generated in the small gym room. We realized afterward that ceiling mounted pot lights were directly above the cardio machines. I sweated more than I normally due and would attribute this to the excess heat generated by the pot lights above the cardio machines. What we did like was the spa across from the gym, which was generally excellent. The spa is also equipped with separate men's and women's steam rooms, which we appreciated. Regarding breakfast, 33+ Euro for the breakfast was very, very pricey. We did breakfast for two mornings and then had breakfast outside the hotel. The quality was fine, but the cost was exhorbitant. We've seen better hotel breakfast buffets in Paris during previous trips to the city for closer to 20 Euro. So we recommend that you avoid eating at the hotel.

The view from the room was fantastic as we could see the sun rise above the roofs of Paris in the morning. Hotel Scribe is a very nice hotel with all the bits and pieces that make a 5* (well, 4* Lux according to the hotel's official French listing) just in place. The rooms are exceptionally clean although small (but that's the rule everywhere in Paris). The breakfast buffet menu is quite rich, the bedding is extra comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and brand new, filled with Hermes amenities. We didn't need any particural service from the staff but they were very attentive and helpful at check-in and check-out. I shall try to compare the Hotel Scribe against its competitor Hotel Le Grand (which is just across the street from Hotel Scribe) where we had stayed for three nights back in February '08. The only thing missing from Hotel Scribe is the \"glorioso\" style in the atmosphere of the hotel which is evident everywhere (hall ways, rooms bathrooms, furniture) in Le Grand, the large lounges and entrance hall and of course ... the \"Cafe de la Paix\"!! Cafe de la Paix is a Paris institution in terms of cafes and restaurants located on the ground floor of Le Grand and that's where breakfast for the hotel guests is served in the morning. It is also an \"haute cuisine\" restaurant for lunch and dinner. Such details put Le Grand one click ahead of Hotel Scribe which make Le Grand a true 5* hotel (but, of course, this comes at a price...) considering that at Hotel Scribe we paid 330 Euros per night (including breakfast) for a double room which was really an excellent value for a 5* hotel located in such a convenient and beautiful area of Paris (Opera).

I found the room to be pretty small for this type with however a big spacious bathroom. All the other reviews are right: how do you shower standing?? there is no curtain or even a glass panel and all the water goes all over the bathroom floor, making it very slippery ( and potentially hazardous- and I'm NOT an elderly!). So although you have a great pressure, you minimize the shower time as it floods the floor. A shame. The complimentary toiletries may be from Hermes but are tiny and there are very few of them so I was most pleased to have brought my own shower gel & shampoo. The beds are very comfortable with luxurious egyptian sheets ( but then again it's a 5*) and the decor is good and the room very clean. The price of the breakfast is totally outrageous, even by 5* standards ( and I've been in a few without sounding smug) and although we went for it ( it was my b'day) we just found it to be good- not fantastic. The spa- I had a massage and found the therapist to be very good but again, as a regular user of spas, I found the place lacking a bit the indulgence feel you get in other spas. The room can overlook a nice courtyard and making them very quiet ( a bonus in Paris). I found the staff to be courteous but not overly so. Could be so much better working in such an establishment. But maybe they were having a bad day? The big Plus point of this hotel is definitely the location- in a really nice arrondissement of Paris ( Opera) with great shopping around, the place de la Concorde only 15mns walk away and the place Vendome only 10mns walk away- with plenty of fab restaurants and caf\u00e9s in the area.", "Date": "September 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kansas city", "Title": "\u201cA Wonderful Stay at the Scribe\u201d", "Author": "davidbruce", "ReviewID": "UR18270735", "Content": "We spent 10 days at the Hotel Scribe for a recent vacation in Paris and overall we had a wonderful experience there. This is certainly a high-quality hotel that is worth a splurge if you can afford it. Our room was not big, but it was adequate. The bed was very comfortable, with a small desk area and a flat-screen TV. Best of all, the room was quiet at night. If you have noise concerns, make sure to request a room overlooking one of the inner courtyards. The bathroom was large and nicely appointed, with a big powerful shower, high-quality towels and fabulous Hermes products. A few minor peeves: as others have pointed out, the poor design of the shower door meant it was inevitable that water from the shower would spill out onto the floor. And although they gave us a nice new shower floor mat, on several days they took it away and did not replace it, so we had to call down to ask for one, which was annoying. But these are minor quibbles. My partner got a massage at the spa one time and said it was great. We also used the gym a few times. It is quite small and there's not much to it other than a few cardio machines and one of those 10-in-1 Nautilus-type machines. But you can still manage to get in an OK workout. There's also a nice big whirlpool and steam room that you can use. We didn't have the buffet breakfast down in the basement restaurant every day, because it IS expensive (as is everything in Paris these days), but we thought it was nice enough. We didn't experience any of the problems that others reported here, such as the problems with restocking. It seemed to be well-run, and there was always plenty of food. We often found ourselves hanging out in the nice bar area off the lobby, where they also serve food. With its big glass atrium, it was a relaxing place to sit for a drink or to have a late-afternoon bite at an odd hour. We also had dinner there one night and it was delicious, and you can pick up a light continental breakfast that's a bit cheaper than the full buffet down in the basement restaurant. They often featured live music in the bar, including a pianist and a harpist one evening. The tea salon at the front of the hotel was also a good place for a quick bite. It serves light sandwiches and delicious pastries. We found the staff at the hotel to be fantastic. They were all extremely friendly and helpful to us, and there was no need too big or too small for the concierge staff to help us with. Last but not least, the Hotel Scribe is in a great central location, especially if you like to shop. It is within easy walking distance of the major department stores as well as endless other great shops and boutigues on street after street. It's also within easy walking distance of ooodles of nice restaurants, including many late-night options, and just a block from the large Opera metro stop. And although it's a toursity area, it's not as bad as some other areas of the city. As I said, the hotel is well worth a splurge. It's definitely a luxury hotel, but it's smaller and thus more intimate than some of the larger luxury hotels.

I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews. We arrived at the airport and took the rossybuss directly to the opera area which is a short walk to the hotel. It was a little disorienting when we got off the bus because the buildings are so huge and they look alike, so it took us a few minutes to spot the hotel but once we did everything was excellent. We arrived at 9:30 am and hotel clerk was able to get us in our room right away. The room was awesome! Everything was clean and new. The bathroom was all marble floor and very clean. They still have no shower curtains but there was a half glass door and I would puta towel on the floor to catch any water because the floor is very slippery when wet. There is a seperate room for the toilet which was also very clean and my parents room had a little different floor plan. There room overlooked the street and my room overlooked a small courtyard that looked down over thehotel lobby. Not much to look at but I liked being able to look at the weather so that I knew if I needed my raincoat. The weather was unseasonable cool and rainy. I purchased a metro pass, so we used the metro all the time and went everywhere with no trouble. One day we went on a day tour to Mont St Micheal which i would also highly recommend. Our vacation package included the nonstop air from chicago the hotel and breakfast everyday. The room had a minibar, coffee/tea maker with free coffee and tea but the stuff in the minibar was expensive so we set that stuff aside and put our own drinks inside. The hotel provided two free bottles of water everyday which was nice. The breakfast was excellant. They have a small variety of cereal, pastry's and scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage. A fruit pyramid and a variety of juices. We would be seated at a table and the waiter would take our drink order and then we were free to browse the food tables. We were offered free USA Today paper which was nice. I eat a very healthy diet so I was glad to see dried fruit and high fiber cereal, tea, fruit and different types of breads/muffins, I can see why some reviews may say that the breakfast is expensive at 30 Euros apiece but this was included in my vacation and we looked forward to it every morning. I probably would not have wanted it if I had to pay extra, but it was convient to meet for breakfast everymorning to discuss the days events at 7am and then head out by 8:30 to beat the crowds. If someone expects this breakfast to be like hometown buffet they will be disappointed. It is a small elegant breakfast with white linens and waiters. Kind of fancy and cute! Near the hotel there were a few cafe's and a english movie theartre. The concierge was excellant and always helped or answered all of my many questions. They spoke fairly good English. The only problem that I had at the hotel was the heating system was whisper quiet so I couldn't tell if it was running but the maintance man showed me with his laser beam thermometer that indeed it was working correctly. It just took and hour or so for the temperature to change and then I had to figure out what was comfortable for me. Phone charges and internet charges were a bit confusing, so I decided to buy the 30 minute interenet card for 10 euros at the front desk. They have two computers in the business center one has an english keyboard and the other a french keyboard. This allowed me to sign on to my email to send messages to family back home. With the time change it was best to use email so that I wouldnt wake them up with phonecalls. Our room was very quiet except when I could hear a kid run through the hallway occasionally and at 1am I could hear other guests come back after a night on the town. After 3 nights I didn't notice anything...I had settled in to the hotel and slept very good. I think I would buy a table fan to give me a little noise for the room since I use one at home I think this would have helped me sleep better the first night. The time change probably also caused my sleep problem. Also we went to bed early the first night and I disrupted the maid and she wasn't able to do the turndown service which would have helped because I discovered on the second night that she pulls the drapes closed at night with the light blocking panel which helped because there are spotlights in the courtyard until 1am which may have also helped in my sleeping problem. That was cured on night two when the maid turned down the beds and drew the curtains and put a little chocolate on my pillow. My fondest memories of hotel scribe was being greated my the hostess for breakfast every morning and on the day that we left as I was wheeling my suitcase out the door to catch the rossybus back to t he airport... I turned around and the 3 doormen/bellman were standing in a row in there uniforms. They waved at me and smiled and one of them said something like Goodbye and have a save journey, come back again. in a mixture of French and English. It was perfect....I couldn't have imagined or dreamed this trip any better and staying at Hotel Scribe make all the difference. I would love to go back again and I would definately want to stay here again. This hotel is a diamond in the rough. Everyone in Paris was friendly and would help if they could...some couldn't speak much English but most knew more English than I knew of French. I had read in a travel book that sometimes Americans may appear rude because we live a faster paced life and we expect places to open exactly at such an such time. So I made it my first priority to be patient, understanding, polite, and smiled when I entered the store or place of business. In return everyone was eager to please and some went out of there way to help us find places on my map. I never thought that I would love Paris. My daugher picked this destination for her Senior Gift because she wanted to see the Eiffel Tower. I never thought I'd ever go here but I'm sure glad we did.

This was not a big deal since it was warm in Paris and we had the air conditioning on the entire time. The only downfall we had was at around 8:00 in the morning we could hear a slight banging just on Friday morning , not on the Saturday morning. It was obviously the workers trying to complete the renovation. I will mention this renovation is basically done. Just a few finishing touches going on. Overall, we would stay here again when we return to Paris. One more thing.. the staff in the hotel were all very nice and helpful. Everyone spoke perfect English and we were always greeed with a genuine smile...", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Scribe", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197577-Reviews-Hotel_Scribe-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$380 - $691*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1 rue Scribe</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75009</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514908", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/27/32/273240da99b2db5819fc45a3842774488large.jpg"}}
