The Coliseum (about 25min walk), Vatican (20min walk) and Piazza Novona and The Pantheon (about 15min walk) are all close by and we enjoyed walking rather than catching the many 'hop on hop off' bus tours that go around the city. Piazza Farnese and Campo de Fiori are also only a 5min walk away and are a great place to stop for a drink and bite to eat after a long day sightseeing. The hotel is very close to the Trastevere area, which where we went each night for dinner. A great area with a range of bars and restaurants to choose from. I would highly recommend you visit this area on your stay. The hotel itself is very clean and tidy. The breakfast buffet was good, although we did find that it was a little understaffed considering the number of tables to be waited on and there were some delays in replenishing the buffet. My tip would be to ask for a room that looks over the courtyard. Our room faced onto the alleyway and it was quite loud up to the early hours of the morning. The noise just seems to echo in the small alleys! However, the rooms that look over the courtyard should avoid this noise completely.

It is located on a tiny syreet at the foot of the Ponte Sisto which leads you into Trastevere, a quaint old Italian cobblestone village filled with many Italian restaurants. The hotel is within a short walking distance to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, and Campo de Fiore. It is also a 1/2 hr. leisurely walk to the Vatican. Our \"superior\" room was very disappointing. Even by European standards, it was very, very small. With the queen bed, s nightstand, and a desk, there wasn't much room to move around. Closet space was minimal with a safe a 3 small drawers. I've been on cruese ships where cabins were much larger! The bathroom was adequate but large enough for one person at a time. We did have a balcony which was adjacent to other balconies on our floor- not much privacy. When my husband asked if this was the room we requested, they were very rude. Our bed was the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept in. The mattress was extra, exra firm and sat on a bed board with no box springs. Even the pillows were extra hard. My husband who prefers firm mattresses even had trouble sleeping. My biggest complaint was the housekeeping, or lack thereof. There was clean linen and towels daily but the furniture was not dusted and the floor was not vacuumed. The bathroom ws another issue. There was just one glass in the room. With 2 people i the room, I guess we were meant to share. Also this glass was not replaced or cleaned in our 8 days stay. I did find 2 glasses in the mini bar which we used. The common areas were beautiful and clean and the daily buffet breakfast was delicious. However, if we asked for a second cup of cappuccino, we were told rudely that we would have to pay for it! It felt that odd since there were many other guests with large pots of regular and yea on their tables. I never felt welcome by the hotel staff they always gave us the feeling that visitors were a nuisance. My husband speaks Italian fluently and we have been to Italy many times and we were appaled by the treatment here. This is so unike th Italians. There was a lovely bar/lounge, but the few times we were there, the place was empty and we found it quite boring. All that being said, we would not stay here again, nor recommend it to others. BTW, there is a great restaurant called \"Sergios\" just around the corner from the hotel.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shelton CT", "Title": "\u201cThank you for a wonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "allDeckedOut", "ReviewID": "UR102474518", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from Rome and want to thank the staff at the Ponte Sisto for their help.

We stayed last July after having to reschedule our postponed trip from last year, and the Ponte Sisto was gracious enough to allow us to use our prepaid deposit after a last minute cancellation, so I did want to acknowledge that. Some of the hotels were not so accomodating. We booked a two room suite (actually two separate rooms that shared a private common hallway). This was perfect for our family of 4 since we had a lot of privacy yet could open the interior doors to the rooms, I think the room numbers were 508 and 509. Our room had a very small balcony (oddly entered from the bathroom) and a nice view, while our sons room just had a window. Both rooms were very comfortable, the A/C worked great (we were there during a heat wave) and we made good use of the very big \"mini\" fridge to keep drinks cool. Also the rooms were very quiet. We loved the location and walked to Trastevere for dinner...what a great spot. In fact, we walked everywhere in Rome from the Ponte Sisto, even the Vatican. The staff was very accomodating, my husband had a craving for Granita di Caffe one afternoon and couldn't find it, so when we returned to the hotel we asked the bartender if they made it. They didn't, but he went out of his way to make it from scratch and it was much appreciated. The breakfasts were the best we had anywhere, so many choices and great scrambled eggs and bacon. I like by scrambled eggs cooked really well and one morning they were barely cooked. I guess one of the waitresses noticed my disappointment when I looked at the eggs and asked if I needed anything. I told her I liked my eggs very well done and 3 minutes later she brought out a large dish cooked just the way I like them. Speaking of breakfast, the courtyard it's served in is gorgeous. The only reason I didn't give the Hotel Ponte Sisto 5 stars is because of the price - For the two rooms we paid aboutt $600 a night which was considerably more than the rate when we originally booked forAugust of 2009. It was more than I would normally spend but we had already prepaid our entire stay so had no choice. If the prices were more reasonable I would definitely rate the Hotel Ponte Sisto 5 stars.

From the hotel, it is a short walk to Piazza Navona, Campo de\u2019 Fiore (a cozier square with a public market and restaurants), and, over the bridge, Trastevere, an historic residential area known for its restaurants and cafes. Vatican City is a bit further away, perhaps a mile, but walkable (if you like walking). Ponte Sisto's street presence is unassuming, or, to the uninitiated (like us), almost alarming: it is about a block from the river, on a narrow road/alley liberally decorated with graffiti. A short time later we realized that this describes much of Rome (at least this part of it), and these streets are well-populated and safe. Once inside, one's first impressions are quickly revised; the lobby is small but welcoming, and overlooks a beautiful courtyard. The front desk staff speaks English, which was very assuring on our first trip to Europe. The rest of the staff responded warmly to our attempts to use some hastily-learned Italian, and felt quite welcome. Our room was not overly large, but provided all the essentials and then some. There was ample closet space for our unpacked luggage, a roomy marble bath, desk with wired internet service, and one of the most comfortable king-sized(?) hotel beds we have ever enjoyed, which was most welcome after a couple of days of long walking tours. (Unfortunately, we were experimenting with traveling with iPads in lieu of a laptop, and the wired internet service did not meet our bleeding-edge needs...) The hotel provides an excellent breakfast buffet in the courtyard every morning. The buffet offered a wide selection of hot and cold choices, including eggs, sausage, bacon, cereals, fruits, etc. The tables are set with linen napkins and tablecloths, and the wait staff was helpful and courteous (and tolerant of my clumsy Italian). Our least favorite experience was the temporary loss of the single elevator serving our end of the bulding, but we did learn a few things about the hotel traversing the four flights of stairs. The breakfasts were a high point of every day, but we were especially grateful for the services of Ricardo at the front desk: when we had trouble coordinating with the operator of a motor coach tour we were scheduled for, Ricardo responded to our questions by calling the tour operator and arranging for pickup at our front door.

Rooms and public spaces were immaculately maintained, only a slightly small bedroom being the drawback (but oh, the all-marble bathroom!); service was generally very very good - breakfast was the best we've had in many a hotel, with loads of choice - and the thick walls of this old building and capacious, perfect beds meant undisturbed sleeps. The location issue in Rome is tricky as it depends *what* you want to be close to but for us this is close to perfect: 3 mins from Campo de Fiori, another 3 onwards from there to Piazza Navona or 7 more to the Pantheon. Ponte Sisto is the main bridge across to the chic borough of Trastavere, the city's real / genuine / cheaper-than-touristville nightlife area and the hotel is 50m from the bridge itself (NB on first \"taxi\" approach get your driver to approach it NOT through the windy pedestrian streets of the old ghetto, now a trendy shopping district, but round the main fast road by the river, dropping you off at the layby by actual Ponte Sisto bridge itself); Vatican City is a beautiful quiet walk along the river of under half an hour and in the opposite direction you can pass the Campodoglio and Forum and reach the Colosseum is about the same time. Lovely lovely place, far less expensive than many hotels this good in this good a location; and if you normally (like us) look for well-rated 3-star instead, this is one of those circumstances to find a few more bucks and upgrade.

I booked both of these rooms on-line, one on Orbitz and one on Expedia. These rates were half of what the hotel charges on their web-site. The double room was a fine size with a nice bathroom and a lovely view onto the courtyard. The suite was, of course, much bigger with a pull-out in one room for our son, and a king bed in the other for myself and my husband. There was also a large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub, and a large walk-in closet. My only disappointment was that there was no balcony as I had expected. As it turned out, it did not really matter. One can just go sit in that lovely courtyard. Breakfast in the courtyard was good. One tip is to order a capuccino or a caffe latte. You will not be charged extra. The coffee they give you otherwise is not very good. It was very convenient to have a bar in the hotel. Lovely to come back from dinner and be able to enjoy a cognac in the courtyard. Or to enjoy a cold drink after a day of sightseeing. The hotel is definitely child friendly. Full of families. The concierge gave us a guide with a list of things to do with kids in Rome. My son loved the children's museum. We had to go back for a second visit. Everything there is in Italian and in English. The Time Machine movie was fun also. In addition, we just happened upon an interactive exhibit of Leonardo's machines in the Palazzo della Cancelleria. We arranged a private tour of the Coliseum through Vatican Tours, recommended by the hotel. It was a ninth birthday present for our son that we all three really enjoyed. We loved the hotel's location. Last year, we stayed in the Piazza della Rotunda which was fine, but quite touristy. The beauty of the location of the Ponte Sisto is that it is near to many tourist attractions, but does not feel touristy. It is a lovely stroll up the elegant via Giulia to the bridge that leads to the Castel Sant'Angelo. From there, it is another short stroll to St. Peter's. Starting again from the hotel, it is an even shorter stroll across the Ponte Sisto to reach Trastevere. In the other direction, it is a short stroll to the Campo dei Fiori and, further along, to the Piazza Navona. In terms of nearby restaurants, we went several times to Pierluigi's which is just up the via Giulia on the Piazza dei Ricci, and also twice to Sabatini's which is on the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere.

The bathroom was all marble and very luxe, but I literally (though we decided not to take a photo of this) sat on the toilet with one foot well into the shower, the other foot on the sink, and my knee in the bidet. Seriously. When we checked in, the attendant said he was giving us a room with a lovely courtyard view. We had a balcony, but it was the roof of the building below, separated with iron railing between four rooms--and one of the balconies ran the length of the others, blocking the other three rooms from having a view of anything other than some attractive rooftops and windows. And water poured down from the rooftop onto the balcony next to ours--though there was no rain--kinda wierd.

If there was anything I was disappointed about it was the street the hotel is on - graffiti lines the walls, the cobbled street is a path of sand in places and often litter strewn about (but its not by any means unsafe or dodgy, it just needs some TLC) . But within a minutes walk along the road you're in the hustle and bustle of it all. Had the hotel been located on a better road, it was undoubtedly be pricier so not a complaint as such.

My single room while well designed was perhaps the smallest I have ever had. The hotel was clearly not full and I stayed 8 nights so they could have easily put me in a double room. There were no drawers. Suitcases had to go under the bed which was one hard mattress on a wooden frame. The bathroom was modern but not designed well so the door presented a problem. The room had one ill-placed window so it was dark. I had no chair. The courtyard is beautiful but fairly boring. No one was ever there except for breakfast. I would have preferred a roof top setting or outside bar to people watch. The courtyard would be nice if you had small kids or family staying in several rooms. I stayed in the Albergo del Senato Hotel beside the Pantheon in Dec. I liked that hotel and the that area much better.

It was also our first international trip. We selected the Hotel Ponte Sisto based on the reviews we read on TripAdvisor. Having heard some of the horror stories that travelers face in Rome hotels, we just wouldn't take a chance on booking some of the lower priced hotels with mixed reviews. We looked for a hotel where the reviews were almost 100% positive. For the most part, the reviews of the Hotel Ponte Sisto were spot on. The hotel's location is just a block from the Tiber and the Ponte Sisto bridge, which leads into Trastevere. Trastevere is loaded with restaurants, many of which are recommended on TripAdvisor and in other guide books. If you like to eat, then you won't be disappointed. As far as its location to the major sites, it's a bit off the beaten path, although we did a walking tour of the Colosseum, Pantheon, and the Forum completely on foot that originated from the hotel. Other attractions like the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish steps may require a taxi for some people. The hotel itself is clean and modern, both in the common areas and the rooms (we were in a standard room). The room itself is a bit on the small side, but that's in comparison to a standard U.S. room; we don't know how it compares to a typical room in Rome. The bathroom is beautiful, but European towels leave something to be desired (hand towels are paper thin and if you're used to using washcloths, you'll have to bring your own, as they don't offer them). Clothes storage is a bit on the limited side (only three small drawers) and they could use a few more outlets at the desk. There is a dual voltage outlet in the bathroom, but it seems to have fried my battery chargers. The A/C worked fine while we were there so sleeping was comfortable. The buffet breakfast is served in a beautiful outdoor courtyard and was certainly adequate for a good start to the day. Some other reviews have mentioned that the front desk staff is not the friendliest, but it depends on who you deal with; some are friendlier than others, and as long as you don't have any problems, this is a non-issue. If you are looking for a quality hotel near Trastevere, the Ponte Sisto is a great choice.

Some of the posters had warned of an entrance off a loud, dirty alley, but I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived in front of this lovely hotel. The alley was not different than any other in the historical district. It may get more foot traffic due to the bridge to Travestere being close by, but I still thought other areas near Pantheon were much busier and louder. We stayed in a suite with a large terrace on the 4th floor for five nights. Unfortunately, due to the colder than normal temps and rain we only used the terrace a few times. I would not pay for this room type again. We did enjoy the large room by Rome standards; it was actually a sitting room and a connecting bedroom. The bedroom had a very large closet with room for two suitcases. The bed and furnishings were ok, not as plush as I expected for over $500/nt. Bed a little hard. The bathroom was amazing though with a jucuzzi tub and beautiful green marble and gleaming fixtures. There were also robes and slippers for our use. No shower, but not a problem with the hand help shower fixture in the tub. Breakfast had a lot of options. Service was prompt. The bar area is small and we only visited it once. The front desk does a nice job and are curteous, but not overly friendly. They do their job well, they are just reserved. They made suggestions and reservations for two restaurants in the Travestere area and both were our best meals on our trip. My only complaint with the hotel and staff is when my husband's knee swelled up twice it's size (ended up needing surgery when we returned home) they would NOT give us ice to put on it. I came down to the bar late at night several times with a zip lock bag and they said they couldn't give us ice. I explained my husband's knee and they said they needed the ice for the chanpagne. I understand it is a small ice maker, but for a 4 star hotel not to give out ice (1 qt!!) or find it for us (I asked the front desk about a place to buy ice in the area and they didn't know of any) I did not think this was acceptable. BTW, ice must be hard to come by because the two markets near the hotel did not sell ice. Super location, max 5 minutes to Campo de Fiori and a few minutes more to P. Navona.

The hotel sits on the street that is the direct path to Trastavere so you get a fair amount of pedestrian traffic early into the morning.

However, do take comfy shoes as the cobbles can be quite hard on the feet. we did however catch a taxi from the colloseum to our hotel which only cost us 6 euros. some people complain that Rome is dirty and full of grafitti - well it is a working city and the grafitti does shock you a little but it is a place that has captured my heart and i cant wait to return. for all the ladies; i was quite concerned about what to wear. most people in the day wear shorts and t'shirt style tops. in the evening, the same again, alot of crop trousers and jeans and vests. however, everyone is smart looking. i did not see anyone - tourist or local dressed like scruffily. smart casual - seems to be the way.

First of all, the location is great. It's right next to the Ponte Sisto bridge so you are a two minute walk to the Trastevere area. This is a lively, fun area with lots happening, great bars, trattorias, street markets and entertainment in the evening. We walked into this area each evening and had 4 great meals - the Alle Fratte di Trastevere on Via delle Fratte di Trastevere was a favourite - excellent food and good value too. The square next to the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere has really nice bars for an early evening drink. We felt very safe and the area had a great atmosphere. We received a warm and friendly welcome from the front of house staff (all of the staff we encountered spoke very good english). Our room was on the 4th floor and was a decent size with a good bathroom (bath & shower) and overlooked the private gardens at the back of the hotel. It had French windows that opened up onto a mini balcony which caught the evening sun. A complimentary basket of fruit was most welcome and the mini-bar was the most reasonably priced bar we have EVER come across, how nice to feel you're not getting ripped off for a bottle of beer. As we said before, the location is just great. A 20 minute walk up river to the Vatican, a 15 min walk to the Colosseum and Forum and about half an hour stroll to the Trevi fountain. We got the Metro twice but only because we were a bit hot! Breakfasts are excellent. Hot and cold food available in the beautiful courtyard, bread, fruit, yoghurts, pastries, eggs, sausages and excellent coffee. Booking a taxi via the hotel to transfer to and from the airport (65 euros there and 50 back) is well worth considering as the driver will take you to the door whereas it's a bit of a trek from the station or Metro otherwise. The downside (yes, there is one) is the cost. The hotel is not cheap BUT you are paying for the location and it's second to none in my opinion.

This arrangement worked ok if all you want to use the room for is sleeping. It was really too small for anything else, even for a dresser to unload a suitcase...we just lived out of our luggage. The bathroom was nicely done in marble -- everywhere! -- but the shower was so small you could barely fit through the door. Our rooms did have nice terraces with rooftop views, although we could not use them with the rain. As with most hotel website photos, these do not represent the typical room. Candid photos by other travelers are more accurate. The hotel was clean and neat, furnished with dark wood and light pastels and always with fresh flowers - a nice touch. The front desk staff was competent and helpful and there was always someone on duty that spoke English, which helped our limited Italian. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. We were there for 5 days and did not tire of it. The hotel does not have a restaurant, which we found a bit inconvenient. The front desk will tell you that you can ask for simple amenities...like hot water to make a cup of tea, but we found that the attendant in the bar was quite rude and annoyed by our requests for a pot of hot water. After two such attempts, we gave up trying. The highlight of the hotel is the central courtyard...truly an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Rome. Unfortunately, it rained or was cool for 4 of the 5 days we were there and the courtyard was not in use. The hotel made little effort to utilize it if there was hint of rain. There is a small market/grocery just a few doors down. We booked the hotel based a combination of TripAdvisor reviews, location and direct e-mail communications with the hotel. The location worked out well. It was centrally located and allowed us to walk many places in central Rome. It was quiet at night, although one of our party could hear noise from the bar/street below.

Also you will find many good restaurants around the place - especially when you cross the bridge (ask for advise at the reception if you do not have a good tourist guide book). On the pluses side I would put also a very good quality of service and overall atmosphere of truly Italian venue - you will not feel there like being in one of those international network hotels. Rooms decorated nicely with good quality materials but without overwhelming \"luxury\" and cheap looking golden fitting. On the opportunity side I would mention lack of hotel restaurant and breakfast, which is good but nothing really special. When mentioning breakfast - you should not miss having one on the fantastic backyard (on a worm day of course).

I think it would be hard to find a better location, so central for easy access to the many sites of Rome (many within walking distance) and a couple of minutes stumbling distance to excellent restaurants in Trastevere. Another reason for selecting the hotel- I wanted adjoining rooms for two children that are now too big to share 1 family room. The layout at Ponte Sisto was perfect, the 2 rooms were on a corner and completely separate- with an extra door in the main corridor being closed to create a common joining area (a bit like a porch) for the 2 separate rooms. If felt more spacious and more of your own space than standard interconnecting rooms. The hotel was very clean and comfortable, staff were professional and quite friendly. I thought breakfast was generally very good. As you might expect, it was more European than hotels in the US/ UK/ Ireland but did do a small selection of bacon/ sausages/ scrambled eggs as well as cold meats, cereals, fruit, breads, pastries, biscuits etc. Breakfast staff were friendly and helpful, although it was a bit too busy with less choice on 1 of the 3 mornings.

Internet Hotel advertises Internet in the room, but it's old dial-up internet via the hotel switchboard. Didn't try it. Internet in the bar was a computer, that could be rented. Didn't use it. There's no way to connect your own computer to a low-cost or high-speed internet (Neither ADSL nor WLAN). Did try Mondadori near the Trevi Fountain. Their internet was down, when I was there. Found a small caf\u00e9 (Good Caff\u00e9 in via Dorothea, not far from the hotel), where you could get a coffee, beer or some wine, and a snack or two - or a meal (noon and evening) - and free WLAN access at the same time. It worked. It was a nice place with a rare atmosphere and the young people running the place were nice and very polite. Breakfeast restaurant Good. Quiet, polite and effective with a wide range of different choices for most tastes. Was included in my price. Special requests by guests seemed to be handled promptly. The hotel has no dinner restaurant. Bar was not visited. Rome had too many interesting places to visit. Distance to Forum Romanum approx. 1000 meters. To Vatican approx. 1200 meters (Via Giulia starts near the hotel) on foot. Perfect location to reach most sights inside the old city walls on foot.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4524262", "Content": "This hotel was in a fabulous location, next to the river and convenient to many attractions.

Breakfast was included for us and the selection of food was impressive: fresh fruit, cereals, yougurt, breads, cheeses, meats, pastries........and very good coffee! I loved the location. Out front is a quiet street that resembles an alley in the U.S. I liked that it felt quaint and that there were little shops along the street. Each night after the rest of our group turned in, my husband and I would walk for about 5 or 10 minutes to different restaurants where we could sit outside and have a glass of wine, usually in front of one of the many fountains in Rome. Even though we were out until midnight many nights, there were lots of other people out too and we felt very safe. I must admit that our 8 night stay was split between two hotels and the Ponte Sisto was the hands down winner. Both hotels were considered three star and cost within $10 of each other, but the Ponte Sisto seemed like a five star compared to the other!

We have never traveled to Europe before so we did not quite know what to expect.

The air conditioning in the room worked well. The grounds of the hotel were impeccable and the breakfast was good enough that we ate it everyday -- it was an Italian breakfast. We did have a few disappointments though mainly based on services provided by the staff. The first day no one cleaned our room and on the second day once again our room was not cleaned nor was a change of towels provided. We called three times and finally someone was sent to our room to clean it up. The remaining days we always returned to our room and found it cleaned up. The second item, is that there is no \"real\" consiguerre, you will be dependant on the staff at the reception desk. They unfortunately provided us with tons of misinformation. We would typically expect better of a hotel with average prices of $180.00 per night. Last item, when we booked they indicated that they had high speed Internet access in the rooms.

Don't be put off by the tiny entrance down the dark alleyway! The hotel has all 'mod cons', immaculate marble bathrooms, excellent air-con, brand-new furnishings etc, but in beautifully renovated old buildings that really make you appreciate you are in Italy, with that lovely courtyard with its palm trees and masses of flowers, and a huge roof-top sun terrace with stunning views over Rome (though no other guests seemed to know that was there!). It's well placed for walking to many of the main tourist attractions - and felt very safe for two women walking home at night, which was important to us. We loved the 20 minute walk along the Via Guilia to the Vatican. It was only 5 minutes in the evening across the river to Trastavere - though we found that a bit too 'touristy' on a Saturday evening. We had better meals at Vecchio Romano (book in advance) and in a couple of tiny trattoria in side streets near the Pantheon. The hotel reception were very helpful in suggesting where to eat. We didn't book any tours in advance, but struck lucky at St Peter's, tagging on to a free tour in the morning by Jason of Roman Odyssey Tours - young American with a degree in Theology, a passion for art, and a brilliant storyteller; he was so good we all stuck with him for the 3 hour afternoon tour of the Sistine Chapel!
