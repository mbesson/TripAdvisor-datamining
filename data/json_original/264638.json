A lot can be said about this palce, some of them good and others not so much!! I better start with the good. We arrived in Rome at 8am on a Monday morning thinking that there would be no way that our room would be ready, or that there would even be a room for us! We were so relieved to hear the woman at the check in desk say that they could put us in a room. We were able to go and freshen up (which was exactly what we wanted after 7 hours overnight in Milan airport!) The second great thing about this hotel is the location. You are about a 5 minute walk from three train stations, one of which goes to Fuminco Airport and the other two are metro stations on the blue line, or the B line. The metro is by far the easiest way to get around the city so that was great! The street which the hotel is located on is also great. There is heaps or restraunts and pizza places so you can find a meal to suit all budgets. For those who miss fast food there is also a Burger King on the corner which makes quick late night meals easy. Speaking of meals the breakfast provided is exactly what you would expect from a European two star hotel. Pastries and bread rolls with spreads and ham as well as fruit juice and a machine which makes hot drinks and hot water for teas. However there were a couple of downsides - first off there was no lift. This wasn't a major problem though. We were on the second floor and I had a massive suitcase, so I think that if I can manage this then most people can!! (I'm not known for my upper body strength!) Secondly and most majorly was the bathrooms. You couldn't really even call it a room, more of a small cupboard smaller than a single mattress. If you open the door too quickly, as we discovered when we first arrived, you will smash into the toilet. Petty much if you wanted to you can sit on the toilet and shower at the same time. That is how small the room is. Another problem we had with the bathroom, however this could have only been a problem in out room, was that the drain did ot drain very fast at all and after two minutes the water was up to your ankles. We needed to use a spare towel outside the door to stop the water flooding into our room. So there were good and bad parts to the Hotel Pyramid but the main question is would I stay there again? The short answer is yes I would. Maybe not with my parents on a nice family holiday, but if I was coming with friends who I didn't mind being in close quarters to for a week then I would return. S if you're looking for a no frills place to stay, which has an excellent location then you cannot go past the Hotel Pyramid Rome!", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCheap and cheerful\u201d", "Author": "Southwestpt", "ReviewID": "UR125252735", "Content": "A small hotel but cheap and does the job.

Usually Tripadvisor reviews can be quite harsh but this case prior poor reviews about this hotel were true. The reason we booked here was because it was cheap and Rome is not a cheap place. Location was not great. Metro station was a 10 minute walk away and not many restaurants in this area. I didn't feel safe walking around the area at night and the street it is on is filthy. We pretty much only slept in the room as we were out and about during the day. Room was quite large for the both of us. Had a balcony with a nice view of the apartments across from us.... Had a TV which was quite small, and did not have a remote. You have to pay a bond for the remote! Which I've never heard of. The bathroom was a wetroom, I could of taken a shower whilst doing my business on the toilet if I wanted. It was quite awkward having it that way. Room was extremely hot, everytime we wanted to turn the AC on we had to call reception. WIFI is chargeble here. I didn't believe my belongings were secure in this hotel. We left early one morning closed all the doors. We arrived back later that night finding our balcony door wide open. The balcony is shared with other rooms in the hotel. I would say the cleaner left the door open for fresh air but thankfully nothing was missing. After that we actually stayed in the room every morning until the cleaner finished cleaning our room before we could go sight seeing to make sure everything was secure. On our final night the porter asked us for our key when we left the building which I have never come across either. There's a heavy metal bar next door but was not that loud like previous reviews made it out to be. At least the Colosseo was a 20 minute walk away and the breakfast that was served was tasty.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundee, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI'd give this 3.5 if it were possible\u201d", "Author": "John J", "ReviewID": "UR119629044", "Content": "I'm afraid that the difference between \"Average\" and \"Very Good\" is in my view quite large and so I plumped for the former when I'd really have wanted to give it a \"Pretty good\". We stayed there for a week earlier this month, having previously stayed there as part of a package in 2005. This time we selected it ourselves and we weren't disappointed on our return. Given that Roman hotels are expensive I don;t think you could say Hotel Pyramid is exactly cheap (though they often have deals on their website which help soften the financial blow). But it has two very big pluses: cleanliness (on both our trips our rooms were spotless) and location. On the latter point it depends, of course, where you want to go and what you're looking to do. But for us Hotel Pyramid is ideal. You can walk easily in half an hour through Testaccio or up the Aventine to Circeo Massimo and the ancient centre. You're five minutes' walk from two overground stations (Ostiense and Porta San Paolo) and one underground station (Pyramid), as well as close by a major bus terminal: this means you can roll your suitcase easily from the Fumicino airport train to your hotel; you can go on day trips (Ostia Antica is exceptional); and you can get round the city quickly by Metro (Colosseo is just a few minutes from Pyramid, Termini mainline station similarly). All in all, if you're planning to use the public transport systems to see more of Rome and its environs, this place is great. The other advantage to this hotel's location is the presence of decent and affordable eating nearby. Everything from the Testaccio restaurants and some traditional Roman joints on the Aventine to sit-in diners on Via Ostiense is at your disposal. I guess the ultimate test is whether we'd go again ourselves. And, as you've guessed, the answer is definitely Yes.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA place to sleep--that is it!\u201d", "Author": "sportsshrink", "ReviewID": "UR119372779", "Content": "The Pyramid Hotel is just an average hotel. I do not spend much time in my room when travelling--I am usually out touring all day. I need a place to sleep and take a hot shower. This hotel served that purpose. It has some positive and negative features. The positive are: A comfortable bed, a hot shower and an adequate breafast. It was a basic breakfast--pastry, coffee, juice and rosette rolls. It was self serve and no limits on what you can take or consume. The negatives: The hotel is a good distance from the train station--if you follow the website walking directions, you are taken through a maze of tunnels with motorized walkways and escalators that don't work. I had a lot of luggage and this was a long tough journey. At the entrance to the Ostiense station--there is a strange tent village of street people--youth hanging around at all hours of the night--it might be a bit scary for those who aren't comfortable walking in a strange city at night. Another negative is that the hotel has no carpeting and you hear every footstep on your floor. I constantly heard chairs being push across the floor above me, doors slamming and footsteps. The rooms also have the silly system of having to conserve energy by putting your key card into a slot to power the room. I had read about this in advance. A little trick is this: I just jammed my club card from my local supermarket here in USA in the slot. I removed it in the morning and placed it back after housekeeping left. This way --my room fridge was kept running. The bathroom was a \"wet room\" There is no shower stall--just a drain in center of the bathroom and a curtain. My drain was slow so the whole floor filled with water. There is no possible way to get dressed in the bathroom--so if you are travelling with a friend--be prepared! I put my bath mat ooutside of the bathroom door--so i had a dry non slip surface to walk on when I was done showering. A few little positives--most of the staff were nice--the hotel is located near some restaurants--there is also a Carrefour supermarket close by--I would load up on wine, fruit, bottled water and cheese at the Carrefour and keep it in my fridge. They also sell sandwiches --so if you are touring you can load up and take a bite to eat with you. One quick suggestion I have is to recommend going to the town of Ostia Antica and view the archeological site there. There are basically three train stations at the Pyramid Station--The Roman metro--the suburban metro and the Ostiense train station. If you have a tourist pass or a simple one euro 75 minute ticket--you can travel 1/2 hour to Ostia Antica at the Suburban metro stop of Porto San Paolo. Once you get to Ostia--it is clearly marked and within walking distance to get to the Archeological site. It shows what a Roman town was truly like. It was the highlight of my trip.

first review i've ever written. it was so bad that i felt i had to warn people. first off, it's in a shady area. i know rome is dirty and anywhere can look sketchy, but this place is very sketchy. we were afraid to go out at night. secondly, their policy is that they are not responsible for anything being stolen from your room, and you still have to leave your hotel key at reception when you leave the hotel. they told us it was b/c the maids needed the key to get in the room. i don't know why they thought we were stupid enough to believe that they didn't have a master key, especially b/c we had maids come into our room more than once while we were sleeping and wake us up to clean (no do not disturb signs). other besides being woken up by the maid repeatedly (and we didn't sleep in late) we clearly had our key at the time. they would also skip our room for cleaning altogether b/c of this. we also did take the key with us one day. so, the receptionist was bold-faced lying. thirdly, they control the air conditioning. you have to call reception & ask for it to be turned on & then they put it on the lowest setting. on a hot summer night, expect at least 30 min before you cool down at all. we would have to take cold showers when we got home b/c we couldn't cool off in our room with the window open or with them being cheap with the air conditioning. and they would also turn off our AC for no reason and we would have to call yet again to have it turned back on & to say we never wanted it off in the first place. fourthly, be aware that like other hotels in europe, you have to insert the room card to get power in the room. so, our fridge was warm when we got there. we thought it would cool down with the power on, but it never did. when we told the front desk our fridge had a problem, they told us it didn't. so, we had to get into an argument with them over something as simple as the fact that the fridge wouldn't get cold. we lost a lot of food we bought from the grocery store b/c of this before they changed out the fridge. fifth, you have to put down a \u20ac20 deposit to use the tv remote. crazy, i know. they are REALLY after money any way that they can get it. sixth, you have to pay for the internet. you pay \u20ac1.50/hour. i paid once, but i didn't even get a full hour before i was cut off. by this time, i was so sick of dealing with all of their ineptitude and attempts at money-gouging, so we just started looking for internet cafes and really just tried to avoid being in our hotel as much as possible. seventh, the breakfast included is not a breakfast. it's hard old dinner rolls, croissants, butter, jam and coffee. that's it. don't expect meat, dairy or anything that will actually give you energy for the day. you have to go out and buy breakfast. it's definitely not worth waking up for. eighth, be aware that there is a \u20ac2/per person per night tax in rome as of july 2010 at 1,2 & 3 star hotels. so, after booking this hotel b/c it was the cheapest, it turned out not to be the cheapest b/c not all the taxes were included in the booking. we paid an extra \u20ac16 which made us REALLY know that we should have stayed anywhere else. ninth, the bathroom sucks. i'm used to wet rooms and small showers in europe. after traveling to many countries this past month, this bathroom was the worst. it was the worst b/c the shower is in the middle of the bathroom between the toilet and the sink. so, you wrap a curtain around you and that's it. there are no shelves or anything to hold your shampoo, soap, etc, so you have to reach outside the shower to get this stuff off the sink. and you have to be careful so you don't get your towel, clothes, the extra toilet paper, etc that's sitting on the sink wet. it's really a pain. tenth, it might matter to some that there is no elevator. it sucked for me b/c i had to lug 50 lbs of luggage up and down stairs. i had gotten used to doing it at other hotels, but it still sucks overall, this place really sucks. we didn't feel comfortable at any time. the dim rooms, the constant attempts to gouge for more money, the cheapness of the owners, the far commute to anything in rome, the lack of safety of belongings in our rooms, the people at reception blatantly lying, and much more just made everything about the place where we were supposed to be able to relax really unbearable. it really hindered our vacation to the point of making it very unenjoyable. save yourself the hassle and book somewhere else. it will probably be cheaper anyway once you include the tax

The shower and toilet were together in the same area without a bathtub/ stall. This made showering awkward and somewhat difficult. The floor would flood with water and we would have to wait for it to recede before opening the door. Then, the bathroom floor would be wet all night and the following morning. Additionally, the room itself was somewhat cramped. As a final complaint, the hotel is located right next to a dance club/ bar, so the sounds of loud bass reverberated through the walls all night long.

I've stayed here twice, with a third time later this year. LOCATION / COST - 5 or 6 minute walk from the Ostia / Piramide twin train stations, which are more-or-less one and the same. The metro line connects with - well, all other metro stations, but the Ostia line connects to Ostia Antica (a day out) and even to the coast/beach ! We bought weekly bus/rail tickets that are now about 16 Euros, and include travel to the seaside. Fantastic value. In the hot weather, it's also easy to get to / from the station / hotel by the very frequent buses (every 3 or 5 minutes, daytime). There is also a train line from Fiumicino airport (NOT the express to Termini) but I haven't tried that yet as previously we landed at Ciampino and got the prebookable online and very cheap, very nearby Terravision Bus to Termini, then metro to Piramide. You can't use the 16 Euro tickets for those journeys, I believe. Or a shuttle transfer is about \u00a313 British Pounds Sterling. You'll easily know when you're at the right station as there is a giant white marble pyramid and a brown castle just outside the stations. There is also quite a big bus station / interchange right next to the station. Even better. Just study the bus route numbers and times well - once you get the hnag of them, they are usually handier than the metro. The hotel was originally quite hard to find, but Google Maps and Street View now makes this easy. You can go to the top of the street on StreetView, but not down it as it's quite a narrow sidestreet that was probably not worth sending a camera van down. Don't be put off by the view of Burger King on the corner. A) It's sometimes handy after a very long day of walking. B) Kids might like it. Young kids, however, might be bored and feel confined in this hotel. Don't let the online view deter you. If you scroll a few yards left of the burger place, you'll see an upmarket ice cream / cake / coffee shop. We felt safe in this area, although it's hardly the Historical Centre. Not for \u00a335 GBP per night (for the aircon room and continental breakfast, for 2 people), which is a fantastic price that I got by shopping around ferociously. In the event, it was cheapest to book a hotel and flight (a Swiss airline, from Manchester UK, change once at Zurich for Fiumicino) together through a well-known travel company, rather than my usual Liverpool to Ciampino flight with a budget Irish airline. There was a \u00a330 rebate offer at the time, and I'll be getting an extra \u00a320 back from a cashback site. (Well, I DO have Budget Traveller as my TripAdvisor profile. The side street is quiet but the nearby main street very busy (so use the zebra crossings!). However, the hotel is double-glazed with very cold but variable aircon, turned on by Reception on request and at no charge, so no need for open windows. Having said that, the rear rooms are very quiet, looking straight onto a big quadrangle with large pots of plants.This belongs to the flats opposite, forming the very large 1st floorquadrangle. These rear rooms have heavy grating to deter thieves from, say, accessing the quadrangle then getting into your room. Don't let this worry you. The 'grille' is probably also to stop hotel guests getting OUT and relaxing on the flat dwellers' private terrace. You'll see them across the way hanging out their washing on their balconies, painting their doors etc. The flat residents never seem to use the terrace, though, and tend to stay on their own little-used balconies. Rear rooms slightly quieter than front rooms, especially if you like open windows. Did not have any probs with basement club - very, very, very faint thudding when we were in the 1st floor back room. A few people congregated outside while we sometimes ate fresh pizza slices and drank Perroni at the small and crazily cheap pizza cafe more-or-less opposite the hotel. (Cafe mainly evenings only, I think.) The people were not a problem, friendly, no fights - it's the peaceful black T-shirt kind of people. HOTEL - pictures on the hotel's website are fair. Reasonably basic and smallish (some rooms with large wetroom but some with very small wetrooms that we did NOT find a problem at all). But not as small or basic as budget Parisian hotels. I think they grade themselves as 2 star, but 2.5 or 3 would not have surprised me. Tiled floots and marble strips to the lower halves of the walls. Ceilings high - you can just about reach the aircon machine over the door to change the air direction if you stand on a chair - and I am pretty tall. Simple breakfast served in the basement. Most guests seem to be backpacking or just there for 2 or 3 days. We always stay longer. Not that many tables, say 15, but never seems to get too crowded, and no queues for tables. We were always the last out! Coffee from a machine - Italian language, so think before you push and make sure you don't overflow your cup. Trial and error gets you there. Staff pleasant and helpful. Night porter. No problems with staff. Will advise on what to see, where to go etc. Also helped us phone and get a cab back to the airport on the last day. (Not cheap for a private Merc cab. Get a shuttle?) AREA / EATING / NIGHT-TIME - this is mainly a place to sleep and travel to / from. However, it's also now a late-night trendy clubbing area. DON'T let this put you off - the bars are a few hundred yards away and are never heard, but if you like clubbing, it would be a great area to stay in. (Warning - there are various offers to get you in through the doors, and they are trickier than they seem. Read all the small print - difficult if it's Italian. Some bars are fine, some charge quite a bit for your 1st drink with food - but whether you eat one crisp or a massive snack, it costs the same. Eat nothing and it costs the same.) There is also a nearby corner pizza restaurant (not tried) and 200 metres away a small good value restaurant. (This is Rome, so don't expect real bargain basement prices.) Go right ,out of the hotel's glass door for 100 metres; right again; and it's on the next corner. Insalata Ricca. It's on Google maps, as is the Abitart trendy hotel, where you can get just a drink, or have a meal, too. We had a drink but did not try the food. Dress reasonably smart for this one, as well as for the night clubs! For a few clubs, turn right; LEFT at the first junction, then there are trendy clubs / bars. Early evening, not busy at all, friendly, food pretty good and reasonable in cost. IN SUMMARY - very happy with this hotel, as long as you don't expect to be in it all the time and don't expect TOO much from it. TIPS - get a 3-day or weekly or monthly combined bus / metro ticket. This is NOT the same as the dearer one that has a few museum entrances included. Go to the beach for the day on the train from Ostia station, right next to Piramide metro station - they interconnect. The train looks like a metro train. Some beach access is free; much is payable but you get seats, bars, food. Seek and research well, including the best train stop to use and remember trains back to Rome may get crowded as it gets later in the day ! It's the same train for Ostia Antica, the ruined town (a bit like Pompeii - surf for Ostia Antica). The little town near the train station before you get to the ruins (so it's a small diversion) is very nice with a good bar / restaurant near castle walls. Walk uphill to The Knights of Malta 'keyhole' for a great view of St Peters. On the way are a rose garden and an orange tree garden (panorama view) to rest in.

One thing you should be aware of, which the others don't seem to have mentioned, is that there is a club next to/ under the hotel which is VERY LOUD till about 3 in the morning. As we were virtually above it and didn't get much sleep on Saturday night. The club was also open on the other nights (Thurs to Friday) but o be honest we were so exhausted from all the walking around Rome that it didn't disturb us much on those occasions. The clb may have only recently opened, hence the lack of comments, but in our view it was a serious drawback: hence the lower rating. On the other hand, it was clean, the wet room was fine (despite being off putting at first glance) and the staff was - for the most part- very helpful. And as someone says you don't spend much time in the room. We add our recomendation about the nearby restaurant (right then right again): we had the best, and best value steak ever. Don't be too put off by the area: the street the hotel is in is very unattractive but the surrounds are typical city suburbs. In fact, it's worth looking around a bit rather than heading straight into the city centre. You can take a pretty short walk to the river and follow it into the centre, seeing some things most guides don't mention like the Pyramid itself, a British war cemetary adjacent the old city wall and some outlying monuments. If you do head straight in, the Metro is close by and very cheap - but also very ugly. The local graffiti artists use the carriages as their canvas and they are extremely basic inside. Also be warned when using it at rush periods: at 6 pm at the Spanish Steps station I was robbed trying to et on by two men working together, who wedged me between them and stole my wallet.

The hotel is not suitable for anybody who finds steps/stairs a problem as there are no lifts, but for any fit people (especially on a budget) the rooms are clean and adequate. The wet room which I know many people have commented on was not a problem for us - the shower was lovely and powerful and it was easy to control the heat. Yes, you should take a towel or two for yourselves (I think we all know that now!) but their thin cloths do work ok especially for children! As I had read previous reviews, we tried the restaurant around the corner from the hotel (right out of hotel, then right again - about a 1 minute walk) called the L'Insalata Ricci, which we found to be a lovely establishment with very friendly waiters and a great food selection. The menus were printed in both Italian and English, so you can make your choice in English and attempt to order in Italian if you're brave enough. I do think the waiters responded very well to our (very limited) Italian conversations, just one or two words or phrases are enough. We had very enjoyable, reasonably priced food here, I definately recommend this one. There are also several local shops in the vicinity of the hotel including some very good cake/pastry shops and others which sell reasonably priced water and other drinks and snacks.

The main sights ie the forum / colluseum are a 30 minute walk but some great sights on the way.. and if your not feeling that brave the reception can book you a guided tour.. we went on the second day.. they use a great company and the guide we had was very funny and his insider info took us to the sights further from hotel. you could have done it yourself but it did take the hassle out of it and saves time if on a short break. we found the info on here really helpful when travelling to Rome (especially the info on a wonderful little restaurant called the L'INSALATA RICCA you turn right out of the hotel to the end of the street and right again and follow your nose. the food was excellent and prices VERY good.) if we were to go back we would not hesitate to use the abc again... 1/ take your own towels the ones provided really are of no use. 2/ eat a big breakfast.. you'll need it as you are walking and on the go all day.

This was not a main holiday, it was a romantic, inexpensive trip where we went for the sights and surroundings of Rome, not to stay in the hotel for any period of time. Thanks to Tripadvisor, I chose this hotel on the basis it was clean and cheap. The hotel is three stops from the main drop off in Termini on the Metro costing a Euro each. The tube system in Rome is incredibly less complicated than the multi coloured entangled lines of our capital's tube system as there are only two lines, A or B. From the tube the hotel is approximately 5-10 minute walk from the metro down a busy main street. To dispel some of the myths about the hotel being in an unsavoury area, this is not true. Irrespective of what time of night it is there will be the odd drunk wandering in and out of the traffic, but the drunks will not hassle you as they are too busy trying to clean the cars that stop at the traffic lights. There are no visible signs of drug dealers, muggers or hoodies in this area, just people who can't afford to live slap bang in the middle of the city going about their everyday business The hotel is small but the staff, like all the workers in Rome speak English, are friendly and at the recpetion give free sight seeing maps that are the best we found in Rome. A story I cannot dispel is the towels. They are no use to man nor beast but if you are reading this review then you will do as I did and take your own. The shower is fine. It is a wet room but those reviewers who asked where do you hang your towel and clothes - over a chair just outside the bathroom door. Breakfast is pastries and rolls with jams. Coffee does come out of a machine but if you are heading out, there are one or two small establishements that serve the odd cup of coffee (Insert irony here) Rome is beautiful - Yes it has grafitti, beggars and umbrella salesman everywhere you go but expressing your anger at them once is enough to send them on. If you are thinking when to go, January is a perfect time, warm enough and no crowds. From Pyramid, if you have your walking shoes on then you can get to all of the major sights (Colloseum is only a 10-15 min walk away) The tube is so easy though that even for those less mobile, you will get all the famous sights done.

Nice breakfast, only pastries ( delicious ! ) and coffee, juice etc as in most Italian hotels, it is what we expected ( and for \u00a330 per night was excellent ) the towels did not bother us, if they dry the Italians they dry us ! Italians only have the best, its just a matter of preference. We had a smoking room as one of our party is a smoker ( no smoking anywhere inside in Italy ) The other couple in our group had a huge balcony on the front, not much to see ( residential area ) except washing on balconies but gave a flavour of Roman life which I love to see. We had a leaky toilet cystern it flooded from the top ( was fresh water ) every time it was flushed but it was repaired on the day it was reported. Staff very helpful, young and friendly except for the old chap, but he was only on once during our stay. ( he rang us a taxi that ripped us off, it was not an official white cab) I would suggest taking a travel kettle as the coffee machine in the foyer was not working, the young girl on reception gave us a spare cup too!. No lift at the hotel which some times became a drag after a long day but only three flights so not to bad ( it would be hard on the elderly or disabled ) the location was ok but a little bit of a bind as the roads were a nightmare to get to the Piramide metro but once there it was no troulble using the metro ( not as daunting as I expected...just regular Romans going about their business......not full of beggars and pickpockets ) I've have never seen traffic like it ! but a lot do give way for you to cross, just watch for the scooters that don't and whizz around the cars that have stopped ! We ate all our evening meals at Insalata Ricci round the corner ( right out of hotel then right again, 3 minutes walk ) Was excellent and always packed every night whereas other places around were empty. Plenty of Italians eating there which is a good sign, also served excellent steak ( if you like it well done make sure you tell them, Italians cook it quite rare, they think we British ruin a good steak by over cooking ) Also pizza to die for ! ultra thin base that melt in the mouth !! All of us enjoyed our choices. 4 euros for pzza 10.50 e's for steak , they charge for bread and service charge ( 4 e's ) but their focaccia bread is delicious we did not mind paying.

Out of hotel and turn right, end of the road and turn left. About 50yds up on your left is a great late-night bar, candle-lit with stunning contemporary decor and lovely staff. A little further along is a brilliant, very small local restaurant with (quite literally) pavement tables. The food was superb and staff couldn't have been nicer. At the end of the row was another, brand new modern bar and restaurant which, although expensive, was very 'cool' indeed and very popular with the young, glamorous locals.
