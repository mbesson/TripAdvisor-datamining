{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Old hotel This is an old hotel and not real close to much. The bathroom tub did not have a shower curtain or door, so you're left to use the hand-held shower and hope you don't get too much water on the floor. The breakfast that was included left a lot to be desired. Not much selection of anything to eat. There were a lot of people in the dining area and it was very crowded. We only stayed at this hotel one night and that was enough.", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR987445397", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Charlie_in_Toledo"}, {"Content": "Normal hotel Positive Points: The room was big and clean, and the bus passes every 10 minutes to go to city centre. (Bus number 14)Negative Points: The lady from the reception always speaks with no smile. It seems like she's being forced to do something. The other persons from the reception were always kind.Our room didn't have one king bed. So we ask them to change from 2 small beds to one big bed. they simply put them together with one big sheet.In the bathroom there is no curtain in tha bathtube so everytime we take a shower there was water in the floor, which is very inconvenient.Breakfast is simple. You cannot take out anything to eat outside :). There are some panflets to remind you everywhere :)Conclusion: Good relation quality/price. Only the location could be better, as it stays in a corner of the city.", "Date": "Mar 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR425256472", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "PTLisbon"}, {"Content": "Lovely The hotel is very close to the center with a good quality/price ratio.The Hotel staff is very kind.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR403863715", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Gary72London"}, {"Content": "RUDE Staff We were (group of 10) at the Columbus hotel in Aug. 07, the rooms are not too clean, and some are missing bathroom door.

Hotel was inadequately staffed to move groups through breakfast and dinner. Hotel desk had to page bartender for those needing bar service. Bartender was just fine, though. Location is not convenient to to a group that is trying to condense a lot of sightseening into a short time. The bus stop is only 5 minute walk, but the bus was often so full that the entire group could not get on the same bus. So that means waiting for the rest to arrive. I also had my only close encounter with a pick-pocket on the no. 14 bus. Crowding helps them. Breakfast and Evening meals were very uninteresting (canned peas seemed to be the only veg.)They are cutting corners everywhere. The area around the hotel does not contain any alternatives. Eat somewhere downtown. I never had a bad meal there.

We arrived to unfriendly staff immediately who did not want to help us with simple problems with the room. Our safe didnt work and the bathroom door wouldnt shut. These seemed like easily solved problems, but the staff were patronising and extremely put out by our polite request. The rooms were very basic but clean at first. We could have overlooked this if we had not experienced the rudeness of the staff. During our entire stay, the bathroom towels were not changed once and, to top it off, we found a cockroach in the bathroom one morning!Food at the hotel is poor Breakfast food is left uncovered, like ham and cheese. You are not allowed to have more than one cup of tea at breakfast without a telling off from staff! We didnt sample the lunch or dinner because we were recommended not to from our own holiday rep!Not only are the staff rude but there is a strange atmosphere around the hotel, as if you were being watched constantly as there are so few customers. Our entire group of holidaymakers felt uneasy and we stayed out of the hotel for as long as possible in the day to keep out.Overall,I would certainly not recommend the Hotel Columbus to anyone. We really enjoyed our stay in Italy.But sadly our stay in Florence was disappointing and put a downer on the rest of our fantastic holiday.The only advantage to the hotel is location. It is overlooking the River Arno and in a quiet, leafy area by the city swimming pool 5 minutes walk away. The number 14 bus is very good and stops near the hotel every 10 minutes. Florence itself is a lovely place and we would definitely revisit, but not at the Hotel Columbus!", "Date": "Aug 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR471832596", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good value and comfortable We booked into the Hotel Columbus at the last minute after checking out of a terrible so called 3 star hotel, which was situated around the corner, after just one night. The Hotel Columbus was a welcome escape, our room was of a good size, clean, comfortable and the air conditioning worked perfectly. There was a pleasant dining room, good choice at the buffet breakfasts and good, reasonably priced food at lunch and dinner times if you required it. The hotel also has a large lounge with comfortable sofas and armchairs and a nice bar leading to an outside garden terrace. The staff were friendly and helpful and after the nightmare of our original choice of hotel, it was a very welcome oasis and reasonably priced. The Hotel Columbus is situated on the banks of the river Arno, in a very leafy and attractive residential part of Florence and is about half an hours walk from the bustle of the city centre. Bus No 14 runs from a stop about 300 yards from the hotel directly to the Duomo, city centre and the station, approximately every 10-15 minutes. The last bus back from the city centre is around 1am and the fare is only one euro. Althought the hotel windows are double glazed and shuttered, the road that runs in front of the hotel is very busy so, if you are bothered by traffic noise, it would be better to ask for a room at the back or the side. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Florence in comfort and at a very reasonable price.", "Date": "Jun 16, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR985402509", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Eurofile"}, {"Content": "tr\u732bs d\u8305\u83bdue   showReview(16608485, 'full');", "Date": "May 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR577512827", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "hotel non centrale ma in una comoda posizione   showReview(11310733, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR818120865", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Zentrale Lage   showReview(11668067, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR546391306", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u951b\u64b2\u6c49\u9287\u0441\u510e\u9288\ue76c\u5157\u9359\u509a\u59de\u9287\u0443\ue196...   showReview(20348267, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 15, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR263550198", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue76c\u5137\u9289\u5ea1\u7a9b\u5a0c\u88e4\u4e9c\u9287\ue1ba\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137...   showReview(20348057, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 26, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR582375876", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d237507-r18376705-Hotel_Columbus-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "237507", "Price": "$148"}}
