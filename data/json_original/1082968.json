{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Short hike from the station, but excellent room Located right behind the Shinagawa Prince hotel, the Takanawa Keikyu sports one of the best locations in the Shinagawa area. Shingawa is an underappreciated area, with restaurants and shops and even movie theaters all within walking distance of the station. In the first floor of the hotel there is an Outback steakhouse and a Denny's style diner, Royal Host, serving meals until early in the morning. (They close for a few hours in the morning but serve western and Japanese-style breakfasts.) McDonald's is just a couple minute walk down the hill. I stayed in a large twin room with two double-sized beds, a flat-screen TV and a host of terrific amenities (including Shiseido beauty products). I ended up bringing back meals from the nearby department store (basement floor) Wing Takanawa, which features discounted eats after 8 P.M. For those of you who can't wait that long, there are western-style eateries within the next-door Prince hotels complex, a TGI Fridays in the sister hotel (Pacific Meridien, right across the street), and of course dozens of Japanese restaurants along the two streets in front of Shinagawa station. In fact, if you're adventurous and want to eat what the locals eat, then try visiting the ramen shop alley that runs under the Shinagawa Keikyu train tracks. It's noisy, but the noodles there can't be beat.All in all, a quiet room, good value for the money, and a convenient location: strongly recommended.", "Date": "Apr 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR415431191", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LyonZ"}, {"Content": "\u9289\ue042\u5157\u9288\u6052\u5115\u9289\u6825\u5137\u9287\ue0a3\u7866\u9287\u4ff1\u5020   showReview(21745154, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR261456229", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u951b\u621c\u6c49\u9287\ue1bc\u56ad\u5bee\u70b9\u4f00\u9287\ue21d\u58c7\u9287\u52e9\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0d\u501b   showReview(20362359, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR174337999", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tarepanda-a"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d1082968-r7415996-Takanawa_Keikyu_Hotel-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1082968", "Price": "$183"}}
