At the airport nobody came to pick us up, so we had to take a taxi. Once at the hotel they said they did not had any information, but strangly our reservation and the agreement to pay the price in cash they were not forgotten! (all agreements were in one mail!) Again when we were leaving they wanted extra payment for the transfer although agreed upon earlier. They claimed they had nothing on paper, so I had to dig out my mail (again couple of hours lost during a holiday). I care less about service, room size, price... but what I really can't stand is deceitful people who just treat tourists as cashcows, trying to rip them off as much as possible. There are enough hotels around Taksim and Istiklal for the same price, and even in better condition, who are honest and trustful. Afterwards I heared that all hotels offer transfer from/to Ataturk for free, certainly if you stay 13 nights! Why trying to milk every penny out of the tourists when you already got a good deal? I would recommend to avoid this hotel as they can not be trusted, and trust is the most important thing as you travel to an unknown place.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cQuite good\u201d", "Author": "ryu132", "ReviewID": "UR115979461", "Content": "Before booking for that hotel, you should now both the pros and cons. First of all, the location of the hotel is amazing. It is located on the most famous street of Turkey, namely Istiklal Street. This street lives for 7/24, it is always crowded and noisy. Sound insulation is not that good. Thus if you are a light sleeper or you need a very quite place to sleep, don't stay in here. If you want to feel the energy of that street, go and stay in that hotel. The room I stayed was really good and clean. Minibar was not functioning but that was not a big deal for me as I can find anything at any time from the street. The bathroom was also quite nice. I am not an expert on hotel prices but I know that the hotel prices in Taksim is getting higher every year. So for me the price of the hotel was reasonable. The staircases are narrow, there is no lobby, for me these things do not matter. The staff was very helpful. In sum, if you know what to expect from that hotel in advance.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cThis is an awesome hotel and we will go back there anytime!!\u201d", "Author": "Elzette", "ReviewID": "UR115601937", "Content": "My husband and I were in Istanbul for a Pshycology Conference in July and we stayed in this awesome hotel. The hotel was cosy and clean with a very nice buffet breakfast every morning. The staff were very friendly and helpfull and helped us to organise day trips. etc. It was a bit noisy in the evenings, but you are part of the busiest street in Istanbul and this makes you part of the vibe!! The hotel was very central and we walked everywhere. It is surrounded by good restaurants and shops and Istanbul is a shoppers paradise!!

It has a motel/dorm room type feel. It faces the busiest street in Istanbul so if you're unlucky enough to get a front room you will be bombarded at all hours with a lot of noise. However, if you bring ear plugs it's fine. On the plus side the breakfast is great and the staff is lovely. It's also in the heart of it. So if you're there to party and be out late and not have to travel far this is the place to be. We enjoyed our stay here because we were out seeing the sites and all the city has to offer.

Despite the fact that upon reserving this hotel I mentioned the fact that I would like a quite room, we've got a room on the second floor, facing Istiklal Cadesi, one of the noisiest and busiest streets ever. The breakfast wasn't fabulous, and the rooms weren't very clean or nice either. The carpet was dirty and the showers weren't too thoroughly cleaned.

While on first entering the hotel, I was somewhat shocked at the tiny desk which served as a reception, and was fearful for what I might find thereafter. However, the room was certainly a pleasant surprise. My husband and I booked the Excecutive suite, which if you can afford it, I would recommend above the others, as it offers you that little more room - as well as have a small kitchenette handy. However, a word of warning, the bathroom is tiny - but the shower is powerful. Breakfast is decent and is located on the first floor. The staff were very firednly and willing to help in anyway they could. The situation of the hotel is ideally practical to get wherever you need to go - and you fancy a quic walk around the shops or to get something to eat - then Istiklal Caddesi is right at your doorstep. The non-suite rooms are located at the front of the building, which offers a view of Istiklal St. but can be noisy from the crowds below. However, the larger suites are to the back of the building, which is very quiet, but your only view is a facing wall.... The choice is yours!\\ We stayed for 2 weeks, which meant that we had a free airport transfer to Ataturk Airport in a very comfortable Mecerdes van. Overall, I would be more than happy to stay here again - as it is cozy, safe and simple. The reception staff do not let just anyone wander in. The only downside is the one flight of stairs you must take to get to the lift - so it's a definite no go for anyone with any physical disabilities.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerville", "Title": "\u201cUnexciting and overpriced.

The Suite Home Hotels entrance and lobby betray the modern comfort and style of its rooms. in its price catagory it certainly it offers one of the best rooms available. The location is excellent connected by furnicular, metro, busses, dolmus(small busses), and abundant taxis. Historic areas Beyoglu, Pera and trendy Cihangir are just down the street. Istiklal itself is full of activity with shopping, restaurants, bars, dance bars, cinemas....everything in entertainment. This is where Istanbuls young congregate everyday and every weekend. DolmahBahce is a furnicular ride away and Sultanahmet and the old city is another tramride away. If it is your first trip to Istanbul and your activity only centres around The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and the Cistern then this may not be the right location for you. More Convenient would be Sultanahmet, But if you want to see the city like the residents then the location is really excellent. The rooms are modern and stylish in good taste and are very clean All the ameneties are there and better than many istanbul special class hotels costing 90 Euro. The staff are very knowlegeable and helpful, breakfast is decent. The only drawbacks to this hotel are if you are disabled (there are stairs to negotiate) or you need a very quiet hotel.

A minutes walk from Taksim square, so transport from the airport is seemless. We caught the shuttle service which costs 10 TYL and takes 35 mins.
