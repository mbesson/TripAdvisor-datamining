After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little leary and this place does have some minor drawbacks but overall I thought it was a great value. First the drawbacks: like most apartments the lighting is dim. There are a ceiling lights in the kitchen and bathroom but only table lamps in the living room and bedrooms. The internet is wired and the outlet in in the living room so bring your long ethernet cable. The TV is also in the living room (none in the bedrooms). No elevators. But for the price, I gladly can accept these minor limitations. I had a full kitchen with dining table, dishes, dishwasher, refridgerator, microwave, separate bedroom for the same price (or less) than a regular hotel room. I found the front desk staff to be very friendly (they have a workstation with printer where you can print out your boarding pass in the front office). I got a quiet nights sleep every night (and I am a light sleeper).My AC unit worked perfectly. I thought the location is great (I took a short walk over to the Orleans a few times to gamble). I probably saved more on meals by hitting the Albertson's grocery store which is close by than the entire cost of the room. The daily maid service was great - they even put my dirty dishes in the dishwasher for me. Of course, being a single guy, I only used the microwave and didn't attempt any serious cooking. Overall, I thought it was a great place to stay and would definitely check it out the next time I'm back in Vegas.

The motel is a converted apartment building, so the units all have one or two bedrooms, a living room and kitchen. There are also coin-op washers and dryers available, The pool is open every evening until 10 pm (much later than at most Las Vegas hotels). We loved our stay here! I'd like to address a couple issues raised by previous people who posted on this site: 1) Do you need a car if you stay here? The answer is absolutely \"no\". First of all, the Emerald Suites provide a free shuttle to and from the airport. We arrived at about 9:00 pm and the shuttle was there to pick us up about 15 minutes after we called - very good service. During the day there is a schedule, so you might have to leave a little earlier than you would if you were to take a taxi, but you can't beat the price - free. But what about getting over to the Strip after you arrive? No problem! You just walk across the street to the Orleans hotel (I know it's hot, but you can do it) and take the free shuttle to Bill's Gambling Hall on the Strip and/or the Gold Coast, which happens to be right across the street from the Rio (where our convention was being held). 2) This place is very well maintained. Everything was clean and orderly. The bed was comfortable and internet connection very fast (they will loan you a cable - it's not WiFi, but it's free). We got this place as part of a package deal on Priceline - it hardly cost us any more than the price of airfare alone.

I suspect this because of several things: - although the buildings are 3-story, they don't have elevators, which can be difficult for persons with mobility issues or a lot to lug around (and probably gives the housekeeping staff a good cardio workout!). I wound up on 3, but didn't mind since it meant no chance of some heavy-footed plodder above me. - the rooms aren't laid out like most \"extended-stay\" ones - they have separate bedrooms (without a phone - which can be a challenge) and large kitchens. - the finishes aren't motel-like, including the absence of drapes - or anything to hook them on (the importance of which is detailed below). That being said, my room was comfortable, with a trim-level akin to a discount chain (Red Roof, Econo-Lodge) and was waaay cheaper than the nearby Orleans (especially with their \"activity/spa\" fee and daily internet charges), where I was attending an event. There were, however, some issues that keep me from giving this facility an robust endorsement: 1) The internet service is via an ethernet(\"cat-5\") cable, instead of wireless, and while it's free, the service was maddeningly inconsistent; constant stalling, failures to load pages, and response that frequently reminded me of the wonderful days of \"dial-up\". The staff tried resetting the server, which helped once, but the second time when it got no better I was advised that \"if someone's downloading a movie it can get really slow\". Great! I wasted a LOT of time trying to just do things like check e-mail or research attractions - if you need reliable service for work-related things there's a good chance you'll be pulling on your hair after a short time. They have some cables to lend, but the one I got was in bad shape. I originally thought it might be the issue, so I got one at Big Lots (just $4). 2) The lack of drapes (just blinds on the sliding balcony door and bedroom window) lead to a big surprise when I went to bed the first night; an annoying level of light leaking into the room (from the fixtures that illuminate the sidewalks between buildings). I could face the mirrored closet door and see myself - with the lights off! Luckily I could borrow a tablecloth and clips from a vendor friend at the event to cover the blinds. 3) My unit (and others, it appeared) had a noticeable gap at the bottom of the door; this increased hallway noise and meant that the smells of pan-fried chicken and charred toast wafted into my room (with the latter giving me a start - thought it might be a fire!). Got a towel from housekeeping to put across the threshold. 4) There's a business just north of the property that appears to do metal fabrication and feels compelled to bang a lot of large metal containers around very early in the morning - it sounded like a dumpster-truck driver training class! My room was on the south side, so I only noticed it on the days I was outside early - no issue if you're not sleeping past 8AM. I have to say that everyone I encountered on the staff was very pleasant and courteous - must've had a turnover from the staff from other reviews. As for that other reviewer's complaint about hot water - I take showers that only last about 4-5 minutes, and the water was ankle-deep in the tub when I was done. If you're still covered in soap 30 MINUTES into a warm/hot shower, you've got bigger issues to worry about - like avoiding bankruptcy from budget-busting home water heating bills!

For $49.00 a night, west of the strip-closeby, we were so surprised to see it was a SUITE, with an Apartment-like feel to it. A great Kitchen, Dining room, Heater (Yeah!), TWO BIG rooms, a Super clean environment, the Bathroom was just ample enough, extra towels and blankets in the hall linen closet, and in the living room a Huge TV with delivery menus. In the morning we saw it had a pool, laundry, soda/water machines, etc and we walked across the street to \"The New Orleans Casino\" (HUGE, great restaurants, lots of choices for Casino Playing). There is plenty of parking and they told us it is $appx. $400 a week for a 2 BR. We will definintely be coming back with our whole family!!", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat VALUE!\u201d", "Author": "SoapinTrucker", "ReviewID": "UR20772062", "Content": "Full blown suites, includes stocked kitchen (no food of course, just the other stuff) , the kitchen comes with pots and pans, dishes, utensils, and coffee pot, microwave, etc!

However, the lighting in the rooms could be better and it would be helpful if the lamps were plugged into wall sockets that are activated by the light switches. The air conditioning unit made a thumping noise in the plumbing whenever we tried to cool the room down. It sounded like someone was playing bongo drums in the bathroom. The spa was warm, but the jets did not work so it was like sitting in a warm bath. The bath towels were well-worn, which is not terrible. However, it would have been nice to have more than two bath towels since most women use more than one a day (one for wrapping their hair after showering). Also, there were no 'pool' towels, so we had to ask the maids for extra towels or use the ones intended for the shower. The main doors into the buildings could use devices to stop them slamming at all hours of the night. It was very disconcerting to hear the loud banging all night long. The room had internet, but we had no idea how to use it. The front desk staff could not even tell us HOW to access the internet, so we had to find a wi-fi spot every day to log on! Oh...and on our last night, a guest ripped the fire extinguisher box completely off the wall and left it lying on the floor. When I reported it to the front desk upon check-out, she seemed pretty unconcerned. It could just be that she was young, but I would have sent someone out right away to see if any other damage was done. Paying for the full stay in advance was a little disconcerting, too. It makes it difficult to shorten the stay and find other lodging. The location was good. If they can fix some of the issues above, we would consider staying there again. If those problems aren't rectified, we would probably choose to spend a little more to get a working spa and a little more quiet.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "basketballdad", "Title": "\u201cJust what we needed\u201d", "Author": "basketballdad", "ReviewID": "UR20177784", "Content": "We were out in Las Vegas for the weekend for our son's basketball tournament and we stayed at this hotel.

Stay was very uncomfortable rooms being too far from main lobby and smoking . then we moved to emerald suites in Cameron (2 bed room suite). We 5 (4 plus one infant)family members had a very pleasant stay in emerald suites for 3 nights . We had nothing but regretting for staying in Tropicana We loved everything in this suites. rooms appeared brand new or very recently renovated. We felt as if we are the first people to stay there, as they were so clean . Kitchen is too good, we made best use of it. Free internet (LAN ) and local calls!!! above all the price we paid was very less. Many TV channels including travel channel .In brief, this was much better than the condo we now live in Cayman islands (At least we are paying double the money for last three years ) It takes only 5 minutes to be in \"STRIP\" ($2.50 bus pass valid for 24 hours, with great connectivity and frequency ). As our flight got delayed , we overstayed for 6 hours for free!!!. And free airport coach!!. all these things were not included in our pricy Tropicana rooms I strongly recommend to stay here , NOT ON THE STRIP in a big crowd", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Emerald Suites Cameron", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d526105-Reviews-Emerald_Suites_Cameron-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$62 - $133*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4777 Cameron St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89103</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "526105", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/48/ee/48ee518b28dd024fa6985a99143a285d7large.jpg"}}
