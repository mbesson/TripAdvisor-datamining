The Vdara is located on the strip itself but, unlike every other hotel, they don't have a casino of their own. Instead, they are connected to the Aria Hotel and Casino and the infamous Bellagio. Vdara was created for those who want to stay more affordably, and don't need the casinos as they are more likely there for the entertainment, attractions, etc. If you don't need the casinos, but you want to be in the center of all the strip's activity, then the Vdara is a great way to go. I stayed in the lowest class of rooms (I mentioned I travel on business, right?) and was pleasantly surprised to find that even they are set up as small apartment, including a small kitchenette with a couple of burners, microwave, and a small empty fridge (as well as one stocked with the usual fare). If you are traveling with children, or if you intend to be in Las Vegas for several + days and don't want to eat-out every day, this is a great alternative. The room itself was very comfortable, very clean (except for a stain on the sofa), and very quiet. The only reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars was because I can judge it on the rooms only - I didn't dine there, and I didn't use their spa or other facilities, so I really can't speak to them. But certainly - based on the room and it's cost - it deserves at least 4 stars. My only criticism is of the parking situation. Parking is by valet only - you can't just pull in to their garage. While the service is relatively fast and free, I wasn't expecting to have to tip the valet every time every time I got my car, and hadn't budgeted for it. It would have been nice if they could have told me that in advance. On the other hand, if you take a taxi in from the airport and don't plan on renting a car, then this won't concern you.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Nice Room\u201d", "Author": "southboundwithkids", "ReviewID": "UR127880330", "Content": "We stayed at the Vdara for our first trip ever to Las Vegas. We weren't sure what to expect, based on mixed reviews from other comments on Trip Advisor. Upon arrival we were very satisfied with our suite. We had the king-size bed option and there was a kitchenette with a table, microwave, fridge, hotplate, sink and cupboards. You need to request kitchen utensils, bowls, and plates, but that is not a big deal. There is a separation between the bed and the living room area and both have tv's so you can watch on the couch or in bed, whichever you choose. The room was kept well-supplied with fresh towels, soaps etc and after we came back from a day out it was nice that the bed was made and the bathroom tidied. We have since been back to Las Vegas and had an unfortunate stay at another hotel and we kept on comparing our stay to the Vdara in March 2011. Hands down, the Vdara won on all points and we wish we would have stayed there on our second trip. If you find the cigarette smoke of Vegas offensive, stay here. They don't have a casino and the entire building is smoke-free. We found this extremely refreshing after a long day of inhaling the gross air of all the casinos.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Luis Obispo, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat expectations... need to manage them though.\u201d", "Author": "BloominDiva", "ReviewID": "UR127873216", "Content": "Just returned from spending 4 nights at Vdara and for the most part it was a positive stay. However, I do think that managing your expectations of this 4 star property will be key to having a great stay, as in, this is not a typical high end Vegas experience. The location is part of the City Center area of the strip, but this property is not \"on the strip\" and you'll have to go through either City Center or one of the other hotels to access the strip. You would not come to this hotel, unless you were staying there. There are no restaurants, nightclubs, shopping or gaming here. And, that can be a good thing if that's what you're looking for. We took our daughter (11 years old) with us for spring break and the room was great in terms of space & layout. We were excited about the kitchen area (separate area with table, 2 chairs, micro wave, cook top, sink, cabinets & mini fridge), but that faded a bit as we realized that there was literally no kitchen amenities, like dishes, utensils and the room in the mini fridge was almost nothing. The microwave was handy however. If you call room services, they will bring you dishes, utensils, even pots and pans ~ though it will undoubtedly take a while. The pull out couch in the seating area was ridiculously uncomfortable as a bed, my daughter ended up sleeping on the couch, which was really too short for her, but still more comfortable than the pull out mattress. We had to call for bedding the first night we were there, though we checked in as three people. When housekeeping cleaned up our room the next day, they took all the bedding for the pull out. We had to call again to get the bedding back the following night and it took almost 2 hours. We were never provided with enough towels for three guests. The king size bed was super comfortable and the bedding was wonderful quality. We loved the big windows and the blackout shades at night and were very pleased with how quiet our room was in general. We were on the 23rd floor and had a really great view of Paris (Eiffel tower) and the fountains at Bellagio ~ we loved that. The bathroom is spacious and was very clean. Loved the soaking tub. The bath products were pathetic (perhaps \"green\" products) for a 4 star resort, we ended up going a buying shampoo & conditioner. There are no robes provided in the room, but a nice note saying, you can call and ask for them. REALLY? We loved the afternoon we spent at the pool, the hot pool is really wonderfully equipped with jets and is a good size, but there were no options for food or drinks - could be that it was the off season. The gym looked really great and my husband did use the machines a few times and there is a very pleasant atmosphere, as there is throughout the whole property. My husband stood in line for 20 minutes at the concierge to purchase show & exhibit tickets, and finally another concierge showed up and began helping people at the back of the line though there were people waiting in line that had been there for a really long time. Really strange. There is an attendant at the elevators who pleasantly greets you and makes sure that you have a hotel key before entering the elevator area. This was both pleasant and made us feel secure. We did order room service one night and were very pleased with how quickly the food arrived and how it was delivered and set up. The food was good. I'm assuming that the food is handled through the kitchen that serves Bar Vdara in the lobby. The person who delivered the food made a point of telling us to call after we were done eating to have room service pick everything up. We did this, no one ever came. The in room menu is adequate, not exciting, but good. The Market Place area in the lobby is crazy busy in the mornings and terribly inefficient. Don't bother ~ go to Aria across the way and find the Patisserie, you'll be much happier. For a really amazing breakfast situation, try the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan ~ gourmet buffet like you haven't had anywhere (see separate review). Vdara is very accessible to the Bellagio, Comopolitan (great places to eat) and Aria (there is a tram that runs between Bellagio, Vdara, Aria & Monte Carlo). All of these close properties have things to do, see and great dining options. Vdara is quiet and we did appreciate that atmosphere on this particular visit, though they do need to tone down the air freshener ~ it was completely overwhelming. Ultimately, I feel we received great value from this hotel, but we felt the service and room accoutrements did not meet our expectations or needs. It is a mixed bag and it almost feels like, they had really great intentions, but ran out of funds in the service & amenities department along the way. The first rule in customer service - is service. Don't make it hard, give guests what you know they need and want and you'll have happy guests. It's really pretty easy. Upon checking out, my husband did voice a few frustrations and they comped us $50 towards our in room dining, which was very appreciated.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cBest non- Vegas hotel in Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "tpackman", "ReviewID": "UR127869659", "Content": "My husband and I are not fans of Vegas so when we needed to book a hotel in Vegas we were not thrilled.

Location: off the strip,connected to the Aria and Bellagio.It takes bout 10 min walk through the Bellagio to get to the strip, or you can go through the Cosmopolitan, if you want to walk outside, and then through the gaming area of the Cosmopolitan. Not having a gaming area in the hotel was good, as was having a smoke free environment. Room: Loved the kitchenette area, and the lounge area. As others have mentioned, the kitchen area does not have any utensils, you need to call for them. It was great to be able to heat your food, or store food items in the little fridge.Comfortable bed,great having the lounge area to chill out in.Room service food was not too pricey and the presentation was good. Closer attention needs to be given to scuffed areas such as the skirting boards in the rooms, vanity surrounds in the bathrooms etc. Not in keeping with a 5 star hotel. Great having Internet access. The bathroom: spacious enough, with a good size shower, good supply of hot water. Could do with better shower pressure though.Our toilet got blocked on our last morning,quickly resolved by maintenance and housekeeping. Amenties: VERY dissappointing that there was no coffee making facilities, especially as you have a kitchenette. This means that you had to buy it in the market area downstairs or call room service and the prices were ridiculous!!!! Also very dissappointing that there was no adaptor plug available, you had to rent it!!! For a 5 star hotel, this is totally not acceptable. We were able to get an adaptor when we stayed at the Westin in down town LA.

We are a couple in our early 30's and were looking for a fun but relaxing vacation. I was nervous when I made the reservation because of all the reviews that said the customer service was terrible and the location was inconvenient, but all fears were gone within 30 seconds of arrival. The bellman was extremely cordial. We were able to check into our room at NOON and given an amazing room with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. Shout out to Seay at the front desk who was super pleasant and extremely helpful. Our room was exactly as pictured online and was immaculate. We requested cookware at time of check-in and it was brought to us in less than 30 minutes. The housekeeping manager even called to make sure it was delivered and we were satisfied. The concierge got us on the guest list for the hot clubs on the strip every night we were there. She even gave us a courtesy call and sent a text message to confirm our reservation and tell us our guest list contact person. Some reviewers mentioned housekeeping comes very late in the day (duh, it's Vegas and everyone sleeps late), but we did not find that to be the case at all. In fact, most days we had to ask her to come back because we were still asleep. Our room was always clean by the time we returned in the early evening to prepare for our nighttime activities. We are a fitness conscious couple and made use of the gym twice during our stay. We found it to be a good size for a hotel Vdara's size. We did not have to wait for a machine, all of the machines worked, there were free weights, mats, etc, and more than enough equipment to get a good workout in while on vacation. Some reviewers thought it was inadequate but I don't think you should expect Bally's Total Fitness in a hotel. There was an attendant who was very attentive and made sure the gym was clean. There were bottles of water on the machines and even cold towels for when you finished your work-out. We had two meals in the lobby cafe and both were good (breakfast was just average to be honest but the lunch items were pretty good). Some reviewers mentioned the service was slow but our food was brought to us in ~10 minutes which was awesome considering how crowded it was. The prices for the market food were comparable to standard hotel gift shop prices. We decided to save a few bucks and buy our booze and snacks from the Walgreen's in Planet Hollywood (I would highly recommend this). Honestly, if we had not had a $100 dining credit that came with our reservation we probably would have eaten somewhere else but it was fine for a quick meal. We had room service one night and it was also just average but not bad. I would stick to the sandwiches and wraps (but not the burgers) as they seem to be the best. Since I am trying to dispel all of the misconceptions about this hotel, I will also dispel the belief that the hotel is 239239293 miles from the strip. We found a walkway on Harmon between the Cosmopolitan and Aria that ends right on The Strip in front of Planet Hollywood. It took us all of 5 MINUTES! If you walk through the Bellagio (walkway attached to the Vdara) or the Aria (in the same parking circle as Vdara) it will take you 10 minutes. It's not far friends and the hotel is definitely worth it. Truth be told, when you stay in a casino hotel it takes the same amount of time (but twice the aggravation) to get to the front door once you walk from your tower and fight your way through the casino and crowds. With Vdara, getting from your room to the door is quick and seamless. The elevators are also incredibly fast All in all, I would DEFINITELY stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone. In fact, my boyfriend and I were looking at our calendars in the airport to see when we could come back...true story! Staying in a non-gaming hotel is the way to go. Check-in and check-out is a breeze, its easy to get to your room, there are no crazy long lines at the Concierge Desk, and it is a relaxing refuge from the crazy (but awesome) shenanigans of Vegas. We were able to party and relax all at the same time. The $20 resort fee was not a big deal. We made use of the internet, gym, and the 2 bottles of bottled water per day so we feel we got our monies worth.

The toilet is adjacent to the vanity and closet so you kinda have to announce that you are using the toilet! I liked not having to walk through a casino to get to my room. The valet service was very quick. We'd call down for the car and it'd be ready by the time we arrived in the lobby. The only gripe I have about housekeeping/room service is that if you actually intend to use the kitchen you have to constantly call for every little thing you may need. If you ask for knives and forks they give you exactly the amount for the guests in the room and when housekeeping comes they don't replenish whatever pots,pans,glasses, you've used. I think that since they offer a full kitchen it should at least have glasses, a pot, pan and basic utensils for a couple of days. Other than that I don't have any complaints. I visited the gym and loved the wet towels and water they gave you once you finished your workout.

As soon as I booked it and \"sealed the deal\", all I did was read negative comments: 1) walking to the Strip from Vdara requires a map and alot of walking 2) the $25 PLUS $3 resort fee is ridiculous. We brought no laptops. The fee was for 2 small bottles of water daily, a newspaper (in lobby, not even delivered) and FREE making up of the sofa bed if needed. Well, it wasn't and that fee was and is still a sore spot with me. 3) no bar in the pool area 4) entire useless kitchen, with no dishes or silverware or COFFEE MAKER (asked about it, was simply told Sorry...doesn't come in your room) You can however go down to the Market in the lobby, wait in a relatively long line each morning for a rather small $5 cup of coffee As I said, it was our 25th Anniversary. Our genuine anniversary, no BS. Even brought a copy of our marriage license. They didn't care at all. Would have thought a bottle of champagne in the room (even cheap stuff) would have been a nice touch...but NOPE....didn't matter to them. Did like the room. It was lovely. Bathroom exceptionaly clean, and the shower was delightful, despite reading otherwise about the low flow sowerhead we thought it was perfect. Would I recommend Vdara? Eh.... I wouldn't bad mouth it, but I would simply say that since I felt overcharged by the daily resort fee FOR NOTHING, and the fact that my very special day was a non-issue to them, I personally would NOT return. There are just too many other choices out there, with hotels that DON'T kill you with resort fees.....thet DO offer free breakfast buffet with room stay, as they HAVE restaurants in their facility, and do care if and when you are celebrating an occasion.

We found that when we opened up the sofa bed for our son, the entire living room was completely taken up and was no longer useable, while the standard room where my brother and sis-in-law stayed was much more spacious and had the same sofa bed with lots more room.

Speaking of the pool, I called the concierge in advance to ask about the pool being heated (I was told it was not, but it is) and to reserve a cabana. Cabanas were not available (\"not sure why, that is kinda weird\" was the response I got) and the pool closed every day at 5 PM -just when you might be back to your room to enjoy a dip in the pool or hot tub. The weather was glorious the whole week we were there. and the pool was a very popular feature-packed each day with guests, but they kicked us out at five.

A prior reviewer was correct that although the hotel is close to the strip, it takes 15+ minutes to get to the strip because there is no sidewalk and you have to complete a complex system of up and downs staires and elevators to get there-like much of Vegas. There is a convenient walkway mostly indoors to Bellagio, where the buffet is very good but the lines are excessively long and smokey. Vdara food was subpar and the one night we ordered room service, the food was mediocre to poor. The marketplace in the lobby had a wide range of quick breakfast items and was very good, but expensive.

Our check in experience at first was a bit rough - we arrived in the morning and our bags were taken immediately to storage by a nice gentleman outside and I will say, the staff was excellent outside of the first girl we met at check in. She was very surly and wouldn't give any details about a check in time prior to 3pm. We ended up at Cosmopolitan for lunch and then came back at 1:30pm and were checked in right away by a different and much more helpful staff member. The rooms are definitely the highlight of this hotel. They are very spacious, clean with neat features such as an Ipod plug to stream music through the TV and buttons for housekeeping. The bathroom was awesome - huge tub, large shower and tons of counter space. Also, the best hairdryer ever. Beds were comfy and there was lots of space for three of us and our suitcases. There is also a kitchen area which was nice for additional storage space. Overall, I loved the room itself and the hotel is very beautiful/well maintained. Now, the annoying things...it is really difficult to get to the strip. We couldn't find a convenient path, you either take the tram to Aria or Bellagio and walk all the way through or take your chances walking through Cosmopolitan. You can't really walk down the access road without risking life and limb.There is only one restaurant and it is a take-away style which is very expensive. We spent most of our meal time at Cosmopolitan where the restaurant choices were plentiful and extremely high quality (and reasonable). Also, the pool was very disappointing. It is on the 3rd floor and there is still some construction going on so the bar was closed and you had to the go to the bar on the main floor. There are way too many chairs/umbrellas which makes walking around difficult and it is just generally a small space. On Saturday, the pool was shut down mid afternoon due to high winds. Sigh.

For a new hotel it was dreadful! My daughter said it was the worst she slept on during our 6 week trip. Housekeeping did a good job and we had no noise issues. We were aware of the $20 resort fee and as we used the gym several times had no problem with it. We were also aware that the Vdara was not on the strip, and did not find the walk a problem. Our only other negative experience was at check in. I think we were unlucky and had to deal with a girl with attitude.

When we arrived at our room we had a view of the freeway. I returned to the front desk and spoke to the same girl. At first she tried to tell me she had given us an upgrade to a corner suite, I told her that was what I had booked and paid for. I told her the package included a \"view upgrade\".

Walking to the strip is a little strange because Vdara is actually elevated - you need to either go to an adjoining hotel (Aria or Bellagio) or find the elusive stairs/elevator to get down to street level - but its not a very significant challenge. There are walkways to the Bellagio and Aria is just across the driveway. While there's no restaurants in the hotel, Cosmopolitan and Aria both have a number of great options (tip: most of the Aria restaurants have a prix fixe menu before 7pm for a great price). Aria also has a much better pool, which you have access to as a guest of Vdara. That said, you are in the center of the strip and there's even a tram that can take you all the way to Monte Carlo. Inside the hotel, the rooms are spacious, with a kitchenette and a very large bathroom (with a tub and a separate shower and plenty of towels). We made use of the fitness center in the spa as well (included in the resort fee) - its not very large but has basic cardio machines, several weight machines, and a free weights area - certainly better than most hotel gyms I've seen.

The only thing I can say that was an issue was both my husband and I woke with sore backs due to the softness of the mattress. Also, the bathroom lighting is awful. Other than that, the rooms were nice and clean. IMO, this hotel gets the biggest ding due to the location. It is pretty far off the strip with no easy access to get there. You either have to trek through the Bellagio or through the Aria. I guess you could risk your life and walk on Harmon Avenue through the wizzing taxi cabs and get to the strip directly. We did it the first night but not after that. I'm just really surprised that someone would build a hotel like this without a more direct link to the strip. Perhaps they wanted people to trek through the Crystals shopping area, but when we were there, parts of it was like a ghost town....even scary quiet. The entire Crystals, Aria, Vdara, and Cosmopolitan area were very poorly designed. We tried getting to the Cosmopolitan for drinks one night and there was no easy way to get there even though it is physically right next door.

There was no coffeemaker or coffee provided like most establishments offer and the line at the lobby cafe for coffee was at least 20 min.long.

The big set of windows had black out shades or alternately just daytime shades which both went up and down automagically.

You can get all the way up to Mandalay Bay and back for free on the tram system. The other side of the strip has a tram system too but they charge a nominal fee for the day.

We were delighted with the quietness of the room as we were booked for 5 nights stay, and so excited that we couldn't hear any noise from neighbours at all. After some exploring we came back to our room looking forward to a great night's sleep as we were very tired having arrived from Australia, after going to bed at approx 11:30pm we were awoken at just after midnight with an increasingly loud throbbing bass noise, not quite believing what we were hearing and thinking this would just stop, we persevered until approx 2am when we finally rang the front desk to see if they knew what was causing the noise and asked if there was a nightclub in the hotel we didn't know about. They assured us that they didn't have a nightclub in the hotel and other guests had also made complaints so they were sending a security guy around to locate the noise. 3:00am the noise had still not ceased and had almost doubled in volume, we rang again, we were told that they were still looking for the source of the noise. My husband couldn't sleep anyway so he thought he would be helpful and go for a wander on some of the floors to see if he could locate the noise for them, but all the hallways were quiet. The noise finally ceased at 4am, after very little sleep we brought this to the attention of the front desk the following morning who were very apologetic and assured us that it would have been another guest having a party within the building and that 'those' people normally only stay 1-2 nights anyway. They gave us $50 worth of resort credits as an apology and said they would move us to another room if it happened again. Next 2 nights were quieter so we figured it was sorted and were happy. Friday night the noise started up again, once again we waited until 1:30am until we complained they promised to send security to search the floors to find the noise, nothing happened and the noise continued to rise in volume to the point where we could hear all the words to the songs, my ear plugs didn't even dull the noise. After ringing again and being told we were apparently the only guests who could hear the noise we gave up. 4am the noise finally stopped. Saturday night, same again, but this time we were so tired with no sleep we started ringing at approx 12am, they sent a security guy to our room to hear the noise, he was lovely and promised to go around the hotel to shut the noise down and assured us that they take parties in the hotel seriously and although they are happy let people go to a certain extent once someone complains they have to do something about it he stated it would take him approx 20mins to find the noise. Nothing happened and no word from security either so at 2am when the noise had increased agan in volume we rang again to be told by a different operator who answered the phone that many other people had complained and that 'yes it is just the noise from the Cosmopoliton Hotel's Nightclub again', it was the first we had heard of this! At 3am it was still loud so my husband went down to speak to the front desk and was advised that they were still trying to find the noise when he mentioned the Cosmopoliton hotel nightclub they were vague and non committal so he asked if we could move rooms but told they had none available as it was the start of spring break, at 3:30am we finally rang the front desk and security again and they admitted that it was the Cosmopoliton nightclub but the Vdara were powerless to get it shut down despite a large number of Vdara's guests complaining, 4:00am noise finally ceased. Exhausted we checked out to go to our next destination. Bitterly disappointed with our stay at Vdara it appears that the cause of the noise was the Cosmopoliton Hotel's open air night club on all the nights in question according to an admission from one of the front desk staff, and that the hotel did know this all week. Why not just be honest about the situation instead of blaming it on the poor other guests having parties when they weren't??! We had to wait until our last night to find this out, if we had've known we would have gone to another hotel after the first night. To top it off we went to book some tours only to find our credit card had hardly anything left on it, after ringing our bank we discovered Vdara hotel had taken an authorisation for over $650?? As we had pre paid all accommodation and resort fees we were stumped as to why this would be, hotel staff finally admitted that they take a very large authorisation as it is Vegas and people do tend to have parties, we asked why we weren't told this and were told we should have been advised of this when we checked in. Obviously we were not told, even though we specifically asked Zachary, the guy who checked us in, he stated 'oh we just take the credit card for incidentals and things...' every other hotel we visited were quite happy to be honest about how much they were taking as an authorisation and it was normally about $50-100 in total. To the credit of the person who checked us out on the final morning, he did go to lengths to have the authorisation released from our credit card quickly for us and kept his word so that was good. We are just an average late 30's professional couple who saved very hard and spent thousands to go for our first trip to th USA, although we made the decision to enjoy our visit to Vegas despite the lack of sleep and the hotel room and view was beautiful, next time we will not be returning to the Vdara or recommending it to anyone.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ennis, Clare, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFrom Ireland\u201d", "Author": "Niall N", "ReviewID": "UR127033689", "Content": "My wife and i stayed here and we were impressed with the hotel.

I question the 5 star rating now. That said my trip out was good arrived around 4pm. Got standard deluxe room for 3 nights at $100 per night. Checkin was fine, asked for view of fountain... Got view of city center and pool. 31st floor. Room layout not bad. Nothing fancy. Liked the soaker tub and bath layout. Couch in sitting area uncomfortable. Room does not take advantage off views. Walk is 10 minutes walking briskly from elevator via walkway and escalator to bellagio conservatory. A little spooky and coming back at night by myself. Tram to crystals. To get to aria is 5 minute walk out the lobby doors go left and follow sidewalk right inside. The gaming part was not that big of an issue still easy to get to plenty of gaming. Visited spa and staff there was very nice. 50 minute massage was worth the money. Had hair done at the salon and the stylist was good. Atmosphere was very clean and calming. Room service. Omelette and orange juice for one ended up about $40. Cold on atrival. Lady that delivered it was very nice. They do not add in gratuity which is unusual. She was very grateful that I asked. I had maid service the first day which was adequate. As I was by myself and not spending much time in room I opted not to have service next day and they had left me a message to verify. You put your service light on I'd you want it cleaned and there is nice do not disturb light also. Resort fee of $30 per night for two bottles of water, pool which was closed and Internet is high. As I checked out at 4 am it was very annoying to lay for a day I didn't feel I got to use. Biggest issue is plumbing. Toilet has low flow and flushing was issue from beginning. When I got back to room exhausted at 11 pm and had to catch flight at 6 am last thing wanted to do was have to call because toilet was stopped up which it was. I just waited and told them that morning when I checked out. They were very nonchalant about it as though it happens often and by the other reviews it probably does. Not having a restaurant was an annoyance and the little deli there closing at 8pm didn't meet my schedule when you come to room at night and want a snack.

My mother has difficulty sleeping and having a hotel that was close to but not within the craziness of Las Vegas helped. You then have a choice to see all that Las Vegas offers but then can retreat to your hotel for reprieve. The room was good. Clean and sophisticated. However, rooms of this type only have one king bed and a pullout sleeper. I had asked prior to arriving so it wasn't a surprise. If you are going to use the sleeper couch, call them for sheets and to make up the bed. Interestingly enough, the sheets and blankets used for the sleeper are not the appropriate size for the bed. It worked fine though. The bathroom was just a marvel with the great soaker tub and shower. You need it for all the walking that one does in Vegas! The one thing that is strange is that the rooms do have a small kitchenette but NOTHING in the way of cutlery, pots, kettle, plates or mugs. I did call housekeeping for a kettle. They didn't have one but did supply a pot for boiling water. I also asked for a few mugs for tea or coffee. If you want to use the kitchen, CALL them for some household utinsels. They have a small fridge for you to use and they supply 2 small bottles of water each day. Wireless internet is also available. The internet is included in the resort fee that is charged here. This fee also includes gym usage, newspapers and the water in the fridge. Although the Vdara is not directly on the strip there is a monorail to connect to other hotels and the hotel is connected to the famous Bellagio. My mother is a senior and she needed to have some quiet in the afternoon to take a bit of a breather before going out at night to see shows and such, so this was a great spot for us. I love the gym and the personnel who work there were really friendly and helpful. There is the whole gamut: elipical trainers, treadmills, weights and universal gym equipment and yoga mats and such. I used the gym every morning and it was busy. All the staff we had contact with were great. One annoyance: I had a package sent to the hotel and I have to say that the $3.00 charge to accept a package was a bit much given that we are paying for resort fees and such. Also a warning, there is a sensor on the fridge with the beverages and such. They bill you $9.00 each time the fridge is opened, so check your bill before you leave the hotel!

I had a corner suite which was like a small apartment. The overall design of the suite was very functional and user friendly with all the trimmings: Bath Robes, Full Kitchen, Separate Sitting Area, etc. Power curtains and black-out drapes completed the picture. The Vdara is connected by a short walkway to the Bellagio which is the center of the Las Vegas universe (in my opinion). MGM has very smartly connected all these venues -- City Center, Bellagio, Aria -- with either walkways or trams so you can get around without a lot of walking on the strip or using cabs. Vdara has a basic coffee shop for all three meals with groceries for your in-room kitchen if you choose to eat in or you have a family with you and want to save money eating out.

It was beautiful out mustve been about 80. In their defense, they werent kicking people out as soon as they clock struck 4. 3. Resort fee kinda sucked... 25.00 a night.

My main gripe I think is the location. If you walk through City Center you have to walk via Aria then Crystals, or via Bellagio or via the road then the Cosmo, or if you\u2019re feeling adventurous/crazy, via the non-pedestrian road bit on the side of the Cosmo (don\u2019t try this!!).

It was very clean and luxurious. On the negative side, for a hotel of this class, they need to upgrade to toilet paper that does not dissolve on contact. It was not even white but a dingy gray color and extremely thin like you would find in a cheap restaurant bathroom. The shower, although very spacious, had the shower head mounted up so high that combined with a very poor flow, made rinsing your hair difficult. It was funny that when a cab driver asked us how we liked the hotel, we mentioned the shower and he said he hears that from a lot of people. Does the hotel read these reviews??? The large windows gave an outstanding view of the city and the blinds and blackout shades lowered with the touch of a switch. Unfortunately, the blackout blind directly across from our bed was broken. We reported it on the first day but it was not fixed until after we had spent 4 nights waking up to bright light in our eyes. We were also absolutely astounded that a hotel of this caliber chose to chain their iron to the ironing board. We have never even seen this done in cheap motels. Very tacky and insulting.

Not only was it located in close proximity to the Strip, but it is one of the only smoke-free hotels around and that was important to all of us. Upon entering the lobby, we were instantly struck by the fact that the Vdara has no casino. That can be a plus or a minus for you, so take it as you will. The front desk staff were friendly and incredibly helpful. We were travelling in two couples and, though we had booked separately, Vdara was able to put us in adjacent rooms on the same floor. Bonus points! The rooms in particular are spacious by hotel standards and very well-appointed. Entering through the kitchenette, the room opens up to include a dinette area, roomy couch with a flat screen TV and an ahhhh-mazing king-sized bed. Near the bed is the ensuite equipped with a sink, major counter space and even a deep soaker tub. While most of our time was spent exploring Las Vegas, the Vdara proved to be a restful place to recharge - and in a bed that induces heavenly sleeps! It's a quiet hotel, far enough from the Strip but close enough with access through the Cosmpolitan or Bellagio hotels. Though the pool was closed for renovations, we were able to use the Aria's pools (across the rotunda) for no charge and enjoyed every minute of them. The Vdara no doubt impressed us and was a wise choise for our accommodation. Though the Vdara is a very nice hotel, I doubt we'll stay there on our next visit... and not because it's not a great hotel, but because the Strip has so many other hotels that exude far more excitement and Vegas-esque character than the Vdara.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menlo Park, CA", "Title": "\u201cLovely Rooms, Friendly Staff, Great Location, NOT SMOKEY\u201d", "Author": "ParadiseAdvice", "ReviewID": "UR126601550", "Content": "We booked a spur of the moment Las Vegas trip (yes, shocking, I know) and chose to stay at the Vdara Hotel and Spa. The hotel is located in the city center cluster amongst Avia, Cosmopolitan and right next door to Bellagio (one of our favorites) - right in the heart of the strip. We frequent LV yearly at a minimum and have stayed in a number of places, which is always part of the adventure. Our experiences have included (in order of preference) Bellagio, Venetian, Mandalay Bay, Wynn, Paris, Luxor, MGM Grand, Excaliber, and Tropicana. Vdara has two distinct advantages: 1) It is new and, 2) It is smoke free (BIG bonus). Upon arriving we found that the check-in line was a bit on the long side (never a great thing to do to people who are tired from traveling) but the check in staffer was great. We already had booked a nice room and we still received a free \"birthday\" upgrade (thanks so much!) The bell hops outside were really great and efficient both coming and going. The guy delivering bags to the room was without fun or frills or any enthusiasm whatsoever. The room itself was gorgeous, on the 40th floor, overlooking the Bellagio water feature and strip. The room had a lovely little kitchen, a good-sized refrigerator, an honor bar, sink, dishwasher and stove top, but no coffee or coffee maker - weird! The room itself was beautiful and complete with a bedroom, half wall that divided into the den/office, two large plasmas and all bordered by a wall to wall window which included power blinds and black-out curtains (touch of a button). The bathroom was large, luxurious and included a large bath, glass shower, closet, plenty of counter space, but very few amenities (only soap and shampoo). As a side-note, I'd like to add that the shampoo smells exactly like public bathroom deodorizer - funny until you wash your hair with it. The other oddity was in the fact that this place calls itself a \"spa\" but there are no bath robes or any other such pampering amenities unless you ask for them. We asked about them (asked the bell hop who brought the bags) and he pointed to the phone and told us to ask \"them\" if we wanted any robes. Hmm. The bed, pillows and sheets were lovely, and I'm really fussy about my bedding, so that's a big plus. If I pay money to stumble blindly into my room and collapse into a drunken coma on my hotel bed, I don't want to wake up with extra kinks in my neck and back in addition to my hangover! Last little bummer - nobody told us that the pool lacked a drop of water and the hot tubs weren't running either...oh well. Guess that makes them harder to review. Bottom line: Nice, nice new, greatly located, smoke-free hotel with a few kinks to work out.

Either way, the rooms are very nice and the beds are spectacularly comfortable. Both the Aria and the Cosmopolitan are very close but I suggest before you go out, you speak to the concierge and get your bearings and directions straight because you can spend alot of time walking if you dont know how to get to and from the different hotels.

It's a few blocks from the strip (behind the Cosmopolitan), but close enough where everything is nearby. There's a tram/connector to the Bellagio, which helps you get access to everything else. If you don't mind walking 10 mins to Las Vegas Blvd, it's great! It's not your typical Vegas lobby..the minute you walk into the hotel, you realize that you are in a different venue. The simple, quiet lobby excudes cleanliness with a touch of urban chic. The market/deli - also located in the lobby area, offers organic food that is delicious and fresh. The staff - from the bellperson to the night doorman - is courteous, professional, and makes you feel welcome from the beginning. They truly appreciate you staying there. The room we had was a mini-suite, with a kitchen area, living room/sleeping area, and separate bathroom area. My good friend and I traveled together, and it was nice to have plently of room to spread out. We felt like we were in an apartment in Manhattan. The view was amazing, and offered different shades to allow one to enjoy Vegas skyline. The rooms each have a doorbell, and buttons to indicate whether or not you want housekeeping service. I accidentally left ours on, and did not receive service one day. Ah well! A few things that I was surprised about...my friend and I wanted separate beds, but they indicated that the entire hotel only offers a King and a pullout couch. Personally, I did not like that one of us had to sleep on a pullout couch, and that 2 beds were not an option...but my friend said it was fine to sleep on. The pool area was not open, but I was able to use Aria's pool area....about a 10 minute walk next store. It's a wonderful area with great bar service as well. We went to the spa, all excited for a Vegas spa experience. It was wonderful and relaxing, with a hottub/showers/heated lounge chairs/aveda products to use, etc. Meditaton lounges are available to use too, so one can take a nap right after a massage. It was marvelous. We both realized afterward that we could hear a lot going on in other rooms/outside our doors during our massage...not something that you shell out decent money for a \"spa experience.\" That was disappointing. We called the spa a few hours later, and they apologized and welcomed us back the next day to use the spa area as much as we want. When I went back the next day, they knew who I was immediately and welcomed me with open arms.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glendale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay\u201d", "Author": "Michael W", "ReviewID": "UR126257580", "Content": "Vdara is a gem, especially if you like to get away from the casinos and the smoking.

The same guy wouldn't let my boyfriend leave the car, so without offering to help, I dragged both of our backpacks into the reception. At the reception, there was no line and I was served straight away to a lovely gentleman who checked me in quickly. I was soon on my way up to my room and was delighted with the view (I specifically asked for a high room with views of the Bellagio fountains prior to arrival. tick). The room had a small kitchen (you need to request utensils etc) and 2 fridges which I thought was good one was full of mini bar goods (which are automatically charged to your room when you remove them) and the other fridge empty which was useful as we bought drinks, salads etc from Walgreens & ABC which was much cheaper than room service/the deli downstairs. The automatic blinds/shade was automatic but I was a bit disappointed at the amount of light that shone through the gaps in the morning. I expected them to completely shut out the light, but it wasn't the case. My fault for staying out all night I guess! The bathroom had a lovely big tub which I thought was great. Nice and deep. The shower was good too. The bedroom had 2 TV's, one facing the lounge, the other in the bedroom. The internet was quick (and should be for the resort fee - $25 a day, crazy). Room service was very slow and ridiculously expensive (as expected) but we got $100 credit included in our package so we used it. My boyfriend ordered a hamburger which he thought was OK and I ordered some breakfast. I liked how the toast was made fresh in the room. The deli downstairs was lovely and fresh (and expensive) but it is convenient. As mentioned above, stock up with water/softdrinks/snacks/alcohol from Walgreens or ABC to have in your room. Check out was quick, no line. You can actually call reception and make an appointment to check out so perhaps thats a better idea if you are on a tight schedule, from other reviews the reception line can get long but over 4 nights, we never saw it too busy. The walk to the strip is accessible through the Bellagio & so too is the monorail. Overall I was happy with the room and would recommend it.

Vegas is big so we accepted you have to walk to get to places. Comfy shoes are essential in the day. We didn't have a problem with all the walking to different hotels as we felt we needed to after all the food we ate. The Vdara is connected by a walkway to The Bellagio and we enjoyed walking through to get to the strip. We actually felt this hotel was an excellent location. One small word if warning for us Brits. There are no tea/coffee facilities in the room and you need to ask the lobby for cups, plates, cutlery and pans etc. Upon request they delivered the items within 5 mins.

With my MLife membership, I was able to swing a rate at Vdara that made it competitive with other upscale hotels. You can't deny that the building is amazing and flat out exquisite in various aspects. There's something about the shape that sets it apart from the rest (except for Aria, of course). Yet, I can't help but think that, someone, at some point, ruined Vdara for everyone. By this I mean that there are certain things about the guest rooms that are flat out quirky. Kitchenette? Great, until you realize that all the drawers and cabinets are empty. No silverware, no dishes, no cookware. Nothing. Clothes iron? Tethered to the ironing board. Coffee maker? None. To understand where I'm coming from, you have to compare Vdara to Palms Place. I would consider these to be equivalent properties, but the edge goes to Palms Place which has fully stocked kitchenettes, doesn't tether the clothes iron to the board, and provides a coffee maker. It's like a movie with a really impressive trailer, but when you pay $10 to see the movie in the theater, everything from the trailer happens in the first 10 minutes and the rest is fluff. That's what Vdara is to me. Big lure, followed by fluff. Yes, it looks nice, the beds are pretty good, and you're in CityCenter, but you might as well have stayed at Aria because you don't really gain anything by picking Vdara. That's it.

That they are smoke-free and have no casino was a plus for us too, because we wanted a quiet hotel. Unfortunately our stay was very disappointing so we will stay at another hotel next time (there are so many!). First of all. The pool is under construction so it can be very noisy. They don't tell you that when you book or check in. We thought the pool is in repair and ready for a swim the next day. But after asking we found out that the pool is under construction for the next months. So, no pool in the hotel. For what I am I paying 30USD resort fee??? Rooms: - nice new room with big windows - view of interstate (but was ok for us) - construction noise the whole day - thin walls so you hear your neighbors (our neighbors partied the whole night like crazy) - although it is a new hotel the walls in our room were run down and in the bathroom the ceiling was half ripped off but never repaired - nice bathroom, but no water pressure in shower - they have a kitchen in every room but no dishes, coffee maker or anything....you need to order it - there was a table lamp at the bed side but you had to turn on/off the light from the living room, not when lying in bed which is very inconvenient (and yes we've asked because we thought it can't be true, but it was in our room) - window shades have a gap between them so light is still coming in - check out time is already at 11AM (no late check outs) Location: - very annoying, you need to take the air train or walk quiet a while (THROUGH the casinos) until you get to the strip (and it's not a pleasant walk and you get confused where to go because there are almost no signs) Service: We travel a lot all over the US (for business but also for pleasure) and stayed in many different hotels from 3 stars to 5 stars luxury. Even Motel 6 has nicer, more helpful and better service than this hotel. The font desk is very uninformed. The hotel was not fully booked on a weekend. Now we know why. What we didn't like about the front desk: - you wait in the check-in line forever (same with the concierge, maybe one person is not enough?) - asked for a a quiet room far away from the elevator or ice machine and the front desk gave us the room right next to the ice machine (which was located at the wall to our bed). - asked for an explanation of our room rate and fees and got 3 different answers from front desk - front desk seemed like robots. Their answers came right out of a hotel handbook. Their answers are standard and sometimes they don't give an answer to the question at all. - front desk was very rude when we asked for a late check-out. When I politely said that other hotels have no problem with late check outs (especially when they are not fully booked) she just snapped: \"Well, that's your bad luck then, we don't do it.\" - no apology for the noise from construction of the pool when we asked about it. Very rude. - no self-parking, only valet Value: - When you see the hotel prices you think 179USD is quiet cheap, but in fact it's not. You end up paying 250USD with the taxes, fees and the resort fee. You have to pay for every little thing. We will not stay in this hotel again. Customer service is very important to us and this hotel treated us not very friendly and helpful. Never experienced such a rude and uninformed front desk. They have to train their stuff much better. And this is for you, Mr PR of Vdara Hotel. I saw that you commented on most of the reviews which is a good thing. But you only write the same answers to everyone (I guess a simple standard answer a la \"copy and paste\") and you don't take the time to address the issues people had. I think that is even worse than not commenting on a review. It just shows that you don't care about the problems but only about to get more people in the hotel. Good customer service does not use standard answers, they apologize and care about their guests. Even if you tell me now that that I should come back. NO, thank you. We will not. Much better choices in las Vegas. It's always the same answer: \"Thank you for taking the time to write a review regarding your recent visit to Vdara Hotel & Spa.

Upon arriving we were greeted at the airport by Allen, our hotel-appointed limo driver who had already found and pulled our luggage off the carousel. Major points. Once at the hotel and checked in, the bell hop Kimberly took us to our room. She was very nice and personable. Our room had a couple issues. One of the shades was stuck and slightly crooked, the downstairs TV wasn't working and the upstairs bathroom door lock was loose. We called downstairs and they had us switch rooms. They gave us a better suite with a panoramic view! Along with switching us to this room they also sent Harris, the technician, to make sure everything was perfect. Harris was a great guy and so nice. He really went the extra mile, all with a smile and I loved the way he spoke with ownership and pride of the hotel. More points. A couple days in to our trip I was downstairs meeting up with a guest who was just arriving and Kimberly noticed me and asked how I was doing. She remembered my name and asked how my wife and toddler were. Extra Points. We loved the view and the location and appreciated that it was a non-smoking facility. The bathtub on the lower floor was situated right next to the huge open window of the most gorgeous view imaginable. I'm a shower guy and I took a bath every day I was there. I added a photo of it. Right across the street at Aria the casino is world class and also smells great. A short hallway takes you to the Bellagio so finding a nice place to gamble is no biggie. Want $5 blackjack? Across the street from Bellagio, Bill's Gambling Hall has it. The lobby at Vdara smells better than any other hotel I've stayed in and you can buy the scent on sticks to take home and make your house smell the same way. We bought two packs of them and will buy more in the future. If you are planning on having someone with you who will be taking the pull-out couch, they would be better off leaving the couch in it's normal functioning status. The pull-out bed felt like a sheet over bare springs so I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. The beds in the rooms were awesome though and very comfortable. Overall, we loved Vdara so much we were sad to leave. I smile thinking back at the memories I will have and it is easy to say that the view, the smell, and location/amenities, etc.. will be the things you remember about a place, but when Vdara has this in spades and one of your fondest memories will also be of members of their staff, that says something. We highly recommend Vdara for your next stay in Vegas.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel & Wonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "internationalworld", "ReviewID": "UR126069291", "Content": "Had an amazing weekend here with my girlfriends.

I got an email offer from them for around $125 a night. When deciding on this hotel I chose it because of the no smoking feature because after a night of smoky casinos and restaurants it is nice to come back to smoke-free sleeping. Vdara does pull this off quite well. The smell and coziness of this hotel are very good. The rooms are nice, but nothing that special considering you are in Las Vegas. The bed was large and soft, but totally ruined by the cheap paper sheets and worthless comforter you are given. They change your sheets only if you ask. Rooms have dark colors, wood grains, and a lot of glass which makes them look sharp but they do not have enough worthwhile employees to handle keeping them clean. The only problems with my room were the paper sheets, large amount of dust, and the decision this hotel made to charge you mega bucks for coffee at their mediocre deli rather than supply it in your room. No coffee in a four star resort is a travesty. With those minor issues alone I would have given it a rating of four, but it gets a poor rating for its staff and the managements lack of caring when something goes, in my case, very wrong. First, you wait in line forever when you get there. Second, I asked for a view and got a breathtaking view of Interstate 15. After waiting in line forever, I mean forever, and for me it was 10:00 pm and it took an hour to get my taxi paid to inside my room. I don't use credit cards, I hate them, I brought cash and a debit Mastercard to Las Vegas. After the deposit I initially paid, they charged me a $250 hold on my debit card simply for not having a credit card. I asked her to run it as a credit and she said she could not. They can when I order a pizza in Las Vegas, but not at this new super snazzy hotel. I was fine with the hold since I was going to pay for the hotel anyway, but after I left the desk, she ran another $812 hold on my card. I got a fraud notification from my bank asking me if I was in Las Vegas and just spent $1000 dollars plus at the Vdara, and I said, uh, no I just checked in but it was only $250 but he informed me they just received another transaction for the $812. After I blew a gasket and cleared all the smoke that came out of my ears, since it is smoke free afterall, I called down and was treated like a child. They told me it was an \"accident\" and they could not take care of it now since their bank was closed. I asked for a manager to meet me at the front desk and they said for me to ask for Austin. When I got down to the long lines of check-in, I had to wait in line again, being told when I went to the front to see the manager that \"they would be right out, please remain in line.\" When I got to the front of the line I spoke with a lady (Anleese maybe) and I told her I was to speak with Austin about an issue and she told me Austin went home and she would take care of me. I said, okay, and she arrogantly cut me off and asked me if that would be okay if she handled the issue. I said yes and explained the entire problem to her and she told me that it was an unfortuante mistake and she would try to take care of it but it would take some time. I went back upstairs to my furious wife, who was embarassed and upset with me over all this happening, all that was going on. The manager called up and said her bank and my bank were closed and she would have the next manager coming on in the moring take it off my account. She ended with, it may take up to five business days for it to be completely off. I needed a drink and hit the strip. Friday came, it never came of my account. Saturday, still there and Sunday too. I called my bank that Friday afternoon and they said no one marked in the notes that anyone from Vdara called and that transaction would be on my account until they, Vdara, took it off. They told me they should have been able to void the transaction immediately after they did it, but of course they did not. Vdara never called my bank the next morning, as I was assured, and never after it was brought to managements attention or for the four remaining days I was at their hotel. They never checked with me to see if the matter was resolved. Luckily, my fun money was cash, and Vdara could never take that from me. When I checked out, the same employee who made the mistake would be taking care of me again. I don't fault her, she was always sympathetic to me and there is a reason they are called accidents, they are accidental after all. She asked me how my stay was and I said not very good considering all these holds on my account. She apologized again and read me a note on my account that someone wrote that it would be taken care of on Friday. I pulled my phone out and showed her on Monday morning that it was never taken care of. She asked for my card to pay the remaining balance on my room and I laughed. I asked her \"What would you do if you were me?\" She knew. I did pay for my hotel, turned around and left, knowing I will never, ever, be back to that place again. Other things you should not forget: *Resort fees and the taxes on those fees charged me an extra $110 on my hotel. *You are carded every time you go to and from your room by some guy that works there. Nothing more annoying than stopping, getting out your room key when you are just walking through a lobby.

We chose this hotel as there were no casinos and it was a non-smoking hotel. After staying at the hotel although we loved the room I personally would prefer to stay in busier hotel but I'm sure people would book this purely to be away from the hustle and bustle of the gaming rooms. Check in was easy and had no problems with anything on the bill, there is a resort fee but we paid this before we left the UK. The hotel is new and has a lovely smell when you walk in, you can buy the scent sticks there. The rooms are decorated well and the bed is very comfortable, so much so after our flight from the UK and jet lag we crashed out for 12 hours and missed most of Saturday night. We would have gone out if we had not had to be ready for pick up for a helicopter ride at 5.00am - well worth it with Maverick helicopters. There is a kitchen area but you have to ask for the basics of cutlery, plates and glasses so we never bothered eating in. they try to sell it that they can arrange in room dining. We had a room on the 50th floor looking over the Luxor and down towards Mandalay Bay/The Hotel but since found out you can get rooms overlooking the Bellagio which we wished we had requested. Unfortunately the Pool area was not in use as the beginning of the season so could not use but were told we could use the pool in the Aria next door but never got the chance. Again due to time we never got to use the Spa so cannot give a review on this. My only complaint was on 2 occassions we had knocks on the door from maintenance of which we had not requested, I put this down to there being so many floors and they got the wrong floor. In all this is a quite, contemporary hotel, away from the main strip. It is a little difficult to locate and we found it easier to go through the walkway to the Bellagio. My advice to anyone new to Las Vegas, good walking shoes, plan ahead with shows (if not use Tix4tongiht kiosks for cheaper) and where you are going to eat.

The cafe downstairs is a wonderful little place to eat, kind of expensive, but I've noticed that most places on the strip now are getting very expensive to eat at. We did not have any trouble with customer service. We found everything efficient, and everyone friendly. The rooms were spotless, and the beds so amazingly comfortable (I think one of the most comfy beds I have ever been in). I loved the weight room. It had just the right amount of equipment (treadmills, ellipticals, free weights, weight machines, skip ropes, you name it) and it was never busy. The Vdara pool was shut down for maintenance when we were there, so we had access to Aria's pool which was superb as well. Overall, we love the Vdara because it is a nonsmoking facility (so you have no rooms that smell like smoke even though they are suppose to be nonsmoking), and there is no casino, which makes it into a nice little get away. Aria is a 2 minute walk away, or there is a walkway that connects you to the Bellagio (also only a 2 minute walk).

We booked 4 months in advance, choosing a Panoramic Suite. As experienced travellers we knew the right questions to ask. We made sure our \"unobstructed\" view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip was guaranteed. Well...upon a late arrival, after 10 pm due to a 6 hour flight delay, we were tired and ready to crash. Not so fast...our room had an awesome view...of the back of the hotel, the parking lot, and the freeway. We called down to the front desk and got very little sympathy. At one point we asked if we could cancel the reservation in the morning. We were told \"do what ever you want.\" So...went to front desk to talk to a manager. Actually got some sort of assistant who was helpful. She changed us to a \"view\" room. An obstructed view that really required some imagination to see anything but the back of the Cosmo. Back to the desk. This time she actually took me to two more rooms with partial views. I said the reason I booked four months ago was so I would not have these kinds of issues. She then said she could show me a Penthouse suite...as an upgrade. OK. Of course the Penthouse was awesome. On the 56th floor with a commanding view of fountains/strip. \"Only $50 more per night.\" Since we were staying 5 nights we wanted the better room but thought they should be more accommodating considering it was almost midnight by now. We settled on $25 more per night with waiving of 3 nights \"resort fees.\" (Don't get me started on THAT subject,) They also gave us a $50 resort credit and a few drink coupons. So we got settled in and were pretty happy for the duration of our stay. The hotel didn't tell us we had some additional benefits that go with the Penthouse suite...airport limo ride and private check out desk to name two. Housekeeping was good. We also called ahead of time to request a coffee maker, dishes, and pans be put in the room. So we had to get all that stuff delivered to the new room. Not sure we would stay at the Vdara again. No casino...which is good and bad. Also they pump in a sickly sweet perfume into the lobby air. But good location and the room was very nice and clean. Bed was great and main bath was well appointed. Water pressure in the shower was a little weak. Also the blackout shades have a gap where two sections meet...which lets in light. WiFi worked fine...three TVs...large living room area with the spectaculat view of course. Oh and we got to meet some nice members of the security staff at 3:30 am one morning when the couple next store got into a knock down drag out brawl...in Italian.

This was my 3rd stay at Vdara. The first two visits (04/2011 and 11/2011) were great; I was mesmerized by the prototypical Vegas over-the-top facility, the suites themselves and the view! And given the fact that Vdara would send me a promotional e-mail almost every week, they succeeded in enticing me to return in 02/2012. So what went wrong this time? For my first two trips I'd booked a deluxe view suite; no complaints with the room itself. This time I thought I'd splurge a little by booking a corner suite. I arrived at the hotel at 2p.m. The line at check-in wasn't too long, but when it was my turn, I was told the only clean room they had was on the 6th floor facing the garage, and the receptionist Kalli offered to upgrade me to an executive corner suite but it'd cost me $100+tax. I was incredulous that this 56-floor hotel had only one clean corner suite, to which she replied it was because all the other ones were dirty. I told her I wasn't going to pay an extra $100 because their cleaning staff had only cleaned ONE room by 2p.m., so I offered to wait. She told me come back at 4p.m. Mind you, I was also in the midst of a bad cold, but I've got my principles, so I came back at 4p.m. as told. I had to tell my story to a different receptionist, Sevy, who said the room was still dirty. He offered to give me $75 for food. I knew Vdara didn't even have a restaurant, and there was no way I was going to spend $75 on over-priced coffee (costs $5 a cup there) at their deli, so I asked if he could apply the credit towards the mandatory \u201cresort fees,\u201d and he did. He again offered me the executive corner suite at $100. By then I was getting fed up, so I asked him what the difference was. He said it's an extra half bathroom. I said I was traveling by myself so there's no need for me to pay $100 for a bathroom I wasn't going to use. He said there was nothing more he could do. So, with no room to go up to, he told me to come back at 5p.m. and said the room should most likely be ready by then. I came back at 5p.m., feeling chills and having a migraine from my cold, and lo and behold the room was still dirty! Sevy was nowhere to be found, so I had to deal with a 3rd receptionist, Debra, who frigidly said there was nothing she could do about housekeeping, and told me to come back at 6:30p.m.! That's FOUR AND A HALF hours after I had already checked in! But she assured me that she'd be here till 10p.m. and I wouldn't have to deal with anyone else. Alas, I said on a wooden bench right across from the receptionist desk because I really had nowhere else to go, and I saw her disappear into the back room after 6p.m. and I never saw her again. At 6:15p.m., I looked out the doors and it was already dark outside, I thought this was getting ridiculous, plus I was beginning to spike a fever and I really needed a bed, so I dragged myself back to the check-in area and talked to a 4th receptionist, Abraham. He heard my story, and I could see on his screen that the room was still listed in red (dirty), and he immediately went to the back room. He came back five minutes after and said the reason the room was perpetually \u201cdirty\u201d was because maintenance had to fix something in the room. He apologized and offered to upgrade me to that executive corner suite without charge. Truth be told, I was feeling so sick and tired he could've sent me to the morgue then and I would've slept there. So, at 6:45p.m., almost five hours after I checked in, I was handed a key to my hotel suite. I thought to myself, \u201cWhy did receptionist number 1, 2 or 3 not communicate with housekeeping/maintenance to find out what the 4th receptionist was able to do within 5 minutes?\u201d Because of the above, I was forced to wander around in a limbo for 3 hours then sat on a wooden bench across from the check-in area for almost an hour and a half, and I couldn't make any plans for anything because I didn't even have a room. But the story doesn't end here. I went to the suite. There was a beautiful kitchen with a coffee maker and Bosch appliances. But no cup. I wanted to heat up some water to take my medicine, but their fancy coffee maker wouldn't just boil water without their little coffee cup, and I didn't want coffee. I just needed hot water, so I dragged myself down to the deli to ask for a cup. The cashier looked at me and said, \u201cI can't give you a cup. I was told not to give out any cups.\u201d I explained to her that I needed to heat up some water in the microwave and the only thing they had was glass, which would break in the microwave. By now it's a recurrent theme amongst the Vdara staff when I heard the cashier reply, \u201cSorry, there's nothing I can do. You can either call maintenance for cups, or I can give you a plastic cup.\u201d Yep, that was what she said verbatim. I'm only sorry I didn't see her name tag because by then I was getting absolutely fed up. The guy who stood next to me in line shook his head. I was spiking a fever, my head was throbbing and I couldn't even get a paper cup in a hotel where I had paid to stay. I replied, \u201cI'll just buy an empty cup from you then! I need hot drinkable water.\u201d She still wouldn't give it to me, but instead called her manager on the phone. She eventually RELUCTANTLY handed me a paper cup. Is this vacation or have I enrolled myself in a refugee camp? After that day I tried to enjoy my vacation by staying as far away as possible from the Vdara staff. I did use the concierge once for dinner recommendations. She just basically printed out copies of restaurant menus at Aria, Vdara's sister hotel, and Crystals, their fancy City Center shopping mall. But at least she didn't say there was nothing she could do. On my last day, after I checked out at 11a.m. (the designated check-out time without paying an extra fee), I had five and a half hours to kill before my flight, so the receptionist told me the bell desk could store my bags in the meantime. I went up to Randy, who looked at me coldly and said he could only store one bag because my other bag was a shopping bag and he couldn't store any bag that was \u201copen.\u201d Actually, I had my small backpack and a pair of shoes in another bag within the big shopping bag, so I asked if he could store those two bags for me because they were not open. He agreed, but I asked him what I should do with my big empty shopping bag. He looked at me and the shopping bag and said, \u201cWell, you better hold onto it then. Rules are rules.\u201d I was distraught by his utterly unprofessional and demeaning response, didn't really know how to react and just quietly walked away. I walked around in disbelief for five minutes, decided that one could catch more flies with honey than vinegar, and walked back to the valet area and handed him $2. Suddenly, he broke into a smile (or a grimace, I really couldn't tell nor care at that point), and said, \u201cOh, let me store that bag with your stuff then.\u201d So with $2 those rules suddenly didn't apply? Are you really that cheap you can be bought for $2? And without the $2 I was a secondary citizen to you even though I had just stayed four nights at your hotel? I am absolutely appalled by the professionally incompetent, morally dubious, apathetic and socially uncouth behavior that I encountered with the Vdara staff. Don't get me wrong. The facility is gorgeous. It's actually a failed luxury condo project as locals have told me, so that's why every room is a \u201csuite\u201d because they were meant to be sold as luxury condos before the real estate market crashed. I really would like to give a better review for Vdara because it is just one of these beautiful places you have to see for yourself, but the whole Vdara staff just systematically ruined my vacation for me. I'm also beginning to realize that the first two times my stays at Vdara were uneventful because I never had to deal with the staff.

We asked for a room as high as possible, and the staff accommodated, giving us a suite on the 51st floor. There are two banks of elevators much like there are in large office buildings, so we never had to wait very long to ascend. If you don't upgrade to a larger suite, you'll enter your room into a small kitchen featuring a mini-bar beside a fridge for guest use, a sink with a garburator, induction hot-plate and convection microwave. The room was clean and all the furnishings seemed new. The bed was very comfortable. The only hang-up, so to speak, was that the phone on the desk of our room did not work. There were two other phones in the room, one in the bathroom and the other on the bedside table, so we decided not to raise the issue with the front desk. All other appliances and electronics worked well, including the electronic window shades and blinds. The bathroom was large and functional, with shampoo, conditioner and body wash replaced daily. Service was, for the most part, good. After being out late one night, the lock on our door wouldn't work. After consulting with the front desk, security was sent up and the electronic lock on our door was reset. The whole ordeal took only 20 minutes to rectify. We would have made greater use of the concierge desk, but there was always a long line, so we usually went to the bell desk. They were very helpful with directions and recommendations. When we did finally speak to the concierge, we were given incorrect information about the bus fare, but it wasn't a big deal. The hotel is connected to the Belagio via a walkway, and is serviced by a Tram which connects it to the Aria and the Monte Carlo further down the Strip. This is especially useful, as the distances between the properties in Vegas are much farther than they seem on maps. There is only a single cafe in the Vdara which closes early in the evening, but access to Aria with all its shops and services is easy. The pool was closed during our visit, but we were allowed to use the pool at the Aria, which was much nicer than the Vdara's pool looked. Overall, the Vdara is a great hotel, and I would stay here again.

If you are not encumbered by a dog this is a beautiful place to stay. It is a non-gambling property so you'll have a bit of a trek to indulge or see a show or eat.

Yes, the resort is not on directly on the strip. We had a five minute walk from the elevator to either the Bellagio or the Aria. No casino, see previous comment. No restaurant, ditto. The lack of these amnities or conveniences was negligable. I have stayed at large places on the strip where I had even longer walks within the same resort. WE stayed in the basic deluxe room.

The CityCenter area looks like a walkable urban area on the brochures but in fact is not--the entire center of the area between the three hotels is roadway.

The king size bed was very comfortable. The windows have those automatic shades you can operate from the wall to black the whole room out if you stay up all night and need to get some sleep. A short walkway from Vdara through the Bellagio convention center puts you on the Bellagio casino floor. There's a full bar on the lobby floor, along with a coffee shop to grab something quick. Fitness center is decked out with new equipment and sits inside the spa area on the second floor. It sits in the city center area, which is full of shops and other hotel properties as well.

I have stayed at quite a few hotels in my travels and I am definitely not a nit picky kind of person and unfortunately I haven't had much time to post reviews in recent years on hotels like I used to, but I had to do it for this one. First and foremost Vdara is not a 5 star hotel. We recently stayed at the Cosmopolitan in November of last year and the hospitality, rooms, restaurants, everything was top notch. We were attracted to the Vdara because they have no casino and no smoking and all rooms were suites, right up our alley. Well upon check in, which was smooth and quick, I asked the front desk clerk if I could see an upgraded room before deciding if $30 more dollars a night was worth upgrading to their Vdara suite. Well she seemed kind of put out and told us that we had 10 mins. to view the room. I let that comment pass, but it didn't sit well with me. The Vdara suite was definitely not worth $30 more dollars a night and with her attitude, we decided not to give this hotel more money. The first impression of this hotel via the front desk clerk was not good. She was not rude at all, just very cool. No warmth none what so ever and we noticed this with a couple of the other front deskers who were checking others in. Barely cordial. The room was nice and comfortable, but what hotel that has a kitchenette, not have basic kitchen utensils? Seeing we were staying here for 9 nights, we needed these things. We had to call for spoons and forks and other kitchen items. They took forever delivering them. The iron didn't work right and we called 4 times for a new one, and never received one. We made due with the luke warm iron. What 5 star hotel does not have a DVD player for their guests? Yes, we love to watch movies from time to time in our hotel room after a long day of sight seeing, eating and slot playing. I think even the 3 star hotels have DVD players. In order to watch a DVD, you had to rent a playstation for $50 a day!! Are you kidding me? You mean to tell me that the $20+tax resort fee doesn't include this? Absolutely didn't care for the valet parking. Even though it is included in the resort fee that you pay, it still feels like a scam because the valet parkers are so kind and considerate, how do you not tip them? So you kind of felt like you had to tip them. Also, I'm not too crazy about leaving my car rental keys with anyone. So if you wanted to self park, you had to do that at the Aria, and that was a very long walk (commute) back to the Vdara. A scale in the bathroom while on vacation? Please give me a break. Who wants to know how much weight they have gained? I'd rather find that bad news out when I get back home. Now, with all these small little problems, I still would have rated this hotel maybe 4 stars until the ultimate no no happened. Everyday housekeeping cleaned our room. Great, no problem. But everyday when we returned, all of our personal items were moved!!! Did not like this and should have used my first mind and complained about it, but we decided that we just had an over eager housekeeper who wanted to keep things extra neat in the room. So instead of my toiletries being on one side of the bathroom counter and my husbands on his, she felt they all needed to be on one side only. My clothes that I had folded in a chair, well she decided to put them in plastic Vdara bags. Are you kidding me right now? This person is actually moving our stuff!! Hubby said, oh they are just trying to be helpful, so we said nothing. Thank God we put our ipods in the room safe, because my flat iron (ceramic, tourmaline, the really expensive kind) came up missing. Didn't notice this until actually getting back home. I leave my flat iron on the counter top in the bathroom at every hotel we travel to. Never thought this would be something interesting to steal. After doing a clean sweep of the bathroom and other rooms in our suite on departure morning, we determined that we had left nothing behind. Not realizing that my flat iron was not where I left it in the bathroom until after we came back home. That is when it hit me. The flat iron was missing from the counter top after the last time the housekeeper cleaned our room. Never even missed it until after returning home. Really mad at myself for not noticing the flat iron missing while still at the hotel. We actually tipped this person everyday and she had the gall to steal from us. Who steals a flat iron? I spoke with the hotel and they are checking into it, but I know nothing will come of it. It's my word against the housekeepers, but it is a very sad day when you can not leave personal items in hotel rooms (let alone a 5 star) and have to have something missing. I felt I needed to give anyone who is considering to stay at this hotel a heads up. It is a very beautiful property and the rooms are well appointed (except for the kitchen utensils), but the lack of hospitality and thievery at this hotel is a very sad situation. It is a shame that I now have to do an inventory of all items I bring to hotels and before check out, make sure every item is still accounted for. This is the first time I have EVER had ANYTHING stolen from me and even though it was only a flat iron, it still hurts as if it was something of even more value. This sad incident will definitely not stop us from our Vegas trips several times a year, be we will never ever stay at this hotel again, not just for the thievery, but also because we just didn't seem like we were valued.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cValentine's weekend\u201d", "Author": "ljctx", "ReviewID": "UR124932967", "Content": "Part of a Southwest Airlines four day package.

If you are like me, this is the perfect hotel. Once you arrive, you are greeted with a clean fresh aroma. They pump some fragrance into the air system. We got the Deluxe Suite on the 50th floor facing Monte Carlo. We were greeting to a beautiful view and very clean suite. In the suite was a king size bed, sofa bed, desk with ethernet plug, cordless telephone, tv with audio/video plug ins for DVD/iPads, ironing board and iron, small personal safe and and hangers. In the kitchen you get a small bar fridge, two stove ranges, sink with garburator, microwave and a dining table. Upon request, you can get plates and utensils from housekeeping. Beware of the other small fridge that holds items from the hotel. Once lifted from its place, you will automatically be charged. Unless absolutely necessary, I would avoid opening the fridge in case you trigger a sensor. Bathroom is large with a soak tub, shower stall, weight scale, professional duty hair dryer, (ladies you can leave you hair dryers at home. This is very good quality. Three heat settings and speeds) lots of towels and toiletries. Some commented on the traffic noise from the highway but we did not hear anything. You may hear more helicopter noise zooming by. Nice bar in the lobby and a small cafe for a light snack. They are not open late night so either you order room service or head out the hotel. They also have a small store to purchase microwave meals, beverages (yes beer, wine and hard liquor) and personal items. Did not have a chance to visit the gym. The pool was closed for the season. The hotel is a short walk to Bellagio, Aria and the Crystals. There you can take the free tram to Monte Carlo to go to MGM. Walk through Bellagio to Caesers Palace. Even though the hotel is off strip, it is close enough to walk there. Now for some comments. 1. Those of you that visited youtube to view what a room is like at Vdara, may notice a Kreig coffee machine in the kitchen. You will not find it or a regular coffee machine as I was disappointed to find out. I didn't see I would ever use it if there was one as there are number of places that serves coffee. 2. Be careful on the selection of beverages that requires a bottle opener. 3. Vegas is very famous for charging an arm and leg for hot water. I also advise to bring your own water kettle if you like to make hot water. 4. Bed and pillows are extremely soft. If you are used to that, you will have the best sleep. If you are like me who is used to firm beds and pillow, you may experience a sore back and neck in the morning. Doubling up on the pillow doesn't help. Overall a fabulous hotel.

I don't gamble or smoke, so this was the perfect hotel. It was so nice to walk into a Vegas hotel lobby & not have to walk through the maze of a loud, smoky casino. The room was excellent. I took the advice from previous reviews & requested a high floor (I always request a room away from elevators). My room was spacious & quiet. For once, I had a relaxing time in Vegas. The housekeeping is good, but know that they are slow and take a LONG time to clean the room. The 1st day, they cleaned the room in the afternoon and were done by about 5pm. The second day, however, I was gone all afternoon and had the green \"housekeeping\" light on. I returned around 5pm, and the cleaning cart was parked 2 rooms away, exactly where it was when I left earlier in the day. I went out for dinner, and when I came back around 8pm she was cleaning my room! I had to get up at 4am to catch my flight, so I asked her to stop. (she was very nice, it was not her fault since she just came on the shift at 5pm). So, just know that if you are accustomed to having quick service early in the day like most hotels, that may or may not happen here. Not necessarliy a big problem, but possibly inconvenient if you want to be in your room in the early evening. The spa is fantastic, great service, all the perks & extras you could want. If you go, plan to take advantage & spend a few hours there. They have toothbrushes, razors, Aveda face products, etc., everything you need. I highly recommend you spend an afternoon here! The only downside is the food selection. The Market Cafe is convenient, but unless you hit it EXACTLY right, the lines are ridiculous. Due to the limited options, this little place gets overwhelmed & jam packed. If this is the case, take a 10 min walk into the Crystals mall & go to the little Wolfgang Puck \"Pod.\" They have coffee, sandwiches, etc, at the same prices with no lines. (at least when I went at the prime 10am hour. The bar is nice, the wine selection great. The food menu is good but limited. I wanted to eat here a second night, but the menu just didn't motivate me so I went over to the Aria to find a bigger selection of menus.

All of the staff we talked to in person or on the phone very helpful and always tried their best to take care of us. We never got 'not my job' from anyone. We slept late one day and we called to get our room cleaned about 4:00 and they expedited getting it cleaned. We went for a long walk and it was done when we got back. Spa is small but they suggested we use the Aria spa for a day pass and is only $5 more. Fitness center was nice. Only one working stationary bike but lots of treadmills with iPod connections. There's only one bar and cafe/market. Market was much better stocked and wasn't horribly over priced, better than I expected. Aria is right next door (very short walk outside) and has lots of restaurants, club and casino. Also, Bellagio is directly connected by walkway (all MGM properties). Cosmopolitan is short walk behind the hotel, again outside. Not MGM property so not directly connected. It has several bars and lots of restaurant options. If you're looking for good and cheap, find Secret Pizza. Vdara is a hike to strip but we found the walk through Bellagio quick and easy. Coming home to quiet, smoke free lobby was heaven.

Having stayed at the MGM Signature a number of times, however, I was disappointed that the newer Vdara didn't raise the bar for me. The big advantage to the Vdara is location. Obviously, it's located in the City Center, but Vdara is a 50-yard covered walkway away from the Bellagio, as well. The shortcomings of Vdara are few but diminish what could be a five-star property: 1) no robes in the room (you call housekeeping to request them) 2) no tableware in the kitchen 3) wood chairs on marble kitchen floor - upstairs room made a ridiculous amount of noise just sitting in the kitchen...at 2am 4) soaking tub instead of a jacuzzi 5) no covered, climate-controlled walkways to casinos (unenclosed walkway to Bellagio is as close as they get) The only other hotel I've stayed at in Vegas is the Signature, which has the missing amenities above and doesn't have the chairs on marble issue either. The huge benefit to Vdara's location is enough to outweigh these shortcomings. I much prefer being able to walk 100-200 yards to 3 of the best casinos and high-end shopping on the Strip instead of having to take a looooong walk or cab ride from the Signature. If I am going to Vegas for something other than the Strip (business), I would probably stay at Signature over Vdara. If I am going to Vegas for fun, I'll look into another similar property (Trump or Palazzo) before heading back to Vdara.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFabulous non-casino hotel!\u201d", "Author": "MVLULU", "ReviewID": "UR124449538", "Content": "I have been to Las Vegas twenty-three times on business.

They jack up the daily room rate by this fee supposedly for internet access, local & toll-free phone calls, access to the Fitness Center, a daily newspaper, two bottles of water, and turndown service on request. A decent hotel would include internet access and turndown service on request in the regular room rate - which is not low; with cellphones, who needs free calls; the newspaper is at the front desk, not delivered to the door, and can be grabbed by anybody coming off the street. If a guest wishes to use the Fitness Center, he/she should be able to opt to pay or not. On general principles, I refuse to return to any hotel which engages in this abhorent rip-off.

Cons: There's a kitchen, but you have to beg for plates, cutlery and pots & pans because nothing is in the cupboards (which is annoying). Worse, they don't have a coffee maker -- they wouldn't even bring one up for me. No coffee maker??? Even a Holiday Inn will have a coffee maker in the room! Supposedly the pricier rooms have coffee makers, but this lack almost convinced me give the place two stars instead of three (the staff kept that third star).

We stayed at Vdara because we want to stay in a non gaming hotel.

In 20 minutes we were in our room. We booked an executive room because it has a large space, a half bathroom and a full size fridge. The room was clean and the housekeeping staff did a great job. We asked them to make the sofa bed and deliver 4 dining sets, it was done by the time we were back to our room. The bed was comfortable but not the sofa bed. The bathroom was nice and clean and stocked with towels and bath amenities. 2 Flat screen TV, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. The location of the hotel was close to everything. Its within walking distance to the strip, ARIA, Mandarin, Belagio etc. The only thing that set me down was that they could not save me a room with a lake view as I requested several times prior to arrival. I understand it's not a guaranteed but with the modern computer system they should know whether they will have a specific room I requested on that day or not. I count this against customer service and the M life service. I'd rather known this in advance rather than later. No upgrade was offered too. I guess some four star hotel does not have the drive to deliver a 5 star service after all.

It will light up with different colors (depending on what you want) to let housekeeping know your request. Kitchen : as soon as you go in, you are in the kitchen area. There is a mini fridge (fits few bottles of water), a microwave, sink, cabinets and drawers. It comes bare so you have to ask for everything. I read few reviews that mentioned that you can ask for a coffee maker. We asked, but they said they don't provide them anymore. Bathroom : spacious sink, wheelchair can roll in under the sink. There are grab bars by the toilet. Roll in shower with grab bars and mounted shower chair. The shower area isn't that spacious, but it was okay for us. There is a bathtub which we didn't get to use. Bed : I know wheelchairs are usually customized and people have their own preference on the height of the bed when transferring.. but in our case, the bed height was good. In my opinion, it wasn't too high. There is no casino so it was very quiet. There was only carpet inside the hallway to the rooms. We went by the pool, most of the area is accessible.

It's all non-smoking, does not have its own casino, and is pretty well positioned in the middle of the Strip behind the Cosmopolitan, next to Bellagio and opposite Paris. Unfortunately the line to check in and out is almost always very long. While reception staff are generally very pleasant and helpful, each transaction seems to take a very long time. The Vdara does not offer self-parking - and collecting your car can also take a while -but generally the valet team are friendly and helpful. With no restaurant on site, food is only available in-room, at the casual Market Cafe or in Bar Vdara. The menu in the bar, however, was quite impressive and the quality/presentation of the food was very good. The bar staff were knowledgeable and pleasant. The rooms are not overly large but well designed and attractively appointed. The small kitchen is not stocked with anything...at all!. Glasses, cups, spoons etc must be requested from Housekeeping. The remote-controlled black-out blinds are a nice idea but do not provide any semblance of 'black-out' as the gaps between the blinds let in a great deal of light. While the air-conditioning is efficient there is only one large fixed vent in the bedroom area. If you like a cool room for sleeping the air is blown around the bed creating an uncomfortable breeze! The main bedside lights cannot be controlled from anywhere near the bed, and the small reading lights are inadequate for comfortable reading. On the positive side, the rooms were pretty quiet considering the hotel's position in relation to the freeway. And there was certainly no noise from neighboring rooms or the hallway.

The rooms are actually suites. They are large and very clean. The decor is soothing, modern and relaxed. Any service you ask for is tended to promptly and room service is always on time! All of the suites have door bells, house keeping lights and do not disturb lights outside each door that are set by pressing a button in the room by the door. The curtain/ window shades are all electronic and the view we had was wonderful!! The valet parking was quick, efficient and friendly. The concierge was very helpful for events and directions as well as full of good ideas for this to do. The pool is large warm and clean as well as the jacuzzi. The spa was heavenly! We had terrific massages together in the same room. The dressing room/ sauna/ steam room area is so well planned out. Every amenity is there for you in case you forget to bring something with you. The spa staff are very helpful with information as they show you around before your massage. The security in the hotel was very good and professional in their behavior.

Obviously my visit was during post Xmas season and hence maybe the wait. That apart, the resort is fabulous, probably the only non-smoking place in the whole of Vegas, unless you wanted to stay 10 miles away. All other hotels on the Strip can give a non smoking room, but cannot give a non-smoking environment - hey! it is Vegas baby...is what their eyes would say if you can read eyes. Vdara is well connected and actually it was a whole day later when I realized that the monorail is free. After that traveling from and to became such a boon, since the Strip is quite an expanse. The front desk did not tell me that on arrival, directed me to the Concierge who had an attitude and looked indifferrnt, was not friendly. I went the next day to the Concierge asking if they had a coupon for the monorail, again similar attitude and 20 minute wait. The gentleman in front of me kept calm and his dignity when the concierge staff rolled her eyes on what seemed an obvious question to me; that proved definitely it was not me or my deo. However the bell boys and the valet were very friendly and were willing to wait until we got all our stuff off the car. The valet even asked me - would i need the can of water taken to the room, and the flipflops - both I had forgotten, non essential but and it was very good he asked me. I would have realized that the next day when I needed them to go to the pool. The room itself had a Kitchenette that was a blessing. Being a vegetarian, there was not much not choice outside especially after 10 pm. Vdara itself has limited eating in options, Aria being a few foot steps away did not have any veg options either. What to watch out for is - the booking agent on the phone told me from the type of room i was booking, I could see the Bellagio fountain and the strip, so had an expectation built up. It was a glimpse of the fountain and had to look for the strip. Their website is good, but not very descriptive of what to expect. If I did not have an expectation it would not be so bad. Four pluses - kitchenette and honestly fully non-smoking hotel, Valet and bellboys excellent; almost centrally located and good enough for the price.

This hotel RUINED our trip - NEVER again. Now I'm not one to complain and usually don't but felt I had to let people know to please avoid this hotel. Our trip started off great - i walked into the lobby admiring the design, art work, the beautiful bar, great smells etc. We patiently waited in line where a nice gentleman checked us in and 'upgraded us'. We arrived to the room and I was happy with the view but didn't care much for the room itself and actually found the layout to be quite awkward = a lot of wasted useless space = and the rooms are quite dark. I didn't bring my blow dryer as every hotel i have stayed in has them. Well to my surprise this hotel didn't - huge disappointment as I need to blowdry my hair so I wasn't able to wash my hair and get properly ready for a night out. My fault I guess for just assuming I guess. We decided go out anyway and got home around 4 a.m. Well at 6:45 a.m. we got a nice wake-up call from the alarm clock being set from the previous guest who stayed in our room. We woke up exhausted and cranky and spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to turn the stupid clock off - not as easy as one would expect - there were no off buttons - just snooze. Couldn't unplug it because it's plugged in behind a built-in wall unit. We finally got it off or so we thought only to get woken up again. Nothing worse after staying out late and wanting nothing more to sleep in. We played around with it some more and finally got the alarm off then headed out for the day. We returned later in the night forgetting about our disasterous morning and hit the sheets. Sure enough 6:45 a.m. AGAIN the alarm goes off. This time i was really angry. I called down to front desk and they said 'we can't explain how to turn off the alarm over the phone - maintenance will have to come up to turn it off - it is hard to explain how to turn off\" (No apologies or anything) REALLY!!! You need maintenance to come turn off an alarm clock!!!!!!! RIDICULOUS!!!!! So another day and we are up, annoyed and angry. Great way to start the day. Then to top it off I go down to the lobby 'cafeteria' and order a $5 gross coffee I have to serve myself. Finally the day came to leave and I couldn't wait - we checked out - got the bill (all the resort fees, fees for overpriced room service, fees for everything you could think of really) from a rather unpleasant little man and went on our merry fricking way.

We just completed a 4 night stay at the Vdara and had two rooms. check in was easy and quick and the lifts are located next to reception, so unlike most of the other Vegas Strip hotels you aren't dragging your bags through the lobbies and casinos to get to your room!. They also only offer valet parking which is included in your resort fee. Although there was no casino in this hotel is attached by a covered walkway to the Bellagio so within 5 minutes you can be in the casino. The hotel spa services were overpriced even for resort/luxury spa, but I had the best massage I've ever had in my life here. All rooms are suites and have fully equipped kitchen. We stayed in a Hospitality Suite and had two bedrooms , two full bathrooms and a guest bathroom with a lounge and kitchen/diner. Kitchen was fully equipped and we also had our own washer and dryer. My parents were in a one bedroom Penthouse Suite and there room was beautiful too. I have seen the comments about not for asthmatics and pumped fragrance but have to say that it did not affect either myself or my mother neither did I notice it. The only downside is that there is no proper restaurant located in the hotel. there is a small cafe/market but they do offer a fantastic 24hour in room dining menu. But if you want to eat out, the Aria hotel is located within 2 minutes of the front door and easily reached by a pedestrian walkway. The Aria has lots of restaurants and shopping . We dined at the \"Julian Serrano\" tapas restaurant and having lived in Spain for 4 years I can definitely say the traditional tapas was as authentic as it gets!

Vdara is the place. You are nicely situated between the glamorous old world Bellagio, and the glamorous new world Aria in the Strip altering City Center. Literally, steps from each, and connected to Bellagio by a covered walkway. The view from my room looked out over the Bellagio fountains and the Paris Hotel's Eiffel Tower on one end, the Palms Hotel and the red and blue neon covered Rio Hotel at the other. Yep, I was in Vegas alright. The room was spacious with two flat screen tvs, and a large, comfortable bed and nice living room. There is also a table for two in the kitchenette area. The bathroom had a large glassed in shower with a built-in counter for sitting. The separate bathtub was a deep tub soaker, which came in handy at the end of day for soothing my aching feet. Reception was courteous and speedy. And the lobby was always populated, but the foot traffic was manageable. Weather wasn't conducive to using the outdoor swimming pool, but it looked adequate with lounge chairs all around the deck. Didn't use the spa, but checked out the menu which looks nice, so next time. And there will be a next time. Vdara is understated by Vegas standards, but still cool, and the closest thing to feeling like you are home. The best place to stay, in my opinion.

There was three of us on the first night with a fourth person flying in from California on the second night.

The whole arrival & check-in process was very smooth (although we arrived on a weekday afternoon so not sure what this will be like at busier times). If driving, you may miss the sign that leads up the ramp to the hotel/complex entrance so be extra careful! The room itself was a pleasant surprise. Being a new hotel, the rooms are in perfect condition and the corner suite in particular was very spacious, with great views of the strip, two bathrooms, a full kitchen and dining table, even a washing machine and tumble drier! There is a sofa-bed that can sleep two although it is not very comfortable for two adults so would probably be better suited to one adult or two children. Having said that, it was perfectly adequate for one night. The bathroom in the bedroom was very spacious too, with a separate huge shower and a free-standing bath with great views - this would be great for a couple on a romantic weekend away but not of much use to us during our stay. We did not spend much time in the room and did not use any of the hotel services so cannot really comment on these, other than the housekeeping which was good (you can ask for the sofa to be made into a bed while you're out). The other great selling point of this hotel is its location. Through a system of walkways, you can walk to the Bellagio in about 5 minutes and there is also a light rail loop that connects to the Aria and some other hotels (we only used once to go to the Aria).

However, the check-in experience, room amenities, and hotel facilities are all lacking. With so many options available on or near the Strip, I would not likely stay again nor would I recommend this hotel to others. - Check-in staff is inattentive - Room is beautiful and spacious but lacks some key amenities - Room service and housekeeping staff are prompt and courteous - No self-parking; pool facilities open late and close early; beautiful but open and expensive bar CHECK-IN I booked a City Corner Suite online for a special getaway with my girlfriend for her birthday. A few days before arriving, I called the hotel to request a room with a Lake/Strip view and also to request that kitchenware be delivered to the room. The phone attendant told me that she had made a note about both items, but that views are not guaranteed until check-in. We arrived around 10:30AM, before the 3:00PM check-in time. Indeed, the note about kitchenware was on file, but there was apparently no indication of my request for a view. I requested a view again in person; no Corner Lake View rooms were yet available, nor could a dirty room be assigned to us despite the fact that people were checking out that morning. We were told to come back closer to check-in time to select a room, but my we had planned to hike near Lake Mead in the afternoon, so we had no intention on cutting our trip short. I let our attendant know this, and he told us we could pre-register with our credit card and ID and return to the invited guest line and pick out a room later (to save time). He also told us that if a room with a view was cleaned before we got back that he would try to assign it to us. When we returned to City Center after our hike, we queued in the invited guest line. Although only one person was in front of us, the normal line emptied faster. In fact, I overheard one other couple receiving a Strip View Corner Suite in that line. Finally when it came to be our turn in the invited guest line, we were asked to produce ID and a credit card (almost as if we had not done this before) and told that there were no rooms with a Strip View available. Not only that, but the room that we were assigned smelled heavily of marijuana. We returned to the desk and requested to be moved; the staff were quite responsive and apologetic but again didn't listen to my needs. Rather than being moved or upgraded to a different room class with a view, we were assigned to an Executive Corner Suite on the 11th floor overlooking the Aria Tram, and my requests for kitchenware were not transferred to the new file. Moreover, despite the fact that I asked if there was a sofabed in the room, the attendant did not ask if I needed it made up, and later that night (when we were super tired), I found that there were no sheets on the sofabed nor anywhere in the room and had to call room service, delaying my sleep by at least a half hour. It seemed like at every opportunity, I was delayed and ignored by the actions of hotel staff. This is not what I would expect from a hotel reviewed so highly by others. ROOM (Executive Corner Suite - see photos) Despite the lack of a view, the room itself was very clean, spacious, and comfortable; we slept very well in both the bed and sofabed. There is a very nice TV in the bedroom and one in the living room, and there is also a connection center for iPods and other devices under the TV in the living area. The Internet was lightning fast but went out of service once during our stay. The electronically controlled shades and blackouts are great for blocking out the flashing city lights. The main bathroom is large and has two sinks and a separate shower and tub. The toiletries smell very nice, with floral and sandalwood notes. There is an extra half bath attached to the living space, which is handy if someone is sleeping on the couch. However, neither bathroom has towel racks for hand towels, so you have to leave those lying awkwardly on the counter. There is a Whole Foods south on the Strip at Town Square if you need to stock up on food and want to use the beautiful kitchen in your suite. There is a large fridge (which is refilled with water bottles daily as part of your resort fee), electric burners, and a dishwasher in the kitchen, and you can request as much kitchenware as you'd like (be sure to also request detergent if you need to do dishes). However, the Keurig coffee machine and/or the pods it uses makes very weak coffee, and there was no tea nor cocoa in the room, which is something I'd expect from a much more basic hotel. Also, if you want to wash your clothes before heading home, there's a washer and dryer in the closet near the door, and room service can bring you detergent and softener. SERVICE Room service and housekeeping were excellent and reasonably prompt about bringing us anything we needed. FACILITIES The is no self-parking at Vdara; if you don't want valet, park near the West Elevators in The Cosmopolitain, exit by foot via the hotel lobby onto Harmon, turn right, and take the outside stairs to get to Vdara. The hotel pool is open from 9AM to 4PM; for any business traveler or couple looking to squeeze in an early morning swim or late night visit to the hot tub, stay elsewhere. Also, pool hours are listed as \"seasonal,\" so it's hard to know this information in advance. The hotel bar is integrated into the lobby; it's quite pretty but very open, and drinks are on the expensive side ($10-12 for a cocktail).", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat off-strip location.

Then, we thought we would give LV a try. We are no gamblers, don't drink much, but we are interested in the whole artificial setting in a city scale, in the desert, and we are also interested in how the tourists sustain its existence, through ups and downs. The City Center was formerly the site of Boardwalk hotel and a Bellagio staff parking lot before the whole area is redeveloped in 2005, initiated by MGM with Dubai money. The development include Cosmopolitan. Aria, Vdara(Condo hotel) and Mandarin Oriental and its residence towers. The location is undoutedly the best. But, remember that, in Las Vegas, you just walk at least 20-30 min. just to get through a hotel on the strip without getting distracted. This is an ideal location for a casual tourist, like us, who doesn't spend time in Casinos and who just have 2-3 days to get around. Particularly, Aria appeared to be the better sister to Vdara, and has a nice modern casino and posh restaurants, tall ceilings in public levels, but better and more luxurious interior decoration didn't mean much, once we spotted prostitutes and female pimps arranged by the casino staff. _______________ (difficult to access from the strip) Strangely, both Aria and Vdara, sharing its arrival/valet area on the second level from the strip, the access is more easy with the car than walking pedestrians. The signs were hard to find or follow to get to Vdara from the street. And, the lobby and elevator hall, situated on the second level, was hard to get to, and it really takes 15 min to get back from the strip on foot. _______________ (No extra features) For Vdara, other than the hotel front desk, and the compulsory valet parking service policy, there is no real contact with the staff as they do not have any feature! Someone below mentioned, lacking Soul, and I totally agree with his perception. The canteen is the only food and drink source in the building. Operated as self-service but very slow, and they close early! In the morning, we feel forced to compromise a lot, in limited seating area, and the breakfast menu option was not great. Coffee and Snack kinds. But their pasty and coffee, smoothies are expensive, but very good. The gym, included in your extra service fee, was inside the spa and doesn't look inviting, also limited numbers of weight training sets. _______________ (extra charges) I already accepted the water bottles, gym, internet, Valet parking as the extra compulsory charge at a set price. But, the management probably knew the guests don't use much of these features. We still tip a lot to the valet parking guys each time, or they keep you in the lobby for a very long while. But, including the extra fee, it still is a good bargain compared to others with shabby rooms in a distant location. _______________ (issues with front desk) The front desk receptionists can be really nice or nasty, depending on who to talk to. We, initially ran into some really nasty Chinese staff who refused to confirm and hold our room when we called from Grand Canyon, to notify our midnight arrival in the same night. -but, the room was already paid through their website! And, other than the apologetic manager who sort out this matter, we had to give tips to other receptionists only to re-confirm the room type when we arrived for additional night check-in (facing higher floor, the Bellagio fountain facing at already set prices). Then the room was not ready still at 4pm as promised. Although tipped, she did nothing until I called the hotel at 4:15pm. After another hour and half, we were allocated to the slightly disappointing lower level location. There is a cocktail bar, in the lobby, but I have seen only one guy using it for one afternoon, otherwise, it was inactive. Another Lounge type room was closed, next to the foot bridge to The Bellagio. _______________ Closely located to the Strip is a plus, but, poor wayfinding from the ground level to return to the lobby was tough each night, and walking through the parking entrance of the Cosmopolitan, climbing on to the windy and isolated staircase next to the fire station are rather humiliating and very inconsiderate. For the rating, I would still give 4.5 out of 5, IF this was in NYC or Chicago in a boutique hotel category. But, I am giving 3.5-4, considering Other hotels' exceedingly high standard and Vdara's accomodation-only ANNEX approach to Aria, lacking the quality services. Vdara's poor reception experience and stiff-faced valet parking staff need big improvement. However, although I point out some flaws and disappointment, compared to Hilton, MGM signature, and dingy northern strip hotels, or even Planet Hollywood hotel rooms, this is far superior option for many travelers for its location and the great room fittings.

CES was starting up on the 11th so prices were up for the week i was interested in. The first two nice were very reasonableee at $190 a night for a corner suite. Then on Monday, the price went to $300 a night and they wanted $900 a night for the rest of the week. Tip, try to stay away from Vegas when CES rolls around. I really didnt have a choice since my show was adjacent. The Room was absolutely amazing. I was not expecting such a large suit. It had a full chicken with a dish washer and huge fridge. The bathroom was even bigger, with a large shower and beautiful bath tub right by the window with a full panoramic view of the mountains and strip. There was a comfortable living room with a nice 46'' LCD and and equaly large bed room with another 46'' LCD. The room feels like an apartment. The space is really well used. i was sad to leave the room. The design is simply beautiful and functional. Also, forgot to mention that there is a washer and dryer in one of the closets. The view is gorgeous. I got to see the strip as well as the surrounding mountains in the horizon. I used the gym just about every day. Its well equipt and has just about everything you need for a workout on the road. I ate at the bar downstairs the first night i came in. The pizza is not very good, dont get it. The crust was stale and the cheese tasted like it came out of a can. The bar tender was very nice. Also, watch out if you eat alone. a really scanky looking women sat next to me. I am sure she was a prostitute. I hear this happens a lot in vegas and that the hotel gets a cut. was surprised to see here in this type of hotel, as it does not have a casino and is more of a business hotel. In any case, it really uncomfortable when you have a prostitute sitting next to trying to solicit you. The hotel has a walkway to the belagio. Thus you can get from the Vdara to the Ceasers really easily walking through the belagio. This is a smoke free hotel which is a real treat for those of you who dont like the smell of cigarettes. The lobby actually smells like a spa, which is very soothing. I also ate at the Vdara market downstairs which was a great solution for a quicj breakfast or lunch. The southern sandwich was great and soups were amazing. Very fresh and the prices are decent relative to other places around. I stayed at the trump last year during the same dates. There is no comparison, this places trumps, the Trump ;). The service is better, the prices are lower, the location is more fun, and rooms are jusy beyond.

Having stayed in Vegas before at the other end of the strip we really liked the location of Vdara being right next door to both Aria & Crystals. One of the main reasons we liked the hotel so much was because of its proximity to excellent restaurants in both Aria & Crystals. We loved that Vdara is smoke free and it doesnt really have a big proper lobby bar...which means its a little more low key but close to everywhere you might want to eat or party (ie cosmo). The one drawback that we didnt care for was the lack of cutlery in the apartment/hotel room. We got a salad from Aria one day and waited for over 30 mins to have some cutlery brought up to the room.....really?! Why have a full mini kitchen with a stove-top and full size fridge if I dont have any cutlery? A proactive solution to this might be to ask my on arrival if I would like cutlery etc for my stay.... The room was very spacious, clean and extremely modern. We wouldnt hesitate to stay here again. My couple of restaurant tips for you to consider are: -American Fish -Social house for exceptionally delicious japanese happy hour & out of this world coffee from Jona (the best barista in Vegas!) -Jaleo (much better than Julian Serrano-in our opinion) -Holsteins for a delicious burger -Scarpetta for delicious affordable fresh pasta Lastly...if you want to get to the other end of the strip to the Fashion Mall or to check out the gorgeous Wynn hotels you can jump on a Trump shuttle at the basement of Caesars Palace....but trust me the walk wont be quick & easy...no walk seems to be along the strip in Vegas!", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSpotty service but would stay again\u201d", "Author": "family5_10", "ReviewID": "UR123116774", "Content": "The suites were impeccably clean, and the kitchenette at the entry gave us a lot of hard surfaces on which we could safely leave our luggage.

The hotel is beautiful, the room was all-class, and the beds were extremely comfortable - no complaints, there. My problem with the Vdara (and CityCenter as a whole) was likely due to my lack of comfort with properties that cater to the wealthy - a general lack of soul and comfort. The hotel has no doormen and employees (aside from security) were few and far between. The lobby felt like a museum - cold and quiet. The casino (which is actually in the Aria) was high-dollar, as was the clientele. Although nicely dressed, we weren't wearing a jacket and slacks and felt completely out of place - on a Wednesday evening. Casino staff were as snooty as their customers, and that's steered us right out the door and down to Bellagio. CityCenter's mall is named Crystals, which sounds more like a strip club in downtown Atlanta than a high-end luxury mall. This place isn't for you if you don't own (or know someone that owns) a Bentley. The main stores are Bulgari, Cartier, Fendi, Gucci, Tom Ford, Versaci. Again, beautiful, but just not for me.

After about 15 minutes of the desk clerk trying to check on different rooms, we were given a $50 credit to have a meal and our room was ready. We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains to Rio. The room was modern and included a mini kitchen. There was a sliding door that separated the bed area and the restroom. The door would not close completely, a little annoying.

Disadvantages: very limited on food, you basically need to visit Aria for gaming or something to eat unless you just want a simple meal (sandwich). There was a small lounge bar. I believe there was a restaurant on property, but it was not open when we checked. We stayed here for the 31st and Jan 1st, then moved to Palazzo (favorite). We checked out at noon and wanted to buy some gifts at Aria before going to Palazzo.

I'm not real sure I'd stay at Vdara again unless it was at a really good rate. We like to play the games and walking to Aria to play was a little more inconvenient then we liked.

Vdara is a non-casino hotel situated in City Center just across from 'the back' of Aria. I stayed in a Vdara Suite on the 45th floor which was around 900 sq ft and had a good, reasonably longish distance view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip. The suite was clean with a kitchen and dining area, a lounge area, bedroom, large bathroom and separate toilet. It had more than enough room for me. The bed was a King size and was comfortable. One aspect to the suite which was slightly disconcerting was that it was in the join of the inside corner of the building which meant that I could see in to another hotel room and I assume they could see into mine too. It was possible for both rooms to close the blinds but if this was done then the great view of the fountains and the strip was no longer available - so it was either a sacrifice of privacy or a sacrifice of the great view. I tended to switch between the two. As I was only there for one night this did not bother me too much but if my stay had been longer I would have asked to move to a different room. Room service was delivered on time and the food (Ramen Noodles) was of good quality. The pool area looked decent and relaxed but I did not use it myself. There is a bar and a cafe in the hotel lobby which I also didn't use. If you want casino action you can walk to Aria in a few minutes and there is also a walkway through to Bellagio.

We didn't eat in particularly but it was great to have the option, and our champagne breakfast on Christmas morning (fizz from the local store and smoked salmon bagels from the cafe downstairs), was a delight - made more fun by the watching the exploits of the pilot spelling \"NOEL\" with his plane vapour. The hotel is so close to the action but was like an area of of calm and tranquility away from the buzz of the casino's and the Strip. A few minutes walk took us to the Aria - the buffet on Christmas Day was well worth the queue (about 50 mins). The food was plentiful and delicious.

Deep soaker tubs fit two large people facing each other. Amazing soak for one person. Seperate glass encased shower has a weak shower stream because of the LEED Environmentally friendly hotel that Vdara is. There is no self park for Vdara so you need to choose valet (which was quick and efficient), Bellagio self park or Aria self park. Aria is a tram ride away so we chose valet or Bellagio self park. Valet is always free in all Vegas hotels. Tip $2+ to the driver that brings your vehicle. Vdara is at the back of the City Center property so your best connection to the strip is via the overhead covered walkway that goes north into Bellagio. The tram takes you to Aria then Monte Carlo.

This is very true. The \"Market Cafe\" of the hotel has only very limited choices. It is difficult to get food, esp if you arrive late in the hotel (e.g. late flight arrival or after a long-day trip to Grand Canyon) 5. Room condition: some people commented that the black-out curtains do not block 100% sunlight. It is true and it can be annoying if you want to wake up late. But, since we stayed there during winter time, it did not give us too much problem. 6. Bathroom: our major concern is the water pressure of the shower.

As a result, it is very quiet and sedate. It is also smoke free, which is a big deal. I believe that builders initially viewed Vdara as residences and not hotel rooms. This resulted in larger suites that have all the amenities. The suite we were in had a full-sized refrigerator, microwave oven, dishwasher, and even a clothes washer and dryer. You won't find that in many regular hotel rooms. The suite featured 1.5 baths. The living/dining area and the bedroom were separate with zone heating. This is a very nice feature. The bed was extremely comfortable. In all three nights we were there, I did not hear any sounds at all, so I think they added extra sound proofing when they built the place. The elevators were very fast; I never waited even a minute for one. The Vdara has a gym on the second floor with about 5 treadmills and a couple of recumbent bikes. They have some dumb bells and a few machines. You can get in a good workout here, but not a real intense one. They supposedly have a locker room with steam and sauna, but that is another $25 per day. The wireless in the hotel was very spotty. Make sure to plug your laptop into the ethernet cable. The speed was good, but not great. I think in a brand-new building, it should be great.

When you want to eat/shop/gamble, the Aria and Cosmopolitan are all within a very short walk. It is not the easiest route in the world to get down to the strip. You may not want to, though, since City Center has everything in it. I would also avoid the City Center monorail. It does not go very far. The stations are generally at some remove from the hotels. By the time you walk up to the platform and then into the hotel, you would have been better off to just walk in the first place. I strongly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a quiet place to stay that is luxurious and fully-appointed.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Experience\u201d", "Author": "songoftheeclipse", "ReviewID": "UR121832210", "Content": "My fiancee and I had an excellent overall experience during our 4 day stay here. We stayed in the deluxe suite. The room was fairly large with a kitchen, living and bedroom divided by a partial wall, and a bathroom. We unfortunately didn't make use of the kitchen but it would be a great way to save some money on your trip. The living room area was comfortable with a couch, chair, and desk. The partial wall that divides the living and bedroom has a tv on both sides. The bed was one of the best I've ever slept on in a hotel which was great because its hard not to do a lot of walking in Vegas. A restful night really prepares you for the next day. The pillows were awkwardly large. The bathroom was spacious with a large bathtub and a separate shower. I would have liked some stronger water pressure for the shower but I do have an unruly mass of hair that is hard to wash. The frosted glass door lets light through so make sure to role over if you here your partner get up in the night to use the bathroom unless of course you like light when you sleep! The view from our room was amazing. You could see the mountains off in the distance or the fountains at the Bellagio down below. The room was clean and the cleaning service was prompt and efficient. One day when we didn't request room service we came back to the room with a message on the phone. When we called the person at the front desk asked us if we needed anything since we had the do not disturb light on when they came to clean. I thought that was a nice touch. I was impressed with how thoroughly they cleaned; I didn't expect to come back and see some of my clothes I left out folded. The only real negatives from my experience were the long time we waited in line to check in. It took almost 30 minutes. It was a Saturday afternoon and the line was long but when you're on vacation its hard to wait for it to begin! Also when we checked out even though a long line formed behind us when we walked up there were 2 people helping each person at the desk. Maybe they were training but if I had somewhere to go I wouldn't have wanted to walk up and see 4 people helping 2. The $20 resort fee seemed excessive but that is common practice at hotels. I didn't visit the spa or the gym. If you are looking for a relaxing hotel for your Vegas vacation I highly recommend this one. The location is just off the strip. The tram can take you to Aria, Crystals, and Monte Carlo or you can walk right into the Bellagio.

The room we booked online was a basic Deluxe Suite. We arrived at about 3:45p.m. and did not have to wait in line at the check-out desk which was very nice (though I think this was just due to the fact that we were there on a slow day). I am subtracting a star for the lack of enthiusiam and overall rudeness of the Gentleman who checked us in, he barely said hi to us and acted as if we interrupted him by wanting to check in, this did not start out our experience at Vdara very well. It was hands down the rudest I've ever been treated at the checkout desk at any hotel I've stayed at in Vegas (I don't get upset about much but he was talking down to us BIG TIME). We asked if there were any upgrades avaialable, and while we did not get an upgrade to a nicer room we did have a great view of the Bellagio fountains. I read reviews and don't know how people always talk about the Hotel upgrading them for free to a nicer room...I have been to vegas over five times now and it has not happened once to me. Our room was on the 33rd floor and it was quick access from the elevator to the room which was very nice; No large lobby to walk through or sets of elevators to take which was a relief Upon arriving in our room everything was tidy and neat until we went into the bathroom. The ceiling above the bathtub was peeling and it was a very noticable eye sore in the bathroom, we also found garbage from the previous people who stayed there, old toothpaste and tisses. I am not one to complain about small stuff so I picked them up and threw them away myself (I'm sure some people would have come unglued but I just didn't let it bother me, I didn't want to be upset the first day in Vegas). The beds and pillows here were the most comfortable I've ever slept on In Vegas (I would go back just to sleep on the beds..they were that good!). The small dining table was nice as was all the storage in the kitchen. Everything else in the room was basic; a chair & desk, sofa, coffee table, a main closet, a closet in the bathroom, two nightstands, flat screen TV, and some drawers for clothes (no coffee maker....sad). The location of the hotel was great. Vdara is part of the CityCenter so it is in the middle of the strip. It was connected by a walkway to the Bellagio, behind the Cosmopolitan, and across from the Aria. Going through the Cosmopolitan seemed to be the fastest way to the strip. I can't really review the food at the Vdara but we did get coffee one morning. It was good, but way to expensive for what it was (which I find to be the case with everything in Vegas nowadays). They have one bar which we did not try also but it was always packed (so it must have been good). The whole time we were there the room service was great, our room was so clean everytime we came back at night (maybe the cleanest I've ever stayed in, with the exception of the day we arrived). Overall I would give Vdara an average review (if I could 2 1/2 stars). It would be a great hotel for couples or families who are going to vegas for a quieter time. Would I go back? Probably not and here is why: The front desk person was unfriendly, when that is the FIRST thing I experience on my first day of hard earned vacation I just cannot return to a place like that (no matter how great the rest of the experience was).

Firstly, a word of warning..when checking in you will be asked for a deposit of $500 which if you pay by credit card does not get taken from your account straight away only acts as a guarantee, whereas if you pay by debit card it does get taken but refunded when home. Along with the resort charges of $20/day. You can keep track of the charges on your room account through (one of the two plasma tvs in the room!!). We had a double deluxe on the 37th floor overlooking the bellagio and its fountains!! The view is OMG through 4 huge double windows! The beds are soo comfy..just what you need after a long day walking.. also two plasma tvs :D The rooms are pretty big even just the basic rooms! I loved the whole modern, contemporary and chic feel of the hotel and the gorgeous smell on entering. The staff are soooo friendly (especially the bar staff). The location of the Vdara is great a short walk to the Aria then you are on the Strip.

The conference organisers booked the hotel for us and we stayed 7 nights. Arriving at the hotel, we were lucky with check-in - a breeze compared to other members of our group who arrived at different times. They queued for 20 minutes or so. Prior to going, we checked out all the reviews and was totally surprised when we arrived in the room to find how big it was - some had claimed that the rooms were small!. I read somewhere that this hotel was built as an apartment building originally and turned into a hotel - hence the kitchenette and the dining area. Strangely, the kitchen stuff - plates, etc, were available only on request. The rooms looked, felt and smelt brand spanking new. Fresh and clean with modern decor and colours. Bed was ultra comfortable and huge. The shower was hot and strong. We asked for (and probably paid for) a room overlooking the Bellagio Fountains which were magnificant. Location was convenient to the Strip and also the casinos. However, in hindsight, it was a fairly lengthy walk to the strip along a deserted back road which may be very offputting to some. There was a tram that linked all the way back to the Monte Carlo, where we had other friends staying which was handy. There were chargeback facilities through several hotels in the same group (and same area) which was magic for the buffets and the pub! So plenty of pros. Top 4 cons worth mentioning: 1) the Resort Fee of $15 which appeared to be payable for a tiny bottle of water, they even managed to forget to leave water on 2 mornings. 2) The young ladies that booked the shows etc were so snobby that I felt I was intruding on their busy schedule. 3) I didn't take a laptop and they wanted to charge an obscene amount of money to use the Business Centre and 4) The cafe is very basic and it would be nice to see them re-open the restaurant on site.

We can often find an excellent rate, and we've taken advantage of Vdara promotions on two occasions. We travel to Las Vegas approximately 4-5 times per year, and we've stayed at many of the hotels on the strip. Pros: - Non-smoking and non-gaming: this means that it's quiet, smaller, and easier to check into. The lobby is often very quiet, which is nice compared to the insanity of the other hotels on the strip. The best part is that the Aria is about 200 steps away, so you can be in the middle of the fun within minutes. - Rooms: We've stayed in both the basic suite and the City Corner suite, and both are stunning. Classy decor, and the beds are fantastic. Ask for a Bellagio view or an Aria view. - Service: Most staff is utterly courteous, helpful, and friendly. - Kitchens: The kitchens are great for saving some $$$ by making some meals in the suite. Plenty of room for simple food prep and a nice dining area. - Free parking at Aria: You can either valet your car at Vdara (for free, I think) or park for free at the Aria. It's a short walk to the Vdara through the Aria. We like to do this when we want to get our car out early to go hiking around Las Vegas. Cons: - Kitchen: While it's great to have a kitchen, you have to individually request every single item of cookware that you want from housekeeping and have it sent up. This suite isn't nearly as stocked with cookware as other suites on the strip like Trump and MGM Signature. It's really the main drawback for us. - The basic suites do not have coffee makers, although there is a full kitchenette. - We've had some trouble getting housekeeping in our room. We've been gone twice from about 9am-5pm hiking and returned to an unmade room. We had turned on the \"housekeeping\" light in both cases. Overall: Although we've experienced some fairly minor inconveniences and instances of poor service, I still think Vdara is a five star hotel.

We booked 2 corner suites and had 3 ladies in one and the 2 guys in the other. They accommodated our request to be on the same floor and although we did not have a view of the foundations we instead faced off the strip to the mountains. Nothing wrong with taking a shower or having a bath with that view.

The pull out bed was alright and we asked for turn-down service nightly so that housekeeping could come and make up that bed. This worked great except for one night where something must have gotten lost and they delivered new linens instead of turning down the bed. The bathrobes are amazing and I highly recommend using them, I would have bought one had they been available. One of the best features of the Vdara it is closeness to the Bellagio. It takes less than 5 minutes to walk to the Bellagio lobby and then on to the strip. The Aria is also right there and has some fantastic restaurants as well.

Like many of you, we spent a great deal of time reading the various reviews and became confused at the seemingly contradictory findings. We found it to be EXCELLENT. Please allow me to elaborate from a baby boomer point of view. We do NOT generally stay in fancy five star hotels and we do not expect to be pampered or waited upon in any luxurious way, BUT we do INSIST upon a clean, well appointed room and we require a hotel that is well kept and has a reasonably friendly staff. Our first stay in Las Vegas 3 years ago was in a standard room at Treasure Island with a strip view. We found it to be a very good value and we enjoyed the north end of the strip. Our second stay was with other family groups and we all stayed at New York New York on the south end of the strip, again a standard room with a Park Avenue upgrade. It was quite good but in our opinion not up to the standards of T.I. This November 21-25, 2011 we decided to explore a fancier room at the newly built Vdara. Initially we were booked in a Vdara suite with one free daily buffet each (breakfast or lunch only) at one of 7 MGM buffets. As the trip came closer to fruition, Vdara introduced a new package for an upgraded corner suite with a $50 DAILY resort credit for in suite dining or use at the Vdara Market. This is the option we went with for $129 per night .... the credit brought that down to an effective rate of $79!!!! Yes we did use the credit each day (more on that below) The room in our our middle class opinion was SPECTACULAR!!!! It was an 811 sq. ft. one bedroom condo. Elsewhere the various reviews describe the room quite well and the Vdara web site has an excellent 360 degree view of it and a floor plan, so we will let those reviews speak for themselves. For clarification it seems from some reviews that the Corner suite and the Vdara suite are identical except for the view BUT not quite. The Vdara suite has a main bathroom and a powder room but the view is not as good as the corner suite which has one very large bathroom but a stunning 270 degree view. We would have preferred the powder room too but all in all it was a great great room. Many reviewers complained about the electronic shades and the difficulty in using them but we found it to be no problem at all. I guess there was some mild sun shining around the edges and between the blinds in the morning but it did not bother us. We do not need cave like darkness to sleep and in fact generally kept most of the blinds up at night. It was stated by some reviewers that the housekeeping was poor and service was substandard or poor. We SAW NONE OF THAT, although one day our room was missed for cleaning all together. The front desk offered to send someone up when we returned that night but we did not to be bothered at that time and so they volunteered to remove the daily resort fee for that day. Fair enough we thought!!! There have been many questions concerning the various offers that the Vdara makes available from time to time such as what is included in the Vdara resort credit and how does one use it. It was a mystery to us as well but I think that our experience may help shed some light on the topic. First of all the Vdara Resort Credit actually means slightly different things depending on the amount assigned and the details of each offer. For example SOMETIMES the resort credit can be used for the Spa, and the Aria restaurants as well, BUT in our case the $50 daily credit could only be used for in suite dining and for ordering food from the Market Cafe just off the main lobby. Although the cafe also carries soft drinks, snacks, souvenirs etc. the credit was only usable to offset purchases made from the Market Cafe menu. (A detailed menu is available on the Vdara site) To use the credit simply order the items from the menu and charge it to your room. It can be eaten in the cafe or taken back to your room as you wish. Service was quite prompt and even a special order was ready within 15 minutes. Juice, Tea, Coffee are able to purchased via the credit. As mentioned elsewhere, the only trick is that you may need to personally check at the front desk or call down to ensure that the credit has been adjusted on your bill. This was a fairly simple task and while it would be nice to have it happen automatically all of the time it was a very small diversion for what amounted to $50 off each day. We just checked on our second day and on our last night after we had made our last purchase. As noted elsewhere, there is no Casino and no real restaurants to speak of, but both are readily available just across the driveway at the Aria. The walk to the tram which will take you south to the Monte Carlo is just two flights of stairs (or escalators) off the main lobby. Or instead of turning in to the tram station just walk a few more yards and you enter the Bellagio complex. From that first entry point though it is a good 10 - 12 minute walk to work your way through the Bellagio and emerge at the overpasses to either Caesar's Palce on the west side of the strip or Bally's on the east side. There are many other hotels that almost immediately let you out to the strip in a minute or so and they are \"hopping\" day and night with the sounds of the casino, entertainment and restaurants, BUT we were much more pleased with the more quiet and laid back atmosphere of the Vdara. We do not regret a single minute!!!!!

We ate out and brought left overs to keep in our room since we have a refrigerator and microwave. The rooms have kitchens but no silverware. No problem, there is a note asking you to call room service and they will bring silverware up to your room. Well, I called down to have someone bring up some silverware, after 45 minutes of waiting I figured they forgot and I called again. They couldn't give a reason as to why it was taking so long and in 5 minutes I had my silverware. I expect to wait 45 minutes to have freshly prepared food delivered to my room but not for silverware, and it's not like this was a Saturday night when the hotel is super busy. It was a Thursday. The next thing that I didn't like was that there is no gift shop/sundries shop at the hotel. So if you forget to bring something like a toothbrush/asprin or anything else, you have to go to one of the neighboring hotels to get your things- I went to Aria to get bandaids, it would have been nice to get them at our hotel. Of the 3 hotels in City Center I liked the Cosmopolitan the best, cool bars, friendly staff everywhere. The buffet at Cosmopolitan is awesome!

We had both been to vegas seperately before and this was our first trip together. First thing, Friday night about midnight, we were woken up to water running from our bathroom. Upon inspection, it was leaking through the roof and the light fixture. A handy man attended right away, inspected it, ensured we would get upgraded and indicated he would get back to us asap to let us know if we should move the same evening or wait until the am. We waited for about an hour, nobody called and so, we went back to sleep. A side note about the rooms. We stayed at the Vdar because of the kitchenette however, we had to request utensils and plate which, they took everyday and we had to request again. And, the rooms had no coffee pot or kettle which, I'm sure, is so you buy their coffee in the lobby. We used a pot to boil water. We were up early the next morning for golf and because we were wondering the status of our room as nobody had gotten back to us, I stood in the always long front desk line (remember, this is 645 am) to ask about the status of our room but, left because we would have been late for golf. This brings me to my second dissapointment. We requested our car from the valet and were in a bit of a rush to get going....when he arrived with our car and my husband did not tip him, he actually said \"oh, okay\" and turned around and left with obvious attitude. So, overall, the hotel itself was beautiful with friendly and helpful staff or the most part. And, the rooms were beautiful. However, we were not upgraded despite our inconvenience and felt some pressure and hostility from the valet staff when, god forbit, you did not tip them. We were eventually moved to another room but, it was not an upgrade. And, I'm not sure if I'd go back just because of the valet experience.

We actually enjoyed the fact that there was no casino in this property, as it gave us a chance to get out and move a bit. Each morning I went down to the pool and lounged/swam/enjoyed a book, while my husband joined a poker game at the Aria (sister hotel) across the road/circle driveway. The pool at the Vdara was great, and service there was fairly good, though one day I did have to wait because only one waitress was working. All of the other days there were two or three servers walking around. I did enjoy an egg scrambler dish from the pool menu, and sat at the tables nearby; this meal was excellent, and I would have eaten from this menu more often if I didn't have a free brunch each day. I found that it was easy to find a lounger in a good spot, and there was plenty of sun to soak up. I did find that the rays would reflect off the hotel windows, and at one point I had to move because it got too hot! The pool deck also burned my feet when I walked to the steps to cool off in the water, but I guess that's what you get in the desert during the hottest week of the year! We then had a late brunch each day at the Aria buffet, which was included with our room at the Vdara, and was EXCELLENT food. I do wish there was a buffet in the Vdara, but the Aria is also lovely and just a very short walk away, so it was a minor inconvenience. We didn't use the bar in our hotel as we had plans each evening and it just didn't work out for us to drink there, but I did access the room service menu late one evening for a delicious pasta dish. We also loved the tram (accessible from the back of the property) as we had friends staying at NY NY, and the tram got us much closer to them for the few times we met up.

The bed was uber comfortable, and it was great having a living room, kitchen and full vanity in the room. Very spacious corner suite. The view from our room 52006 on the 52nd floor was spectacular and offered a 180 degrees of neighboring hotels up the strip, mountains to the west, and directly above the Bellagio fountain which lit up at night - just spectacular. For exploring, this is a great location being central on the strip. The only issue we had at all was with the service. My dad dropped us off in his car, and while 5 bell hops stood talking to each other 20 feet away in front of the hotel - NOT ONE OF THEM even looked up to see if we needed any help unloading or transporting our luggage. This was a major faux pas. The front desk staff were equally lacking in welcoming warmth and under-attentiveness, and they neither informed us about our room amenities, the application of our $50 daily credit, early pool closure, etc..., nor welcomed us to the Vdara. The were short, curt and bored. Upon check out, they were in the same form, and when I asked for a print out of the credit we were given of $50/day, I had to ask several time for proof. Her response was that \"I made the charges, so shouldn't I be able to recognize that the credit was applied?\" Shocking really. We called for several things to be fixed in the room (blinds wouldn't close, broken TV remote) but no one ever came.

The Ugly: I booked two rooms & asked for them to be connected. I had gotten a special online that included $25 credit for one room $50 for the second room including an in room gift. I verified 2 times before our stay & was told it was not gonna be an issue. When my boyfriend checked in he was told that I needed to be there with my card ( even though when I booked the rooms I was told it was not going to be an issue). I had to give my debit card over the phone for both rooms and was charged a $400 deposit. He got upgraded to a slightly nicer room so our rooms were not even close to each other. Once I checked in I was assured our rooms had in room credits. We were billed for our in room gift, was told it would be removed. Ordered pizza the second night, it was truly the worst pizza. The kids asked for sandwiches! We are not snobby by any means. Cheap frozen pizza would have tasted better. $40 for 2 - wow! We tipped the attendants but when I checked out I was billed again for tips and the $75 credits were not applied. When I complained the girl at the front desk waived the resort fee but she insisted the credits were given when I could clearly see I was only being BILLED for room service. I left and found that they had my deposits refunds still on hold and an extra $60 on hold for 5 days. I called in & I was told someone would call me back.

The are advantages and disadvantages depending on what you are looking for but, first of all, let me describe and review the hotel as it is before giving my view on this new way of staying in Vegas. We booked a Panoramic View room but when we arrived the highest floor available was the 8th floor, which defeats the purpose of having 270o views of Vegas! We asked for alternatives and the check in person was more than happy to assist. She disappeared for 5 mins to check blueprints for the hotels to figure out what rooms would be best for us. She returned with a list of floors and room types. We opted for a City View room on the 39th floor, with views of the strip and Bellagio Fountains. The room itself was very impressive and different to any other room we've had in Vegas. The kitchen / dining area is quite unique and contained a very large fridge/freezer with ice making facilities, sink, microwave and hob. The dining table, with four seats sits neatly within the kitchen and the washing machine and dryer sit in a nearby cupboard. With our trip being nearly 2 weeks, we made use of the washing machine, to freshen clothes. The living room contains a large tv with two seater sofa and coffee tables. It has a separate air conditioning unit from the bedroom, which again we found useful if one of us was sleeping while the other watched tv in the living room. The bedroom itself was large enough and separated from the living room by fogged sliding doors. It has another large tv with bedside cabinets, desk and several lamps. The bathroom can be reached via a sliding door from the kitchen or door from the bedroom (the whole suite is a square that can be walked round). The bathroom is very large and has twin sinks, which large lit mirror. On the other side of this mirror there is a makeup area with the same sized mirror. There's a wardrobe with safe. The bath tub is deep but not very large. The separate shower is large but the water pressure in our suite wasn't very high. The signature part of the suite was the window running along the two external walls of the suite. The electric blinds (shade and blackout) could be controlled in living room, bedroom and bathroom. It let lots of light in and, of course, gave magnificent views of the Bellagio Fountains, Eiffel Tower, The Cosmopolitan and Strip as well as sprawling Vegas. Having read many reviews there are split opinions on this hotel. Firstly it's only a hotel and not casino. We're not gamblers but did enjoy being amongst the slots now and again when we stayed at The Mirage. However, Vdara is connected to Aria, Bellagio and Monte Carlo. It takes a 5 min walk to Aria and Bellagio or 10 min tram ride to Monte Carlo. These are all part of MGM Resorts too so the MLife card will work in all three and allow you to collect points. This was fine for us. Vdara is part of the City Center complex and, as such, is set quite far back from The Strip. To get to the strip you do need to walk for 10-15mins, through any of the three casinos mentioned previously or there is a road leading out from the front door. At first this was no hassle for us as it normally takes the same amount of time to walk from your room to the front door of any casino resort! However, after the second day this did become a little tiring, constantly walking the same routes simply to get out of the hotel and see the sights. The hotel is also completely non-smoking. This is not a problem for us and was actually quite refreshing having come from the more smokey Mirage. We ordered room service once and the food was delicious but the guy who delivered it stood around for a tip for what seemed like forever. Even though I gave $10 tip when I signed, I felt pressured into another $5 to get him to leave the room! Tis put us off ordering again. All in all, we loved the room at Vdara. The staff were friendly. However, it lacks the facilities of other resorts and the walk to and from the strip through other casinos became tiring. I'd definitely recommend it if you have stayed in other casinos and are looking for something new but if it's your first time, stay in a casino resort for the real Vegas effect.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crawley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn oasis in Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "KPYG", "ReviewID": "UR121171562", "Content": "We stayed he in November 2011 and booked as part of a hotel and flight package. We have stayed at other locations in Las Vegas and was a bit apprehensive about the Vdara having read some of the reviews on here. We shouldn't have worried at all, this place is fantastic. Although this hotel is not directly on the strip you can easily get there in a 10 minute walk. The hotel has a link to the Bellagio which gives you easy access if youre going north up the strip. If you want to go south then cross over the road to the Aria and either walk down along the foot path or go through Crystals shopping centre. You can also get the free tram at Bellagio or Vdara. Our room was fantastic. Having seen the Vdara advertise on Facebook about their room views, we emailed ahead of our arrival and requested one. On our arrival we were greeted by very helpful member of staff. She noted that we had requested a view room and gave it to us at no extra charge. What a view we had, looking north up the strip with views of the Bellagio fountains. Magnificent. Our room was spacious and clean. We had a dining area, lounge, bedroom and large bathroom with bath and shower. The room had two tvs, hair drier, a separate fridge in addition to the mini fridge. As stated in other reviews there is no cutlery, robes or slippers in the room but we had all of these within 10mins of requesting them. We sampled the in room dining and were pleased but Vegas has so much more to offer food wise. $20 a night resort fee gets you in room Internet, bottled water, use of the pool and newspapers. Is it worth it? I don't think so but there are other hotels who don't charge this. You can get free wifi being just within the proximity of the hotel and you don't need to be a guest. It's clearly a fee they charge and are using these things to justify charging you for it and you can't opt out.

Cons: -Rooms did not black out well. -While the roooms look to be a good deal online the $20 Resort Fee quickly pushes the rooms into Aria/Cosmo/Wynn price range. -Rooms seem half done in areas like the lack of true black out, and lighting scheme. - No basic/expected amenities like bath robes, etc. (although you can call to get it done). -Uncomfortable furniture (beds are pretty good). Final thoughts: The hotel feels only 1/2 done. My buddies room lacking the table/chairs, the uncomfortable (but pretty) furniture, and the lack of a good lightning scheme and good black out curtains make the hotel feel that things are a bit rushed. Given that the price of the hotel is in the same range of some better options, unless you're dead set on staying in city center in a hotel without a casino there are better options.

On booking between Aria and Vdara we opted for Vdara as we felt the room was nicer for the money, we fully understood on booking that Vdara did not have it's own casino, had one bar and a cafe but knew it was a 3 minute walk into Aria that had all the amenties required for a trip to Las Vegas. Check In: seen a few others have had a bit of an issue on this one I think it depends on when you check in and it ss luck as to how busy it may be, we walked right in and checked in no problem, we were asked if we wanted a room on a high floor and from reading up on Vdara I knew some rooms had a view of the Bellagio fountains so we asked for one of them and we got it. On other days we did see more queues at reception so I could see how it might get busy but as I said no problems for us. Room: Room was very impressive 3 big windows that go the whole length of room, a separate sitting area divided by tv/clothes unit with 2 large screen tvs, 1 for bedroom side and 1 for sitting area, there is also a kitchen area that has a table with 2 chairs a 2 ring cooker,microwave and fridge. Bathroom has a shower, sink and nice soaking tub, a hairdryer is provided. There is a nice sized built in wardrobe that also houses iron and the safe. If you require cutlery you have to phone down to get it which I understand as to have cutlery in all rooms would create more work for housekeeping to keep clean and we would not have used it anyway. The other on request item are bathrobes, I believe as it is 5 star those should be in room without request. The lights and curtain controls are in middle of room I think they should be beside so you can operate lights and curtains from bed. Bar,Cafe and foyer: As there is only 1 bar in Vdara I think it has to be spot on and it just lacked the service levels I would expect, we found it slow to get drinks when it was quiet and that was on 2 seperate occasions, cannot fault the quality of drinks or the bar itself just not 5/5 I am sure it is fine most of time but just slow on our 2 visits. The cafe is a little small for the amount of rooms in hotel so it was busy, the menu was good though and food was also nice. Foyer area is nice with security at lift entrance which is common in all Las Vegas hotels. In summary we would stay here again it is a lovely hotel with lovely rooms, it is well located next to Aria and its casino and restaurants and Bellagio is close too. We recommend this hotel highly but what gives it the 4 stars rather than 5 is that service level and the MGM Mlife card. We found the Mlife card took a lot longer to get points/comps than our last vist at Wynn resorts.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton Square, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cI like VDARA\u201d", "Author": "Alexredrock", "ReviewID": "UR121065581", "Content": "pos: comfortable room,view on the Bellagio fountain,no casino, no smoke aria,quiet neg: very, very small cafe", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "Fair_Minded_Dude", "ReviewID": "UR121064583", "Content": "Where to start....

This was my 1st time here and while it was enjoyable, there were a couple hiccups along the way. First the pros - Vdara is entirely non-smoking and when you walk in the lobby you can actually breathe and get a fragrant floral aroma. For me the fragrance was turned up a bit too high but still, I loved the non-smoking aspect. Our suites were well appointed with a small stove, microwave, and fridge. They provide you 2 small bottles of water a day but our room attendant was very kind and let us have some extra if we were going out etc. The seating area and bed area are divided by a wall with 2 flat screens on both sides. The bathroom is huge with soaking tub and glass shower (water pressure was so-so). For a $20 \"resort\" fee (this is per room, per day) you get free wi-fi and I guess those bottles of water every day. I didn't get a chance to visit the pools or gym but perhaps those amenities help make up the fee as well. The hotel has a tram to City Centre which is a bunch of upscale shops but also some more affordable restaurants. It is close to Bellagio which was nice as we went to their buffet. It is more towards one end of the strip so yes, you will have to walk a little if you want to see Venetian, Treasure Island, etc. The cons - We pulled up in our taxi and no one was there to greet us, help with luggage or guide us to the door. We ended up having to unload the luggage ourselves and wander around to find the proper door to enter. Up in the room we requested kitchenware, a coffee maker, and sheets for the sofa bed. When we came back later in the day we had the kitchenware and sheets but no coffee maker. They did not make up the sofa beds for us - we had to do that ourselves and it turned out so uncomfortable that we decided to forego it. When we called to inquire about the coffee maker (which was there the last time my family visited), housekeeping told us they were not allowed to deliver it but if we called customer service and got an ok, they would bring it up. When we called customer service we were told our \"deluxe suite\" did not include a coffee maker and this was only for the more expensive rooms. Um, what?? What hotel room does not come with a coffee maker? When asked to speak to a manager, they said the same thing. Wow Vdara, I cannot believe you can't afford to put a coffee maker in a DELUXE suite and yet still charge a $20 \"resort fee\" per day. Even Holiday Inn Express has a coffee maker in the room. We were told if we wanted coffee to go to the market downstairs to purchase one. !!!! Finally after much hassle customer service allowed us to have a coffee maker. Housekeeping would not always remember to leave more k-cups (we had to write a note) and while they were great in taking the dirty mugs from the sink, they did not replace them so we had to use paper cups we brought with us. I did grab b-fast at the market downstairs once but the line was extremely long and when I got up there they had just about run out of every b-fast food item. I can't imagine having to come downstairs for a cup of coffee every day. Overall I had a great trip.... the big bonus for me is the non-smoking but I will seriously reconsider the next time I look for a hotel in Vegas.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oradell, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat introduction to Las Vega\u201d", "Author": "NoaandOmar", "ReviewID": "UR120926814", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a 4 day stay at the Vdara all suite hotel in LV.

You have to like to walk. There is a covered walkway (300 ft walk ?) from the Vdara lobby to the tram station in Bellagio. The tram runs from the north end of CityCenter (Bellagio) to the south end (Monte Carlo. By tram/foot you are 30 minutes from the showroom in MGM, and 35 minutes (using also the Mandalay Bay tram) from Mandalay. It's not so convenient going up the strip. Our late night cab ride from the airport was $20 including T&T. Going to the airport, some cabbies take the freeways which probably is a good idea but adds $10. Every one of the rooms we have stayed in have had an excellent view looking N/NE toward the upper strip. You look down on the dancing waters of the Bellagio fountains. No accompanying audio -- but incredible visually... especially at night. During this trip (mid 11/2011) -- admittedly low season -- the nice, large breakfast and lunch restaurant adjacent to the lobby has had a sign \"Closed for a Private Party\" but appeared deserted.

There aren't enough tables so plan on taking it up to your room... The staff is nice enough. In each of our visits, I've snapped cell phone pictures of the room layout, fixtures, and especially the desk/audio/video center, which has a nice design so when I have my home office redesigned, I'll have some visual cues.

I had difficulty pulling the bed frame out, and it took a long time for housekeeping to come to make an attempt at it. (I had to call three times, and it was easily 60 minutes before anyone from the hotel came to help). The housekeeping staff had no luck either, and could not tell me when they would be able to find someone from the engineering department to try to fix it. Since it was 2:30 am already, I decided not to bother with the sofa bed that night. They eventually fixed it the following day. Also, housekeeping service was a little disappointing for a five star property. The trash cans were not emptied after the room was cleaned one day, and clean wine glasses were not replaced after used ones were taken away by the cleaning crew.

I personally like the location. Its right next to the Bellagio but offset from the strip. This means its a bit of sanctuary from the Las Vegas craziness but minutes away from it when you want it. The downside was the restaurant/food options. There is a convenience deli sort of place and something called the Silk Road which my company had rented out for the trip. In Vegas you expect a selection of good restaurant options in the hotel/casino itself to select from. This leads to the other aspect which might not be to some peoples liking, this Hotel doesn't have a casino in it.

The pool at the vdara altough rather small compared to other hotels was nice and relaxing.

Also there is no restaraunts in the property just a cafe \"which did not bother us since there are so many great food options in Vegas\". The biggest downfall of the hotel is the customer service they are terrible, They double charged both myself and my girlfriends credit cards the full rate \"we were splitting the room price\". Spoke to the manager on the phone after check out about the situation and she was extremly rude it took over a week for the problem to be fixed.

It was astounding!!! We arrived early (aroun 11 am) and knew we probably would not be able to check into our room yet, but thought it would be worth checking. The front desk informed us our room as not yet cleaned, but they would hold a room for us. If we came back in a couple of hours we could check in at the \"Invited\" check in area and not wait in the line. It took two more tries, but the wait was well worth it! Our room had the most breath-taking views of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip. Wow!!! From the 52nd floor it felt like we could see the entire city and the mountains. The City suites are so spacious! We asked for extra hangers, place settings for the kitchen and detergent because I already had clothes to wash. All of these items were brought to our room within minutes of arriving. Great servcie!! Our room was spotless the entire time we were there. It was wonderful having a full sized fridge and microwave. Eating leftover lobster pasta for breakfast was yummy! It seemed every time housekeeping cleaned our room they took our soap. Whatever was sitting out in the shower they threw out and repaced with a new bar. I've never seen a hotel do that! Unfortunately by the end of our stay we were a bar or two short and had to move our one remaining bar from the sink to the shower to the tub. I'm sure with a quick call to housekeeping we could have requested another bar or two, but we ended up just moving around our lone remaining bar and chuckling about it. Everything about Vdara was relaxing and peaceful. It is completely non-smoking--a rare gem in Las Veags. Every time we walked back into the lobby I took a deep breath and said, \"I love it here!\" The air was fresh and wonderful. The walk from the lobby to the room elevators was short and sweet. A nice change from most Vegas mega-resorts. Aria and Belligio are within EASY walking distance so it feels like everything is right where you are. I loved it! It was unseasonably chilly (certainly NOT Vdara's fault LOL) and we did not use the pool areas, but did walk around them. While the pool area is small, it was very appealing. And with cabanna's renting for only $125 on a week day, we will probably rent one the next time we are in town. We loved it so much we will return in May.

A couple of small things I find inconsistent with otherwise great place to stay: 1. The showers only have the \"old style\" single handle water volume/temperature control. I find it strange that they decided to save on faucets while making this high end property. 2. Lack of good way to print boarding passes. One more gripe - $20/day \"resort fee\", which covers internet access, access to fitness room, and 2 12 oz bottles of purified water. Unfortunately many hotels are going this way, and the issue is that it is mandatory, even if you do not want any of the services the fee covers. The good part is that the hotel is literally steps away from Aria and Bellagio (from the same MGM group), and also from Cosmopolitan (different group), which offer a vast variety of restaurants, etc. Overall quite enjoyable stay at Vdara.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazing rooms in a low key resort\u201d", "Author": "LikeItIs-Reviewer", "ReviewID": "UR120513038", "Content": "The Vdara is definitely the place to stay if you value a great hotel room over resort facilities and amenities. The rooms are awesome - its an all suite resort so as standard the rooms have a kitchen/dining area, lounge with fold out sofa bed, two big flat screen TVs and a big bathroom with separate soaker tub and walk in shower. The decor is very modern, with cool lighting and colour schemes and electric shades and blackout blinds. The bed was unbelievably comfortable and on the whole it's really the kind of room you'll be happy to spend a lot of time in. Even better if you can get a north facing room with partial views of the Bellagio fountains. The rest of the hotel is very pared back and unlike other Vegas resorts. If having a huge dining selection, casino and shopping in your hotel is important to you, then the Vdara may not be ideal. Dining options in the hotel are very limited, but given the location right between the Aria, Bellagio and Cosmopolitan you are only steps away from other resorts who have all that in spades. The pool area was fitting for the hotel - simple and stylish. In high season when everyone wants to be down there, it may get a little crowded, but I can't see it ever having the type of pool scene for those who want to party all afternoon. A few minor annoyances: - the blackout shades have a one inch gap between panels which limits their effectiveness\u00a0 - the hot water takes a l-o-n-g time to come through in the shower - why give all the suites a kitchen if you then have to call to get kitchenware stocked in the suite?

The hotel is new and is in a good location with direct access to the Bellagio and the strip. This hotel doesn't have it's own casino which makes it cheaper in price, faster to access the room and clean from cigarette smoke. For the gamblers, the Bellagio casino is within a 7 minute walk and there is also access to the casino of the Aria hotel which we did not visit. We very much liked the location if the hotel as all the major attractions and shops were in walking or short drive distance. Upon arrival, we discovered that the hotel only has a valet parking and no close self parking option. This was quite disappointing for us as we like to have direct access to our vehicle, didn't plan on tipping the valet for each time we needed the car and watching the valet drivers running around trying to get the guests cars out in time, made us feel pretty bad for them. I hope they get paid well for this tough job. As we entered the hotel, there was a rather short queue at the front desk for check-in and 3 receptionists dealing with the guests. Shortly after, one receptionist stopped working on check-in, another disappeared into a room in the back leaving only one receptionist to handle the check-in. We waited over 20 minutes, while there were only 7 people in front of us. As we asked for a room on a high floor with a good view to the Bellagio fountains, we were given a room on the 30th floor which had an amazing view to the fountains. The room was large, clean and comfortable. We liked it very much. The only downside we found was that there is a small space between the sets of blinds which allows enough light to shine in during the early morning hours and wake us up. Our most disappointing experience was on our second night, when we were woken up at 5 in the morning by what sounded like a helicopter. We called the reception to ask them what the source of the noise was but they did not know. It was only after the second call that the receptionist was willing to check with security who told her that these were the backup generators of the Bellagio which were being tested. This lasted for 45 minutes. Following this experience and also some service problems we got from the lost&found department, the hotel had the decency to deduct the resort fee from our bill without us asking them to do so. In general, several hotels in Vegas have now stopped charging a resort fee and I personally think this hotel should follow. To summarize: the location is great, the room was nice, but I think they definitely need some improvements on the customer service side.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAn Amazing 5-Star Sanctuary\u201d", "Author": "scottanderson1978", "ReviewID": "UR120483628", "Content": "My wife and I just spent 6 nights at the Vdara Hotel & Spa and absolutely loved it. We were told by our Expedia concierge that we would feel spoiled after staying there and he was absolutely right! The location was excellent - the Vdara is located in the City Centre complex right in the heart of the Strip next to the Bellagio. There was a free 24-hour tram service which ran from the Vdara to the Aria and then onto the Monte Carlo which came in very handy, and otherwise we were able to walk almost anywhere else we needed to. One of many aspects of the Vdara we liked was the fact that there was no casino located in the hotel - this equated to no noise, no smoking and a much more relaxed, refined atmosphere as a result. Our room was on the 48th floor and it was absolutely our sanctuary from the hussle and bussle of Sin City - the quietest hotel room we have ever stayed in with the comfiest King bed we have ever slept in. We had a great view of the south side of the Strip, and the room in general was immaculate in terms of cleanliness and design. The kitchenette was cool (although we really didn't use it other than the fridge) and the bathroom was very spa-like. There are resort fees at the Vdara amounting to $20/day, but we felt this was fair (even though we admittedly didn't take full advantage of the associated amenities) as having free unlimited high speed Internet access was a huge plus for us. The maid service was always thorough, the concierge was very accessible and the front desk was always helpful - excellent customer service all around. As for dining, we visited various places on the Strip for dinner each night, however when it came to breakfast/lunch/brunch we had a special deal as part of our booking which covered up to $40/day in buffet meals at any MGM resort (with a couple exceptions). Although the Vdara did not have a buffet we walked over to the Aria most mornings (only 3 minutes away) and took advantage of their excellent buffet - fair price and very fair offerings. With respect to airport transportation there are no scheduled shuttle pick-ups to/from the Vadara, but we simply phoned one of the shuttle services and they had no problems picking us up on request. $7 one-way versus the same trip costing $25-$30 via taxi. All in all, we have nothing bad to say about the Vdara. This hotel is truly a 5-star experience and well worth the money.

We saw that Vdara had good reviews and is new so ended up booking 3 rooms there. I even splurged and got the Vdara suite for my husband and I to make it extra special. Along with hotel arrangements, I also made reservations at Cut steakhouse one month ahead of time just to make sure that our party of 7 would get the reservation at the time we want. Then after dinner we would have enough time to get into our costumes and go to the Club that we want. It was Halloween weekend so I knew that it would be very crowded. The problem started almost immediately as we checked in to the hotel. First, we drove around looking for the self parking garage, and couldn't find it (or signs that say there's no self parking at Vdara). We circled around several times which is painful because Las Vegas blvd is busy. Finally I called and the hotel said that Vdara only does valet...which is unusual for Las Vegas. Anyway, so we dropped off our car and checked in. Our suite was pretty nice but as soon as I sat down on the couch in the living room, I felt my socks getting wet. There was a large wet spot on the carpet right in front of the couch. I'm sure many people will agree when I say how much I hate wet socks. Not sure what that puddle was (and praying it wasn't puke from previous guests), we called the hotel asking someone to take a look at it. Mind you that this was immediately as we got into the room on Friday afternoon. A guy came, looked at it, didn't offer anything useful and just gave us some towels to put on top. We decided against changing rooms at this time (bad mistake) because I had already unpacked and thought this spot should dry up soon. Moving on to Saturday, the big day. We got back to the hotel at 3pm and the room was still not made up. The wet spot was still just as wet as yesterday. We called the hotel asking someone to take a look at it again and to make up the room. By 4pm, still no one came. So we called again and then left for the pool for a quick bit of sun. Came back at 4:30 to get ready for the big night. Our dinner reservation is at 6pm. We were planning on being ready by 5:30 and have the family up in our suite for a quick round of drinks before heading out. As we walk up to our room, our door was open, there was a huge cart outside and 6 people in the room. We asked what is going on and apparently that wet spot was from a leak from the AC and they had moved all the furniture in order to strip the carpet!! Who does this during a guest's stay without asking them first whether if it's okay with them? To have 6 strangers go into your room with all your belongings tearing apart the living room is NOT what I expect to deal with at a 5 start hotel. Additionally, the maid is cleaning the bedroom and bathroom at the same time! Bear in mind that NO one had apologized to us at this time for this craziness. We asked if they could come back to do this after we check out tomorrow since we are now running late in getting ready for dinner. They hesitated...which in my opinion shouldn't even be an option for them...and finally agreed. But it took a long time for them to move back the furniture and clear out the room. Meanwhile the maid is still taking his time cleaning the bathroom so we still could not get ready. Imagine my husband and I just standing in the middle of the suite with all these strangers there and a mess everywhere while time is ticking away. By now, I decided that we need to switch rooms because there just isn't enough time waiting for these people to get out. Again no one was around to help us. We called the front desk explaining this and asking to switch us to the nearest room so we can get ready. One woman came over saying she is the manager then said she will ask the manager to see if we can get another room (....i thought she was the manager??). After several more phone calls by us to the front desk (because no one came back or called us), they said finally they found another room and someone will come to take us to the other room. Meanwhile I had to frantically clear out everything in the room and dump them in the luggages (which irritated me so much because all of our nice dressy clothes/costumes has to be shoved in the luggage). Still after an hour (now it's 5:30) no one has come to get us to a new room!!!! The restaurant couldn't move back our reservation because surprise surprise, it's full! So now we are looking at possibly missing our dinner reservation and having to scramble for some random restaurant that can accommodate 7 people at the last minute....after all the time I spent researching on restaurants. So I hauled my stuff down to my mother in law's room to use her shower. My husband still had to wait at the mess of a room for \"someone\" to come to take him to our new room. Any woman knows that 15 minutes is not enough time to shower and get ready for a fancy night that you had planned for months! I was so frustrated and overwhelmed at this time that I broke down in tears (which I NEVER do in public). We rushed out of the hotel (my hair wet) without being able to do our little pre dinner get together and luckily reached the restaurant without losing our reservation. On to the following day, sunday. I called the hotel front desk to speak to customer service to give them feedback on this terrible experience. The woman on the phone was apologetic and sounded sincere. She asked for my phone number and said that she will call me after talking to her manager and credit us some money back in an attempt to remedy the situation. I had calmed down by then and hearing someone apologizing finally made me feel better. I would have been okay without any credit back at this point but since she offered, I figured why not. Many days has passed since that day and no one from Vdara has called me. We saw a credit of $44.80 on our card.....what the heck does this mean? This is so insulting. Do they think that this horrible ordeal has a price of $44.80? Additionally, because we were rushed out of our suite in such a hectic manner, we forgot my husband favorite tiger's eye bracelet and our family halloween photo (that we paid for at the foundation room) in the suite. A reasonable person would see this and easily be able to figure out who this belongs to. Especially after this ordeal. They have our contact info, phone number, email, etc. They could have and should have contacted us immediately to notify us. Nope, no one did. We had to call the hotel's lost and found (after being on hold for a long time, then hung up on, then redialed) to find out that they do have our things but wasn't planning on letting us know! Sorry for the long rant. I feel so strongly about this and wanted everyone to know how unprofessional Vdara is. I feel like we were dealing with amateurs. We have stayed at almost every hotel in Las Vegas from 3-5 stars. No place was this terrible and unprofessional. I feel so insulted by this hotel. I will NEVER stay here again. I will tell all of our friends and family to not stay there. Oh last thing, the valet only situation at this hotel is very inefficient. Especially during check out time, there were crowds of people waiting outside for like 2 valets to run back and forth like crazy to get everyone's cars. Again, just another example of amateurs who set up this hotel. Save your preciously earned money and stay anywhere else instead. I recommend the Wynn which is our normal go to hotel.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAwesome stay!\u201d", "Author": "iamindy22", "ReviewID": "UR120252973", "Content": "This was my first trip to Vegas and we would love to stay at Vdara again.

We were just in Vegas in July and stayed at the Wynn in a corner view deluxe, so we know our hotels. We wanted to try something different. Actually I think for a younger couple the Vdara is even better. Big bonuses for airy, non-smoky and serene lobby--very nice to come back to after the noise of slot machines/smoky casinos and 'see and be seen' venues like at the Cosmopolitan. But the biggest bonus is the location. You get a great-sized room with very modern decor, a super comfortable bed, a soaking tub with a separate shower, and if you opt for the second elevator bank, a great view of the Bellagio fountains. It's sort of a kiddie-corner view, so you don't get to see them all front and center as if you were staying at the Bellagio, but it's a great view of the fountains and the strip. Bonus points for: -cleaning our room first thing as we left around 9 am every morning. I absolutely DETEST big hotels where you are waiting around all day for someone to clean your room and you have to call down to housekeeping frequently -short check-in line (very much in contrast to the Wynn, where it took 1/2 an hour to initial checkin) -clean, neat, and smoke-free lobby with a great little cafe with great cappuccinos/espressos and snacks -indoor walkway to the Bellagio and all the amenities/shopping in the Bellagio -short tram to CityCenter/Crystals and Hermes (of course, gentlemen, that may NOT be good for you if your wife finds this out) -around the corner from restaurants at Aria and Cosmopolitan. We could walk to restaurants even in my 5 inch heels every night...so nice not to have to cab everywhere. -best location on the strip--proximate to everything. -Very helpful staff--extra kudos to the doormen/taxi stand staff. Really nice guys. All in all, I actually think we liked Vdara MORE than the Wynn! Negatives: -Vdara does not have gambling, shopping, and restaurant venues inside itself proper, so you have to walk to a restaurant. For us this wasn't a negative, but gamblers and diners who don't want to leave the property via a short walk or tram might not like it. For us it was well worth the short walk to have a QUIET place to come back to at night.

The rooms are the back of the hotel are quiter so take your pick - the rooms at the front can be noisy but you do get views over the strip and over the mountains. You do get aircon noise but will get used to that pretty quickly. Service is exceptional - discrete and attentive - nothing is too much trouble. Staff are friendly and efficient. Rooms are changed frequently, in some cases twice a day. Pool area and spa are lovely - small but not too busy. The pool area is trendy with music playing, waitresses and bar.

Check in was prompt and painless. We were in a corner executive suite on the 24th floor. One of the primary reasons we chose this hotel, is that it does not have a casino in it. The room was quite spacious and flowed very nicely. The decor was modern minimalist which I really appreciated. My two main criteria in which I judge a hotel room are the bed which was quite nice I slept very comfortably. The second criteria is the water pressure in the shower. I have to admit the water pressure was lacking. Our room had many windows and it was nice that these were all easily controlled electronically and the room did include blackout curtains. My review title mentions a snafu. As this trip was to celebrate a milestone birthday. I had arranged some special treats for the birthday girl prior to our arrival with the concierge. Her room was supposed to have some birthday balloons and a plate of choclates and fruit waiting in her room. Well this didn't happen! I immediately called down to the concierge to see what had happened. Alleriese told me she had seen the balloons go up, and I must be mistaken. I told her that I was in her room and they were not there. She basically called me a liar which was unacceptable. She did not offer to investigate or look into what had happened. We were pressed for time as we had tickets to a cirque show and had to leave. I did stop by the front desk on the way out and mentioned what had happened. I wanted to talk to the concierge but over our 4 day trip there was always line for the concierge. Luckily upon our return the snafu had been corrected. But I still had a sour taste in my mouth from my dealings with Allerise. So the next morning I went down early to discuss this situation with the hotel manager. He was not available however Hakan the chief concierge was. I relayed the situation from the previous night, and indicated my lack of faith for there execution on the birthday cake that was supposed to be delivered the following day. Hakan went to great lengths to assure me this would be executed as I wanted, and followed up with me several times to reassure me that things would go as planned. Overall it was Hakan's attentiveness making things right that allows this review to be a 4 versus a 1 or 2.

I kept all the dishes etc in the cupboards and they were never removed by the cleaning staff. The shop and cafe was excellent and very reasonable so we used it to buy salads and desserts. Many people went there to collect breakfast in the morning. The pool was quite busy but we could always get loungers. There was a bit of glare on the building but we just put up our umbrella until the sun moved a little, it was not a problem. This was one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in and would recommend it to anyone staying in Vegas.

We were lured by the no smoking and no casino aspect of this hotel, more on that later .... I had emailed the hotel one month before to let them know it was my husbands 50th birthday and was there any chance of a complimentary upgrade to a fountain view. I received a reply saying no problem - great! We checked in on a Tuesday afternoon - no queue but there definately is on Friday through Sunday, as weeekends are busier. We were given a room on the 16th floor, with no view! I rang and spoke to the front desk and reminded them of my original email and their reply. The best they could do was offer a possible move to a view room the next day. We have never done this in our lives but decided to agree and the next day we moved to a room (43032) on the 43rd floor with a full fountain view - fantastic! The room service was good, cleaned everyday but the last and we rang and requested, cups, pan (for boiling water, no kettles provided and robes and slippers) all with us within one hour. The hotel is modern and clean,. The Market Cafe is very small for the size of the hotel and is the only place you will find for food. Silk Road was not open once in our 10 day stay. Always a sign saying private party. It was sometimes used for conference dinners etc. I dont think we would have used it anyway as its a strange space age kind of bar, not very welcoming. Bar Vdara is weird, an afterthought. The outdoor seating and (swing?) looks out onto the car parl - nice! We all know that part of the Vegas holiday is the weather (which was great) which in turn means a great pool is essential. There is where the hotel fails, big time. For the size of the hotel, the pool is completely inadequate. It doesnt get sun until 10am (opens at 8am) and then to stay in the sun you would have to chase the sun around the pool, moving from bed to bed. The beds are crammed in each one touching the next, Im really not exaggerating. The space that is taken up for cabanas is wasted, I didnt see one used! There is a small jacquzzi too. We used the pool two mornings and tried one afternoon. I have never seen so many people crammed into one space, there wasnt a single bed unoccupied. This is not my idea of fun! There is music, which is a bit loud but bearable. At the weekends the music is turned up to give a `party atmosphere'. Several people complained, as in such a small space it was just too loud, they were taken no notice of. I dont mind music but want to be able to relax by the pool, which just wasnt possible. We decided to take matters into our own hands and went to see the concierge. If you want hours stolen from your holiday, this is the place. Sometimes only manned by one person and some staff more helpful than others, not good at all. We had already had a look around the Aria and Bellagio pools. We asked could we have some kind of pass to other hotel pools in the group (Aria/Bellagio). After much discussion the Manager at the Aria pool agreed we could have a pass for the next day. We went to the Aria the next day, amazing!!!! Three big pools, all bigger than the one at Vdara (not including the liquid party pool). Three big jaquzzis. Lots of trees, space and beds. It was heaven. Some music playing but not intrusive. We had a chat with the Aria pool Manager and he agreed that we could come to the Aria pool again. We went every day!!!! This saved our holiday, it sounds extreme but it made such a difference, it was wonderful. We spent so much time at the Aria. The smoking and casino element was just not an issue. We like a bit of a gamble and didnt really notice the smoking. There are so many choices for food. We ate at Blossom (Chinese) pricey but gorgeous. Sweet Chill, basic pastries/breakfast, never too busy. We also ate at Beso (Eva Longorias steak house in Crystals, not too pricey and great) and Wolfgang Puck in Crystals, pizza/pasta good value. We also had dinner at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Paris for my husbands birthday, gorgeous (book ahead for a great table). Apologies for the long review but wanted to get in as much as we could. I have no problem paying a resort fee (there is no choice!) but felt we should have paid ours to Aria as that was the hotel, hands down, that provided us with a great holiday.

The reception area is small and very cozy. The staff is very friendly and the girls working the reception are beautiful and classy. You don't feel like your in Vegas as there are no casino in this hotel. This is a big plus. You can get away from all that noise by going back to your hotel. The concierge booked for us at Circo next door at the Bellagio and we asked for a good table as it was our friends wedding and we got the best table of the restaurant. Both my wife and I loved it.

Express check-out on the TV did not work, and there was a big line at check-out (even bigger than check-in), so a hotel employee was collecting room keys and writing things down on a notepad and that was checkout. She said I would be receiving the hotel bill via email, but never did. I did, however, receive a spam message thanking me for staying there. We got our rooms off the price line website for $80/night each and felt we did not receive the price line treatment that some people sometimes report, which was a pleasant surprise. I am giving it a bad rating because of the following: we had two rooms. In one room we took a drink from the minibar to see how many ounces it had and put it back. We were charged $9 despite the fact we called and was told they would take it off the bill. The second room, my dad who was on his first visit to the US accessed a paid movie on the TV and backed out as soon as he realized it was paid. I explained this to the check-out lady with the notebook and she said would take the charge off, but that did not happen either.

I'm still staying here as a guest, so my review may be updated by the time I leave later in the week. Here's the problem: 1) the hotel room toilet seat was never cleaned. Housekeeping never bothered to clean the seat. I went to walgreens, bought my own bleach and wiped it down myself. 2) I paid a $20.00 \"resort fee\" fit each night I stay at the hotel. This amount is in addition to the room rate and taxes that I pay. Supposedly, the $20.00 is used to cover costs relating to free daily newspaper, Internet access. Well we never got our paper. What makes this whole situation worse is how customer service was handled by the hotel staff. So after I didn't notice a paper in my room I called the front desk and inquired. The representative who answered the phone at 10:05pm on 10/19/2011 said that there were plenty of newspapers available at the front desk for me to pick up. She told me to go downstairs and get my selection. I went downstairs and didn't see anything. Plus, there was a long line at the front desk so logically I went over to the desk just off tk thr side and asked the Asian woman on duty there for help. She frowned, and wasn't helpful at all. She told mr there weren't any papers either and that if I wanted one I needed to walk over to the aria hotel to get it myself. Frustrated, I went back to my room, complained to the front desk about this and asked them to remove the $20.00 resort fee charge. Word of advice to all travelers: you should not have to pay $20.00 for a daily newspaper that was promised and never delivered. Also, you should not have to physically walk downstairs to get something that wasn't ever available in the first place.you should also never expect to get good customer service at vdara. I'm still at the hotel right now. Hopefully they'll work out their mistakes before I leave their premises. And I hope they will remove the $20 charge that they agreed to do.\u00a0 I told the blond security lady working the night shift on 10/19/11 and she promised to find a paper for me, which she did and had personally delivered it to my room. Thank you. She worked hard to find it for me. Regardless, I am still not paying the $20 bogus charge for the night.

We had a partial view of the fountains at Bellagio (we could pretty much see the whole thing - see photos). The room was nice - it was clean. There looked like a stain on the floor that they tried to get rid of, but it wasn't that noticeable. I liked how spacious the room felt. We had the one with a single TV instead of the one that has a separate living room from the bedroom. The bed was comfy and the pillows were very fluffy. The elevators are quick and the walk from the elevator to your room is really short. We intended to use the kitchen but didn't bother. You have to request kitchen utensils if you want to use the stove. There is no coffee maker in the room - first time I've ever seen this. There is a small fridge - VERY small. If you have left overs from dinner, it might not fit. To smaller than average sized bottles of water fit and that's about it. The Marketcafe on the main floor sells 6-packs of eggs, bacon, etc which was handy. Housekeeping did a good job each day. They always arranged our toiletries & stuff in the washroom very nicely. They would forget things from time to time - one day they forgot to give us face cloths, another day they forgot to leave a bath mat, another day they didn't replenish the shampoo (which I loved by the way. It was their own brand and for whatever reason, it left my hair very shiny). The shower has a rain showerhead so the pressure isn't strong, which I kinda missed. In terms of location, it's in between Aria and Bellagio. Valet is complimentary, but if you want to self-park you have to do it at Aria and either walk through Aria to Vdara or take the tram from Monte Carlo (which is right by the self-parking lot, maybe a 2 min walk) to Bellagio. If you take the tram, take the elevator down because it's closer to the doors to Vdara. You can also park at Bellagio but the walk from the self-parking lot to Vdara is a bit longer because you have to make your way through the casino & hotel. I think it was still about a 10 min walk even though the parking lot is actually right next to Vdara. I didn't check out the pool because it was cold while we were there. I didn't think i would, but I missed having a casino in the hotel. If we wanted to do anything we had to walk all the way to Aria, Bellagio or drive somewhere. When you're really tired after walking around all day, the trek back to Vdara was kind of annoying. I have stayed in Aria before and think I would prefer to stay there. I had very little interaction with customer service - they left me a message once because housekeeping said they weren't able to clean my room because of the Do Not Disturb light when in fact they did clean our room. The person I spoke to was very nice and apologetic. I lost & found on the last day because my husband lost a hat somewhere between the tram at Bellagio and the self-parking lot at Aria and I was asked to hold and nobody came back after 20 min. When I called again I got someone totally different and they helped me. We prepaid for this trip using expedia. When we checked in, they had to pre-authorize $100/night + the resort fee/night on our credit card. Make sure you have enough room to cover this or else you might not get your room!

We could have upgraded to a larger suite with a coffeemaker for an additional $20 dollars a night. Frankly that's a lot for a small coffee maker. Also, I thought it was quite telling that the small coffee shop/cafe in the lobby sold small coffee makers and ground coffee. Also, the kitchen area didn't have basic items such as any flatware or plates. Since my mother is older we tended to have dinner early and would liked to have had a late night snack without always having to order room service, but without utensils it was very difficult.

(BTW, Thank you for clicking \u201cReview Helpful\u201d button!) Maybe the best in Vegas. Here\u2019s why: You stay on the Strip without the pushing and crowding of a casino-lobby. All the Casino you need is just steps away at the Aria and Belligio. All Suites. Free Aroma Therapy every time U walk in the place. Best bed you will ever sleep on. Front Desk staffed by Super Models. Ultra modern luxury appointed rooms. Eager helpful staff. I go to Vegas 2 or 3 times a year and stayed in the best of \u2018em but always go back to the Vdara since I discovered how good it is. There is just a home feel to it. A home in a bright future where everything works and everybody is nice! ROOM: Stayed in the Executive Corner Suite this time. Wow! Really strongly recommend this design. Add washer and dryer & another flat screen TV, lots of extra room to spread out & more views to the super nice regular suite, a True home away from home. If you want to use the full kitchen very much pack some paper plates, forks or plan ahead & call housekeeping in advance to have them bring you what you want. The only possible bad outcome is if you do not ask for the extras you will need, they will cheerfully bring you anything. BATH: Bathroom larger some rooms at Holiday Inn! Really nice large shower and nice to gaze at skyline while in the soaking tub. Robe and slippers nice touches. MORNING COFFEE if Critical for you, and it is for me! The in room coffee makers are back but only in the bigger suites. So - splurge on better room - splurge on the in room coffee service ordering it the night before and awaken to butler bringing coffee! - lobby store opens real early - stop by the Starbucks at the Fashion Show Mall & get Avia instant and a souvenir mug heat using in room microwave. All good options. A bad morning coffee experience only happens if unaware of the choices. SPAS: The spa here is full service and intimate. The one next door at the Aria is bigger and also really good, maybe better but not by much. The high balcony infinity pool built into the side of the Aria is a rare co-ed spa experience, very romantic. DINING: The Union in the Aria has the best sliders made of prime steak and a wicked good chocolate cake. Skip the Aria\u2019s buffet, it has all the charm & service of a high school cafeteria, try the Bellagio Buffet instead. Kitchen in room, lobby store to pick up something to put in it, room service fast (but maybe not 24 hr) and you eat at the real dining room table in your room. SHOPPING: Skip shopping at the Crystals mall. It is has down escalators with no corresponding up escalators, a \u201cyou can\u2019t get there from here\u201d maze-like nightmare walking design that traps you into long unwanted extra long walking past empty or ultra super uber high end stores. Very pretty though, architectural eye candy. But if you can afford these prices? Have your personal shopper go for you, they will be late. The mall at Cesar\u2019s, the Fashion Show Mall and the 2 outlet malls are much more fun. NEGATIVES: The high end Aveda shampoos and stuff disappeared after the first day though, not sure if they are dropping this brand or just trying to save money. One day after sleeping really late with the do not disturb button pushed I called to alert housekeeping around noon that I was leaving and they could now clean, when I returned at 4 it still was not done. In a one week stay these were the only 2 negatives so not too bad, and it took years and 4 or 5 stays here to have even these very minor complaints.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cTERRIBLE\u201d", "Author": "Molly B", "ReviewID": "UR119262585", "Content": "Vdara hotel, what a joke!

The pool is only opened from 8am - 6pm, the gym closes at 8pm, and so does the sauna. It costs $25.00 to use the sauna, plus the hotel charges a mandatory \"resort fee\" for using gym facilities, internet and for turn down service. I needed none of this - but had to pay this fee anyway. I attended the IMEX Meeting and incentive trade show and was surprised to find Vdara as an exhibitor.

I selected Vdarra because it is a non-smoking hotel without a casino. To get to my conference each day I plowed through smoke-filled flashing neon casinos, laced with gyrating semi-nudes and five different rock songs simulatenously blaring at full-blast. Each evening, my frayed senses welcomed soft colors, quiet and fresh air. The immaculate rooms are tastefully decorated with state of the art features and wonderful toiletries. You can also check out from the television in your room as long as it is not the night before a morning departure. I had an early morning departure but the front desk checked me out the night before which saved me time and stress. Here's the downside: When I checked in I was first notified of additional $20.00 per day \"resort fee\" for the use of a land line (no joke) in my room and newspapers in the lobby. I told the front desk that I didn't need to use such things and I wanted to \"opt out.\" I was told that I had to pay the extra fee anyway. Since I pre-paid the hotel stay, I was trapped. Apparently, many LV hotels do this. Therefore, it makes sense to ask about this before you book. Despite this fee, although I had a kitchenette, there were no plates or utensils. The hotel requires that you ask for them to be brought to your room. After I requested them, I still didn't get them. I had to request them again. The hotel waived one night's resort fee however. Inexplicably, the hotel give does not include coffee mugs in the set of utensils and plates delivered to your room. When I stumbled upon a conference room and borrowed a mug,the conference staff told me that their attendee-Vdarra guests complained about this. It follows that the hotel does not supply coffee makers in the room or offer coffee or tea in the lobby either. You are allowed two bottles of free water a day in one of the room refrigerators. If you open the stocked refrigerator and touch an item 30+ seconds, you will be charged for it, even if you put it back. Yes, I had to ask about this rule. It costs $10.00 to use the business center for either 10 or 15 minutes. They will allow you to get a boarding pass however. The concierge is free but there are long lines in the morning. By afternoon the lines disappear. To paraphrase JP Morgan, if you have to ask Vdarra how much their basic services cost, you probably can't afford to stay there. However, if you don't share Morgan's philosophy and there are certain services you need, I recommend that you call ahead of time to find out how much they cost and then decide whether you want to book a pre-paid room. Factor in an extra $110.00 for a five night stay.

We specifically wanted a non-smoking, non-casino hotel to avoid the hustle and bustle but still wanted easy access to the main spots on the strip. The Vdara met all our expectations and covered all our requirements. The first thing you'll notice as you walk into the hotel is the amazing smell. It smells like a spa - a combination of various essential oils. Absolutely beautiful. There was a small queue at check-in when we arrived but the desk was fully staffed and we waited approx 5 minutes, maybe less. The girl on the desk was extremely friendly. We had booked a Lake View Suite and I asked if she would be able to put us on a high floor so that we could get an even better view. This was no trouble at all for her and she put us on the 34th floor, room 028. When we walked into the room, we were astounded by the view. We pretty much directly overlooked the Bellagio lake and fountain show. We also had views of Paris and the Flamingo on the strip and the Rio off to the left. By far the most spectacular aspect was the views of the surrounding mountain ranges. They were just beautiful. We loved watching them change colour in the morning and evening as the sun rose and set. We couldn't have asked for any better - top marks. The room itself was gorgeous - a little kitchenette (that we didn't have cause to use), a dining area, seating area, bedroom and bathroom. The bed was fantastic. We're used to a firm bed at home but this bed was like sleeping on a marshmallow. Maybe not what I'd choose for a permanant basis but a lovely treat for a week's holiday. It was also massive. I found it hard to get out of each morning. The bathroom was great. Large walk-in shower with adjustable shower head to change pressure. Lovely big bath with overhead shower and large vanity unit with sink and mirror. Housekeeping came every day and made our bed and tidied everything. They even neatly arranged cosmetics and toiletries. We didn't have any cause to deal with any staff during our stay but, on the occassions we saw them they were always very friendly and polite. The hotel is just off the strip but you can get there very, very quickly. There is a covered walkway that leads from Vdara directly into the Bellagio. This is a very pleasant walk as you're taken right through the Bellagio conservatory and lobby. The walk seems very quick because there's so much to look at but it probably takes about 10 minutes maximum. Vdara lobby is directly opposite the Aria lobby so you can get to a casino and bar in less than 2 minutes if you wanted. Aria leads onto the Crystals shopping centre which, in turn, leads onto the strip so, again, another 10 minute walk to the strip in a different direction. We had a $20 buffet allowance each, every day. Vdara does not have a buffet but the allowance could be used in the Aria, MGM Grand, Luxor, Mandalay Bay (and others that I can't remember). We went to the Aria most mornings because it was so close. The buffet there was amazing and the hotel is really nice and new too. We tried MGM Grand one day. The variety was even better than the Aria but the place itself wasn't so nice. You just had to give your Vdara room number and show ID and they'd charge to your room. Vdara then remove the charge from your bill. Only spent one day at the pool. It was lovely. Towels are provided there and there were loads of loungers. Pool was a little smaller than usual but was amply sized. All in all, I would definitely recommend Vdara.

The entire hotel has 1 small store/shop, and it closes at 8pm. They have 1 bar, which holds about 20 people max. No restaurant, no place for water/soda...zilch. Every morning the line for coffee is *out the door* (20-25 minutes minimum) and angry customers are cursing and muttering about how awful it is. There's one line with two registers and whether you want coffee, food or toiletries, get ready to wait. Forget about getting through to the concierge - calls go to a recording where and the line in the lobby was consistently 20 minutes. I used my iPhone a lot. One day I stopped at the front desk and waited the 30 minutes in line, so I could speak with the manager. I explained how frustrating it was to wait 20-25 minutes each morning for a cup of coffee. She (Anar Shah) suggested I get coffee at the Bellagio or Aria! (You can't make this stuff up). I said that I didn't want to have to go to a different hotel for coffee. The woman next to me at the desk was complaining about her stay, and asked for incidentals to be comp'd on her bill. They weren't offering anything, except suggestions to go elsewhere. I went from annoyed to heated and walked off. They built this place 2 years ago and simply didn't include enough amenities. Now they're hurting for money and I guess they cut way back on staff to control costs.

That experience was, well, a mix of highs and lows. Vdara is designed to be an quiet, calm oasis away from the other casinos on the Strip. It doesn't contain a casino, which means that it doesn't make a lot of money in 2011, so MGM (the owners of the property and the enormous CityCenter complex) really aren't huge fans of you finding your way here. You can get to Vdara through either the Bellagio or Aria casinos. I walked through the Aria to find my way to Vdara, and after a couple of signs pointing me in the right direction, the trail went cold. Encouraging me to stick around and gamble, perhaps? Fortunately, I was not ashamed enough to ask a security guard, who directed me to Vdara and didn't once beg me to stay and gamble. How quaint! Vdara itself smells ... spa-like. There are air fresheners in the elevators and plenty of green features to the building's interior design. It's like someone gave an interior decorator $500 million and sent them to a mall that just had Bed, Bath, and Beyond, The Body Shop, and Whole Foods. That's not to say that it isn't a pleasant experience, just ... odd. Check-in was quick and painless. There is a small cafe in the lobby of the hotel, but it was closed at 10 PM, even as the bars were open. There didn't appear to be anywhere else within the hotel to buy essentials, so if you woke up at 3 AM with a headache or in need of a drink, unless I'm missing something, you would have to trek outside in your PJ's and head across the way to the gift shop in Aria. The rooms themselves are reasonably spacious. My room had a kitchenette, but no silverware was included within the room; I had to call downstairs if I wanted to have silverware sent up. This screams \"People were stealing our silverware.\" The room had electric drapes and a big, comfortable, clean bed. A small dinner table had seats for four; while there was a futon with a small coffee table that would comfortably sleep another person, there is no way you were sticking four people in this room. The room also had a large flat-screen TV on the wa... Well, let me clarify. The room did have a large flat-screen TV on the wall. The only problem is that when I turned the TV on, it spewed a mix of random colors that wobbled back and forth on the screen. There was also a weird spider web image that came to a point on the side of the screen. This happens when - yes - someone punches, drops, or otherwise breaks a television set. And this useless broken set had naturally gone unreported, so it was up to me to tell the hotel that the room I'd been in for an hour had a busted TV and that I had nothing to do with it. Fortunately, MGM appears to have taken my (honest) word that I didn't break the television. When I called the front desk to report the problem, the hotel sent a technician up to take a look at it. The technician agreed with my observation about the brokenness of the television, but noted, \"We don't have any of those TVs left!\" He then suggested that the front desk might try and offer me a new room that had a working television, but I pointed out that it was nearly 1 AM, had unpacked everything I had, and really just wanted to go to sleep without moving my things to another room. He noted that he would call the front desk for me and ask if they could take care of something for me. (Nothing ended up happening, but this was a complimentary stay, so there really wasn't much that they could do beyond send me up some free air fresheners.) Of course, this surely doesn't happen in everyone's room. But it was quite disappointing. After that, I went to sleep and then woke up, showered, and left. The bathroom is quite nice thanks to the large soaking tub, but only an average shower. The wi-fi was extremely effective. In all, this is a new hotel that serves as some sort of sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, and there's certainly a place for that. But it can be awful boring when someone's decided to break your TV. I recommend that when you check-in, ask for a room with a working television.

First time in Vegas so I am not sure if this is the norm, but it just felt very impersonal and they only seemed to care about the volume of people coming and going through the hotel. Check in desks were always busy as they were never fully staffed. 30mins to check in after a 10hr flight is not ideal. The room we had was really nice. However, our toilet broke 3 times in 6nts and most days it wasn't cleaned until 3/4pm. We just felt that they didn't care. We also had a room on the 5th floor facing the delivery area, so we were woken up daily with trucks coming and going. I think this was due to the fact we got a really good deal, so they allocated us a 'cheaper' room. Pool was very small with loud music pumping out all day.

If you are in Vegas for business, maybe it's an OK place to spend a few nights. Vdara is a typical average-class business hotel (like Marriott, Radisson, etc.) that could be located anywhere in the world. In general, the whole City Center architecture looks like an airport complex somewhere in Munich, or Amsterdam: nothing glamorous, nothing exciting. Vdara hotel is clearly an afterthought, since they were not able to sell those units as condos, and converted them to a hotel. If you are planning to go to Vegas for pleasure, and looking for a 5 star experience, I would recommend Bellagio and Wynn/Encore options, not City Center. Here are some of the key points of our experience with Vdara (deluxe room): - Check it was actually easy and quick, no issues there. - Room is not that as spacious as it looks on the pictures, divider in the middle makes it look like a suite, but it\u2019s actually just an average size room with a nice decor. - A lot of space is wasted by the kitchenette (and if you are not staying for extended period of time, simply wasted space) - Bathroom is rather small, probably the smallest I've seen in 5 star hotels in Vegas, with just one sink. - There is no issue with Vdara location, as far as its proximity to the casinos and strip. We easily walked everywhere. Aria is literally 2 minutes\u2019 walk, Bellagio is about 3 minutes. No problem at all. - We had a horrible experience with housekeeping. We left our room at 8 AM, turned on the switch for the housekeeping service, and came back at 2 PM just to find out that our room wasn't serviced. When we called to complain, we were told that they don't start working until 10 AM,???!! Who cares? It's 2 PM now! It seems that the hotel is consistently understaffed and don't have enough people to clean rooms (and don't care about complains). - Checking out. We got down to the front desk and saw a huge line. Probably 30+ minutes for check out, so we went back to our room and used TV service for self-check out. - Market caf\u00e9 looks like an airport fast food place and serves airport-like food. Also, the fact that Vdara is a non-smoking hotel is not such a big deal after all. There are always non-smoking rooms in other casinos, and in general, I've noticed that there are only a few smokers on the casino floor in Bellagio and Venetian (not how it used to be just a few years ago). Overall - will not recommend. Our friend who recently stayed at TI (Treasure Island) said that their renovated rooms are very similar to Vdara. It doesn't carry 5 stars, but at least you get the whole \"Vegas\" experience.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Big White, BC", "Title": "\u201cThis place rocks!

Loved the bed. There was 2 x 40\"flat screen tv's (we just had a basic room). The room was clean (carpet showing some stains but its a very light coloured carpet) High speed internet included in your resort fee - all plugs available to connect to tv - Ipod, USB (2) cables for wire in connection We were in a room on the 36th floor with a North View (Bellagio pools) View amazing, the blinds awesome. -Remote controlled and 2 sets of blinds. No elevator line ups, pool was awesome - (death-ray is accurate) Lots of options for shade with the umbrellas though. Bring your own sunscreen. Sunscreen is expensive here. $20 per bottle. Poolside menu was very reasonable- loved the ahi tuna salad. Only $10 Wasnt expecting housekeeping based on previous comments but we checked in on Thursday evening and had housekeeping on Friday but none on Saturday and checked out on Sunday.

The Vdara was not worth even the dscounted rate we paid. Before I get into the negatives, some of the positives were - - Nice large room with beautiful bathroom and soaking tub - Convenient to Bellagio and other City Center propertie (Aria, Cosmopolitan & Mandarin) - Comfortable bed - Pleasant Staff However, the negatives far outweighted these positives. They were: - check-in took an hour and a half. First desk clerk telling me to come back in a half hour and to put our bags with the bell clerk, the bell clerk told us to go outside to the bell stand, outside no one would help us, and at that point we gave up and held our bags. We were told after the half hour to go to the \"invited guests\" line which was longer than the regular check in line and took an additional 45 minutes waiting there just to see if our room was ready yet. All in all we got on the first line at 2:45 and did not put the key in our room door until 4:10pm. - Our room was never cleaned for our entire stay! When we inquired on the 2nd day having not received housekeeping, they told us that because we booked through discount travel website, we were not entitied to housekeeping services. WHAT? How is that 5* service? But more importantly - I don't want to stay in a hotel room that may not have been cleaned regularly - especially A) in vegas where partying in your room is common, B) god only knows what the people before us did in there and if the room was cleaned everyday then either, or B) when the turnover for rooms for check-in has to happen so quickly, how thoughouly could they possibly clean the rooms if it hasn't been touched in days?? - The pool is a joke. Its one small pool surrounded by concrete slab with the chairs backed in so tight you cant even get in or have any personal space. There is no greenery or anything even luxurious about it and it faces a parking garage. - The fitness center is about as big as my bedroom at home. - The \"Spa\" was closed for rennovation...isn't this a hotel \"& SPA\"?? and why wuld it need rennovation if it has only been open for about a year? - There is no restarurant in the hotel...isn't one of those stars in the 5* system supposed to be for FOOD? If you are hungry or want a quick bite, you can pay through the nose for a snack at the little cafe in the lobby or walk over to the Aria or Bellagio. - No robes in the room, we had to ask for them. - Why would you have a kitchen in each room without putting anything in it - no even a corkscrew or a few forks or knives?? - I couldn't use their wireless internet to access my work with my laptop. I work remotely and use a laptop when I travel to remotely connect to my work PC. Their wireless internet blocked my ability to connect to my work PC and I couldn't work while I was there (unless I went to starbucks outside the citiycenter where it worked fine). This is a hotel where conventions are held constantly, assuming most of them are there to work as well, I can't be the only one who has had this problem. In other hotels I have never had any issues with connecting like I have had here. By the third night, we were laughing about everything that was going wrong and it became a joke. All in all, I would not stay here again and I would not reccommend this hotel to anyone.

After a very prompt and courteous limo pick up from Presidential Limo we were delivered to the hotel at about 0800. There was no one in line and even though I wasn\u2019t hopeful that we would get a room that early I gave it a try anyway. Much to my delight our room was ready and we were promptly and pleasantly checked in. I wish I had written down the name of the lady that took care of us. Her customer service skills were spot on. She was pleasant and very helpful and offered suggestions for things for us to do while we were there. I will add that when we came back from walking around there was a considerable line of people checking in but I didn\u2019t stick around long enough to see how long it took. The Room: We had a 51st floor Panoramic Corner Suite. The view was wonderful with a partial view of the Bellagio fountain, only obscured by the Cosmo. The room while at the end of the hall was not that far from the elevator. I\u2019m really not sure why so many people complain about the hike from elevator from the room. - The room was clean but could have used some attention to the dusting. Attention to detail with the dusting could be improved. My husband is pretty tall so he could see dust in places that I couldn\u2019t \u2026 such as on top of the refrigerator, the TV, etc. That\u2019s really the only negative I could give you about the room. - We had room service several times and the food was good and delivered quickly and hot. Server\u2019s were always pleasant and helpful. They tell you to call when you are done and they will pick up the dirty dishes but after waiting for an hour, I set them outside and turned on the Privacy light. - As many have noted, there were no dishes in the kitchen but when I called they sent some up within 30 minutes and called back to ensure that I got what I needed. While they brought up a full compliment, I had to specify that I wanted more than just plates and silverware. I got a couple pots, cooking utensils\u2019, etc. There is a K-Cup machine in the room and they give you a couple cups to start with but they don\u2019t leave you a coffee cup to make it in. That\u2019s like leaving an ice bucket but no glasses to put the ice in. That\u2019s something that just doesn\u2019t make sense. Vdara, PLEASE put some cups in the room! I ended up getting a coffee cup but then the maid service took it away when they did daily service. I left a note the next day (with a tip) asking them to have another sent up\u2026that NEVER happened. Thankfully I had my own travel cup that I made work with some effort (it was a bit tall for the small machine.) If you don\u2019t want to pay for the additional cups and one cup a day isn\u2019t enough I would suggest bringing your own. I have a machine at home so I just brought some of my own supply. Having a stove and a full size fridge was nice. We made our breakfast each day so we didn\u2019t have to rush out and find a place to eat and we had the ability to reheat any leftovers we had from the previous days. - Noise. The room was so peaceful. Never heard a peep of noise from any other room or even in the hall. The only noise came from the Cosmo night club on Friday and Saturday night BUT it was so faint the fan and my earplugs took care of that. - The bathroom. I loved the set up and the tub was nice BUT, the design of the tub left a little to be desired. The drain cover which has a raised knob is right in the middle of the bath tub. If you try to slide down to rinse your hair or get deeper in the water you end up with the plug in less than convenient locations. Also, if you fill the tub too far, and you slide up too fast, you end up flooding the floor. Thankfully there are lots of towels to help deal with that. - Having a washer and dryer in the room was a huge bonus as well. Note, they do not provide soap or fabric softener so you will need to buy some. Also, there\u2019s a flood sensor that you need to make sure is reset or the water will not fill in the washer. Be very stingy on laundry soap as these are front load washers and if you don\u2019t have sufficient clothes in the washer you will have a soap bubble flood (like I did, although it was minor!) - Location, Location, Location: Well much as been said about this already BUT we really didn\u2019t find it that bad. We walked across the sky bridge to the Bellagio and then out to the strip. Quick and easy. Always lots to see along the way. We really liked that the Vdara didn\u2019t have the huge crowds and smoke that come with the full service casinos and hotels. - Dining options: Other than room service and the Caf\u00e9 down stairs there aren\u2019t many in the hotel BUT that wasn\u2019t an issue for us. We never used the Caf\u00e9 but ran into a very upset man in the elevator that waited 45 min for a cup of coffee because he didn\u2019t have a coffee maker in his room. He was not a happy camper! - Security: Some have mentioned that there was someone stationed at the elevators to check keys before allowing anyone up. We only noticed that during the weekend. No one checked our card during the week at all. - TV Check-out: Used the TV to do the check out and had no issues with it at all. Got an itemized list in my email later that day. No unexpected charges, no issues and no waiting at the counter to check out in person. Overall we really enjoyed this property and all that it offered the location and lack of \u201cVegas\u201d craziness.

We upgraded to a courner suite and it's well worth it if you can do it. (book early and dont stay the weekend for the very best deals). You have full kitchen facilites and we found the shop on the ground floor to offer very resonable prices for grocery items so we had breakfast and nibbles in the suite (there wine was also cheaper than elsewhere). The suite itself was extremly roomy. A couple could live there with no problems. The bathroom was huge with seperate dressing room and wardrobe. The only possible negative I could come up with is the shower didnt offer the best pressure and could fluctuate in temperature but seriously the room/suite was so wonderful that this is just nit-picking.

Needless to say the room overlooked the Freeway! We asked to be moved and were told that another room on the opposite side of the hotel was being cleaned, to wait 30 mins and we would be called. 40 mins later we were told by reception that that room had now been taken and that we had been given another room on another floor that was also being cleaned and they would call us. An hour later, and after going down to reception, we were given a room that had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains and the Freeway. When I queried with reception about the view they informed me that the \"rooms with a good view are more expensive\". Now I am not too sure if we were being fobbed off but we were not impressed. Anyway, we saw two different types of rooms both of which were lovely but as someone else mentioned, there was no cutlery, tableware or cookware of any description.

It is a non smoking, non gaming hotel which makes it a nice place to return to after being in smoky casinos all night. It is a newer hotel, located within the CityCenter complex and within walking distance of the Aria Hotel/Casino and the Cosmopolitan Hotel Casino, as well as being adjacent to the Ballagio Hotel/Casino. The rooms are large, beautiful suites, with a flat screen television on the wall, drapes that open and close by remote, and a kitchenette that includes a refrigerator to use as well as a stocked refrigerator that you can purchase items from. There were some problems. I told the valet that I would be going out for dinner after checking in, so he moved my car out of the way, but the car lights were left on. Check in took quite a bit of time, so by the time I went back out to my car, the car battery was dead. Fortunately, the staff does prepare for such a situation, and they brought out a device that was able to immediately recharge my battery. This hotel is very modern and uses newer technology. On the second night after spending a day out, we returned to our room at 11:00 PM. To get into your room at the Vdara, you wave your room key (instead of putting your room key in a slot) in front of the door which causes the door to unlock automatically. When doing this, the door would not open. I went downstairs to the lobby and was quickly reissued keys in the lobby. When I went back to my room with my wife, the door again would not unlock. By this time my wife and I were getting frustrated. I spoke to security near the elevators (This person was great) who was apologetic and called immediately for assistance. A manager at the Vdra again reissued keys, and had a hotel representative go up to our room to make sure they key would work, but again (the third time), the key did not unlock the door. The hotel representative then called for maintenance, who immediately came and was able to let us in our room and eventually fix the door. This led us to the next problem. Housekeeping never cleaned the room (My guess is housekeeping could not get into the room due to the key problem). My wife eventually spoke to a manager who apologized and gave us a resort credit for our trouble. It is an impressive, beautiful hotel in a great location. We had to deal with multiple staff members at the hotel due to the problems we had, but they were all professional and dealt with our problems in a courteous and timely manner. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and will definitely consider staying there the next time I am in Las Vegas. I would also recommend this hotel to others because it is a great hotel (even with the problems), with professional and courteous staff who take care of their customers. It is a newer hotel with newer technology, so their might be some bugs that need to be worked out, but overall, the Vdara is a great place to stay.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toms River, New Jersey, United States", "Title": "\u201cTO ALL THE COMPLAINERS\u201d", "Author": "27DomP", "ReviewID": "UR118665119", "Content": "Just came home from our 5 night stay at Vdara Hotel and Spa.

We did not choose this hotel as my husband's company booked it for him so for that I can't complain to much however if I returned, it would not be to this hotel with all of the other choices. The hotel itself is very shiny and new and on the surface seems ok. That is until you go explore the other options and see how many amenities you are missing out on. To be clear, if you want a smaller hotel with no smoking, casino, places to eat and away from the chaos of the strip then maybe its for you. I found it nice the first day then quickly started missing a few things. The front desk: Not overly friendly. Made us call back 5 times before telling us they could not give us a late checkout on the Sunday, not even if we paid which I find very hard to believe. The room: Actually quite nice. I was told I was upgraded to full view room...full view of the Aria and valets...not a view at all. Bed was super comfy, bath looked nice but small. Shower was also small. Kitchenette was useless but fridge was nice. The pool: Probably the worst. I had such pool envy when we went to other hotels. Its small and crowded and not very refreshing. Drinks at pool were way overpriced, $5 pop and $14 cocktails. I heard the food was decent though. Food: No restaurants but the Aria is very close however it was always very busy at the buffet. I would recommend Julian Serrano at the Aria...food was amazing! The market store at the Vdara is crazy expensive. Water $3, crackers $8...I didn't buy much there. Tip: Its only a short walk to the tram where the hotel connects to the Bellagio. Use it!

Overall, it was a good experience, definitely the way to go if you want to live like a king in Vegas but still be able to get a good rest away from all the craziness. The room was amazing, and we had a view of the Bellagio fountains and The Strip. It's about a ten minute walk to Las Vegas Blvd from the hotel, so the location is great... the best of both worlds, with no casino on site. People have been saying that the hotel no longer stocks Aveda products... and that's false. You get what you pay for. Obviously, if you book on Priceline and get a great deal, don't expect to get pampered with a high-floor room and the latest organic toiletries. If you book directly through them, you may get better service. We had plenty of towels, silverware, and Aveda products throughout our stay. The thing that a lot of reviewers must not realize is that his \"hotel\" was originally designed as a condo building, before the real estate bubble burst. Therefore, all rooms have kitchenettes, washer/dryer combos, and great views. Also, it is why there is no casino onsite. The downstairs market was never intended for large crowds, but I give them credit for dealing with the huge flow of people. Because of this, also, the pool is on the small side... but the drinks are reasonably priced. The Silk Road restaurant closed earlier this year, and that's old news. There's no \"private party\" in there as the sign says, but also no need to be offended. Aria is right nearby, with plenty of sinful activities to indulge in. I'd give them five stars if it wasn't for the service. We don't complain much but we had some troubles with check-in taking a long time and just some more minor issues. I asked the concierge for a restaurant lunch recommendation and he pointed me to a restaurant in Aria, which is only open for dinner... he should have known better, you know? As far as the building goes, it's a \"best bet\"!! Also, we were there on a very busy weekend, and Vdara and Aria is where a lot of very beautiful people stay.

To get to the strip, it's a bit confusing and there's not really any helpful signage to point you in the right direction.

The cabanas for the price compared to other hotels is a good deal.

This is the bottom of their line, so no coffee maker. But one had 2 big flat screens, the other because of it's layout had one, but was a more open space. The view over the pool was pleasant, and the room was quiet. We had no problem checking in, even though it was quite busy. We were in and out of there in 15 minutes, including the time the clerk spent searching for two suites next door to each other. We really appreciated her attention to that!

To me, a Hotel needs to have, at minimum, on-site restaurants and a private lounge area to rate more than 3 Stars. The Good: Large Flat Panel TV's in the Rooms Nice Views from the Bellagio side (can watch the Bellagio Fountain shows) Very comfortable beds No \"Casino\" smell or traffic The Bad: Very expensive room service (like $48.00 for one person generic eggs, toast, coffee and juice) Very limited beer selection at the little lobby open area bar. ...and most of all, location. It's about a 1/4 mile walk to the Casino area of the Bellagio, a little closer to the Aria Casino, but if you want the Bellagio, get ready for a hike. The walk wouldn't be so bad if they had auto doors instead of expecting you to push your way though all those doors. I know that sounds a little lame to complain about the doors, but hey, this is Las Vegas and it is supposed to be a link between two high class hotels. The other thing that bothered us and a lot of others is the Vdara is right next door to the Cosmopolitan Casino and Las Vegas Blvd., yet it's like \"You Can't Get There From Here\". I think whoever owns the VDara also owns the Crystal Shopping Center as they force you to walk across the street, through Crystals, up the escalator, back across the street on the overpass, then back down the escalator to get to Cosmo's and the Blvd. -or- You have to J-Walk maybe 20 feet across a driveway to cut 90% of the trip and just walk next door. Also, I think when this Hotel was built it was going to be Condos, not a Hotel. They probably built it just before/during the housing crash in Vegas. This would explain the lack of amenities you normally find in a Hotel (like Restaurants, Shops and a better Elevator layout) and also why the rooms have stoves and ovens in them. The rooms look like an updated \"Extended Stay\" hotel. . . One last thing I have to say: The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) is out of their minds and out of touch with customers. This is the second major gambling location I have been to in Nevada since the NGCB removed coin money from the Casinos, and it will be last time I go to any of them. It just isn't any fun to be in a Casino without the sounds of a Casino. We only found one $1.00 machine (at New York, New York Casino) that paid out in coins and there was a long line to play it. Just like the last Casino we went to in Reno, we brought over $2,500 to play with, yet only spent maybe $100.00 before getting bored of the dull atmosphere and leaving the Casinos.

I shared the room with several other folks, so the sleeping area seemed smaller than expected for the price paid. It did have a large bathroom with double sinks, marble, bath and walk-in shower. The kitchen had a dining room table, flatware/plates, a microwave and more, so we saved a lot of money on breakfast and lunch by buying groceries at a nearby Walgreens and preparing food in the room. The double flatscreen TVs are large and new. However, the way the bedroom and living room are set up--with a central partition but open space on the left and right side--meant the TVs were back-to-back, making it hard to watch two different things at the same time without the sound bleeding over. Being a non-gambler and nonsmoker, I appreciated the lack of a casino at this hotel. The absence creates a clean, smoke-free environment and ensures there isn't a horrible cover-up perfume scent in the hallways. For this reason alone, I rank this hotel much higher than THEHotel at Mandalay Bay, because despite touting itself as casino-free, THEHotel still connects to the Mandalay Bay casino and its smoke permeates. In addition to the room amenities, the property has, among other things, a nice gym, a rooftop pool, and a deli/cafe. There's also a large pool area on the roof. Do be forewarned that this is the much-storied \"Death Ray\" pool, meaning that the surrounding City Center towers reflect sunlight directly down and increase the odds you'll walk away with a sunburn. Given that it was 114 degrees outside during my stay, I didn't really venture out for more than 5 minutes, but it appeared they had plenty of umbrella chairs set up. Part of the peace and quiet that goes with this hotel comes from the fact that it is a bit set back from the City Center hub-bub.

So i called the front desk to have someone come look at it. A \"technician\" came to reset the wifi and it still wasn't working his response was \"oh well, sometimes it just doesn't work.\" I was furious, wireless internet is part of a ridiculous $20 a night resort fee and I couldn't even use it. I called the front desk to ask them what else was included in this so-called \"resort fee\" because clearly the internet was not working and they said that it included bottled water (which wasn't even in the room), wireless internet (which wasn't working) and a local newspaper (which i didn't need) When I asked them if I could have the resort fee removed since i didn't need any of those they refused and said its part of the hotel service. So basically I had to pay no matter what. 30 minutes later they sent up two tiny bottles of water, so thats what i had to pay $20 a day for!

Well, I was pretty surprised when we came back from being out and there sat what I would call a comforter. They did not have any toppers. My daughter decided to just roll up inside of that and sleep on the top of the couch. As another reviewer mention the products are not Aveda in the smaller suites but we did received them in the penthouse suite. There was a Keurig in both suites with the little cups in the refrigerator but only one regular and one decaf. You also received two bottles of water. Did not see a paper until we ordered room service for breakfast in the penthouse suite and the guy that delivered the food also brought the paper for us. We left the light on for housekeeping and they came in and cleaned and left clean towels and etc. No problems there. I must mention the furniture in both rooms are very nice and the first suite still looked pretty new. But, the penthouse suite was another story. Apparently either families or parties have had a pretty good time. The couch had so many stains I didn't even want to sit on it. The purple velvet chair was also bad on the arms and head rest area. Not what you would expect for $600.00 a night. The chair up in the upper story bedroom was of the same kind and it was fine. The room itself was fabulous with super cool views. The hotel seemed to have quite a few people always in the lobby but we never ran into anyone on either of our floors. It was nice and quite for sleeping. For those who use white noise machines they have a fan in the bedroom that you can turn on with the air conditioner/heat so that takes care of not having to bring a machine or earplugs. The beds were good and the pillows were great. The tvs were big and HD so very clear. They also have tvs in the bathroom. The bathrooms are super. We did not use the pool but stopped to look at it and was surprised that it isn't a very big area. Lot of people were crowded into a small space around the pool. The valet parking is very fast. We never waited more than 5 minutes. The walk to Bellagio or Aria is no more than 5 minutes or less. Cosmopolitan is also very close but you only have sidewalk part of the way and then you have to walk on the edge of the drive way. Very weird that they didn't figure a way for people to get over there in a more safe way. I suppose if you want to walk a long way you can do that through the hotels but most people are looking for the shortest way to get over there. In recent years we have stayed at Aria, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, Encore, Palazzo, Venitian, Paris and Trump. We would choose to stay here again as the rooms are large for the price. We do like the Cosmo because of the balconies and nice large showers and decor. We like Encore too but the rooms are not as big for the prices they charge. The excutive corner suites we reserved for $129.00 a night and you just can't do better than that at other hotels for what you get. My son and his wife stayed last month in a city corner suite at a good price and said it was really nice.

Upon returning to our room and finding this out, we were informed by Front desk staff that they will arrange for someone to come by at 5pm when we were scheduled to leave our room again. We left at 5pm and returned to our room at 1am the next day from the Grand Canyon, very tired, hot and sticky, to find that our room had not been cleaned which meant that we did not have any clean towels or bathroom products!! Housekeeping were not answering the line, I tried calling twice and was on hold for 30mins in total. I then called Front Desk to only be told that due to the weekend they have many guests checking in, so they advised I simply try calling housekeeping again. I called Front desk a 2nd time and they said they would advise housekeeping of our situation.

Stayed w/ my wife for 3 full days and the planning paid off. Vdara and the Aria are the best 2 hotels in Las Vegas for a few very important reasons. 1) Vdara has no casino. Why is this good well because there are no huge caravans of people constantly walking through your hotel and the people can number in the thousands per weekend. To get to the Vdara from the strip we walked through the Bellagio which is a nightmare on the weekends walking through the hordes of people. Once we got to Vdara property it was instantly peaceful. Only the people that stay on the property are there. 2) No smoking --no explanation needed. 3) Great value. The hotel is a true 5 star and is a bargain. 4) Great views. Our room was on the 48th floor and we watched the Bellagio water show every night. 5) Free valet parking. It's good to tip a few bucks a day though. 6) very clean. The hotel is mostly spotless for the reasons of no smoking and no casino. 7)location. Not directly on the strip to keep out the indigent but close enough to walk there in 5 minutes. About a city block away. 8) staff friendly. They don't have to deal with idiots walking through their casino constantly so they are much more laid back. Our experience wasn't perfect. Cleaning staff forgot to clean out room one day and the safe was acting up but overall a fantastic experience. Some tips. 1)rent a car from the airport. Airport car rental are the cheapest in the city and it prevents you from being trapped and locked to the strip or paying for very expensive cabs or shuttles. 2) avoid the Bellagio. This hotel is nothing buy hype and a money pit. The best thing about it is the water show which is great but that is it. $358 for 2 tickets to see \"O\", not in my lifetime! And definitely avoid the buffet at all costs. A total ripoff. Go to the Rio for buffet. 3) Go see Absinthe at Ceasars Palace if you can, it's the best show in Vegas right now if you are not easily offended.

You don't have to walk by or through a smokey casino to get to anything in the hotel Suites were very spacious Bathrooms - nice soaking tub, large size No weird smells throughout hotel Panoramic views were awesome!!!! We requested a view of the Bellagio fountains. Televisions in both the living and bedrooms were great! Front desk was very accomodating and friendly. Valet was quick when we called to pick up our car. Very, very quiet rooms Did not see any crazy drunks scurrying around the lobby, hallways or hotel The location....very close to most everything but far enough away from all the drunks and smoking buzzards. Parking is free but all the valet people who approach your car expect a tip.....we had several approach our car each time we needed to take it out of our hotel. That was annoying. Very helpful reservation agents. Con's: Toilettries were not Aveda as previous posters wrote about, instead they were Vdara soaps, shampoos, etc. and they smelled very much like a yucky cotton candy that had been baking in the sun for too long. Room service was very slow You have to request kitchen items (dishware, utensils) There is no coffee maker in the room There is no blow dryer in the room Strangely there is no bathroom fan for air circulation. The free bottled water is purified water, not spring water. We did not get our free newspaper. Mattresses felt skimpy and were uncomfortable compared to other hotels we've stayed at (pillows were very comfortable though). Crowded elevators. There were 6 but only 1 would open each time someone would press the button. The lighting is bad in the living area and bedroom. It is more designer lighting that you could not easily read with. The marketplace at the Vdara (next to the lobby area) had horrible cafe frape's. Wasted $6 bucks on one and it tasted like an overly bitter water down frape with no flavor. Prices at the marketplace were not very good either. For example, the baguette's were $6 each! There was mold in between the floor tiles in the shower and a dirty shower nozzle. Everywhere we turned there was someone to tip....the guy who opened my passengers side door, the guy who opened my drivers side door, the guy who took my luggage, and another guy who appeared to take my car (no it wasn't either of the two guys who we had tipped who had opened our doors). Then there was another guy who delivered our bags to our hotel room so that was someone else to tip. We had to call down for kitchen utensils so that was another person to tip. Tipping was never ending! Somewhat intimidating entrance feels like you are in the roundabout of an airport and pulling up to catch a flight. Overall, this hotel definitely does not have the same attentiveness that a Ritz Carlton or St. Regis hotel has but it is a great hotel for Vegas. The best part is that it is non-smoking. If we return to Vegas, we'll stay here again. But we will bring our own bath products and eat elsewhere other than the marketplace. We'll also expect our room not to be cleaned for the day until close to dinner time as it was when we stayed here (the time most hotels have their turn down service). And we'll bring a huge wade of dollar bills for the endless tipping that this hotel seems to thrive on.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, AZ", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Tram Made the Difference!\u201d", "Author": "K2A2", "ReviewID": "UR117760588", "Content": "We rolled into Las Vegas knowing Vdara is an opulent, newer 57-story glass tower tucked in somewhere in City Center.

If you view the whole valet process as a pain in the neck, exit back onto the main drag and make your first right onto the next little street, which is the other side of Aria. There is ample, free self-parking in a clean, beautiful Aria garage [heck, it\u2019s all City Center]. Take the garage elevator to the Casino level 2 and follow arrows to the complimentary tram, which will pleasantly glide you right to Vdara. It was surprisingly easy and hassle-free with very little walking. An electronic sign is always displayed, specifying how many minutes until the next tram, never to exceed 6 minutes. Coffee\u2026 If it\u2019s a critical part of your day, map out your coffee strategy before your leave home. Vdara has only one little grab & go-type caf\u00e9 in the lobby, large coffee is $3.95 plus tax (or there\u2019s room service). Here\u2019s how we did things our way, and loved it: From the Lobby level of Vdara, head to the awesome, smooth-sailing tram; zip over to the Monte Carlo, where you can eat in a traditional coffee shop restaurant, or use Monte Carlo\u2019s Food Court with McDonald\u2019s, Starbuck\u2019s, Subway, etc. My husband brought the four of us large McDonald\u2019s juices and coffees back to the room in a cup-holder for under $10. In the other direction is Bellagio, but you won\u2019t find much that appeals to a family. On a side note, there\u2019s a 24-hour sundries shop near the entrance of Aria, which is pretty easy to get to on foot. As far as shopping, the Crystal\u2019s shopping center is next door, but it\u2019s more the Rodeo Drive variety of shops. If you need more \u2018down to earth,\u2019 everyday shopping, cross the street and use the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. It\u2019s a great outing, and you will find wonderful casual dining there as well. If you don\u2019t want ultra-fine dining of City Center and aren\u2019t into lavish buffets either, AND you want a decent-seeming Casino for real gambling, then stay in grand style at Vdara, but utilize your feet and the super-tram for your conveniences.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cRelaxtion\u201d", "Author": "yattat", "ReviewID": "UR117727797", "Content": "Loved it!!

The suite itself was spacious but did already show signs of wear. We noticed some wallpaper peeling and the desk had several scratches and one gouge in it.

Vdara disappointed us from the get go. First the entrance to the hotel is difficult to find even on the strip. The signs are tiny, the road takes you in loops and is overall a BIG headache. Most hotels on the strip have a back entrance, not this one. The only way in is from the Strip. Considering the traffic on the strip is horrible, it can take you 15 minutes to go one block! Upon finally getting to the hotel, the only way to park is w/valet. No self parking? Come on! Sometimes I don't feel like tipping everybody 10 times a day! But Vdara says that's what the resort fee is for. Yeah, right. So the check-in counter was a pain too. 3 long lines. \u00a0Why don't they get smart and make one line for all of us to stand in. That way we can go to the first available person? On to the room. The furnishings are nice and modern. But there were some major issues with the room. 1) No pots, pans, cups, utensils, etc. in the kitchen. Completely bare when you open the cupboards. You have to call housekeeping to bring each and every thing you want and that takes them at least 30-45 minutes. Such an inconvenience, when I wanted a cup of tea like an hour ago! They don't even give you a coffee maker. Also, the refrigerator is the size of a medicine cabinet. I kid you not. Go ahead and try to fit a few things, and you will see how ridiculously small this is. 2) Bathroom door was one of those sliding doors. Ours was already broken and the lock didn't even work b/c it wouldn't slide all the way closed. 3) The blackout shades are broken into 3 sections and each section has a 2 inch gap in between that lets in all the bright sun in the morning. Forget about sleeping in past 6am, unless you put a pillow over your head. 4) No robes in the room. You have to call housekeeping to bring it up and that takes 40 minutes. Again, a pain when you wanted to use it a 40 min ago and are now waiting to take a shower b/c the robes haven't arrived. We had a bad customer service experience with their coffee shop and front desk one day. They told us to write a comment card and to this day, no response from the manager. Sad.

Vdara is very quiet and serene in comparison to most other hotels. Do not be put off by the walk to the strip. If you are staying in the MGM for example, the walk to the strip from Vdara through Bellagio is no further in comparison and it's quite pleasant. I see reviews from other travellers complaning about how far it is to walk to Aria .... er, hello? It is like a 90 second walk across the ground between the two hotels. There are always plenty of cabs available at Vdara or Aria if you need to get somewhere fast, there's no real strip traffic to trouble you because of it's location (assuming you get a decent taxi driver) and you can be there about 8 minutes after leaving McCarran. There's not much food on offer at Vdara but in under five minutes you can be in one of several restaurants in Aria or Bellagio where there is plenty of choice. in my experience there is only one tiny drawback with Vdara; it's the drapes. I've stayed in single rooms and I've stayed in corner suites and without exception the drapes do not meet. In the corner room I used on this trip, there was a 1 to 1.5 inch gap between the corners of the blinds and I find this mildly unsettling because I like total blackout. If it doesn't bother you its not worth worrying about. Oh, and despite the iPod connectivity claims, I could not get my iPhone 4 to play music through the entertainment centre, not with a speaker cable or an iPhone cable - just couldn't figure it out. Maybe I was just being dumb. I've always had prompt efficient check-in and -out, never had problems with noise or the housekeeping staff and if you take a corner suite you get a huge fridge, four bottles of water a day, washer/dryer, table for four, big bed plus sofa bed and a divider between the two beds for privacy. Plus, the wifi is free and isn't limited to one device per room unlike some other places. I am back in Vegas again this November but have chosen Mandarin Oriental for that trip; we will have to see how that works out. Had that not been available, I would have still gone back to Vdara just for the tranquility of the place.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cThe reviews are true. Consider Vdara but also other resorts.\u201d", "Author": "gnasty71", "ReviewID": "UR117569017", "Content": "It was hard to rate Vdara as you'll see. The ideal rating would be a 3.5 overall compared to other resorts. Overall, it was a nice hotel but the negative comments for the most part are true so definitely read them. Yelp also rates Vdara at 3.5 based on user reviews. We chose Vdara because of 3 main reasons. 1) It had suites 2) there was a good package deal 3) its new so we decide to try it. The hotel was supposed to be apartments or condos and was converted into a hotel. So what does that mean? All the rooms are suites. However, there are no double beds, only single beds. If you are traveling as a couple or family, this is fine. If you are with friends, you have no choice but to sleep in the same bed. We had a Vdara suite which as a fold out couch and can sleep 3 comfortably. Also, the hotel has no casino and not much of a bar scene. It has a spa which we didn't use. The hotel. The hotel is new and I'd consider it luxurious. The hotel has a very modern feel to it which goes with the CityCenter theme. The suites were very well furnished and comfortable. The Vdara suite has a full refrigerator, kitchenette, living room area, spacious bedroom and bath. There is also a half bath in the kitchenette area. 2 flat screen tvs; one in the living area and one in the bedroom. Wifi access is free. The lobby has a bar and a convenience store/food & coffee store. They offer breakfast, lunch and snack foods, has a seating area and a pretty decent section of refrigerated food you'd find in a 7-Eleven,Wawa,Circle-K type places. They have a pool. I thought it was a bit small so it could get crowded. But there is a lot of seating and a bar so that is something. Nothing impressive. We didn't hear any noise from the other rooms or the hallway and our room was the closest to the elevators. One thing that was pretty cool. The suite had a washer/dryer and room service will provide detergent and fabric softener. So what isn't great. Nothing really bad but just the little things. One, its not on the strip. The Aria and Bellagio are in walking distance. There is a tram that takes you through the CityCenter area casinos (Bellagio/Vdara, Aria, Monte Carlo). Its a quick walk from the hotel but the waiting area and stairs to it are out in the open. So when its 108 degrees, its a little annoying. You can walk through various casinos and get to Las Vegas Blvd in about 15 mins. Not the end of the world but it can get tiring to do all that walking. And remember, no casino, no shows, no buffets or special restaurants here so all the guests are going somewhere else. There are plenty of cabs that stop in front and it has valet service if you rented a car. Second, the water pressure is kind of low. Many Yelp reviews complained about that. Its tolerable but if that annoys you, be warned. Third, it didn't bother us but after reading some of the little issues about the valet, it did dawn on me that it was true. You can't seem to call down to have your car ready, if its busy you wait outside for the car, the car gets dropped off on the other side of the road so you have to walk about 25 feet. We didn't mind it but again, if that stuff annoys you, be warned. We didn't see any obvious signs of auto-checkout (the TV offers an option, your bill is dropped off under your door, etc). We checked out in person and there was no line at the time. However, lines can form as we saw so if they do not provide auto checkout, that would be frustrating. So it is a nice hotel with modern suites. We found the staff to be nice and helpful. They printed out my boarding pass because the business center was closed. (It was 8pm which was a bit early to closed in my opinion). The hotel was clean and no problems with any of the room amenities. Its just a bit far from the main areas and you have to go somewhere else to do anything fun. I'd recommend other hotels if you really want to get into the action. If you get a good deal or find yourself at the Vdara, just be aware of the downsides. In the end, its still pretty close to the Strip and you can get there without a lot of hassle.

We arrived at the hotel and were impressed with how nice everything looked from the valet area to the front lobby. Everything looked first class. Front desk staff was pleasant and check in was pretty quick and there were no lines at all. The room was very nice and had a living area that was somewhat seperated from the bedroom area. It was clean and our room had a small kitchen with dining area that was very clean. The first issue with the service cam when we wanted to have our car pulled up to the valet stand before going downstairs so we wouldnt have to wait when we got down there. We thought this was possible after staying at the Wynn last summer where we could call the valet desk and our car would be waiting out front when we got down stairs. It was not posible at Vdara because nobody ever answered at the valt desk, not once in out 5 days there. The second problem witht the valet was that we would hand the valet person our ticket and stand where they would pull the cars and wait. After about 15 minutes the smae person we handed the ticket to would drive the car out and drive right past us and continue on for about 30 feet. We would end up having to walk to the car when the guy obviously saw us standing there. It wasnt a hassle to walk to the car but just annoying. The second problem came when my friend was told that she had a gift waiting at the front desk. We went down to get it about 1 hour later and it was no where to be found. The front desk employee told us to go to the conciege desk and there was nobody there. We stood there for about 10 minutes and finally asked an employee that walked by if anyone was working there and they said no and continued walking. We went backto the front desk and finally after 20 minutes of searching they found the gift that was a gift card from a family member. The hotel is nice, peaceful, and very luxurious but service could use a little work.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, but bad customer service.\u201d", "Author": "rjose", "ReviewID": "UR117509814", "Content": "Positives: 1. Beautiful hotel rooms. The amenities in the room were gorgeous and modern. There is a fully equipped kitchen, dining table, a sitting area, TWO plasma TV's, comfy bed, and the bathroom is absolutely gorgeous with granite/marble finishes and a standing shower AND tub. 2. The lobby is also sleek and modern. 3. The location of the hotel is excellent \u2013 right on the strip. 4. We got there hours before check in and they were very attentive and said that there is a room available ASAP, which I think was a big plus. Negatives: 1. So, when we got into our first room there were small insects crawling in our shower drain and the sink in the bathroom was spitting out the water in a weird manner so we called the front desk. They were very nice and said that they were going to send up someone to take a look. One of the supervisors FINALLY arrived to our room - I mean, seriously don't say that they're going to be up there in 5 minutes but really take 25 minutes. The supervisor finally came, took a look at the insects and the sink and was very nice and offered to give us a room on a higher level and with a better view of the strip. We said OK and she said someone from the front desk will call us and let us know the new room number and that we do not have to go down to the lobby for a new set of keys, they will just reactivate the keys we already had. After the supervisor left, we waited over 30 minutes and did not hear from anyone. So, I called the front desk and wondered if they had forgotten about us. They said no, and didn't even apologize and gave us the number of our new room. Well, when we got to our new room the cleaning lady was still there frantically cleaning the room. I felt bad for her because she had to rush and I didn't want her to rush. In other words, I don't want a half-assed clean room. When the cleaning lady was finally done our room keys didn't even work, even though the supervisor said they would switch it automatically so that we didn't have to go back downstairs. Luckily for us the cleaning lady was still in sight and opened the door for us. Talk about POOR and SLOW service. 2. What peeved me the most about the Vdara was their check-out routine and valet set-up. Most hotels give you the option of leaving your room keys in your room so that you do not have to go downstairs and wait in a line. Well, around 11:30am we were on our way to go downstairs but all the elevators were completely packed \u2013 they were full of everyone else checking out around the same time. We were on the 33rd floor so the thought of tugging my entire luggage down 33 flights of stairs was definitely not an option. So, we went back to our rooms and waiting for about 30 minutes for foot traffic to die down. On top of that, waiting for your car at the valet was like waiting in line at the DMV. There were so many other people checking out that the line for them to bring out your car (self-parking is not an option at this hotel, it's valet only) took FOREVER. We waited a good 30 minutes just for them to retrieve our car. Now, it wasn't the valet peoples\u2019 fault because they were working fast and hard, but rather it was the poor choice of not having self-parking be available. Therefore, this mistake is solely on management's part - they seriously need to fix this because if their Sundays' always look like this they will undoubtedly get an abundant amount of complaints. It was ridiculous, especially since you're waiting outside in Vegas' hot weather waiting for your damn car. Again, I do want to stress that the hotel amenities are gorgeous, updated and modern, but for a hotel to function correctly and for customers to keep coming back your management has to be equally inviting. Quick example: I stayed at a Ritz Carlton and yes, their rooms are nice, but not as modern as Vdara but their customer service is excellent. They are attentive and really care that you enjoy your stay with them and personally I think excellent customer service is more important than modern amenities.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Grove, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGet a deal\u201d", "Author": "JHW81", "ReviewID": "UR117488759", "Content": "I stayed here with a summer deal package and it was really worth it.

We were greeted by a friendly receptionist and didn\u2019t have to wait in line (it seems waiting to check in is a given at all other hotels). Check in was fast and at the lifts they check your room card so security is great. We has a room on 41st floor and the views were amazing. You walk through door into a small kitchen which was great as we had room service the one night so was nice having a table to sit at! Also there is a double fridge one is empty which is great so you can keep drinks in there. You pay a $20 daily resort fee but get 2 bottles of water use of gym etc. resort fees seem to now be at all hotels. The room was spacious with sofa and small armchair, a large bed tv, an entertainment center and reception supplied us with a lead so I could use my ipod! I gave the lead back at end of stay so wasn\u2019t charged. The bed was huge and comfortable and the bathroom was amazing!! The bath tbe is the best ive ever been in. I want one for my home bathroom now. My sister and I had a bath every night as it was so relaxing. The lighting can be adjusted and there is a walk in shower. They provide aveda products, there are also scales, which for me was great as I have a habit of weighing myself everyday. We had one small problem when the bathroom door which slides wouldn\u2019t shut. I asked for it to be fixed but it was actually made worse. I went down to reception and explained and she gave us a $60 credit for the inconvenience and got it fixed straight away! Housekeeping \u2013 in several hotels I have found housekeeping too noisy and not great in this hotel the service was 10/10. You never really saw or heard them and they cleaned the room so well and quickly. The market caf\u00e9 - in reception this caf\u00e9 is convenient and great value. We had breakfast there every morning which were always good, you can also get coffee, sandwiches and some amazing cakes which we said we\u2019d try but didn\u2019t! The pool \u2013 this was one area which I think could be improved slightly. Felt the d\u00e9cor of pool area was lacking and the waitress\u2019s outfits were unflattering and could be much better. We always managed to get a bed but it was very crowded esp on weekends and beds were very crammed in. think they should maybe put bamboo around the pool area as the white fencing isn\u2019t great and doesn\u2019t fit in with the rest of the hotel d\u00e9cor. The gym \u2013 im now a runner so a gym with good treadmill is important to me and the vdara gym was great. Stocked with water bottles and towels its small but a great gym with treadmills, weights cross trainers etc. Location \u2013 it is set back from the strip but there is a walk way to the Bellagio, which also led to the tram or Cesar\u2019s palace. The vdara has no casino so its very relaxing and calm hotel compared to the other hotels which is refreshing when you come back from all the excitement, hustle and bustle of vegas. if you want to gamble it\u2019s a short walk to the Aria and through the casino to get to the strip.

We already knew this hotel had no casino, clubs, restaurants or a huge fabulous swimming pool so we knew not to expect too much. That's why I called it 'comfy quiet place to stay'. I tend to like happening atmospheres but when you need to crash after partying, Vdara def. provides that kind of comfort. The lobby area is quite spacious & has a lounge that's both inside & outside. There's also a small grocery store which we didn't get to visit. The elevators are straight forward, 2 main areas with the floor levels listed. Now onto the rooms, all the rooms are suites which was pretty cool. Ours was the most basic (deluxe suite) but it had more than we expected. Small kitchen area w/a microwave, refrigerator & stove. You get 2 complimentary water bottles every day in that fridge :) The bed was a king and has a 2 seater couch on the side. That was nice to have in case you want to invite ppl over. The bathroom had a shower & tub, I had a problem w/the tub though. The plug didn't close properly so the water would just keep draining. Quite disappointing for a new hotel. The bed would probably be the best part, I have never slept in a more comfy bed. Must have been the memory foam mattress and the pillows they used. Everything conforms to you nicely & it was hard to wake in the morning. The blinds on the windows are controlled by a switch near the kitchen was cool too. Unlike those annoying ones that you have to pull shut by hand. Housekeeping was great, they refilled the towels/toiletries but also took the extra step to pick up after us which we'd never expect. Now the pool, I'd read reviews that it was small but I felt it was big enough. Its got no slides or waterfalls but good enough. There's a hot tub too and more than enough lounge chairs. There's also a fitness center and spa but we nvr got to check it out. So, not too bad overall until you look at it location wise. Citycenter itself is a huge place and its tricky to get around w/all the overpasses & winding paths. Whole place seemed more vehicle than ppl friendly. There is a main road between it (Vdara) and the Cosmopolitan & things would've been way more convenient if they had built a proper sidewalk that leads to the strip. My friend & I pushed past the shrubs that grew beside the Cosmopolitan everyday to avoid taking the proper/super long route. Dining, gambling & clubbing wise is fine w/Aria right across the front lot. On our last day, we had some trouble getting a hold of our shuttle but the folks at the front desk & bell hop were friendly & helpful about it which was nice. I didn't notice any sort of rudeness or 'I hate my job' types of attitudes that most of these folks display.

Our first impression was how nice and open the lobby was but found getting to the front desk confusing (hint. It's to the left of the entrance). After reading some of the reviews I expected a wait at the front desk, and yes there was a line about 4 people long and the wait was around 10 minutes. However, the front desk apologized for the delay and were courteous. Our room, a corner suite, ended up being rig next to the elevator, but once inside we never once experienced any outside noise from the hallway- so it didn't matter. The room: beautiful. It was huge with sliding doors separating the living room from the bedroom. There was a small dining room and kitchen with a washer/dryer unit. None of which we used this time, but I could see this as being very useful if we were staying longer. There was also a sliding door from the kitchen into the bathroom, kinda odd, and the door stuck a lot. We just kept it closed and used the entrance from the bedroom instead to access the bathroom. The bathroom was also huge with a giant soaking tub and separate shower. The toilet area however was semi exposed (no door closing it off). The bed was super soft and you can purchase the bed and pillows online (I'm possibly considering the pillows-so comfy). Overall I'd definitely consider staying here again.

Upon check in we were greeted by a friendly staff and an intoxicating smell. Our room had an excellent view of the mountains and partial strip. We ended up on the 32nd floor which was awesome. The first thing that shocks you is just how HUGE the rooms are. I'm pretty sure my first studio apartment was much smaller than this room. The bed was to die for and made me sleepy within seconds. Fabulous amenities and an all suite hotel sans casino make this place feel like somewhere overflowing with high class. Here's the catch though, the service is hit or miss. We had two instances of a rude service staff. 1.) I asked a elevator attendant how my friend's valet would be charged to my room if they didn't take a ticket and he condescendingly replied, \"SIR valet is FREE.\" And \"pfft'd\" under his breath. 2.) Check out is at 11am and we were scrambling to get out, but by 11:17am there was pounding on our door and the very rude housekeeping professional asked us if we were staying late and we said very politely, \"no\". Well that was all she needed to reply to us in a stern and demanding tone \"SIR check out is at 11am! You need to check out now.\" Well given the lines downstairs and the impossible to operate check out on the TV we were obviously running late. Our bad, but come on be a little more polite. 3.) After all of this I filled out a survey to which I received an automatically generated apology email. I requested in the survey that someone contact me and of course nobody ever did. I called the hotel again and got the run around from a rude front desk attendant. So this hotel is about quantity over quality and I don't think they care much about retention.

First I asked for 2 rooms together with a door connected in between. They said ok. But when we went up there, the rooms were together, but there's no door in between which we can open. We asked several times, and they couldn't accommodate our request. Then I found an old fast food box (with food) left in the fridge that didn't get to be taken out by the house keepers. They came pretty fast and cleaned out the mess but left a weird sour smell in the fridge. Then we asked for some slippers. They never brought them. We called them at least 5 times and they always said it's on the way. i also find there's no lotion in the bathroom and of course I called them to bring 1. Nope never brought the lotion. Finally we asked them to bring some sheets and blanket for the sofabed. It took many phone calls and a VERY LONG time for them to bring them and they left them in the wrong room (my friends room). The front desk staffs were not friendly and the house keeping service was TERRIBLE. We ended up stayed 1 night and cancelled the 2nd night. I will never stay in that hotel. I wonder how they got 5 star hotel rating. After staying in that hotel I got a survey email from them.

(annoying) we called down to speak with someone at the front desk and they offered to move us to another room immediately. we loved the new room(35th floor with a panoramic view of las vegas all the way to the mountains.!!!) needless to say we were very happy. 2. our new room was great but not as open as initial room, it had a wall that seperated the sitting area from the bedroom with a pull out sofa and chair, glass coffee tables, two flat screens, large bathroom with seperate glass shower and large soaking tub (the ish!!!!) kitchenette with table for two, small fridge, sink,two burner stovetop,...etc. the housekeeping in this suite was immaculate...a few issues turned me off slightly....the toilet stopped up as soon as we got there (had to call front desk for repair), handle on bathroom door fell off and nearly smashed my toes! (had to call for repair) handle on kitchen sink came off! (another repair call)....annoying???!!!! yes!!

It is a stretch to call the room a suite and there was not a lot of room to navigate in the \"deluxe\" room with the sofa bed in use. It was a long walk to the Strip,so the location was not ideal. I will say, the walk to the Aria casino was not as bad as some walks I have had when staying on site (e.g. the walk from Encore to the Wynn poker room.)

With the Vdara, I missed having a casino on site... the closest casino is either the Bellagio, or a tram ride to the Aria, or a 10 minute walk directly to the Strip. I also missed having a selection of restaurants on site (the Vdara has one - I think, that is more a high-end grocery store & very small cafe), I also missed shops - to buy either hotel wear or souviniers (the Vdara has none), and then there's the pool - where the Mirage pool (and seemingly every other pool area we visited was attractive, vibrant, and full of life the Vdara pool is... well, a pool - and that's about it. Very small & very boring. We are by no means party people, but when in Vegas we expect to imerse ourlselves in the culture of the town, and the Vdara just didn't do it for us, mostly because of it's lack of amenities and proximity to \"the action\".

Okay, so why the high rating... what the Vdara does offer is beautiful rooms with great views (of places you wish weren't a tram ride away - LOL), the linens are amazing, the bathrooms are spotlessly clean, and the room set-up is very smart (afterall these are suites, not really hotel rooms). ...but that pool area - ugh!

No noise from the pool but a lot of traffic noise at night. You get used to it. Got a good deal with a Southwest Air package. Figure the room cost about $80/night plus the $20 resort fee. Don\u2019t look for the switch that controls the curtains by the bed or the windows. It is on the wall in the little area between the kitchen and main room. Also there is a main light switch by the front door that housekeeping always turns off. Couldn\u2019t figure out why none of the lights would work until I flipped that main switch. Bathroom has a big soaking tub with a separate shower. There is kind of a funky odor that I think is coming from the bathroom vent. You might want to bring a can of Lysol. Turned on the Housekeeping light when I left the room about 9AM and it was always cleaned when I got back about noon. They always left two bottles of water in the refrigerator. You can pick up a free paper in the lobby including USA Today and WSJ. Wireless internet worked fine. Interesting that the Vdara was the only wireless connection available. Pool is nice with plenty of chairs and umbrellas for shade. FYI \u2013 It is not a salt water pool. There is a big Jacuzzi that actually has hot water. No noise from the neighbors (if I had any) until the 5th night which was a Friday. That is when all the party people checked in. The walls are not that sound proof when there are people on both sides of the room yelling at 3AM. Had a little glitch trying to use the TV check-out. It said it was unable to process. Had to go down to the lobby and wait in line. Then they said I was already checked out so the TV check-out must have worked even though it said there was a problem.

Our rooms were spacious, real spacious, equipped with a mini kitchen, a bar, and refrigerator just for your own personal goodies, an excellent view, especialy at night. The best part about it, and most might say what is she talking about, is the fact that the room key function is not goverened by this magnetic strip, which can disallow access to your room if it is near a phone or other credit cards. This key is just a plastic key with some kind of chip in it that you wave in front of the door and it opens. You have three buttons on your wall instead of the hang tags used in most hotels, and you can select housekeeping, do not disturb, and the third one was just a general light that i assume allows housekeeping to know they if they are at your door, they can knock and ask you if you want your room cleaned or need any more towels and stuff, in case you didn't realize that option is available. You have two flat screen tvs so if you are like me, one who likes to watch her own shows, then this option is ideal for you and your companion or crumb snatchers. The bar is ideal as it is open until late at night and has plenty of comfortable seating inside and outside. There is a Market Place spot with a quick mini grocery sections, it is high as the sky though, but, you pay for convenience.

First off, when the bellhop put our luggage on a rack upon arriving, they left our stuff sitting outside without taking it to the back. I sat there and watched it for 5 full minutes before a person finally took it to the back where it could safely sit. That was after watching several empty handed bellhops pass by it. I even walked up to the rack and took something off of it and no one said a thing. What if it hadn't been my stuff? Our bathtub had hair in it when we got up to the room. Not just a hair, but several hairs. Made me wonder how well they clean the tubs!! Shower leaked all over the floor anytime it was used. The rest of our stay was pretty uneventful until we left. We had realized we had left a couple of my sons items behind when we checked out. We were sure they were left in the room and that he hid them somewhere. He is two and puts stuff anywhere. 2 hours after checking out we realized it and called to have them check the room. We were told they would get back to us and didn't. We decided to go back to retrieve the items and talked to a manger by the name of zach who was at the front desk. He assured us the room had been cleaned and the items were not found but that a manager would check the room. 20 minutes later he said they were not found in the room and at this point there was nothing they could do. He acted like we had not really left them behind even though we were positive we did. I had started to cry because I was so upset about them not finding his stuff that had sentimental value to us. He assured me several times that he would call us that night and let us know if he had heard anything or if they had been found. NEVER CALLED!!!!! Between me and my husband we talked to probably around 20 different people between lost and found and housekeeping and management. They way they run things there is a nightmare. They made it so difficult to locate our stuff. We left vegas two days later very upset that they didn't find our stuff. We called everyday, several times a day for a week. They told us that they could have been lost in the laundry and that could take weeks to locate! ERRRG! Finally after a week of them telling us they were not there, a nice young lady in lost and found called the room and had the current guest check the room for them. GUESS WHAT????? They were in there the WHOLE TIME!!!!! So frustrating!!! A cleaning lady and a housekeeping manager couldn't find them in the room but a guest can?????? All that hassle and the last two days of our trip ruined because they don't clean properly!!!! Will NEVER stay there again!!!!!

We got a great rate that included a daily buffet at any MGM Mirage casino hotel which was very nice. I hate, hate, hate the cigarette cloud that you find in most all the properties in Las Vegas. I understand it, but it's still frustrating for non-smokers who have allergies. The Vdara was a refreshing getaway from all of this. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a view room overlooking the fountains at Bellagio. If you don't reserve this kind of room - you should ask if you can upgrade at check-in. The view was spectacular! The room was very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was large and had a big soaking tub (not jetted) with a separate glass enclosed shower. We did use the small empty fridge for beverages but did not use the actual kithcenette (microwave, cooktop). Very handy though if you need it! The bed was very comfy. My biggest complaint about the room overall is the blackout shades. I like to sleep-in on vacation and the shades don't hug the window at all, so about 6:00 in the morning, sunlight fills the room. Very annoying. They should have thought that out better when designing the room. The only issue we incurred was with housekeeping the first day. We left our room early and pushed the button for housekeeping and were gone for about 8 hours only to return and not have our room serviced. We left for dinner and told the front desk and by the time we returned it was clean. Problem solved. We used our buffet passes 3 times. We started at the Aria buffet and then tried the Monte Carlo and went back to Aria. I have been to many buffets in Vegas and the Aria is by far my favorite. Not only was the selection amazing, but the quality of food was exceptional. Vdara has a bar, but no restaurants which is fine. It's about a 2 mintue walk to Aria which has plenty to go around.

The price was right at $85 per night but then you have to add on the $20 per night resort fee. They also place a hold on my credit card of $110 per night as a security deposit. I am not sure why the deposit is per night, its not like if there is damage it grows with the length of time I stay. Check-in was a breeze at around 930pm on Wednesday. Only two people manning the desk an only two people in line. We never noticed a bad smell in the lobby or the public places like others did. You will have to show your room key to the security person near the elevator each time you want to go up, so don't forget the key. The elevator was quick to the 41st floor, we eneded up with a room with a view over CityCentre, Monte Carlo and the Mandalay Bay. It took us a bit to get the lights going, appartently the master switch is by the door and if you don't turn it on, the lights won't come on. When we walked in, we were in the \"kitchen\" with a large table and two chair, we had a fridge, microwave, 2 burner stove and a garberator. As mentioned before, there was no cutlery or tableware. Walking through the kitchen put us in the main room, the queen bed was off to the right, the sofa was in front of us and the desk ahead on the left. The tv was mounted on the wall opposite the bed above a chest of drawers. The bathroom has a large shower, a big tub and dimmer lights. The bathroom does have a slider door with a frosted glass insert so you can \"shadow\" dance if you like. The staff was friendly and the cleaning staff did a nice job. We never ate at the cafe but it seemed busy. The crowd was mainly 20-30 year olds which surprised us. We did like the no-smoking policy. The cons which we weren't happy with. 1. the self-parking is a 15 minutes walk/ride away. The only parking at the Vdara is valet which does not work with rental cars as the valet would not be a listed driver. We had to park at the Aria self-parking, take the overpass to the Aria, walk through a variety of doors to the tram station. To get to the station, you have to ride the escalator up. Once you get the tram, you take it to the Vdara/Bellagio stop. Again, you go down the escalator and through some doorways til you get to the walkway to the Vdara. It was a pain to drag luggage through. It also meant no spur of the moment decisions to go out since it was a pain to get to the car. The location of the garage meant that you would come out in the middle of the strip and be subjected to the traffic. 2. the lights by the bed are controlled by a switch in the kitchen so it is not the best for laying in bed and then turning out the lights. There are two little spot lights in the bed for reading I guess but generally useless. 3. We had three phones in the room, only one worked. The one by the bed was not even plugged in and there was not cord. The one in the bathroom didn't work either. 4. My wife noticed that there was no hairdryer in the room which has been pretty standard everywhere we have travelled before. 5. the blackout blinds are useless due to the large gaps between them. 6. neither one of us found the bed comfortable and we had terrible sleeps. Overall, I am not sure we would stay here again. I would have given the property 3.5 stars if we were permitted to use the half star.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cCornerstone values of service and respect have gone by the wayside at the VDARA!\u201d", "Author": "Ramalamadingdong", "ReviewID": "UR116116189", "Content": "7 ladies from across Western Canada came together for a long anticipated Girls Weekend to celebrate some milestone birthdays.

For starters, the pool area is inadequate, very small and disappoininting. Secondly, one group of women upgraded to the Vdara Suite in the hopes that we could host our own happy hours and get some visiting in. While the suite was acceptable in size and decor, we discovered late at night that in this particular room phones didn't work and the tvs didn't work. Without a working phone in the room that certainly does present a safety issue for its residents in case of medical emergencies, fire etc. Because of the late hour, we took our chances and opted to sleep on it and report the probem in the morning. Much to our dismay we dealt with the day time manager who was extremely condescending and not willing to listen to reason. Long story short, we ended up being assigned a new room in a different tower of the building, we moved our own bedding and belongings ourselves and we were very disappointed that no one was ever sent to help us move rooms. What kind of hotel lets ladies move their own belongings (after waiting over an hour for someone to show up)? It was not like this move was down the hall, it took over 10 minutes of schlepping our suitcases up and down elevators and down long hallways. We later stated our displeasure to the same manager and she, with her plastic face, told us we could have a resort credit of $75.00. That credit bought 3 ladies lunch at the Vdara. Finally, at checkout, we weren't asked how our stay was but we volunteered the information anyways. After retelling our story we were offered a discount on our next stay at the Vdara or their sister hotel - we responded \"not on your life would we come here again.\" Cornerstone values of service and respect seems to have gone by the wayside at the Vdara.

They have power blackout shades, but light still gets in because it is 3 separate shades. The bathroom was roomy, had a soaking tub & shower. King size bed was comfortable. **NOTE: the other bed in the room is a sleeper sofa - which worked out ok for our son (10 yrs old), but I'm sure not anywhere near as comfortable as the bed. Luckily the room is decent sized so even with having the sofa bed out the whole time there was room to walk around, etc. There is a desk and a dinette table with 2 chairs. They did miss cleaning our room one of the days, we called and were credited the resort fee for that day. The next day they did a great job cleaning. It is a nice & quiet hotel -- they did a good job with the sound proofing. We were glad it is a nonsmoking hotel. Casinos, restaurants, etc. are all within easy walking distance. The pool was clean, staff was friendly, but the pool does close early (7pm). There is a small cafe in the lobby, but a lot of the food is premade (like the sandwiches - so if you don't like the sauce, you are out of luck because they don't have any other options). **My biggest complaint would be the strong perfume air freshener they have constantly pumping out in the lobby - it's enough to give you an instant headache. If the rooms and rest of the place had been like this, I could not have stayed there. There is also sometimes a long wait at the front desk - often only one or 2 persons working. Beware if you are in a hurry to check out/catch a plane, etc. The first night when we checked in, it took almost a half our for them to bring up our bags... if we had known, we would've just brought them up ourselves as we were waiting for them so we could change clothes and go out to dinner.

Vdara is just off the strip, but is next to the Bellagio, and has a connection to it, so most days we just walked through the Bellagio to get to the strip. The check-in & check-out process was fast and efficient. Just be warned that Vdara has a $20 resort fee per day that you must pay at the end of your trip. Unfortunately, we were not aware of this when we booked our trip, so it was a bit of a surprise. We requested a room on a high floor, which we were given. Our room was on the 43rd floor, and overlooked the Bellagio pools and fountain, we could also see Paris, and The Palms resort on the other side. The view was spectacular! The Bellagio fountains are a bit loud, and at night with the tv off you could hear them going off, but this wasn't an impediment for me to fall asleep. Perhaps if you need absolute quiet to fall asleep, you should request a room on the other side... The rooms were great, very clean, modern furniture, and a kitchenette. The beds and pillows were super soft and I always had a great nights sleep :) The hotel provides you with 2 free small bottles of water per day, but make sure you don't take the bottled water from the mini-bar because you will be charged for it. The free bottles are labeled with the hotel name and they're in a separate fridge. We didn't eat or drink at the hotel, so I can't comment on that.

The rooms feel more like the modern apartment you wish you could afford than hotel rooms. And it's a welcome, peaceful retreat from the craziness of the Strip.

In the other direction, through a quiet hallway just off the Vdara lobby, you have direct access to the Bellagio hotel and all that it has to offer.

There were very few people in the hotel and we felt like it was private and somewhat exclusive. We stayed for the second time in July 2011. The hotel is still beautiful and wonderfully maintained. The beds weren't quite as comfy and the maids left something to be desired. Every day we would be missing one of the bathroom toiletries that should have been replaced.

I have been in the rooms at the Bellagio, Mandarin, and Aria. I would say the Vdara is much nicer than any of those \u2013 hands down. Pros: Vdara has convenient access to the Bellagio that we really enjoyed. The Aria, which is also very close, has the nicest of all the casinos in my opinion. We enjoyed the pool area at Vdara. If you are looking for a large pool with a party atmosphere \u2013 this is not the place. The Vdara pool area is smaller than others but nice and very relaxing. My very favorite thing about the Vdara is that if you stay on the side near the Bellagio fountains, you can watch them go off from your room all night.

After a four night stay, I don't regret it one bit and didn't miss the MGM at all. The entire staff at the Vdara was outstanding. I arrived in Vegas at 11:30a.m. and went right to the hotel. I asked if it was possible for an early check in and it was! They checked me in right away and I was in my deluxe suite by 12p.m. A bellman brought up my luggage about 10 minutes later. I then asked him for a couple of kitchen place settings. They also arrived in minutes. The room was awesome. I had the entry level suite and it had a nice kitchen area, dining table, and a separate living room area and bedroom area. The bathroom was great, clean. The water pressure was fine and the soaking tub was incredible and filled quickly. The Market Vdara was a great place to get coffee and breakfast. I thought it was very reasonably priced. The service around the pool was excellent. Aria is about a 3 minute walk. Bellagio is about a 5 minute walk though a covered walk way...and if you don't mind walking on the road (illegally I might add like I did) you can walk from Vdara to the strip in about 5 minutes.

Yes it is a mecca of non-gambling and non-smoking (shouldn't they all be non-smoking?) which is a rare find in Las Vegas, but the service left a lot to be desired. Like other reviewers here, we booked the suite for three people (my wife and son along with me) and yet there was no bedding on the sofa bed and not sufficient towels in the bathroom. Also like other reviewers have found, there is no funnelling at check-in/check-out so we waited over 30 minutes to check-in and around the same to check-out. This was no fluke of timing as you could see similarly lengthy queues every day we were there. MGM, who own the propery, should know and do better. Having said that, there are lots of positives about the Vdara. As said, it is non-gambling and non-smoking and a great, central location just off The Strip, and is thus perfectly suited to families. It is an all-suite hotel, so the rooms are generous and you get a kitchenette (with no cutlery or crockery?) so you can bring food back to the room and re-heat/cook it, which is great for families trying to cut some costs. The beds are superb and it you can arrange it, you get great views from your room of the fountain show at the Bellagio next door. The pool and the pool area is adequate, although it was too warm given the weather in July and it was also quite dirty in the afternoons (but great in the morning).

First the positives: - Check-in agent (Jordan) was very nice, helpful and accommodating - Had a great poolside massage from lovely massage therapist Ivy - The room (31st floor) was spacious, seemed clean. Had a nice dining area, large bathroom with tub and shower. - We booked the \"Summer Package\" which initially was a great deal (2 nights in a deluxe suite, view upgrade, daybed rental at the pool, $50 food/beverage credit at pool, amenities basket from pool, 2-for-1 drinks at the bar) - Bellman James was quick, helpful, extremely careful with our bags, pleasant, sweet. - The hotel is non-smoking and there's no gaming (casino) which is great if you don't smoke or gamble, which we do not. - Room service (for a very basic breakfast) was fast and the server was very nice. - The hotel is an eco-hotel, which we appreciated. Now for the negatives. There are so many, it's hard to know where to start. - Our rooms never got cleaned, even though we had the service light on when we left for the day. Also, when we arrived, there was trash and old room service trays in the hallway outside our doors. - We were really looking forward to relaxing poolside for this weekend getaway. However, the way the pool is run is a joke, and service there was terrible. Even after speaking with a manager, it didn't get any better. Resort pool operation is not rocket science, and we have visited many 5-star resort hotel pools that are run like well-oiled machines. Vdara's pool was the opposite: non-functioning computers (so the main attendant had to do everything by hand; then she had no idea about the package specials we were supposed to get), wait staff who didn't attend to their sections correctly, so service was spotty or non-existent at the daybeds we rented; when we did get poolside service, the waitresses just didn't care and were slow; the selection of food and beverages on the menu was limited but I never got to order any of it anyway because in the 3 hours we were there the server showed up twice. We never got the daybed amenities that we were supposed to get as part of the Summer Specials package. We had daybed reservations for 2 days and didn't bother coming back the 2nd day because we just didn't want to have a bad and upsetting experience all over again. - There is a serious lack of dining options in the Vdara, and the options aren't great. There is one low-brow restaurant, room service, and bar food at the bar and pool. - Because we got fed up at the pool and couldn't get food, we decided to go downstairs to the Market restaurant and have lunch. BIG mistake. The cashiers and \"servers\" there were slow, apathetic and clueless -- all qualities you do not want in people handling your food. I ordered a turkey burger and the cashier asked, \"how do you want that cooked?\" Seriously?? How about I'd like my poultry *cooked*? So of course it came out over-done, dry and tasteless, and didn't have the things I asked for on it. Other things that are Restaurant 101 but they couldn't figure out: tables were dirty and took a long time to be cleared. Then when they cleared them, I still had to wipe them down because they didn't do it properly; servers didn't bring out enough utensils and took over 10 minutes after food was served to bring out more... In the end I got utensils from a manager who was apologetic and blamed the poor service on the fact that the kitchen was making food for the entire hotel. - When we checked out and the receptionist asked us how our stay was, we were honest and told her about all of these shortcomings. She did not seem surprised. Although she was apologetic, the most she could do was remove the daily resort fees from our charges. That's a whopping $20/day. \"But I can't refund the tips though\" was her caveat. We never asked her to refund the tips we paid. We asked her if the hotel was busy with a convention or had some other huge spike in bookings, which would *maybe* explain the bad and strange lack of service for a 5-star resort hotel. Nope, it wasn't busier than any other summer weekend in Vegas. Were they perhaps understaffed? Nope, they had plenty of staff, she said. So basically there was no excuse for their poor service, from her point of view. We think that there is perhaps a major lack of training for the Vdara staff, because seriously, this is not how service at a 2-year-old 5-star resort should be. And they are probably a bit understaffed as well. There are PLENTY of other fine accommodation and resort choices in Las Vegas, and it's just not worth it to stay at the Vdara.

Arrived via airport shuttle (wasn't going to worry about cabs and taking wrong way there!). We were very early (1100am) to check in/put baggage with the bell men.

The clerk looks at my name and confirmation number and said \"oh, we have that you no-show'd your reservation last month.\" Confused, i told her why would i book a package (through bookit) that would have a different hotel time than my flight. She took my confirmation page and said she'd be right back; had to check with a manager. Meanwhile, i'm internally freaking out!! I had heard the next woman over say they were fully booked.... About 20 minutes later, the girl comes back, Aylin i think her name was, said okay you can't check in yet, but we have your room. I asked her if i were getting double charged for this, and she gave me the \"are you kidding me?\" look. Heck, it was their mistake not mine that i was listed as not showing up. I asked her if we would be getting any kind of compensation for the hassle. Same look: \"why? we have a room for you?\" I was two seconds away from giving her my shirt to go get dry cleaned as i sweated it away! You travel all this way for hours to find out that you might not have a room??!?! I would have offered to at least take off the resort fee (to which we used none of it). So we put our stuff in bell man, returned at 300pm (she didn't offer to take our number down for a call if the room was ready early, nor did she take off the resort fee for our troubles). The room was very nice. 41st floor...back view. Saw the back of Mandalay/Monte Carlo/Luxor etc... Looking down you saw the pool. Kitty-corner to the left was a view of the airport and tropicana. Straight ahead was the Aria. I was content with it as i knew i wasn't staying in my room the whole trip. Only minor complaints about the room: there are no hooks to hang up wet towels. We had to use the edge of the bathtub. The waste basket was beside the toilet and not under the sink area. Took us a bit to find that one. The shower door needs a rubber stopper cuz when you let go of it, it slams hard!! We thought we were going to break it! The room beside us was smoking and we could smell it through to our unit. The hallway on our first night there was really messy. Lots of dishes, paper bits and the air purifier. Positive notes: beds and linens were awesome!! What a comfy sleep! The hotel being non smoking had a true resort feel, i commented multiple times to hubby that i felt like i was in mexico again with everything smelling so fresh. The walk to the bellagio literally took 2 minutes from the hotel lobby. The tram that takes you to Aria/City Center or to Monte Carlo was handy especially if you were in heels for dinner! We were in bellagio so many times we felt like we were staying in there but without paying bellagio prices. I would stay at the vdara again.

The room was spacious with automatic drapes and blackouts and a fabulous view which was everchanging. There was a small separate kitchen area with basic crockery. Additional items could be requested from reception. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The bathroom was also huge with an enormous shower and bath. Ideal. The hotel was connected to the Bellagio, the Aria and the Monte Carlo by free monorail. It was a bit of a convuluted trek out onto 'The Strip' which is busy all the time!

If we could have just closed that one shade then we could have still watched the Bellagio water shows, but having a guy stare into your room the whole time was a little uncomfortable so we had to keep them closed. The cleaning staff is VERY slow or they just don't care - our decorative blanket was in the hallway outside our door when we checked in. We realized after we went to the pool and came back that the blanket must belong to us but we didn't want a dirty blanket on the bed, so we called housekeeping to pick it up. 4 hours later it was still there. We gave up and just kept it in the corner of our room the whole time. There was the same bottlecap in our hallway for over 24 hours. We had the housekeeping call button pressed on our room, were gone for 5 hours, came back and our room hadn't been touched. The service at the pool was slow and unprofessional. Our \"organic\" chicken fingers were undercooked and she forgot our drink order twice.

We used the pool area only twice, but both times we found loungers easily and we not harmed by the infamous death ray. We saw plenty of drink service and the second day they came around with free samples of their pink lemonage and magarita slushies. There was security at the elevators at all times of days waiting to ensure everyone who went up had a room key, very comforting. We never utilitzed the small cafe in the lobby, instead we headed over to Cosmo, down the step and into the parking garage, to hit the Wicked Spoon buffet to get our day started. It is also a very short walk to Aria or through to the Bellagio. Valet service was quick and efficient, we never waited more than 5 minutes for our car.

We booked our rooms through priceline.com and got an excellent deal ($125/night inclusive of taxes). Upon arrival, check in was quick and they were able to put us in a room at 10:00am. This was fantastic as it gave us the opportunity to go straight to the pool. The pool was just the right size with umbrellas and plenty of lounge chairs. It was 105 degrees that weekend so taking a dip in the pool was a welcome treat. There's also a jacuzzi on the side. The rooms are mini suites with modern and elegant decor. Walking in the room is a little dining table followed by a seating area with a tv and flat screen tv. On the other side is another flat screen right in front of the bed. The bathroom had a separate shower and a deep tub-perfect for taking a bath (which was great). Vdara is connected to bellagio through an outdoor walkway (about a 3 minute walk) and also has a freem tram that takes you to Monte Carlo/City Center. The tram is convenient arriving every 3 minutes or so. We really enjoyed the fact that it was a non gaming non smoking casino. After gambling all day it was fun to come back to a retreat that was nice and quiet. They do charge a $20 resort fee (internet, gym use is included in this fee)/per day Overall, I really enjoyed our trip here.

I was initially concerned as the location was not directly on the Strip, however I was quite pleased that it did not actually have a Casino on the premises as I hoped the focus of the hotel would be more on being \"a hotel\" as their primary offering. I was so right! The location is amazing, close to everything but just removed sufficiently not to be amidst the hustle and bustle. It is a few steps away from the Aria Hotel and Casino as well as the Bellagio. What a bonus that was! Upon our arrival, I was inconvienced by the signatuer scent they pipe through the ventilation systems but the staff quickly stepped up to take care of the problem. Austin was on duty that night and although he seemed a little young to be holding such a vast responsibility, he got AJ to show us a beautiful suite in order to assess whether I would continue to be inconvenienced by the smell. The rooms were great and there was not the same issue with the ventilation system in the rooms. Once we gave our OK, Sean quickly brought up our bags to the room and made sure that we got settled in nicely. Everything went up hill from there! The level of service was consistent and flawless. We were greeted all day long as we exited elevators and security requested a show of room key prior to admitting anyone into the elevator area. I found this to be a nice touch in order to make guests feel safe. The gym is well equipped and the pool fabulous! There is a great lounge pool side with a fantastic and reasonably priced menu. Erin was prompt and great at making suggestions off the menu. The person in charge of the business centre was beyond helpful and provided guidance and support as required. The concierges were always helpful and eager to assist with any request. I have to give a special mention to the beds and bedding.

Most of the complaints were about bad service, no utensils, too far away from the strip,etc... Please ignore all the bad reviews. When we first arrived it took approx 10 minutes to check in. We asked if we could have a view of the Bellagio fountains and they gave us a room on the 41st floor, with a view of Rio, Bellagio, Caesars, etc.... Upon entering our room we both were smiling when we saw how beautiful it was. Nice kitchen (although we never used it), the room was amazing with wall to wall windows, 2 large tv's, kingsize bed, which was the most comfortable that I've slept in for a long time.The bathroom had a large soaker tub and shower. The style of the room is very modern, so if you're expecting old english roses, this is not the hotel for you. The service was amazing. We put our \"do not disturb\" button on and came back that night to a message from the front desk asking if our room was up to par. It took us a day to figure out the short cuts to the Bellagio, Monte Carlo, etc... but once you figure out the tram system and short cuts through the casinos, you will save a ton of walking, if that's what you want. Check out was a breeze, just click the appropriate area on the TV. The pool was smaller than we expected, but still very nice, with amazing service. Free drink samples too. As a side note, we decided to cab it from the airport to the hotel, as opposed to taking the shuttle, and we saved about $30. All in all, this was the best hotel we have ever stayed in in Las Vegas.

Part of the famed City Center development, Vdara is positioned back from the strip and is a non-gaming property. It is connected by short outdoor walkways to either Bellagio (and the MGM tram station) or Aria and the rest of City Center. First impressions were great: short line upon my early afternoon arrival, friendly staff, accommodation of my high floor booking request, and a cool and comfortable lobby when the outside temperature was pushing 105. Unfortunately, the front desk clerk made an error that cost me significant time later to correct, only the lobby air conditioning could handle the heat, and my room had a bizarre array of problems. Vdara was designed to be a condo-only building and when MGM redirected plans for the property to make it a hotel, the budget for completion must have been slashed. At every turn, there were signs of cut corners. For example, every guest room including my standard room has a basic kitchen including at least a refrigerator, microwave, and two-burner cook top, but there's no kitchenware--you must request and wait for it each day and no kitchen cleaning supplies or even paper towels. The room didn't even include a coffeemaker. The poor finishing construction was obvious in my room: the sliding door to the bathroom was installed incorrectly and so even when fully extended would remain open by about 5 inches. Worse, the sill to the shower was positioned incorrectly so when the shower was in use, water would flood the bathroom. Once I noticed it was possible to prevent the flooding with a few towels, but that first use caused a real mess. Additionally, the room climate control simply couldn't handle the summer heat. The AC ran 24/7 and never brought the room temperature below 75. Other than those problems and a broken window shade, the room was modern with comfortable furniture and two large HDTVs (one on each side of the room divider). I had one great interaction with a helpful concierge who worked with me to fix the front desk clerk's error and another positive experience with a helpful valet, but in general, staff seemed to be lacking in training. The in-hotel cafe staff in particular acted like everyday was their first in the job. Maybe Vdara will fix their issues with another six months in operation (since the first 18 don't seem to have been enough), but given the high price, I'd look elsewhere in Las Vegas.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "udo_schuklenk", "ReviewID": "UR115186791", "Content": "I love this hotel, it's close to the strip but thankfully does not feature a casino, hence no smell of nicotine permeates this property.

Other reviews have pointed out that it feels more like a condo building than a hotel, and I would have to agree. The room was comfortable enough, with plenty of natual light streaming through the abundant windows, but the lack of attention to detail gives me the impression this was rushed to get finished and corners were cut in the wake of the GFC. I did get a very good deal for a corner suite, and the separate living/dining area with kitchen and laundry could be useful had I intended on using them, but the bedroom was tiny. The limited wardrobe space was difficult to access as the doors would not open fully, and the 3 coathangers provided weren't nearly enough. The biggest design flaw however was the large intake vent for the HVAC system right beside the wardrobe and only a few feet from the bed, meaning sleep was difficult if the AC system continued to run during the night with the constant drone of the air being sucked into the system. There are small reading lights above the bed, one of which didn't even have a globe in it, and they lacked effective lighting to be able to read properly. The larger fixed bedside lamps could not be operated from beside the bed - they had to be operated by the main switch at the bedroom entrance. Frustrating. The bathroom was a highlight though. Much larger than the Vegas standard with double vanities, separate shower and deep soaking tub, and the great feeling of naturally lit spaciousness made it a haven for luxury bathing, although the non-provision of face cloths was a glaring omission. The room overall was quite modern with dark timber accents and neutral colours, but lacked soul and warmth. The property itself is casino free which will appeal to non-gamers, but a short walk to Aria will provide punters with some relief. There is a small cafe & bar in the lobby, but that is all in the way of eateries. Again, it takes a walk to find other places to dine and there is a useful walkway to Bellagio. Being tucked behind the colossal glass structure of Aria, most of the strip views to the east are blocked, but if you're lucky and get a high floor, there are glimpses south towards Mandalay Bay & Luxor.

Just to be fair and not appear to be bias \u2013 I have also stayed at the Wynn, Venetian & The Hotel @ Manalay Bay \u2013 all which I rank favorably. The brand new hotel flaunts freshly polished furniture and facilities with minimum or no wear tear. The elevator system is quick and resulted in no waits. The hallway/walkway is dimly lit with a boutique feel which could be good or bad depending on your taste. I prefer well lit hallways especially if it can be done with natural paint colors and reflective lights but I\u2019m not the designer. And now we begin the \u201cAre you kidding me\u201d part of this review \u2013 Driving to the resort is not clean cut \u2013 a circling ramp and hope you are not arriving West from Harmon Blvd. as it requires you to slant into oncoming traffic with your vision partially blocked by the taxi queue. Brilliant design folks just brilliant. It is important to note \u2013 this hotel doesn\u2019t have Self-Parking so don\u2019t be deceived by the Self-Parking sign which directs you back to Las Vegas Blvd as you can\u2019t park on Las Vegas Blvd. Valet parking at the Vdara appeared to be efficient without incidence or complaint. I can\u2019t make the same statement for the sister hotel (Aria) but will hold off until later in the review. Check-In was disappointing. 15:00 on Saturday with only 3 customer service attendants. I was first in line but waited over 10 minutes \u2013 I believe 4 persons on line after I was checked in. There was a young staff woman of Asian heritage walking around with a notebook but couldn\u2019t figure out her value or purpose as I would anticipate if I were in a similar role I would either call/page someone in the back to assist guess waiting in queue over 10 minutes (like myself) or comfort the waiting patrons by apologizing for the wait/inconvenience. I might suggest the hotel eliminate her role and spend the funding by adding another person behind the desk or even better invest in organizing the waiting queue (ie. Reference a bank, airport security screening, US Immigration,etc. etc. etc.) by purchasing simple rope and signs. My check in took 4 minute when I finally did speak to someone. No purchase/upgrade offered! Room \u2013 while mostly new quite a few unfavorable observations. Pricelist for minibar available but room wasn\u2019t stocked with supply \u2013 I was ready to purchase the orange juice but there was none? Perhaps, this is a child friendly room or candy-free line? Not my expectation for a high-end hotel. No coffee/tea maker added to no minibar leaves no beverage options without calling room service or heading downstairs? No utensils in the kitchen whatsoever. Light switches don\u2019t make sense or logical so a label might help The room offers three telephones (bathroom, living area and bedside) but only the bedside unit was functional.Can't optimize that $20 resort fee without a phone. Bathroom offered only a single hanging towel holder. Not sure if a design flaw, engineer didn\u2019t have screws for 2nd hook or they anticipate only solo travelers will occupy the 003 rooms. Other miscellaneous \u2013 iron was slightly broken still functional but cracked, blinds which shield sunlight was defective on the right side (perhaps a previous guest or just defective mechanism/motor), and pen supplied in the room was extremely cheap in quality (minor but representative of things). The most annoying part of the room was the noise/sounds from neighbors. I felt it was more an inner city apartment building vs. a high-end hotel. I\u2019ll elaborate on this topic as I felt uncomfortable overhearing the bell hop advising adjacent room guest of options as they entered. More concerning is what can they hear from my room (key point I was in the bathroom overhearing this conversation). I wish to introduce to the architect a simple concept called Sound-proofing of walls/doors, etc. Next, due to the limited dining options at this hotel it is require to visit the adjoining CityCentre/Aria for sit-down. However, my experience due to heavy rain outside the tram connector was suspended. No one working in the Vdara has been prep on alternatives to the tram when increment weather. One valet worker even stated, \u2018The tram service is halted because the electrical system may short out due to the weather?\u2019 Are you an idiot? I couldn\u2019t help but to chuckle at the comment considering all the trams worldwide (including Las Vegas Airport) which could encounter a short during rainfall and wind. I digress \u2013 without tram service the ONLY methods to get to the Aria is walk exposed via the overpass (which has no protection from rain/wind) or obtain your car from Vdara valet and drive about 50 yards and give it back to Aria valet. Maybe a covered walkway would offer guest an efficient path in all weather conditions. BTW \u2013 If a hotel requires all guest to use valet it is imperative to have PERFECT operations as the Aria lost my vehicle. I mention to the clerk upon check-in I\u2019m leaving within 60 minutes but required to wait about 13 minutes to retrieve my vehicle. The clerk was honest enough to mention it was misplaced when questioned on the delay. This hotel should seriously consider Self-Parking for guests as it doesn\u2019t appear they are staffed for peaks periods of transactions (ie. Dinner time holiday weekend). Finally, check-out process met the low barometer of the check-in process. At 9am on July 4th \u2013 only two clerks (one stepped into the back) and a queue for 5 persons waiting service. I would suggest anyone checking out on a weekend to hand in their valet tag prior to queuing on line. This is simply unacceptable for a high-end hotel. My overall recommendations \u2013 I felt customer service, knowledge of staff, missing amenities and basic details were ignored in crafting of this hotel. I can\u2019t speak to the service/lodging at Aria or Cosmopolitan but if anything equivalent to Vdara \u2013 I will gladly bypass all three in choosing lodging during my next stay in Vegas. The folks impressed by this place should really consider staying at any hotel I mentioned earlier as the improved experience might explode your skull.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, UT", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, non-gaming hotel- just read reviews 1st and you'll be happy!\u201d", "Author": "browna1234", "ReviewID": "UR115062773", "Content": "We recently did a quick mid-week trip to Vegas and pricelined Vdara for a great deal. I read all of the reviews in advance so knew what to expect. No property is perfect, but with knowing it's little idiosyncracies, we were VERY happy with our stay! Here's a few pros/cons/quirks: - Pros: ROOMS. Even our most basic suite (deluxe), with only a partial view of the Bellagio fountains on the 24th floor, was beautiful. Clean, modern and comfortable with a kitchenette and a beautiful furniture and bathroom. LOCATION. We loved the non-gaming, non-smoking, just off the strip features. We easily walked between our property, Aria, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and Planet Hollywood, and were SO pleased to return to our non-smoking lobby. GYM/SPA. We used the very modern and well-supported gym every day. Even though it's small, staff was always there cleaning machines and replenishing waters and towels. Spa was very nice as well; I only had a quickie mani/pedi but lovely space and staff. - Cons. (These weren't at all dealbreakers for us as we easily accomodated them into our plans). No restaurant in the hotel other than the market downstairs. However, unlike other reviewers, I was very pleased with the Market food and prices (for Vegas, mind you). For example, one day we left the pool and were heading to a big buffet later so just wanted a light snack for lunch. We bought a premade turkey sandwich to share (huge and yummy!) for $9 and a nice half bottle wine for $12...where else are you sharing lunch and wine for $21 in Vegas? At the pool- SKIP the food there. Drinks were fine. We ordered the fish tacos one day and they were inedible. Just plan to eat elsewhere. HOUSEKEEPING- just know that you have to call and ASK for your room to be cleaned. Which is fine, but since they don't tell you this, I bet many guests just sit there thinking that housekeeping has skipped them... - Quirks- As many other posters shared, it's odd to have a beatiful kitchenette with literally NO piece of kitchen equipment or utensil! But, I knew this, and actually packed a couple of tupperwares for our microwaveable oatmeal in the morning :) But, when I called down a literally requested for EACH item I wanted: 2 sets of silverware; 2 coffee mugs; 2 wine glasses; a sponge and dish soap...they were all brought up very quickly and served us just fine. I DO think they would have also brought up a coffeemaker had we asked, but our camping experience has taught us to travel with Starbucks Vias and powdered creamer...coffee anywhere you have hot water! :) The last quirk is in regard to the \"Death Ray\" at the pool...the pool is not huge by Vegas standards and is packed a bit tightly with chairs, but it was very clean and we got a spot each day. The first day, we were making fun of the Death Ray comments as we didn't experience it at all. Day 2, we actaully became the Death Ray's little ants burning underneath the magnifying glass! But again, we overcame by taking a dip in the pool and a restroom break, and in 15 minutes, the Death Ray had moved over to other victims... All in all, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend Vdara to Vegas travelers. Unless your Top 2 reasons for going to Vegas include smoking and gambling...if so, Vdara is not for you. :)", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grimsby", "Title": "\u201cAmazing rooms, best I've stayed in\u201d", "Author": "cksweet1", "ReviewID": "UR115048044", "Content": "Hotel beautiful, and very modern, rooms amazing, big tv, massive window, but also a great black out curtain which is electric, lots of lights in rooms, big bathroom, lots of wardrobe space, free coffee in rooms, air con in rooms, Hotel is so modern it's like staying in a art gallery, bars and restaurants in hotel are as great as the rest of hotel Free wi fi in all hotel 3 min walk through corridor and ur in the bellagio hotel, were u can see the daily water fountain show, Hotel lifts are big and fast Pool area amazing, the hotel is like a mirror so it's extra hot around the pool, lots of sun beds and booths with beds to use.

Also a negative point of this 5 star hotel is the light switcher - seriously, almost impossible to find if you come back to your room while its dark outside! 3. Badroom is large in this hotel but with possible mold in the shower. 4. Bathtub is a little catastrophe. First of all bathtub was not clean - then the metalic plug is in the middle(!) of the bathtub so if you taking a bad you can seriously hurt your back if you are going under the water because this metalic bath plug is over the bottom of the bathtub. I took a bath there, so know what Im talking about. 5. Pool is open from 9am only, not very flexible, especially if you have to check out at this time. Why not to open from 6am?

It was immaculate, modern, and the experience was enjoyable. But other reviewers were right, beware! Positives: - Check-in was a breeze (We arrived on Thursday though). We asked for a room with a view and we got it. 43rd floor with a partial view of the Bellagio fountains. Mostly quiet, the view went on forever and was spectacular at night. Clean and new, spacious bathroom, seating area and bedroom. For the price we paid, it was a steal for such a large, modern space! Bed was super comfy! We got some great sleeps. Didn't use the kitchen, no need for cutlery (can you imagine if they provided cutlery for every single room on every single floor? Yikes!). Non-gaming, smoke-free -----> excellent! - Staff were so courteous and pleasant, the scent they pipe through the lobby is enjoyable (but not altogether necessary). Everyone we encountered was friendly and warm. The housekeeping ladies were so sweet :) - Proximity to the strip was ideal. We read the review from someone who timed the walk via the pedway through the Bellagio, it was only about 5-6 minutes depending on how fast you walk. It was so quick, don't know what other reviewers were complaining about? We thought it was perfect. There's also the city center tram, great to get to the Monte Carlo without walking in the sun! - There is no self-parking, only valet. Why is that sign even there? Despite that, renting a car and getting back was no problem at all. Signs were easy enough to follow. Negatives: - Funniest thing heard on the tram, \"What's the Vdara?\" \"That's the place where they roast people by the pool.\" Overheard talk of the Death Ray on several occasions. I can't be sure as the weather in Vegas was sweltering as it was, but even under the umbrellas and in the shade, it was sizzling at the pool. I don't know if the location is to blame or not but honestly, it WAS a small space as many reviewers mentioned. For the size of hotel, the pool area was tiny and always packed with people. We had a view of the Bellagio pools from our room....envy :P The music wasn't too loud at the pool at all. - BEWARE. This has been mentioned several times. We didn't ask when we booked the room what the security deposit would be and they DON'T TELL YOU when you check in (like other hotels). They just charge your credit card over $1000 and when you go to use it, another place says you're declined. The woman my husband talked to at the front desk didn't put up a fight, she said they would need to put a deposit of $100 a day ($400 for us) on the card in lieu of the ridiculous security fee which is what they should do in the first place? If you need to cover your assets, at least notify guests of the charge. Yeah we should have asked, but they shouldn't be shady either. Every other hotel I've been to has asked upon check in if $(insert security deposit amount) is alright to be charged to the card. It wasn't really the amount that bothered us, we had money for the trip, it was the fact that they never said anything. Surprise! - We discovered we didn't have soap when we first checked into the room. Quick call downstairs and the situation was remedied. I kid you not, it was midnight and my husband and I had come back to the room to use the shower/tub after a long day...some guy from the hotel opens the door to the room and tries to bring us more soap!! AT MIDNIGHT! Who does that? That's weird. - Blackout shades have gaps, woke us up every morning but our shade at home does that too so....you can't win em all, though at economical hotels, they have black out curtains which may have been better but altogether not as classy...

The location of the hotel was not bad. While not directly on the Strip it is far easier to get to than it seems from some of the other reviews, and takes far less time to get to the centre of the action than certain on-Strip locations. By this I mean that there is a 5-10 minute walk through Aria, Bellagio or Cosmopolitan, while to get to the same place from other on-Strip hotels can take up to an hour easily (Circus Circus used as reference). The hotel is non-smoking and non-gaming, which is a good thing when arriving late at night as we did, as there was a very short walk to the check-in desk. We were informed on checking-in of the resort fee, which we knew about before booking. Another brief walk to the rooms which were also very nice. For gaming, Aria lay across the traffic circle, Bellagio along a covered walkway, The Cosmopolitan lay down the stairs, so there is a wealth of choice of ambience while having peace in your room. The rooms we booked were the basic 'Deluxe Suites', specifically two of these suites. We were given adjoining rooms, which was the only requirement we made, other than asking to have the sofa bed made up in one of them. The rooms were big enough, with a small kitchen space to one side of the entryway and a 2-seat dining table to the other. The main area was divided into two by the media centre, which had large widescreen TV's on both sides, with the TV on the lounge facing side connected to the media hub. The lounge became very cramped when the sofa bed was made up. The bathroom was very spacious. The bathtub is very large and deep, other than that I cannot comment as I am not a tub person. The shower was large enough, with decent pressure and a seat to the side (used this for a shelf). The sink (only one in the bathroom) was large and square, with the wall behind covered by the mirror, and a vanity mirror is mounted to the side. The only complaint I had with the bathroom was with the door, which is on a sliding mechanism, and tended to leave a crack open even when fully closed. The kitchen has a two hob ceramic stove, a microwave oven, a fridge identical to the adjacent mini-bar, storage space, and a sink. There was no cooking equipment nor dishes or cutlery. We had to call down for these. Now, I mentioned that we asked for the sofa bed to be made up. That was at 9:25pm. I had to call down an hour later to chase this request, at which point I asked for full dish sets for both rooms. Around half an hour later, these arrived along with the bedding for the sofa bed. Faultless service on the dishes, but could have been better for the bedding. I cannot comment on the king-size bed, as I drew the short straw (being the youngest sibling) so I had the sofa bed. For most of the stay this was fine, as I've experienced far worse normal beds. However on the last night, the mattress shifted, resulting in a painful dip where my head was. The view from the rooms would be considered 'Mountain view' as the view was off to the Rio and Palms with the mountains in the distance, though this was spoiled somewhat by the interstate. The pool deck was not too bad, though the shades were fixed in place for much of the day, due to the Vdara 'death ray' which warped one of our keys to the point it wouldn't work. This was amazing considering that the locks are contact-less pads rather than slots. We booked cabanas for two days and these were rather nice. comp soft drinks in the fridge with some snacks and a 50\" widescreen with media hub for entertainment. There was a ceiling fan and misters to cool the place down, and four sun loungers reserved in front of each cabana for sunning. A splash pool lay just in front of these loungers. The poorest element of service occurred during our second day at the cabana, where our lunch order was 'lost'. This meant we were having lunch 2 hours later than planned. The peace offering was a choice of snacks and two drinks comped, our ordered drinks being enlarged comped, and an attempt to have the entire meal comped. I wasn't present when the check was settled so I can't comment on whether the meal was comped or not. In the lobby there is a bar and a market/cafe. However we never made use of either of these due to the limited choices in both. The cafe also closes at 8PM which may be an issue for some, but given the proximity to Aria et al. there is a massive choice of restaurants close to your room, often closer than if staying in any of the other hotels(not even close to an exaggeration!).

It was a terrible experience, which began late last night-- the worse part being that the first price quoted was for around $2200, then it jumped to $2313 by the time we reached the end of the reservation process, which then jumped AGAIN to over $2500 when we had to go back to page 1 of the system to edit the ages of our kids (the age change had nothing to do with the increase in price). This all happened in less than 20 minutes. We gave up and did not book. Today, I checked the site, and the price I was able to get was $2313. I just spoke with a manager at their reservation system that admitted that these mid-reservation stream price increases do happen (no explanation on how the price went down), and that the price is never guaranteed until you book it, even if you are in the middle of trying to book it. She \"appreciated\" my feedback on how the site is horribly designed and confusing, sorry that we were paying more for the trip, but that there was nothing she could do.

Our friends had turn down service each night with music playing, low lights, & slippers by the bed. We had none of that. We had the housekeeping light on one afternoon with the housekeeper right across the hall only to find she/he never cleaned the room. Aggravating, yes but not a big deal. Room for improvement: check your washer/dryer to make sure they work; consistency in training & expectations of housekeeping; courtesy laundry detergent, dish detergent & coffee makers with kitchen supplies. Positives: concierge was wonderful; check-in & out was a breeze; friendly staff; quiet place to go back to after a busy day on the strip.

The suites, bathrooms are gorgeous. The downfall of this property is the tacky stinginess with things that should be basic at a hotel of this caliber. On checking in, I searched everywhere for a coffee maker which is generally standard issue in a hotel of this quality. It wasn't to be found. The room menu made it obvious why. Room service coffee was as expensive as dinner at a nice restaurant. I ended up buying some cans of Starbuck's iced coffee and keeping them in the fridge. Reading of the previous reviewer's experience in the take out shop waiting in two lines to get a cup of coffee made it clear that I'm not the only one who found the lack of a coffee maker unacceptable. Also, why have a nice kitchen with shiny new appliances and not provide one piece of cookware, not one dish, not one piece of cutlery or one dish towel? Oh, I'm sure they would have been brought on request but probably at a cost that exceeded the room rate. I found the pool area nice enough. The water was a perfect temperature. The pool is not large with a lot of gimmicks like many of the more hyped pools in Vegas, but it does the job. The pavement around the pool was very slippery, and it was easy to fall there, so do be careful. Oh, and don't get me started with the \"resort fee\". This covered two bottles of water, a USA Today newspaper that they don't even deliver under your door - you have to pick it up at the front desk if there are any left, local phone calls that most won't need and very slow internet using your own computer. This property has a lot of potential. Once they get the details right like adding coffee makers in the rooms, eliminating the resort fee and equipping the kitchens, they'll no longer need to give their rooms away on Priceline for $70 a night like I paid for mine.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "sarasota69", "Title": "\u201cI stayed a month for world series of poker\u201d", "Author": "sarasota69", "ReviewID": "UR114627953", "Content": "I stayed here longer then other reviews so the good really out weighed the bad.

We made two trips to Vdara. My husband and I travel on business trips with his company and on leisure trips with our two grown daughters. We travel to Las Vegas 2-3 times a year and have been visiting for over 15 years now. We stay at several different hotels on the strip and we decided to try Vdara because it was new and centrally located and we always look for a suite with a kitchen in it when we travel. Our first stay at Vdara was at the end of May on a vacation with our daughters on a return trip from Hawaii. We were only staying for 2 nights so we decided to try out Vdara knowing that we would be coming back (my husband and I) in two weeks for a return visit for a convention my husband had at Aria. We arrived late (after midnight) after a long flight and were checked in very pleasantly and quickly by Tabatha. However, there was no bellman when we arrived so my daughter went searching for someone only to find a luggage cart. When she grabbed one, a bellman came out from nowhere suddenly willing to help. We waited a while for the luggage to come up. We also waited for the sofa bed linens to be brought up to our room and the bed made. Why weren't linens provided in the room-I don't know. We just wanted to go to bed but we had to wait for everything! When the maid came to do the sofa bed a Chapstick rolled out of it! Great!! She didn't seemed surprised or apologetic. We received no instructions on how to work the light/blind switches from the bellman so we got frustrated trying to figure that one out. Note- Planet Hollywood gives you instructions upon your arrival!! We went to bed and when I got up I found NO utensils, dishes, paper towels, mugs, NOTHING in the kitchen to make my coffee with- which is a Keurig pod! What is the reason for this? At Planet Hollywood and MGM Signature there is a fully stocked kitchen when you arrive. When I asked about it, I was told that you have to ask Housekeeping to bring it up to you. Well the bellman already got a tip, the maid for the sofa bed got a tip and I guess I have to tip the person bringing the utensils up too? We just let it go because we were only going to be there one more night. There were other issues we found in our room that I will briefly mention. The chair had an odd gross spot on it that we could guess what it might be!! There was clear scotch tape on the dining room ceiling like someone had hung something. There was a clear cell phone cover stuck to the glass end table- I thought it was my daughter's but it wasn't! There was no remote for the den television. We had to share with the bedroom tv remote. There was no full length mirror in the bathroom or bedroom-it was in the kitchen? The decor was very modern but there was very little counter space in the bathroom. The maid would move all of our toiletries on the sink onto a towel in the bathroom. I don't like people handling or moving my things! Some positives are: the views are nice and the master bed was comfortable (sofa bed was not according to my daughters) and the corner rooms are very quiet. When we came back to our room after a day out walking (around 5:00 pm), I asked the Concierge for a comment card and she said that they didn't have any but I could address my concerns with the front desk. I told her there was a line there so she gave me paper and an envelope to write them down and she would see that they would get to the manager. Well when we got to our room, the hallway was filled with laundry bags and there were two room service carts blocking our doorway. I wrote down my issues and gave the note to the lady Concierge. I asked that I get a response via e-mail because I was reluctantly returning in two weeks. When I got home I received no response. I did get an on-line survey however. I repeated everything in the survey that was sent to me and again I got no response. When our second trip was approaching I called Vdara to request a high floor room and to request that my kitchen be stocked for 6 nights when I arrived. I also inquired about getting a response to my TWO lengthy reports. I was told that I could address my concerns to Nicholas (the assistant manager) whose e-mail I was given. For the THIRD time I voiced my concerns through Nicholas to Vdara but was only given a short response to a few of my concerns and a promise that my upcoming stay would be better. Well, it wasn't. We did have better service with the bellman and we did get upgraded to a nicer but same kind of room as last time (probably Nicholas' doing). That was the end of the improvements. My kitchen was not stocked at all (remember I called ahead) and we didn't get robes or slippers in this same room this time. There were a few light bulbs out in our room. I called for the utensils, etc. to be brought up to my room and I got 2 plates, 2 mugs and 2 sets of utensils. No paper towels, no dish detergent, no dish towels (no tip either)! There was also a washer and dryer in the room (which is why we like it) but no laundry detergent either. Luckily I brought my own. After the first day ALL of my dishes and utensils were taken out of the room by the maid. Are you kidding me? I called again and complained, they sent up more dishes, etc. and the person bringing it up said I should probably leave a note for the Housekeeping staff not to take them. I did leave a note and spoke to the maid (best I could) for her to leave everything in the kitchen until I leave and to leave dishwasher detergent so I could do the dishes myself. I did not receive dish detergent or laundry detergent until the 5th day I was there! I also asked for a toaster but they said that they don't have them. Again, other hotels on the strip do! When we were checking out, the line was so long at check-out that my husband had to go back up to the room in disgust to check out over the television and he said that the receipt couldn't be sent to us because it wasn't working on the television! All I have to say about Vdara is that customer service is terrible. No one gets back to you on anything and your comments really don't matter much. Having to call and tip for everything is just crazy!! I don't understand this type of service. I am a very detailed person so I notice a lot. Vdara clearly doesn't focus on the details or customer satisfaction. It is evident in other reviews here about this hotel. I won't be staying here again and wouldn't have a second time if I knew it wasn't going to improve. Vdara had there second chance with me and that's enough. There are much better places to stay in Las Vegas than this. Planet Hollywood Towers had much better service and MGM Signature was also nice. I would try PH first because they are not owned by MGM ( like Vdara) as I had some trouble with check-in at MGM Signature in the past.

I thought I checked everything online about the hotel and any hidden costs. We arrived in Las Vegas and made it to the hotel to check in. I was informed by the check-in agent that there was a $100 a night fee included of which I was not prepared to pay. After much discussion with the agent and whomever she spoke to on the phone, this fee was eliminated. I overheard another agent telling her customer about the amenities at Vdara and when the customer asked for a room with a view of the Belagio fountain, she was able to accommodate his request. I booked the corner suite room for me and my mother and I also asked for a view of the Belagio fountain and was informed that was the last room. When I asked again, someone my agent spoke to on the phone told the agent to inform me that this was the last room taken and if I wanted a view of the fountain I would have to upgrade....yes, more money! I was ready to cry and move to another hotel. I was assigned to a corner suite room of which there was no view. I immediately phoned the front desk to check out and an agent named \"Jin\" answered the phone and told me that there were a handful of rooms with views of the fountain that would be available in a few hours. My mom and I decided to give Vdara a chance and have lunch and come back to the room. When we arrived and contacted the front desk our new room with the view of the Belagio fountain was available and we quickly moved. Jin saved the trip......Out of nowhere, there was a room available! Why did the agent and her manager lie to me about the room and availabilities? I was not impressed with the customer service. Vdara should not lie to their customers or favor one over another.

Our last trip was in '02 and the places we stayed before were wonderful but I wanted to try one of the new City Center properties. We're not big gamblers but thought the only way to enjoy our stay is if we stayed at a gaming hotel with 100+ restaurants and eateries...boy were we mistaken. We loved Vdara!! We selected it over the other City Center hotels because the price was so much more reasonable than the others. Also, they were running a promotion which offered a daily $25 credit valid at both Vdara and Aria...bonus! We arrived pretty late (~11pm). I asked if there were any rooms available with a view of the fountains and the gentleman at the front desk was very accommodating. (Full disclosure, in hindsight having the view didn't matter for us but since everyone on TA makes a big deal about it, I wanted to make sure we didn't miss out on anything.) Our room was on the 41st floor near the elevators and to me it was the best room ever! I'm not sure of the type of room we were assigned but it featured a \"wall\" that separates the bedroom from the living room, with attached storage space/drawers and a desk. This is also where the flat screen TVs are mounted (one on each side of the wall) which was a great amenity for us. I could watch reruns of \"Real Housewives...\" while relaxing in bed while hubby watched CNN while reading the paper from the living room sofa. We used the fitness center each day we were there...plenty of cardio equipment, dumbbells and nautilus machines to satisfy most people. Towels and bottled water are provided. I was surprised fresh fruit isn't also complimentary (like most hotels of this caliber) but there is a bar just steps away to purchase drinks and fruit. We managed to spend a little time by the pool as well. It's located on the 3rd floor and reminds me of pools at other hotels in a financial/business district. If you are going to Vegas to be seen hanging by the pool then you should consider a different property. It's not that type of party atmosphere, although the music played on the speakers was a nice touch. We spent every evening in the Vdara Bar and just outside is a cute little sitting area that we didn't discover until the 2nd night. Not many people there since everyone is out partying I suppose. Features outdoor sofas and swings. As far as convenience to the Strip, I see people can find a way to complain about ANY and EVERYTHING. Yes, it's a few extra steps but isn't everything in Vegas? Because Vdara is so close the Cosmopolitan, Aria and the Bellagio, it felt as if we were simply in another tower of those hotels. We dined out for every meal so we did not require anything for the kitchen, but we requested the robes and they were delivered in no time. Overall, our experience at Vdara was fantastic and it was perfect for us.

We had a corner suite with a full kitchen and the living area was separated from the bedroom. The room offered great views and was about a 10 minute walk to the strip, or about a minute to Aria which is a very lively hotel/casino. The room service at the hotel wasn't great. It took them a very long time to deliver towels on a Tuesday morning. They also gave us the impression that they'd be able to give us a later check-out than the standard 12:00pm, but were unable to do so when we called in the morning. The room was very nice and modern, but not very open, so it wasn't a great room to party in. I was also disappointed when I arrived back from a night of partying in the early AM to sleep on the pull-out couch, and the bed wasn't made up. It didn't make for a great sleep. This hotel would be great for a couple, or for someone who's not in Vegas to party. With the exception of the view, you don't really feel like you're in Vegas when you're at this hotel.

Even to get to the Bellagio which is right next door, it is quite a walk! 4. Pool area is just OK- small and nothing exciting and not much energy. 5.

First, we stayed in a Deluxe Suite on the 40th floor facing Henderson and the south end of the strip, every night the views were spectacular! I know this is no big deal, but staying on the 40th floor you\u2019d think that it may take a while to catch an elevator to the lobby\u2026.not so at all. We jokingly counted the seconds every time we went to take the elevator and we never made it to the count of 5. Anyway, our room was very clean, well appointed, spacious and extremely comfortable. There was plenty of space to spread out considering there was a desk, a small dining table, a decent sized galley kitchen and a large sofa. The bathroom was also large and very contemporary; there was a linen closet, shower stall, and separate bathtub. We really felt like we had rented an efficiency apartment rather than a hotel room and as we later found out the property was originally built as a condominium building. We are both light sleepers but during our stay we were not disturbed by any noise from our neighbors next to us or above us. The silence could have been because we were there on a Sunday through Thursday and maybe the hotel was not filled to capacity. However, there is not a casino, restaurant, or a large bar in the hotel so you\u2019re less likely to see the same level of rowdiness that you would at a large casino. Needless to say it was relaxing... Now to the service\u2026 We really didn\u2019t have a lot of need to interact with the staff but when we did it was a positive experience. We came and went a lot and the valet service was very quick and personalized \u2013 we never waited more than a couple minutes for our car. One day we called to have a robe and an extra luggage stand delivered and both requests were fulfilled quickly and the front desk followed up to make sure that we were satisfied. We had also pre-ordered tickets for shows at the Mirage, Aria, and Monte Carlo and to my surprise the concierge was able to print them so we didn\u2019t have to pick them up. We visited the pool only once and although it may not be as large as some of the more popular resorts it was an adequate space. The area was separated into sections for umbrellas, non-umbrellas/sunbathers, dinning and an entirely separate area for cabana rentals. I really liked the division because we wanted to relax and avoid the sun and the fact that all the umbrellas were kept together meant that the person next to us had to use an umbrella too so we didn\u2019t get any involuntary sun. The location of the hotel is towards the rear of City Center but it\u2019s easily accessible to all of the surrounding buildings in particular The Bellagio, Aria and the Crystals shopping center. The location was perfect for us but make sure that you\u2019re okay with staying a little off the strip. The only complaints that I have were with regards to the small store/eatery downstairs which was overpriced and overcrowded whenever we went there. Also, the blackout shades were not really blackout shades but I\u2019m really knit picking here because we really liked the hotel and we even considered staying an extra night. We didn't want to leave! In closing, I will definitely stay here again so I highly recommend it....", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cSome good some bad some ugly.\u201d", "Author": "Mscgordo", "ReviewID": "UR111667679", "Content": "Pros: No casino but several in a short walking distance.

Resort fees are common throughout the strip, dont like it find a hotel without them. Last, take a cab if you dont like to walk. Our use your car if you want to hit the strip. Walking from hotel to hotel is so 80's. Ok, on to my stay. First time at Vdara. Check in was fast. Less then 10 min , I was in my room relaxing. The corner suite was nice and was over 800 sq ft. Nice size with two flat screens, soaking tub, kitchen and a nice coffee maker. Pillow top mattress is to die for, I will say the bed was little low for my liking but i got use to it. Had no intentions of cooking so the lack of cooking supplies did not bother me but it was strange. Automatic shades were nice and views from the 39th floor were nice. Could have used a 24 hour Cafe as 8 pm is just not late enough. All of my encounters with staff members were pleasent. I even called to ask for a late check out , the answer was sure will 1 pm work? Great. Went to lunch and came back and asked again for a later check out, was told again , no problem 6 pm check out was granted for 30 bucks. Valet was slow at times, solved the problem on day two by calling down, to have the car ready. Vdara is not for people looking for the club scene. It is a hotel to relax and be in Vegas without having Vegas touch you! You can go out and deal with the smoke and loudness then come back to Vdara and have it be quite and calm. What a feeling.

This was the first time staying at this hotel and it is impressive as is the whole CityCentre area. We were greeted by well-dressed, pretty, smiling staff - however beware of the hidden charges at Vdara. On check-in we were advised that we needed to pay an extra 700 dollars (100 dollars per day) security charge which would be refunded 5-7 days after we checked out!! What did they think we were going to do - trash the place? We had carefully taken a set amout of cash with us and the remainder of our money was on a pre-loaded currency card therefore we were not carrying an 'extra' 700 dollars with us. I work in finance and we had deliberately left our credit cards at home to avoid the risk of card cloning and fraud abroad. We explained this to the check-in staff, who after discussing this with 2 other staff members decided that a deposit of 200 dollars cash would be OK instead????? How can this vary so much, seems to me that it's just a ploy to gain some interest in their pockets from holding your cash in their bank account for a week. Just imagine how much interest they will get if they do this with every guest's money? So we now had 200 dollars less for the week than we'd planned, but had we handed over a credit card we'd have been 700 dollars down. THIS IS A DISGRACE, SHAME ON YOU VDARA. The rooms were large, well equipped and clean with amazing views. Housekeeping was adequate but amusingly - we were left 8 new bars of soap, but no shampoo??? As our room had a fridge and Cafe Vdara closed at 8pm, we bought some tea, coffee & milk to use in our room. We asked for some cups and cutlery which we got however we didn't have anything to wash up with so once the cups, spoons etc had been used housekeeping removed the items from the room and they weren't replaced again. Not much good if you wanted a late night coffee in your room.. The hotel is in a good location, you can either get onto the Strip via the walkway through Belagio or walking down the side if the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We found it a bit pricey for drinks, fruit and snacks but this was on a par with other large hotels on the Strip. The pool area was busy but we still managed to find sunbeds without any problems although it felt a bit crowded at times due to the large area reserved for cabanas and daybeds. These were mostly unused (probably due to the high cost of renting one daily) so maybe they should consider removing some and creating more space? The music was quite loud round the pool, mostly R & B or dance tracks which we quite liked but this obviously wouldn't suit everyone, especially older guests. Overall the hotel would be great if some key areas were addressed - e.g. scrap the ridiculous cover charges, provide crockery and cutlery (& some washing-up equip) and the staff had more training, at times they seemed clueless!

The Silk Road Cafe, which was dreadful, has now closed and now stands empty and abandoned in the reception area. This simply shouldn't be allowed to happen in the middle of a prestigious hotel. The adjacent replacement cafe seems much more switched on and is actually open when needed, so that's an improvement. Rooms are still showing evidence of neglect, spotty and stained carpets, bathroom scales that don't work and in our case a wobbly bathroom tap, about to drop off. Room cleaning has improved, at least for our stay. The hotel charges a resort fee of $18 a day which includes water and papers, my brother in the room next door has had to ask for his water, we have both yet to see a paper. Will we stay here again?

A lot of the hotel points are covered in previous reviews so I'll just leave you with a few top tips: 1) Taking taxis to / from the Aria casino side (walking to the side facing the strip) can save money and time if you are travelling to a destination on the strip 2) if you are going somewhere off strip taxi from the vadra and consider taking the freeway if traffic on the strip is bad ie weekends 3) double check your bill when you check out. I was charged double resort fees or 15 dollars, 18 dollars and 20 dollars. The correct charge for me was 15 dollars plus tax. 4) free bottled water is available in the gym - open 6am to 8pm only 5) if you want kitchen wear I would suggest leaving a note for housekeeping and I gets delivered by the time you're back Few other points / concerns aside from the resort fee issue 1) I wasn't feeling well so was napping mid day with the do no disturb sign on. However housekeeping insisted on banging on the door and refusing to go away. I finally got up and was presented with two pillows which I did not request 2) the pool can sometimes pump out loud party music. Not the most relaxing of environments 3) not sure if it's prevalent in other hotels but some people seem to reserve poolside chairs with towels. I would prefer a system whereby the staff did not allow you to stick a towel down and disappear 4) it takes 7 mins (I timed it) to get to the belligio front lobby Conclusion Overall fairly good value. Hotel is slightly away from the action but that could be a good thing. Rooms fairly sized and new Would recommend to someone on their second or third visit to Vegas and thus doesn't need to be right on the action but within walking distance. Not recommended for those who want to gamble or have lots of restaurants. Only one coffee shop.

Yes, theres no casino, which we thought would be great, but somehow that makes the hotel seem to lack character. We booked it as we wanted a smoke free place and a casino free place but it turned out the casino downstairs created atmosphere and cheap/free drinks at other places.And its so overpriced! I ordered a cup of tea late one night at the bar and it was $6.50! Its hot water and a teabag! Speaking of eating and drinking, be aware the cafe downstairs closes at something like 8pm. They sell drinks and simple things you might need like asprin or tissues etc, and for it to close so early in a place like Las Vegas just doesn't make any sense. I didn't love the Vdara. I didn't dislike it, but I agree with other reviews you might find staying at the Venetian or Bellagio a little nicer, they seem to be very luxurious and if 5 star is what you're looking for it might be a better idea.

There were a lot of young people in the hotel but only heard people talking a couple times for short periods of time. Expected long lines at the cafe in the lobby, but did not once incur any time delays. The lobby bar is perfect for socializing and drinks. Similar to a casino floor lounge. For dinner, the Aria is 200 yards away and the Bellagio is a short walk through an overpass. If you can walk around a casino, you will have no problems with these short walks. From the taxi to the front desk is 20 yards, and the elevator to your room is another 20 yards. Try duplicating that in a big casino hotels. Service at the pool was great.

The rooms were modern and well appointed. The beds were comfortable and the staff was very accommodating. The pool area is small and unadorned but it suited our needs to spend some time in the sun. I hope to return soon. However, let me reveal some issues that may aid the future guest. There is no direct way to access the hotel from the street if you are on foot unless you walk in a lane of vehicle traffic. On foot, you can only access the hotel via a tunnel running from the Bellagio or through the Aria and walk around a traffic circle. The rooms have kitchenettes but as a practical matter don\u2019t expect to cook a meal there. The frig provided in each room is smaller then a college dorm frig and you must make a special request for cookware, dishes, glasses and mugs. If you use the aforementioned items, they are taken the next day and not replaced.

When we first arrived check in was very quick and we were upgraded to the 51st floor overlooking the Belagio fountains. The room and the view were fantastic everything was very clean and tidy and the small bar fridge in the room made life a little cheaper as we could store drinks and mixers. The biggest win about this room apart from the amazing view was the bed. With out a doubt this is the best bed I have EVER slept in, I have traveled the world many times for leisure and work (I am a Pilot) and this bed wins hands down. As you will know if you are doing your homework the Vdara is a non smoking, non gambling hotel just off the strip. Plenty of reviews have complaints about the fact you have to walk to the strip and it's too far. Firstly the direct walk down the road takes all of 5 minutes and if you choose to go through the Aria or Cosmopolitan it takes about 10 minutes but you are much further down the strip (side note it may take longer than 10 minutes because you are likely to throw some money in the slots and have a drink). So the location is very good as long as you don't mind a small walk. The gym has coped a little flack in some reviews but it was a very good gym with new Cybrex weight training gear and cardio equipment. Another critique which shows up alot was the security of the hotel. What I noticed was a rather above average standard of security with Guards on the elevators from about 11pm and also a good in room safe. I even witnessed (at 4:30am) a girl having a go at the check in staff for not letting her in with out her card so to say security is poor is off the mark. Only downsides to the Vdara which could be easily fixed by management are that resort fee ($18 + tax per day) which is nothing short of robbery for what comes standard with most rooms around the world. Also the fact you have to order cutlery and plates ect when you first get into your room.

He then offered to give me a handicapped accessible room on the 48th floor with a view of the fountain, at no additional charge. He said that he wanted us to have a nice room since we were staying 7 nights. We did have a couple of problems with the room, a clogged bathroom sink and a phone that didn't have a dial tone. With a quick call to the front desk, the issues were taken care of within a half hour. We didn't have any problems with any of the staff being rude at all, everyone has been super friendly. The room is beautiful, with three huge windows with automatic blinds. I just wish that the black out shades were a little wider so that all light would be blocked out and that the mini fridge was bigger to put a styrofoam container in, flat. I think that the larger rooms have a larger fridge. The room has a convection/microwave too, a very nice touch. It is very nice to have two tvs, one in the bedroom area and one in the living room. We did have room service the first night, as the cafe isn't open past 8pm. The food was very good. I had a steak and mushroom salad and my son had the mac and cheese. Do not waste your money at the brunch at Aria on the weekend, it is a waste of money at $25pp. The crab legs were so salty, pretty much unedible, the rest of the food was just mediocre at best. The best part were the desserts, by far. I don't mind paying for good food, but this wasn't good. If you have a chance, go to the Renaissance Hotel, not on the strip, to Envy Steakhouse, this place is phenominal! You can go to Restaurants.com and get a certificate for $50 off a $100 purchase, so worth it! As far as being far from the excitement, that is not true at all. Aria is right across the street, all you have to do is follow the walkway around in a half crescent and you're there. You can also walk through the walkway to get to Bellagio, or go straight to Las Vegas Blvd, via a walkway as well, this will take you to the Cosmopolitan. The tram at Bellagio will take you to Monte Carlo as well. We walked to MGM Grand, Bally's and Paris. As non smokers, it is very nice to not have to deal with the cigarette smell after a long day. There is piped in scent in Vdara, but it is not overpowering at all, since there is no smoke to cover up.

The room was not going to be ready until two hours after the 3 PM check in. We got our keys and promised to wait until 5 to go to the room. We read that dishes are not included and asked for them at check in. Be very specific on what you want. They will only bring you what you request. You want to wash the dishes you asked for? Make sure to ask for a sponge and soap. Got to the room and the requested items were there. The room was very nice. The view was incredible especially at night. A full size refrigerator, microwave and stove. All the comforts of home. The coffee make was broken but they replaced it. An annoying clicking noise in the air conditioner was reported but no one ever came. The first day and our last day our bedroom did not get serviced. We had to call housekeeping to send someone up. I even had the green housekeeping request light on all day! The garbage under the sink was missed the first three days so I moved it out nto the floor so they would surely see it. Housekeeping needs a little more attention. The first morning we went to the well equipped fitness center. Just after returning to our room I hear the front door open. In walk the Carr party much to both of our surprise. They were just assigned the room at check in. After sending them away I contacted the front desk. They said they will call me back in 5 minutes. After 30 minutes there was no call. Checked the key card on the door and it no longer worked. I went downstairs and found the person I spoke with. He apologized and did not have an idea how this happened. He gave us a $100 food and beverage credit for our troubles. Decent. We used the credit while at the pool and in the market. When I went to check out they informed me that there was no credit on my account. I explained the circumstances and they then put the credit on. Then I was told that the credit is only good for items that are served to you from behind the counter or host. Chips, sodas from refrigerator and candy in the market are not included.

My wife and I were travelling with our two young children, ages 3 and 1, and our au pair so we needed a two bedroom suite. The room itself was impressive--about 1600 square feet with a large open living/dining/kitchen area, two bedrooms with two en-suite bathrooms (each with two sinks, a soaking tub, and separate rain forest shower), a half bath off the entry foyer, and a laundry closet with stacking washer and dryer. The furnishing are modern, yet warm and tastefully done. Bath products by Aveda. Linens and towels are of good quality. The view are to die for, and all the windows feature screens and roman shades that operate by remote control. WiFi included in the resort fee. The whole hotel is non-smoking and non-gaming, which made it a good choice for our family. The lobby of the hotel is open and inviting, and check in was expeditious, but I suspect that was because we arrived on the later side. I saw long lines in the morning for check out and again in the afternoon for check in. The pool is stylish, but cramped, daybeds and cabanas can be rented on a daily basis. By report, there are \"hot spots\" from the reflection of the sun off the Aria hotel onto the Vdara pool that has caused problems in the past, but we did not encounter them. There is a good sized market with food and drink, but it's hours of operation were somewhat limited. By reserving a hospitality suite, we were offered complementary limo pick up and drop off to and from the airport. The reservations person took our flight info and all our requests (car seats, cribs, kitchenware and cooking utensils, etc) and entered them into the computer, which when I called the reservations line to reconfirm all our requests were entered accurately. Then the problems started. When we arrived at baggage claim, I didn't immediately see the person with the sign with our name waiting for us so I focused on getting our bags off the carousel. After the bags were on a trolley, I called the hotel to find out why no one was there. I was dispatched to the concierge, who never picked up. After at least 7 or 8 calls, it became apparent that the reservations line operates off site and we should have asked to be connected to the front desk of the hotel, which we finally were. At that point, the front desk person contacted the limo driver (who operates out of the adjoining Aria hotel) to come get us. All told, an hour delay from the time we got our bags to the time we arrived at the hotel. Also, the car seats weren't in the limo as promised so we had to wait for another limo to come. When we finally arrived, I was crazed because our children (who were still on east coast time) were crazed, and the front desk manager apologized for the confusion with the limo and offered to buy us dinner (which we later changed to breakfast). When we made the reservations, one the website I noticed that there are three floorplans; we wanted the hospitality suite with the bedrooms together on one wing of the room and the largest dining and living room area. This was not the room we were first brought to, despite my request, and we had to be moved to the room we wanted (which took another 30 minutes). By the time we were settled in, it was well after 11 PM local time (or 2 AM for us New Yorkers). It wasn't clear to me why we weren't given the original room we requested. Also, the isn't clear why each kitchen does not come fully equipped with all the necessary things one needs in a kitchen--plates, cutlery, corkscrew, etc. The next day I had a long chat with the concierge about the limo issue and she was very apologetic about what had happened and kindly offered us complementary use of the pool cabanas during our stay ($200/day if you rent one). Apparently they are very short staffed in the concierge department, which is why it was difficult getting someone to pick up the phone when we were at the airport. They also close the desk after 8 PM which seems ridiculously early for Sin City. During our stay, we saw ferociously long lines for the concierge and were glad we did not need them (the manager gave me her direct line). She was made sure the return to the airport went as scheduled, and it was flawless. Overall the hotel is lovely, but it is a large hotel that need more staff. The concierge desk should be staffed with more people (which they are working on) as should the front desk. If you want to print your boarding passes, they give you access to the business center, but they close it at 5 PM. I'm guessing the housekeeping staff are expected to clean a lot of rooms (which they do a nice job of), but most days the room was not made up until after 3 PM.

This is not something you would expect from a hotel that costs over $200 per night. We had to eat our \"room-service\" meal in the pitch black darkness. I am utterly disgusted by how things were handled at this hotel, I can understand things can happen, but for a power outage to last 5.5 hours to 6 hours is a disgrace and not safe. When we complained at the front desk the next morning, we were compensated with our room service being waived (approx $24 value) and the resort fee ($18 value) being waived. There was no apology, and quite frankly I think that we and other guests should have been compensated more highly. I have never been so disgusted with a hotel stay in my whole life. Another thing is the hotel is valet-only, meaning you have to wait for your vehicle. We waited 20-25 minutes in the cold & windy outdoors for a vehicle.

Pool was very nice, great contemporary view. Music not too loud and not a lot of party crowd which was great for me. And... that's it for the pros.... Cons: Room, definitely NOT 5 star quality, cheap and already damaged furniture. One remote control didn't work. Black out shades weren't exactly black out shades. Bed, was nothing special. Every other 5 star hotel on the strip had better bedding and mattress. Also, lighting was poorly designed, and not easily adaptable. Also NO outlets near the desk or the bed (??), no ipod dock as promised. Room service menu was EXTREMELY limited and the downstairs food shop was simply too overpriced (7 dollars for a coffee??) and had limited seating. Bar scene downstairs was simple and nothing special.

I called my credit card company to find out whats going on, and was informed the VDARA charged 1,700 dollars in charges to my room in a day. When speaking with the front desk, they told me it's simply security deposit on the room and that the charges will get reversed in 3-5 business days. REALLY? 1,700 who did they think was going to stay there? Charlie Sheen and his Goddesses? I received a 50 dollar credit to use upon my stay, (gee, thanks!) and upon check out the clerk finally fessed up saying this was a system error and they didn't understand why my card got charged repeatedly and then was lied about by Vdara's own accounting department. Upon check out, I inquired if I can have a late check out as my flight was later in the day, I was told I can stay until 1pm. At 12:10 security knocked on the doors to my room and asked why I didn't check out, after I already explained I'm staying til 1.

Or better yet, the classics like Encore, Palazzo, Bellagio and Mandalay Bay. This is not a 5 star resort. It's a huge disappointment.

This was our fifth trip to Vegas so we do not mind a non-gaming hotel, we have already had the full experience and now enjoy a good value and beautiful room. We stayed Thurs-Sun, on the Saturday night there was a power outage due to a fire behind the Monte Carlo and I will comment on that but first the good! Cab ride from the airport was $15 taking the street not the freeway. Our last stay was at Aria which is the same distance as Vdara but our cab driver took the freeway and the fare was $21. We arrived quite early at 8:45 so we were not expecting a room to be ready. Front desk was very pleasant we asked out what upgrades were available. We went for a Vdara corner suite which was $40 per night. Room was ready at noon. The room was beautiful! Very modern condo decor, lots of browns and grey. I felt it could use better lighting in the evening but lots of natural light in the day. Full size kitchen, nice to have a big fridge for wine! One washroom that had an entrance off the kitchen and the bedroom. Loved the closet and vanity in the bathroom. The tub is not the jet kind but it is very deep and relaxing. I prefer the toilet to have a separate door, my only complaint for the washroom. The bed was very comfortable, I feel that it was a bit lower than a standard hotel bed so that could be a plus or a negative for some. The curtains did allow some light in but I like that it makes sure I don't sleep the day away. We were in room 51006 which had a view of the north strip and Bellagio fountains, also a view to the east of Cosmo, and PH. I could hear a faint sound of bass coming from the club at the Cosmo. Overall it has been the best room I have had in Vegas, including the corner suite at Aria which was still very nice! The accessibility of Vdara to the rest of the strip seems to be a big complaint but I didn't find it to be to bothersome. It is a one minute walk into Aria, and a couple minutes over the walkway to the Bellagio. There are also stairs and an elevator you can take down to Harmon and you can walk along the side walk to the Cosmo. In the morning we would alway take a cab where we wanted to go and would walk back in the afternoon. Now the blackout! We realized the power was out as we were walking back to the hotel, at that time it was all out at CityCenter and the street lights as well. When we got to the hotel we could see no one was going anywhere so we went and hung out at Aria for a while. We came back and were told we could get robes, flashlights and water over at an Aria convention room so we thought why not! We put on our robes and had some fun with it. Once they got an elevator up we were thankfully up in our room relatively quickly. The room had no power still so our flashlights came I handy!

By the way, I was told to ask for a room with a divider, which we did. The bed was very plush, and the pillows were heavenly. As a matter of fact, we are going to buy the pillows. It had 2 TV's - one on each side of divider (living room and bedroom). We were very happy and would give it a 10. There were a few things that we were not as happy with. The furniture is not well made, and some of it fell off its hinges. Our maid forgot wash cloths one day, or ice bucket liner, or replaced used glasses. When we first checked in - it was early, they told us to come back in 3 hours. We checked our luggage with bell captain and left - when we returned, we had to wait in line all over again. The staff was no help at all - this is where they could improve. They need to get things worked out on this end. This location of hotel was not one that I would prefer. It seemed we were always either on the Tram, or walking through the hallways to get to the Bellagio, and then to further locations !

First off though, in reviewing the hotel: This is more of a hotel catered to business folks. There is no casino so the lobby is a lot smaller than you normally would see in Vegas. It also is a smoke-free hotel which was a blessing to me. If you did want to gamble though, there is a short walkway from the Vdara to the Bellagio and the free tram that takes you from the Vdara to the Crystals shopping area, Monte Carlo, and The Cosmopolitan. There is an $18 resort fee (as there are resort fees for every hotel in Vegas) and it pays for the 2 water bottles a day in your room, gym access, and wireless internet access. I thought the fee was priced fairly as I have paid resort fees at other hotels and it did not internet service or water. The room I had booked was the Deluxe Suite and it was very large and big enough for me and my friend. It included a king-sized bed and a pull-out queen sofa bed (you just have to call housekeeping for the sheets for the sofa bed). The sofa bed wasn't the best but the king size bed was pretty confortable. The bathroom had a nice sized tub and the shower is also very large. All of the lights seem to be energy saving bulbs (a good thing in my eyes) as they would be dim when you first turn them on. The room included a teeny fridge (we had brought home leftovers and the containers where too large to all fit in there), a stove, and a microwave. There was no coffeemaker in the Deluxe Suite and you can only order coffee through room service for that room. We checked out the pool also and the \u201cdeath-ray\u201d thing is no joke. It is a fairly small pool area \u2013 make sure you wear lots of sunscreen. I did go to the spa at Vdara and it was smaller than I expected it to be. There was only one whirlpool/jacuzzi, two \"heated\" stone chairs, a sauna room, and a steam room. The showers were large and they did stock Aveda products at the counters. The robes were extremely comfy and the staff was very nice. Tea, water, some fruit, and some trail mixes were provided also. I did use the concierge of the hotel and they were extremely helpful in getting my name on the guest list for the Marquee Nightclub over at The Cosmopolitan. I was able to get in for free along with a few of my friends because we were all girls. Use them if you are planning to go to a club! The Market Cafe at the Vdara also has a large selection of food and drinks also. There are many to-go lunches and breakfast is served all day. The service can be a little slow as they get hectic and there aren't enough tables and chairs. The food we had was good but the coffee wasn't great. I hope it will be better next time. And on that note, I do plan on coming back to this hotel so there is a next time. I was stuck in the power outage also but I felt that the hotel apologized and compensated me fairly. It was terribly scary to be in the hotel with no emergency lighting on and not being able to see where anything is but I felt they will now be able to handle a situation like that in the future.

Happy to report happily surprised. Vdara is an easy 2 minute walk to Bellagio and my room was actually closer to the conference center than many of the people staying at Bellagio. Partied late at Bellegio once or twice and stumbling back to Vdara was no issues at all. Also discovered that Vdara is an equal two minutes to Aria. And from there Cosmopolitan was a stones-throw and from there whole strip is in your face. Actually liked returning to smoke free less hectic place to bed down. Vdara is so close to happening hotels/casinos/restaurants that you don't miss them in the lobby. Room itself was good too. Comfortable bed, clean, new amentities, large. I had no problem with service. I also had the view of the Bellagio fountains which is cool (and many in the Bellagio don't have it). You can tell this is a failed condo deal as the rooms have full kitchens but no plates, silverware, etc (whic is available on request). I didn't request. Negitives: Being picky, the food service is the lobby is very slow. After a typical Vegas late night, getting a cup of coffeee is a bit of a challlenge. The pool is not up to Vegas pool standards and the heat reflection off the building on the pool is very real. If you're going for the pool scene, I might look elswhere. All in all, the place was excellent and the price is right relative to all of the surrounding properties.

I'm used to staying in 5-star locations (Wynn, Aria, Palazzo, etc.) and Vdara was no exception. The only downside I could recall was that the included shampoo and soap didn't have the best scent.

If you typically travel well, you'll hate this place. I was there for a friend whose mother just passed so we had a week to get it all sorted out as efficiently as possible without any hiccups. We needed this trip to be seamless. Being an admitted anal retentive freakshow I figured I'd write the property an email stating the cleanliness issue I have with every room (I know this is nitpicking, I'm aware, but one stays at luxury properties an expected level of service), my travel mate's mother's death and could they please make a quick effort to check our room before we get there. That mail went unanswered and we were given a room with room service trays and shoes boxes still there, not to mention the laundry left in the hall in Vdara-branded bags. The next room had a wet puddle in the bathroom and a band-aid we later found next to the bed and closet. How does this happen? Skip my ODC anal retentive issues, rooms like that should never be released back into inventory. When we called to complain all we heard we was \"I'm sorry.\" At premium properties all employees are empowered to make their guests' stay as enjoyable as possible. At Vdara, it seems the Vegas money extraction strategy is in play. Get the cash but stiff em when they need something. The rest of the trip was a comedy of miscues. Housekeeping never cleaned our suite the next day, insisting the DND light was on despite the actual cleaning lady looking at it with with me while they told me their system said it was on. And then the next day they called to apologize for not cleaning the room that day despite the fact the room was cleaned. Other reviews have mentioned the issue with bowls and plates and silverware and they had no signage in our room telling us to call. They did, however, leave two dirty coffee mugs. We must have had the bad mojo cleaning gods angry with us on this trip because it was just FAIL AFTER CUSTOMER SERVICE FAIL. Now, with all this complaining comes many great things and i wanted to leave the end of the review with a good taste because despite our massive screw ups from them, the hotel is not a dump. Let me tell you why: Spa was amazing. We did two days of spas and both of us had zero complaints. I think Lonnie was the massage therapist and she's amazing. Perfect pressure. Despite my travel mate's cheesy, bad tourist faux pas of asking for more freebee lotions and conditioners, housekeeping was gracious (I know I'd be cursing us under my breath) Valets were efficient and not valet-y jerks Super central location Killer showers and tubs The en-suite laundry is always a nice bonus Pretty People-friendly (if you're a braided hair, NASCAR type, this is the wrong place for you) In conclusion, Vdara was just an OK stay with a slew of freaky errors. They were extremely generous in their comps and we're very appreciative of them. However, if comps never fix a problem, that's a problem. Go into Vdara with a slightly tilted eye towards guest service and you'll have a great time. \"We have 1500 rooms\" as an excuse is unacceptable when there are room service items, bandaids and roaches (see snaps) left in rooms.

The room was beautiful and beyond comfortable. The scented lobby smells great. The location is fantastic if you aren't traveling with a car. The fitness center has plenty of good quality equipment. All in all it's a great place and I would happily stay again. There were however a few areas that could use improvement. First, each room has a kitchenette which is an option that I love. Also, I had read that robes were an amenity that was included, another thing I love about nice hotels ( I can't find any information about this now, so perhaps that is changing). But when we arrived we found that while we had a kitchenette we had no plates, bowls, pans, silverware, etc. There was no information to be found about this in the room. No robes either. We learned that those things are available by request which we found out when we called housekeeping and they were delivered to our room in a timely manner. (By the way, the robe was perhaps the softest robe I've ever worn.) The thing that could be done better? That phone call, the one where you're trying to find out if you're supposed to have pans, robes, whatever...it can be such an awkward call to make. It always makes me feel so tacky and like I'm a huge bother to the staff. I don't think I'm alone on this. This is my suggestion for Vdara: It would be nice if there was either printed information in the room letting you know to make the call or if you were asked at check in about your need/desire for these things. Guests would be able to avoid the uncomfortable phone call and feel that their needs had been anticipated ahead of time. Second, is a matter that absolutely needs to be addressed. It was not uncommon for piles of laundry to remain in the hall for hours at a time, with no sign of housekeeping in the vicinity. One day in particular, we could see three piles from our door, which isn't that long a section of hallway as the hallways curve. The piles remained the majority of the day, well into evening. On another day, a similar thing happened with a room service cart. The room across the hall from us had set their room service cart in the hall (a lot of uneaten food on it) sometime before I went to the fitness center at 8:00am. It remained in the hall until sometime after we went out at 9:00pm. For a minimum of 13 hours, partially eaten pizza sat outside our door. That is really gross. Even at your absolute laziest, you don't do that at home. Perhaps there were communication problems during our stay and maybe it's not the norm, but at least for us the hallway situation was very disappointing, unprofessional and just plain nasty. That shouldn't be allowed to happen in this quality of an establishment.

Very calm, quiet affair. I asked for a high room if possible and we certainly got our wish!!- 55th floor ! It was a treat opening the electronic blinds to reveal a cracking vista. It was jawdropping, especially as on other visits to las vegas we havent been so lucky with the views. We were looking out over towards luxor, mandalay bay etc and could see incoming flights in the distance. Accomodation was v nice. lovely kitchen and bathroom with Tv next to sink. v good cleanliness, lots of towels and flannels. I travelled with my sister and she slept in the double bed and I had the double sofa bed which although was ok, I would have preferred option of an actual bed, as not as comfortable, a thin mattress. Two negatives. On the first night, as we went straight to bed, having arrived late at night,there was a loud whooshing noise which ruined our first nights sleep. We could not block it out even with a pillow over our heads. It sounded like an aircraft engine. it turned out to be coming from a vent in kitchen, as open plan we could not shut door on kitchen. In the morning I went to reception quite stressed and tired expecting a battle to sort it. Luckily, they said fine we ll get a technician to come up. Not long after a guy appeared and explained that because its an eco friendly hotel and we were so near the top floor it was literally fast flowing air shooting up to the roof. So he promptly applied a criss cross of gaffer tape and the sound was blocked off, which was blissful silence when done. so problem sorted only one night affected. Second gripe, being Brits I wanted a kettle. I asked at reception for mugs, plates, cutlery etc also as none supplied, as I heard you had to ask. Everything was available but no kettles left. She put me on a list to get a kettle but never got one in the week we were there. Bit annoyed as I quite liked that idea when booking and dont drink coffee. I ended up with a pan, boiling water in the morning for a brew. Not the end of the world but a bit of a pain as the kitchen was a nice addition with Bosch microwave/Gaggenau hob and felt a bit naff putting pan on in such a slick suite . Pool nice but a bit posey and music too loud to hear my own Ipod or concentrate on book so gave up with it. Im not a huge pool fan though and hey its Vegas. It was a contrast to such a chilled vibe everywhere else. Even though 5 * hotel it wasn't stuck up at all. I think a few families came for the weekend as nonsmoking/gaming resort with notably very polite, quiet children. Also I smiled to myself when in lift with some American teens who had just collected huge takeaway pizzas and no one batted an eyelid. All in all the Vdara was great. I read other reviews about visitors complaining about walking etc. Yes Vdara is a bit out of the way but just cut through the Bellagio or use the fabulous free monorail to City Center. It was quite nice to feel as if in a retreat. To be honest Vegas isn't the place to go if you dont like walking as its a necessity, as even each hotel is vast. I like walking and its good to burn off some calories from the really nice but not so healthy food we indulged in.

One problem I had, which I think was due to them trying to satisfy the request we put in, was the cleanliness of the one of the rooms we had. They had left a cup of juice on the dining table, a pair of underwear on the desk, and did not change the soap in the bathroom. But they cleaned this all up, and the two people in the room were satisfied with that. We did a lot of walking here, and my entire group was very happy with the distances to get to these places.

Comments: This is a nice hotel especially if you like a more modern feel but you have to go elsewhere for a restaurant or casino. The Bellagio is connected by a covered walkway and the Aria is next door. The pool is nothing to write home about and the music is so loud at the pool I couldn't even hear my iPod with headphones on. I asked them to turn down the music and after the fourth time they finally did. They pump some kind of scent into the lobby, possibly to cover up the occasional slight smell of sewage from outside which you can also smell at the pool and probably other hotels nearby.

Ask for double of what you think you will need for plates, silverware, etc., then you won't be calling down constantly for replacements. We had a Keuring coffeemaker so when we picked up breakfast food for the room, we just picked these up and we had coffee each morning.

I had to offer to let the pool attendant look in my bag to prove I did not have any glass or beer. We just had apples, Gatorade and chips and I was given a very disgusted look. I guess that is why you can't find a garbage can anywhere in the pool area. Also as far as the pool, this hotel has real problem that was not realized until it was built. The sun reflects off the building onto the pool area. It is like being under a magnifying glass. They do not allow the umbrellas on the far side of the pool to be closed until 2pm for this reason. There is a fire department at the base of this hotel. My husband is a firefighter and stopped in.

It was the answer to \"why do I have a kitchen in my room?\" The city center is a bit off the main strip, but easily accessible.

I believe the place was still working out the kinks in their service, but overall, all the staff tried to provide us with excellent service - a big shout out to Britney who let us use office services after hours so I could complete my payroll while on the road.

I had a minor problem with the drain in the bathroom sink, the problem was fixed within hours. The room had a good view, and at night, it was totally silent.

I read reviews, asked questions and made sure I knew what I was getting. Check-in was less than 5 min. I had booked a fountain view room and the girl said \"oh, you wanted a pool view, ummmm noooo I requested fountain view.\" She quickly found us another room. Room was beautiful, bathroom perfect with that awesome tub. 2 flat screens, bed was soooo comfy. The only complaint and one of the little reasons I gave a 4 not a 5 was the AC. We like it extremely cool and could not get it to drop below 69. We set it at 50 and still wouldnt get cooler. We asked the desk to send someone, and I dont know of they actually showed up or not, but it still didnt get any cooler. The hallways were also VERY warm. They must be cutting corners on AC. It was uncomfortable and it was only 80 degrees outside, I'd hate to be there in warmer weather. I also spoke to the desk about that, but who knows if they did anything about it. The pool was small but fine for us. We both had massages at the spa and they were average. The spa itself it beautiful. Yes, the hotel is a tiny bit away from the craziness, but that is why I chose it. Honestly anyone complaining about how far away it is must be really lazy or in really bad shape. I have a disc problem in my back and it was fine. A 5 min. walk to Bellagio or Aria. 10 min. over the bridge to Paris and Ballys. We loved coming back at night and having complete peace and quite. No smoking was also a plus. Everytime we walked through the Bellagio I was thankful we chose Vdara, it was always craziness in the lobby there. I agree they need to re-open the restaraunt, I do not understand why they closed it. Coffee shop was ok, but the lines were always long. Was it pricey...yes...but so were all the other shops! All the staff we encountered were very nice and polite. I would absolutely recommend the Vdara and would definitely stay there again. We also saw Cirque's Love while there and would definitely recommend that everyone go see it. Carlos Santana was also fabulous. I will add some restraunt reviews here if anyone is interested. Rare 120 at the Hard Rock was nice, the Sea Bass was wonderful as was the filet. Service was good and our waiter was very attentive. Onda at the Mirage was a huge disappointment. The food was excellent, but the service was so bad that it ruined the meal for us. We spend a lot of time in fine dinning places and I have had better service at the local diner. It was a shame because the place was beautiful and the food was great. We never were asked how out meals were, had to wave down waiter for drinks every time, and my empty plate sat there 20 min. before I had to ask him to take it away. We also let him know when we arrived that we had a 9:30 show (we arrived at 7:30) and we had to rush out because service was so slow. I do not recommend this place due to the service. The Foundation Room at Mandalay Bay was our favorite. We loved the atmosphere and the service was top-notch. Everything we ordered was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and of high quality. We had 3-4 people waiting on us at all times. The 2 main waiters were extremely personable and knew their jobs. I would recommend this place to most people.

It is a new hotel, so everything is still very clean and in excellent condition. Housekeeping does a wonderful job and leaves plenty of bottled water in the room and the small refrigerator. The basic suites (no need for a larger room, it holds two very comfortably, and possibly one or two more close friends in the sofa bed) come with a small kitchenette (table, chairs, microwave, small fridge, a small smooth glass cooktop, sink and even a garbage disposal). This feature is great for saving money on breakfast, lunch and snacks. There was no coffeemaker, but I suppose you could request one (I don't drink coffee). There are two layouts for the basic suite; one is a large, open room; the other has a media center that seperates the bedroom from the living room area. There is a large, wide screen TV on either side of the media center. This is nice because one person can watch TV in the living area without disturbing another in the bedroom. You can request which layout that you prefer. The bathroom offers modern styling with a seperate soaking tub and glass walled shower. The bathroom has a nice, heavy, sliding glass privacy door instead of a regular door. A very nice touch that saves room! The bathroom was always very clean with plenty of towels and a nice towel cart by the tub. There was no hair dryer, but again, you could probably request one for no charge. I don't use a hairdryer. The bedroom and bed is very comfortable, and the bed has two small adjustable reading lights above the headboard for reading or atmosphere lighting.. The living area has a nice sleeper sofa and chair, so you could potentially sleep four people in the basic suite. The light switches in the kitchenette and bathroom have a dimmer to simulate candlelight for those romantic nights! The windows go wall to wall and offer nice views if you know what to ask for. Ask for as high a room as possible that faces north. If you are lucky, you will get a room that has a partial strip and mountain view, and a view of the Bellagio fountains. I stayed in room 38 on the 41st floor (41038, very nice!) The windows have nice shades and blackout shades, both of which are controlled by a wall switch off of the kitchenette area (too bad that they don't have switches for the shades near the bed). Floors are either nicely tiled or carpeted. The style here is clean, slick and modern, but it is always comfortable and relaxing. It may be considered spartan by someone who prefers a room at the Paris casino, but I like the style of the Vdara. It suits my style and the style of the City Center where Vdara is located. There are a few things that come with the room that you must request. Robes, slippers and utensils for the kitchenette are available for free, and they had them up to my room within thirty minutes. I also had to have security up to the room to unlock my room safe, and they were there within an hour. All associates were pleasant, helpful and knowledgeable. The spa and exercise facilities are very nice and very clean. The pool area is small, but very nice. This is a quiet, non-gaming, no smoking resort that is populated by business travelers during the week, and vacationing groups, couples and families on the weekends. There is a nice bar and two restaurants immediately adjacent to the lobby. I only ate at the Market Cafe' (pricey, but what isn't on the Vegas strip!). The Silk Road restaurant was closed for the week while I was there because they were hosting business conferences and private parties. This was not a problem because there are many top-notch restaurants and world class shopping areas throughout the City Center complex and at the nearby (very short walk), new Cosmopolitan resort (you gotta see that place!). Overall, an excellent experience, especially if you can get a room discount through a travel service such as Priceline. This is not a cheap hotel, and you will pay for the excellent service, but in my opinion it is worth it. That is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 for value; it is not inexpensive. I also gave it a 4 of 5 for the location, only because some people feel that the City Center is not as convenient a location as some resorts; but this was not a problem for me as the Strip is not that long of a walk from the entrance to Vdara and Aria. You could actually stay within City Center (and nearby Cosmopolitan) for your whole stay and have everything you want. But who would want to do that? Don't forget, Vdara is non-gaming and non-smoking. So, if you want lots of action, you'll have to go to nearby Aria or Cosmopolitan or stay at a gaming resort. Personally, I like returning to the pampered feel of Vdara after leaving behind the smoke, noise, and drunks at the other gaming resorts.

The housekeeping staff also does an outstanding job!! The pool and bar have great drink menus. The salon staff are fun, professional, and very talented! We did experience some negatives too, however. Perhaps they are still working out some kinks. The concierge service was extremely slow. Twice I used the concierge (for something fairly simple) and twice I waited in line for 30+ minutes; I walked past on several occassions and also saw long lines. The service at the pool was a disaster. On day 1 (a Wednesday), it took 15 minutes until anyone brought us a menu and from that point, another 30 until we finally tracked down the server to order. Then, she brought only 1 of our drinks and said she was going back for the other... it never came. So, when I tracked her down again and ordered 2 more drinks, she said she'd comp one b/c we never got the original order. Then I got my \"total\" with no bill, which included no comp'd beverage. When I said I was charging it to the room, she said \"uh... oh\" and didn't come back for 20+ min.

Also drawn to the fact that it was a non gaming location, as my husband and I were travelling with our 15 year old daughter. I booked directly with the Vdara site and called them up about a premium view room, I found while getting rates via trip advisor, expedia had a premium view room, however on the Vdara site it did not offer the premium view option. So upon inquiring on this matter with Vdara directly they offered me the premium view and waived the additional occupant fee for my daughter. Check in was a breeze and upon walking into our suite we were blown away with the room and the view....we were on the 50th floor and overlooked the Belagio fountains, we were even more blown away when we walked back into the suite at night. Truly Spectalcular. My only gripe however not major just felt it would have been common sense. As I had booked for 3 people being that the 3rd person ie my daughter would sleep on the pull out sofa, however upon pulling this out there was no linen on it. As it was late and we were tired we all just hopped into the large comfy bed. The next morning as we were heading out I approached reception and advised them of the oversight. And would they mind having the bed made up. I was a bit taken back when the young receptionist stated I should have asked them upon check in to have it made up. My reply was I thought it would be common practice that if my booking details indicate that 3 people are checking into that room that it would be general practice that the room needs be made upto cater for the 3 booked occupants. All in all it was a great stay and I would highly recommend it.

(And as I've read some new reviews on the property I would like to make a note that it is very important to report any major complaints to the front desk - especially if they are issues pertaining to privacy or hygiene.) Now onto our review. When we arrived by cab from the airport we were happy to see that there wasn't a mile long lineup for check-in (as was the case when we stayed at Planet Hollywood a year ago). The one complaint I have is the way the front desk personnel made it sound like he was doing us a favour by adding an $18 daily fee for our \"free\" water/paper/pool access/wi-fi. Just add it into the room price or say that these amenities are an $18/day fee. But we didn't have a problem with this fee because we felt we had good value on our room. We had a corner suite which had a great view and we loved watching the Bellagio fountain show from our 34th floor room. It was also nice to have so much space to move around without feeling like we paid an arm and a leg for it. We also loved how it felt like an escape from the regular Vegas pace. The Vdara is connected to the Bellagio by a covered walkway and when we came down the hallway, returning to our room, it was nice to have a retreat from the smoke and noise of the other hotels. We didn't have any privacy issues except for a housekeeping person coming into our room while we were there. It was quickly remedied (we must have turned off our \"do not disturb\" button - which by the way was a cool, modern feature to press a button rather than have to hang a sign on the door) and then they just left us a phone message to contact them if we wanted any service later. It is a major pet peeve of mine when housekeeping enters a room that you'd asked them to not disturb so I really appreciate when it is honoured. We did allow them in the room the following day and we didn't have any issues (although I did lock my suitcase for piece of mind). There were security personnel asking to see your room key before you entered the elevators. The pool area was nice, the cafe downstairs was good and included Jean Phillippe pastries (yum!) which can also be bought across the walkway at the Aria and in the Bellagio by the conservatory. We didn't find this hotel an inconvenience in location at all. So many of the hotels are enormous and you have to walk a great distance through the maze of casinos to get anywhere so we didn't have a problem - especially since we were connected to the Bellagio.

Credit that to a slow Las Vegas totally affected by the Great Recession. Upon arriving, i didn't have to wait in line to check-in even though there were only 2 receptionists working. The reason: the hotel was very slow and it was a weekday in Vegas. I later found out i was checked-in by the hotel assistant manager, who was very skilled at her job of upgrading me...for an extra $25 to an \"Executive Suite\". I later also found out because i stayed and extra night, that the Corner Suite is basically the same as an Executive Corner Suite. Same floorplan, basically the same new amenities such as desk, refrigerator, stacked washer/dryer combo, range, microwave, and even small dishwasher. You will have to call housekeeping to get the utensils and kitchenware, and it's always proper etiquette to tip $2-3 dollars to the delivery person. Back to the hotel review...First time at Vdara Hotel and Spa, and was met with a calm feel without the smoke and gaming clamor. In fact, this hotel is sort of an quiet oasis from the typical Vegas \"hustle and bustle\". Swanky furniture, chic lounges, and i almost got a feel of a more refined Palms Place, where 20's to 40's yuppies would find themselves spending their time. I was there for a photography gig and to shoot the architecture of Vegas on my spare time. The room was very spacious and well laid out. I had a dining table, kitchen, living room area, desk, very comfortable bed, 2 LCD HDTVs, separate shower and soaking tub, and 2 sink vanity with huge mirror. And the most impressive part of it all was a wrap around view of the Bellagio and front City Center strip view of about 180 degrees. The Executive Corner Suite had motorized shade and drapes for privacy and shading from the sun. This is a 4-5 star hotel in terms of quality of ambience and accommodations for sure. The staff was very professional, however, at times because it was so slow, the housekeeping staff could be overbearing with wanting to invade too much into your privacy, and that was a big turnoff. Guests book rooms and suites for comfort and privacy. Privacy is of utmost priority on top of security, and both go hand in hand, IMO. In short, the hotel staff should not be too eager to provide services unless called upon. When i leave my room, i expect no one to enter it unless i request it. This is to ensure my privacy and confidence that nothing could or would be missing due to someone other than me being in my room or Suite. Though nothing went missing, i did find it intrusive that housekeeping wanted to use my phone on the second day i booked, to call her supervisor. She should have a radio or use one of the rooms or suites on the floor to call her supervisor, not impose that she had to use mine. I work with very important intellectual property that no one can see until it's out. It's usually on my laptop while i'm working. Any eyes other than mine that see it could lose me my job. So next time, and this is directed at Vdara and other high-end hotels, please consider first the privacy of your patrons and guests. Having read several reviews regarding possible theft there, well to be fair, i didn't experience any of it, but that's because i warned the front desk that i had read it on TripAdvisor.com , and told them to please not enter my room during my entire stay unless i request something. I suggest everyone do the same. In times of recession and economic hardship, and it was slow here at Vdara more than at other places, it's best to keep from having any misunderstandings arise, and the only way to do that is to be direct and proactive in the approach to resist the possibility of it occurring. I would recommend this hotel, however, with the financial difficulties surrounding Vegas in general, spend some money tipping for services as many do make their living in Vegas from tips, especially in a down market in Vegas, where it seems people there are ready to provide services to make up for the lack of plentiful work. I also ordered in-suite dining services, and even though the 2 dishes i ordered at 2:00am clearly stated $14 each dish, i was charged $16 each dish. Only a $4 price mistake, but i really think the Vdara should just charge the same price for all hours instead of discounting it on the menu to encourage demand at night, only to charge the higher day rate. I wasn't going to address a petty difference, as that's the Hotel's staff to make sure they get it right, but that told me there was an issue of deficiency in demand which results in a revenue deficiency. Things will get better, and i feel the Vdara has good potential when the market turns around. Until then, i will enjoy the new developments and support them, so they can run a more robust operation. Vegas pioneer Steve Wynn has the right formula. Many in Vegas should imitate it. He believes the customer should get the best treatment, and the most privacy and quiet enjoyment of good, quality customer-attentive service from front desk to housekeeping and in-suite dining. Vdara will get there in due time. Until then, they should focus on building a great reputation, and work out all the kinks in these slow times, so they will become more refined when boom cycles occur again.

After reading previous TA reviews I asked if dishes, silverware and robes could be delivered to our room and the clerk agreed. Our room was lovely - very modern and clean with lots of space and a great view. We had a kitchenette with a small fridge - no space for leftovers but fine for drinks. There was a king size bed (ultra comfortable) and a sitting area separated by a screen with a flat screen TV either side. The bathroom was also nice with a separate shower and bath - the shower pressure wasn't good however. The room had blackout shades which we did appreciate - however they didn't quite cover the large windows and the sunshine did come though the gaps in the morning - not a big deal just worth mentioning. Once we were in the room the bell brought our luggage up right away. We waited 30 minutes for our dishes/robes before calling housekeeping again; they then took a further 10 or so minutes to arrive, bringing dishes, silverware and robes. When we returned to the hotel after dinner we realised we had no mugs or kettle. When we called housekeeping they explained that they did not provide kettles but could provide a saucepan/pot for boiling water. This, or the mugs, never arrived however and we gave up rather than call them again. A few days into our trip we had a knock at the door from housekeeping wanting to set up a pull-out bed for us - they appeared confused when we said we hadn't requested this and seemed to have the wrong room. The cleaning service was pretty good although we did leave a tip every day - we got new magazines and water every day. We also got fresh towels every day but I happened to be in the room when housekeeping arrived once and the bedsheets were Febreeze-d rather than changed. The hotel itself was OK. We did not use the pool or concierge so cannot comment on them. As non-smokers it was lovely to come back to a non-smoking hotel as many of the casinos were very smoky. The Market Cafe was fine although a little expensive. As mentioned the hotel smelled good. When we returned after 10pm or so at night our room key was politely checked before we could use the lift - a good security measure. Accessing the strip was easy enough via a walkway through to the Bellagio or a (free) tram to City Center and Monte Carlo; it was also simple to walk to the Cosmopolitan from Vdara's front entrance (approximately 5 minutes). That said, there did seem to be something missing in Vdara and although we got a good deal I doubt we would stay there again.

We would leave around 3 and the room was always made up when we would be back to dress up for dinner 4 or 5 hours later. OK, just a word of advice, the death ray at the pool is unfortunately true. It was in the mid 70's while we enjoyed the pool and depending upon where the reflection hits the surrounding buildings it can get a bit uncomfortable. Our room key was not put in the shade and it melted! So, you will enjoy the pool under the umbrellas (there are lots of them) on a hot day.

First impression of City Centre was nice and the initial arrival to Vdara was what I expected from a supposedly 5* ranked hotel with prompt valet service and a clean exterior. Check in was fairly straightforward until the desk clerk offered a room upgrade (at a fee) which made me think they must get a commission for any upgrades they sell. At an additional $30 per night I decided to go for it which seemed like a good idea until we got up to the rooms to find that one of them wasn't even ready and it looked like it had been forgotten about. Considering check out is 12 noon and check in is after 3pm i thought it was pretty poor service to not have the room ready. This was just the beginning. After making the situation known to the desk, the staff offered a further upgrade gratis which i expected at the very least as the first impression was already shaded. This was the only positive experience we had as the rest of our time coming and going it seemed the only people who valued our business were the valet and the rest of the staff seemed as though we were all just a necessary evil. In summary I will not return to Vdara due to the poor service, complete lack of customer focus shown in general from the front desk staff down to the housekeeping which was a joke, and the fact that valet is the only parking option.

A couple of points to make - there is a kitchen in the room but no cutlery, crockery, kettle, pots, mugs etc. We called up for a kettle and teaspoons and they delivered a pot and a ladle... No idea why. We called again and were told that they had no kettles or coffee pots, so if you want a cuppa tea - boil the pot. Also service was a bit slow in getting things delivered. Calling up each time you need a mug, plates etc is quite annoying so be sure to request everything you need in one go. The only other issue we had was the bed... The linen is fabulous to sleep under but our king sized bed was sunken on one side, so you felt like you were sleeping on a slight slope... Neither one of us slept that well as a result.

After reading many of the reviews about the Vdara, we thought we\u2019d give Vdara a try. We arrived at the hotel late at night. Valet was right there to greet us. No problem finding the front desk. I read that a few folks had a hard time finding it. Well it\u2019s right in front of the big front doors kind of hard to miss. Check in was fast and easy. We were told about the $18.00 resort fee right up front and were asked to initial a form stating there was a resort fee. Yes I do believe that the hotel looks at these reviews. I remembered that in one of the reviews that someone said that they got the old bait and switch on the room. I also recall looking at Vdara\u2019s website and seeing that there are two versions of the Deluxe Suite rooms. I simply asked the clerk checking us in if we could have one a Deluxe Suite with the \u201cdivider\u201d in it. She accommodated us with a room just like in the video. Also she gave us a room on the 37th floor with a great view of the Bellagio\u2019s lake. Great view of the strip too! While its spring breaks I expected a ton of college kids and noise. Being that this not a casino hotel. I think that most kids opted for hotels right on the strip like the Hard Rock. Our visit was very quiet by Vegas standards . We visited the gym and the pool during our stay. The fitness center was small but had just about everything you need to get a good work out in. The pool area was a bit small for the size of the hotel, but we had no problem getting a couple of lounge chairs. The pool is saltwater pool with a bit of chlorine added. The staff was friendly and the towels were nice too. Dining is available for breakfast and lunch at a small restaurant in the lobby. Prices are crazy high. It cost me $4.75 for a cup of coffee. Room Service is pretty pricy too. But with all the dining options in Vegas, we simply went elsewhere. We did ask for kitchenware and room service had it to us two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail. Not slow at all. There are two sides of the little refrigerator. The free side and the mini bar side. You have to ask to have it unlocked. This is down by calling the front desk. Pretty simple. The hotel is not right on the strip, but off set near the back of the property in the City Center complex. So it\u2019s a short walk to the strip. We\u2019d usually walk to the tram and cut through the Bellagio to get to the strip. Or we would catch the tram to the Monte Carlo and exit onto the strip that way. You will land on either mid strip or south strip depending what route you take. You can walk to the strip via the Cosmopolitan too. The tram is free. We stayed three nights. It was nice to see that they have security checking that you have your room keys before they allowed you up the elevators (Late evening). We asked for a late checkout as we had a late flight out of Vegas. For a nominal fee we were able to check out at 4:00pm. Very handy! We were able to get in a couple of extra hours at the pool before checking out and heading to the airport. Pros: Awesome rooms Great location Great staff NOT a Casino Valet parking easy in and out Late check out Plenty of outlets for electronics Cons: Dining in hotel crazy expensive Very short walk to the strip (I know I\u2019m being lazy) Light switches are in kind of a funky place Free side of the refrigerator is kind of small If you want a beautifully appointed hotel that is a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, this is the place.

We also requested a crib for our baby and put in a request for a room on the Bellagio side (half the hotel faces north towards the Bellagio and Rio, the other half faces south towards the Aria).

The room was spectacular! Brand new with windows wall to wall, great soaking tub, fabulous beds, two flat screens, and a nice little kitchenette (you have to ask for cooking utensils). If you are bringing a baby, the Vdara has really nice wood cribs with great mattresses, unlike some hotels I have stayed at that have really dingy metal cribs.

If you want to be steps from the strip, staying at a resort on the strip might be your ticket.

The last time we were there, City Center was under construction. We decided on this trip we wanted to stay in a hotel there. Being in City Center is like being in a cosmopolitan city, not Las Vegas. To me, it seems like the third phase of LV, the first being loud, gaudy, garish, over-the-top and the second being lush, opulant, and luxurious. Not to say that CC is not the last three, but it is a setting that could easily be in Asia or Europe. Very sleek, sophisticated, and urbane. But back to the Vdara. Our stay was the 14th through the 18th of March. Quite frankly, we chose this hotel because we received the best deal. First impression: when we exited the taxi cab, no one from the hotel greeted us, held the door, directed us to check-in, etc., even though it was not extremely busy. However, the wonderful scent that greeted us upon our entrance made me forget about that--until we had to ask which way to check-in. Check-in was pretty simple. We were surprised about the daily resort charge that was added without explanation (didn't see this until check-out and then we were in too much of a hurry to get to the airport to inquire). We never knew there was a free newspaper in the lobby until check-out. I suppose there were other amenities covered by this resort charge that we never knew about as well. We stayed on the 46th floor. The view was amazing! We could see the mountains and the northern part of the strip (from the Bellagio northward). The window coverings were automatic, which was pretty cool. I have read here where people have said it is a difficult system to understand. I am not sure what is so difficult about selecting black-out or blind and up or down. The kitchen was practical. If you desired to have cooking utensils, you could contact housekeeping. The microwave was very handy for heating up leftovers. I was surprised that there was not a coffee maker. I can't even remember the last hotel I stayed at that did not have one standard in the room. I suppose I could have requested one, but we never did. As far as cleanliness, this place was spotless! I am very particular about that--I am the one who goes over everything with handi-wipes immediately upon entering. I did not feel the need here. Our room was always made up in a timely manner. Another curious thing to me was that there was only one sink in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable. The two HD televisions were great. We loved the location, right in the middle of the strip. Again, others have said it is a long walk to the tram, to the strip, etc. This is very subjective. We found it quite easy to get anywhere, downright convenient in fact. The walk to the strip is easy, although the sidewalk stops half way there and you must cross the street to continue on. The tram is just next door at the Bellagio and there is a covered walkway. Not far at all. Easy to get to Crystal's (the shopping area), too. There is not a casino or restaurant in the Vdara. We found this no problem as, one, we are not gamblers, and two, any number of food options are within easy walking distance (for us, anyway). My favorite thing was, strangely enough, that wonderful scent in the lobby. So refreshing.

The person who helped us let us choose our view and floor level with no extra charge. They were very helpful and answered any questions we had at that time. Room was great. Very modern and simple. I wouldn't say it was as luxurious as Palazzo or Wynn but very nice and modern. Was nice to have two tv's as we could watch different programs during our relax time. The rooms were nice in size and very clean. The vibe of the hotel seemed to be more classy 30-60 age group rather than the young party age. There was only one option, a cafe to grab a quick bite. Room service was also an option. However, with the close location to Aria and Bellagio it wasn't too much of a problem. We did get room service and it was fabulous! They came in and set the table with flowers and all. Another great thing about this hotel on a weekend where cab lines were crazy , they were not here. You could always go out and grab one within a few minutes. The pool was great. Easy to find a chair and umbrella. It was very small compared to some of the resorts but didn't seem to be crowded. The music was relaxing and they had magazines you could use by the towels. All in all the hotel was wonderful for out purposes. If you are not there to party this is a perfect hotel!

Service and room quality were excellent, and anything we needed for the kitchen was immediately delivered. Valet service was quick, and any staff that we encountered were professional and courteous. The beds were unbelievably comfortable as were the pillows, and the Aveda products were fantastic. As this was my first trip to Vegas, I did not know what to expect. In my opinion, \"The Strip\" highlights some of the worst in human nature yet tries to provide a clever and pretty \"cover-up\" of true crass and ugliness. I have traveled to many different countries throughout southeast Asia and Europe, and have never seen such embarrassing middle-class (and middle age) debauchery (did people not do this sort of thing in college?). Needless to say, I will never return to Vegas, so please keep that in mind when reading the rest of this review! Vdara does its very best to provide a quiet, 5-star oasis in the middle of complete chaos. Although it is non-smoking, a scent is pumped into the lobby and rooms, which unfortunately caused an allergic reaction for me (but not my husband). The hotel is busy 24/7, and sleep quality is an issue, but again this is not the fault of Vdara. Noise from the strip and the streets is non-stop, so ear-plugs are a must. If you love the Vegas scene, but want a relaxing place to stay, definitely give Vdara a try. If you are like me, a first-timer who wasn't sure about the Vegas experience, please think about what I have written. I found it impossible to enjoy the shows or restaurants, as you are forced to travel through smoke-filled casinos to get anywhere. Nevada is a beautiful state - so stay off the strip and enjoy the incredible desert and canyons. Scoot City Tours is a must, as is the Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon and of course the Grand Canyon.

It is part of the new City Center complex right in the heart of the action and from some of the other reviews and the pictures, I thought we were in for a real treat! WRONG. Although the location really can't be beat (adjacent to both Bellagio and Aria and minutes to the strip) and the some of the spa services were decent, here is a quick rundown of some of our experiences this weekend: *DIRTY sheets- even after we called to make sure they were cleaned and changed, the \"new\" ones were still stained with some previous guests' bodily fluids *We arrived on Weds and room was not cleaned until we called twice to ask for it to be cleaned on Friday *No robes in rooms- you have to call to request them and they bring them up on cheapy wire hangers, with the ties dragging along the floor. Very classy. *No coffee maker in room, so even if you think you're going to luck out by having a \"kitchenette\", you have to pay extra to get anything to use in the kitchen *Since no coffee maker, forced to go downstairs to buy coffee every morning- VERY expensive and VERY long wait. The entire Market Cafe setup is an organizational disaster. *The food at the Market Cafe takes forever to arrive and arrived ICE COLD- not even a hint at the breakfast sandwich ever having at least seen a microwave *We thought we'd just buy some food from the Market to have in our \"kitchen\" in the room- but they sell mostly things that you can't use: i.e. cereal but no milk, meat and cheese but no bread, dry muffin mix but there's no oven, etc. *The \"Champagne\" manis and pedis in the spa include champagne... for $20 extra per glass! At every other 5-star spa I've been to, this indication usually means bottomless champagne but not at Vdara! *The resort fee includes useless items such as free valet (didn't drive a car), free turndown for the sofa bed (not necessary for the two of us), free newspaper in the morning (not delivered to your door, but if you pick it up from the front desk before they run out), etc. Basically a total scam. Plus they tax you on the fee, so the $18 resort fee is really $20+ *I used a Groupon for the spa and even though this company claims to be \"LEED certified\" and ultra \"green\", I was forced to go to their business center to print out paper copies of my Groupon (instead of scanning from iPhone like a \"green\" company would)... and was then charged $1 to print out the coupon that they demanded they have a paper copy of! *I lost a diamond tennis bracelet in the lobby (completely my fault) but wanted to let the front desk know in case it was turned in to lost and found.

This hotel should be grateful to their staff members (what few of them that were on duty at any given time), that tirelessly work their butts off, and with a pleasant attitude.

Not their fault that there were only a few bell hops working on Sunday with hundreds of checkouts and check-ins' ~Never, ever, did I observe any staff member slacking off or loafing around. They work very hard and probably have to put up with a lot of verbal garbage from frustrated clients. ~Rooms are nice but showing a little wear. ~Beds are comfy and rooms are quiet.

One day, we went to \"Plan B\" (and walked) because we did not want to wait any longer for our car. ~Only valet parking.

We walked through the Aria, Belligio, and Cosmopolitan. Again, we don't mind walking but be aware there is no straight shot to get to the strip.

Vdara was perfect for this, and is situated in the heart of CityCenter and a two minute walk to either Aria or Cosmopolitan (which are both fabulous by the way). The service at the front of the hotel was outstanding and the valet and porter greeted us with a very warm welcome, as did the clerk at check-in. No room upgrades were offered; however, the room was stunning and contained a kitchen and dining area, living room / bedroom divided by dual LCD TVs mounted on a dividing partition and a huge bathroom with separate shower and soaker tub. I believe this is a standard room, as I checked out some of the other rooms during maid service and noticed they were equally stunning. When booking, I checked out standard rooms from the other hotels in CityCenter and in comparison, the Vdara can simply not be beat anywhere on the strip for less than $200 per night. You essentially get a suite from one of the other 5 star properties for a fraction of the price. Only drawback... No gaming or restaurants. I saw this as a positive as it allowed me to explore the nearby casinos and restaurants without feeling confined to the hotel. I was originally going to give the hotel a four star rating, because there are a few growing pains (new hotel); however, in the context of value - the hotel has got to earn a five star rating. The points below are some criticisms I feel should be addressed to truly bring the hotel to the next level: Slow housekeeping service to the rooms: Ordered some wine glasses, knife and a couple of plates and it took nearly an hour after having to call an additional time for service. Being that the hotel was not near full occupancy, I would have expected a faster response time. Cheap fixtures in kitchen and bathroom: Felt that they really went cheap with the faucets and shower fixtures. In the kitchen, the faucet felt loose to the touch and gave me the impression that it could just snap off at any time. Low water pressure in the bathroom: For a five star property, the water pressure in the shower and to the toilet are simply unacceptable. My assumption is that this has something to do with trying to get some type of a green rating for the property. When I go on vacation, I'm not concerned with the efficiency of a hotel... I just want to be comfortable. Phone switch for valet: I had to call valet to pick up my car at around 11pm one night, and I could not get through to the valet desk at Vdara. It would ring, then there would be no answer, then I would be transferred to Aria's valet who had no idea what to tell me. It would appear that there is only one valet on duty in the evening, so if they are getting your car, there is no one answering the phones. Better to just go down to the lobby and flag a valet in person. No restaurant or pool bar: It would have been nice to at least have one dining option outside of the cafe in the lobby. I believe they just recently closed their restaurant and will replace it with a grocery store. I don't think this suits the feel of the hotel, but hopefully the prices will be affordable and they will offer a good wine and alcohol section at non inflated prices. For food options, it's best to drop in to Aria across the street. Iron is cabled to the ironing board: Seriously, this is ridiculous! My wife had to drag the ironing board from the bedroom into the kitchen just to fill the thing with water. Concerned about someone stealing a $20 iron? Isn't that what credit cards (incidentals) are for? Ok, other than these criticisms, Vdara is an absolutely exceptional hotel to spend a relaxing time at! When you walk in, the hotel smells fresh and carpets are the plushest and cleanest I've seen at any hotel. I was worried that Vdara would be too \"ultra modern\", but they balanced the overall look to appeal to a wide variety of tastes. I think the designers did a wonderful job! My previous go to property on the strip was the Encore, but I have noticed lately that the prices have begun to rise their into the upper $200s. If Vdara can stay consistently under $200, I think it stands to become a real trend setter in Vegas by offering a huge level of value for those comfortable being close to the action, without actually being in it.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel for couples; Go somewhere else for girls/guys trip\u201d", "Author": "globetrotter3333", "ReviewID": "UR100213848", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights with my boyfriend (we're both 28) and we've both been to Vegas many times before and thought we'd try this hotel out b/c it's one of the newer ones.

BUT Aria is literally a 3 min walk to the casino > There's no where to eat in the lobby after midnight Overall it was a nice, modern hotel and good for couples but definitely not a very fun hotel. I think a lot of it has to do with no casino being downstairs. There's nothing happening and there's nothing to eat after midnight and you'd have to walk to the Bellagio or Aria.

Her brother & his wife ended up staying across the street at the MGM Grand. Upon arrival, we were greeting by friendly and helping staff to assist with our luggage. From there the front desk associate was extremely helpful in welcoming us and ensuring that our first stay in Vegas would be unforgettable! We were told there were a few available upgrades to choose from- and based on our preferences- he suggested the Panoramic Suite on one of the higher floors. The elevator ride to the 46th floor was quick! We found our room at the end of the hallway! The entry cards do not need to be slid into a magnetic strip- just wave it in front of the sensor. Another cool feature is the glowing doorbell for each room. It naturally glows a white color- however, once inside the room you can adjust this color to glow blue for 'Do Not Disturb' or green for 'Housekeeping'. The electric shades were all down when we got in the room. Once we found the switches to raise the blinds- we were overcome with the sights we were surrounded by! Views of the city and mountains from the entryway, kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom! The only thing that was a bit quirky was the placement of the switches-- seemed to be in odd locations. The bathroom was superb- with 2 separate sinks, a large soaking tub looking out onto the strip & mountains, and a spacious shower with marble seat. Unfortunately- her brother & wife did not have the same great fortune we found back at the MGM Grand. Once they came and saw our hotel & room- their excitement dropped as they noted the lack of equivalent high-end accommodations, and likened their room more to a Hotel 6 stay. I for one had an amazing time at the Vdara and am eagerly looking forward to a return trip! We did not utilize the kitchen at all unfortunately- but did read other reviews that said that the promptness for obtaining kitchenware wasn't superb. My only other semi complaint would be the house keeping. Leftover food was left out for several days, and no replacement of soaps/toiletries or the robe once worn once. Little things to note, but didn't hamper my stay in any way! The view and amazingly comfortable bed was well worth the trip alone! :)", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cMy new favaourite hotel\u201d", "Author": "Zmu", "ReviewID": "UR99246057", "Content": "We have stayed at many 5 star hotels in North America and this was one of the best.

She totally ignored the early check in request, wanted to check us into a dirty room and just pointed out that we should go to the bellman outside and leave our luggage. I asked if the luggage can be sent directly to our rooms once they become available, she said NO, you will go to the bellman and get your luggage from him?! Is this a 5 star service or what? - The bar in the Lobby with a seating area overlooking the entrance was a lovely place to be however the staff members were not very helpful there either- I had to wait for 15min until a bartender arrives, the member of staff who was nearby just said he didn't know where his colleague was. Later on few of them were just chatting nicely next to the bar and totally ignored my request to bring the drinks to our seating area. So I ended up having no tray but a folder with a bill, two drinks to carry and a handbag- again is this a 5 star service I wonder. - one of our rooms smelled on mold and it took 3 days and complaints to finally be moved. - in the other room, some of the lights were not working, the bath tub tap was not either and the toilet was not flashing properly. After all, the only helpful and very very pleasant staff members were the Bellmen. Wether or not they were so nice because of the tips, I do not know. I have stayed in many places around the world, I have also worked in the hotel industry and one thing for sure, the staff at Vdara does not really know what a 5 star service is.

Upon check in, while conversing with the clerk I advised this was our first time to Las Vegas and he gave us an upgrade without the super secret $50 tip I had read about for a room upgrade, and honestly I wasn't even fishing for it, but he started our stay off right. The suite itself was immaculate and the view of the Bellagio fountains on one side and the mountains on the other was remarkable.

The Vdara is very new, clean, has lovely modern decor. As many reviewers have mentioned, it is non gambling, non smoking hotel which is great for the non smokers. Since it was my first time in Vegas, I couldn't decide on which hotel to stay at, the lady at the Flightcenter told me the Vdara was less than 2 years old and has very good reviews so far so we decided to stay there. And yes the Vdara is new and very nice. This is not to make this hotel look bad, it is solely just my opinion. Two girls in early 20's going to Las Vegas for the experience and shopping... Vdara is not the best hotel to stay at. It is very quiet.. too quiet. If you travel to Vegas often and you are looking to relax (but why would you go to Vegas to relax?) then Vdara is your hotel. There is nothing going on other than the small bar with maybe 5 people at a time and if you want to socialize, gamble, meet people, etc etc. closest place is the Aria, which is right across, but still it is quite the different experience. To go to the Aria or the city center it's a bit of a walk. It's not \"right across the street\" like the flightcenter told me, especially on a windy day, you have to walk atleast 5 minutes and it sure feels a lot further than across the street. Check in was very easy and fast, there are 50 something floors, and we were on 33rd floor. The view wasn't that great, and the room felt quite small. The bathroom was decent size with 2 sinks and our room had a small kitchen with microwave and fridge. They charge $18 a day for hotel fee for newspaper, 2bottles of water, etc etc, and we did not receive newspaper or bottles of water other than the ones that were there when we checked in. I called front desk on the 3rd day and told them about it and they brought 4 bottles of water up. If you're gonna charge $36 a day for bottles of water, you should make sure it's there. Also there were no robes or slippers but a note saying it's available by request, so we called for them also. Which is understandable because not everyone wants robes or slippers but it's a 4.5 star hotel, (told it's not 5 because it doesn't have casino, otherwise it would've been) and they can't provide robes or slippers? To me its odd and seems like a way for bellboys to make couple extra bucks on tips, which kinda annoys me. Another thing is that the Vdara and Aria is located slightly off the strip, have to turn in and go up this circular ramp to get to the two hotels. Since we didn't rent a car, and it was quite windy out, we cabbed everywhere! And even to get to the strip was $5-10 and include tips, the amount spent on cabs alone was more than $500 for the 4 days. (We did go back and forth from malls, outlets and clubs though but still!) Like I said, this isn't to make this hotel look bad, it is a very nice hotel, it just wasn't for us. We visited Caesars, Encore, Cosmopolitan, Aria and Luxor and the vibe was totally different. There were people everywhere at all hours and we enjoyed meeting all sorts of people from around the world. Next time we will be staying at the Cosmopolitan (another new hotel with the hottest club right now: Marquee), Caesars (has the Pure club as well as the Forum shops) or Encore. They might cost slightly more but considering the amount spent on cabs I think it might even out at the end! The only reason I would not recommend this hotel to a friend is because all my friends are my age and would feel the same. If you are older, or a family visiting Vegas, Vdara is a good hotel to stay at. Oh I do have to mention, my friend forgot her sunglasses in the room, and the security guy called later that day asking if I left anything behind. He told me they'd ship it right away which was very nice we thought she lost her $600 sunglasses! so Thank you Vdara!", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "milwaukee wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cquite side of city center\u201d", "Author": "riverwest", "ReviewID": "UR98115065", "Content": "Hotel is non smoking, non gambling, upscale. rooms are nice mini suites.

Don\u2019t stay at the Vdara if this is your first time in Vegas. Why? Because the Vdara won\u2019t give you the \u201cVegas Experience\u201d that you\u2019re probably looking for. There\u2019s no casino. There\u2019s only one restaurant (and it\u2019s only open for breakfast and lunch). There\u2019s only one bar and the \u201cscene\u201d at the bar is more reminiscent of a Hilton or Hyatt in someplace like Chicago or Houston, not Vegas. While there is a pool, it\u2019s nothing more than a slab of concrete located on the third floor with zero atmosphere. A real Vegas pool is what you\u2019d find at the Mirage or Mandalay Bay or Hard Rock or Wynn but definitely not at Vdara. The spa is small and lacks basic amenities (like juice, fresh fruit, iced towels, etc.) and only has one small whirlpool. If you\u2019re looking for a Vegas spa, head to Caesars or Bellagio or Mandalay Bay. Even the Luxor has a better spa. But don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026the Vdara is one of the nicest hotels for the price of any hotel in Vegas. The rooms are outstanding. I\u2019ve stayed at just about every hotel in Las Vegas and the Vdara rooms and the personnel (front desk, bell staff, restaurant, housekeeping, etc.), are some of the best you\u2019ll find anywhere. The common areas of the hotel and the rooms themselves were tastefully decorated and impeccably clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The plasma TV actually had over 50 stations and most in HD. Most hotels in Vegas that have LCD\u2019s or plasmas have a very limited number of channels and almost never have any in HD. While I know you probably aren\u2019t coming to Vegas to watch TV, why have an HDTV and not supply HD programming? All the rooms in the Vdara are suites complete with kitchens. From the standard deluxe suite (like the one I was in), all the way up to two bedroom penthouse suites. Not that you\u2019d have any intention on cooking, but it\u2019s nice to have a microwave and a fridge handy to warm up or cool down drinks that you\u2019ll bring in from the strip. The large bathrooms have freestanding tubs and large separate glass showers. The only negative I have on the bathroom is that for rooms this size and so nicely appointed, they only included one sink. The rooms all have windows that run the length of the room and include automatic drapes and blackout shades that rise and fall by remote control. The fitness center is small for the number of rooms in the hotel. It\u2019s very nice and modern (all the elliptical machines have personal TV\u2019s, there\u2019s free bottled water and a small assortment of machine weights and free weights). But there is usually a wait to use one of only 5 elliptical machines, 3 treadmills or 2 bikes. The fitness center is free but you are paying for it as part of your $18 a day resort fee. The fee also includes internet, bottled water in your room, local and long distance calls (does anyone really use this?) and free newspapers although you have to get these from the front desk. The spa, unless you\u2019re receiving a treatment, will cost you an extra $25 per day to use. Most Vegas hotels that charge a resort fee only tack on an extra $10 or so to use the spa facilities since you\u2019re already paying a resort fee. Charging an additional $25 is a rip off, especially for this spa. It\u2019s small (only one whirlpool), and as I stated earlier, lacks basic amenities like assorted juices, fresh fruit (typically you would be offered bananas, oranges, kiwi, etc.). It has a small relaxation room and no audio system (soothing music), in the steam, sauna or anywhere else in the spa. It was also very bright. Spas in my opinion should take on dusk type lighting. The spa was probably the biggest disappointment of anything at the Vdara. The one restaurant in the hotel, Silk Road, is only open for breakfast and lunch and the prices are on the high side. But don\u2019t miss it! Both mornings I ate there (because I had a $25 per day resort credit), people were coming in from other hotels just for the coffee and cappuccinos. I\u2019m not sure how they do it, but their cappuccinos are as good as the ones I\u2019ve had in Italy and certainly the best I\u2019ve had anywhere in the U.S. You also have to try the breakfast sliders. These are something right out of Top Chef. Three small breakfast sandwiches made with outstanding beef tenderloin and quail eggs. Unreal! Vdara is located in the back of City Center. Across from the Aria, behind the Cosmopolitan and next to the back of the Bellagio so there\u2019s no direct access to the strip. But don\u2019t be put off by the location. Vdara is connected via a short walkway directly into the Bellagio from the hotel lobby or you can jump on the tram and take it down to the Monte Carlo. You can of course walk across the main entrance driveway and into the Aria. Another advantage to staying at Vdara is the wait time for a cab. There are none. Unlike the mega resorts where wait times during prime rush hour traffic (checkout, dinner, etc), can be up to a half hour or more, there never was more than one person waiting for a cab. Vdara is the perfect place to stay on business or if you\u2019re a long time Vegas visitor who\u2019s not necessarily looking for the typical Vegas hotel. They always seem to have some sort of promotions going on and the below average price for an above average room makes the Vdara a good value.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel, just non-gaming\u201d", "Author": "RJ-EM", "ReviewID": "UR97894479", "Content": "We stayed here for a couple of nights and despite the fact that it is a non-gaming hotel we quite liked it.

The hotel was clean and has really cool art and music playing when you arrive but once you check in everything changes. First you need to understand that this is not a regular hotel, this is a \"condo hotel\" so these are like small apartments (very small apartments). When we boked the room we stressed to the hotel that I needed a room with 2 beds because I was traveling with a work associate and we needed to share a room. When we arrived we were told that ALL of the rooms in the hotel that have more than one bed come with a pull out couch as the 2nd bed. I haven't slept on a pull out couch since college and at $200 per night I was not happy that I was expected to tonight. Especially since it was midnight local time when we arrived and I had been traveling for 8 hours and had a business meeting in just 7 hours. I was assured that the bed would be made for me and that extra padding would be added right away. That I was the #1 priority. I figured well, OK we can deal with this for 2 nights, lets make the best of it. We waited close to an hour and still no housekeeping with linens and pillows, when we called we were told it would be no more than 20 minutes, we called again at 1:30am and were told they were coming right up, we called again at 2am and wa assured they were coming \"right now\". At 2:30am when they arrived the housekeeper asked if we wanted her to make the bed, we said no, don't worry about it, we have been waiting more than 2hours and she said it wasn't her fault, she just got here. Not the answer I was expecting to hear. On top of all this, noise travels well in the Vdara hotel, especially through the air vents. It was like being back in my first apratment in NYC when you can hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next door and the room upstairs. Between listening to the late night antics of the couple in the room next to me and the Fraternity Keg party going on upstairs it was impossible to get sleep, it was like the sounds were bein gpiped in throught he PA system. When I called to ask Mgmnt if they could do something about the party upstairs we were told \"well this is Vegas\". (Are they kidding ! !) The next morning I went to see the manager, I was told there are no other rooms anywhere in the hotel but that they were sorry and that they woudl waive the resort fee for the day . . . WHAT ?!? How about comping the room for the night? Or waive the resort fee for both nghts and give me $200 food and Beverage - no sir, sorry the best we can do is one night resort fee. This place is a joke. I seriously expect more from an MGM property I can't say how disappointed I am in the service and the accomodations. I guess if you come here to party and don't mind sleeping on a pull out couch - if you plan on sleeping than this is the place for you. Otherwise stay away and go around the corner to the Palms or Ceasers.

This was absolutely fine by me, because the lack of restaurants/casinos resulted in a lovely SHORT walk back to the elevators, and my room (probably about 2 minutes in total from the lobby to your room!) It has a direct walk-way connecting to the inside of the Bellagio, and a monorail/tram from there to the aria/monte carlo resorts. Aria casino is about a 3-5minute walk via some pedestrian walkways. The quickest route to the strip is straight outside the front doors, and walk down the side of the brand new Cosmopolitan hotel along the road. This is a fantastic hotel in a great location, with really reaaaally nice rooms. I didn't see the pool area, but the gym facilities were very nice. The best part: The rooms! Last time, I stayed at the Bellagio in an equivalent room. Trust me, the Vdara's rooms are WAAAAAAAAY better. (Probably because they are so much newer). Two (minor) downsides... 1) no utensils in the kitchen (I think it may be worthwhile to request them upon check in, just in case you need them. ) We ended up eating left-over food with shovels fashioned out of ripped up cardboard because by the time you realise you need a knife and fork, you can't be bothered to wait!

Yes, the room was beautiful but you will spend most of your time on the phone requesting items for the room because everything is \"by request.\" The hotel operator is a shared service between VDara and Aria so they don't always get your items to your room and you will have to follow up. For example, if you book an Executive Suite with a pull out bed. You have to request your bed be made up. The rooms have a beautiful kitchen but no fork, plate, spoon, pot, pans etc. You have to request each item and you ask for more than four you have to justify it and then it has to go to a manger for approval. More time wasted on your trip. The rooms also have a washer and dryer but no soap. Not even a dish towel or sponge in the kitchen. I didn't realize I needed to make a list while on vacation. They make it so difficult that it is simply not worth it. Not with so many other hotels that want your business in Vegas. Now let's talk about the Staff. We pulled up to what we thought was the valet and as we were loading our suitcases the employee yelled us for being in the wrong spot then blew his whistle at us. We stook in line for 30 minutes to check-in and 55 minutes to check out. The hotel room has an AC unit but the entire hotel (hallways, elevators etc.) do not. If they do, they were not on this weekend. It was like walking into a sauna. The lobby looked like the airport. People sleeping in their chairs waiting for what I am not sure. Lastly, the hotel will charge you a $20.00 a day resort fee on top of your room charges. Do yourself a favor and find another hotel. This place will go BK in a matter of time. P.S.

We were blessed with warm weather and were able to spend a day by the pool. The lounge chairs by the pool were so comfortable. Large pillows came with each chair.

The spa also had awesome toiletries for each guest to take advantage of including Aveda shampoo and lotions, shavers and even mouthwash. I found all of these items to be very convenient.

I prepaid for my room before my arrival and upon check-in she informed me that I had to pay an additional $18.00 plus tax per night for some BS resort fee.

The room was very small and cluttered with too much furniture (Not what was posted on the site in square footage) 2. The water pressure sucks. 3. Every time I wanted my car from valet I would call in advance to request it and no one would answer the phone, I had to call multiple times in a row. 4. The same goes for customer service at the front desk (no one would answer the phone), poor customer service skills and not accommodating to your concerns. 5.

And if you want to sample the rest of what Vegas has to offer, you're in the middle of the strip to it's easy go elsewhere from Vdara.

We requested a view of the fountains and were easily accommodated with a view on the 29th floor. The room was great. Everything still looked and smelled like new and was very clean. We requested dishes when we got there and they were brought up within 10 minutes. The only annoying thing was that when they cleaned the room they took the dishes away the first time (even though they were clean). We learned that if you wanted to keep them you had to put them away in a cupboard. Dirty dishes were taken away if placed in the sink or left on the counter (which makes sense cause there's nothing to clean them with anyway) but you had to phone housekeeping again to get replacements. Out of the 3 times we phoned to get dishes the longest we waited was maybe 15 minutes... and one time we phoned at 1am when you know there's not a lot of housekeeping staff on duty! The fridge in the room was a little bit small (half was taken up by the mini bar) but it fit enough stuff for us to make simple breakfasts and lunches for 4 days. The hotel is a bit off the strip but there's a FREE tram that takes you to Aria, CityCentre, and Monte Carlo. Walking to the Bellagio was maybe a 5 minute walk with only a short bit of it outdoors on a covered walkway (it was the same walk to get to the tram albeit a little longer to get to the Bellagio than the tram). The pool was pretty much dead while we were there but there were still staff and it was a nice area. Being still quite cool out we welcomed the direct sunlight however I could see how it might get rather intense in the summer months. We went to the fitness centre almost every morning and the staff there were very professional and attentive. There were plenty of different cardio machines and weights. It never seemed like anyone was ever waiting to use a machine someone else was on. Water bottles were provided along with clean towels free of charge. There was a juice bar located just outside the fitness centre and I believe they also had an espresso machine there if you wanted to get a coffee in the morning. Unfortunately we never bought anything there so I'm unsure what the prices were like. Probably the best part of this hotel was the no smoking. It almost became shocking to go into other hotels with casinos filled with smoke. Yes, they do pump scented air into the lobby but I really only smelled it when first walking into the hotel. I would say it was noticeable but not overly offensive. There is currently one restaurant and one bar in the lobby of the hotel (neither of which we went to during our stay). They are also building a cafe in the lobby which looks like it should be open soon. All in all we had a great stay.

At that time I was MAD, I went downstairs to the lobby they gave me the same speech but did apologize. When I returned home 5 hours later, I call the front looking for an update. They told me they did not know what was going on and told me to explain the situation to them again and they would leave a message to the room. Outrageous!! They told to expect a phone call two days later. Outrageous!! Grievance: 1) My/Guest items should not be tucked away- I FEEL ROBED 2) They make their own rules as they feel fit: staff can go into rooms when they see fit 3) When I checked out the first time the room should have been thoroughly checked and my personal items should have been placed in lost and found! 4) After paying to stay there my concerns are no longer important to them.

By far the Vdara was nicer than most, however there were a few issues that are a deal breaker for me. Firstly location, the Vdara is set back from the strip, and you have to walk via the Bellagio to get to it. (at least we found that the shortest route). Also with no casino there is not late night gambling and the stumbling back up to bed. It a 10 minute walk from the Bellagio casino. The hotel itself is beautiful. The lobby has a very inviting aroma, much different from all of the smoke filled hotels on the strip. The room was large, but poorly designed. There were no kitchen utensils or coffee maker, but I wasn't expecting them anyway. The front desk staff was very courtious, and very willing to work with me about the incedental charges. They charge $130 per night upfront, to be refunded later. I simply requested less and so they deactivated our minibar, and when we ordered room service we had to pay with cash or credit, no big deal. They were very willing to accomodate. Upon check in I also requested robes and slippers to be brought up, they arrived about 10 mins after us. Our room was clean, and very nicely furnished. The bed was very comfortable, and luxurios. My biggest issue was with the shower. The shower had very little water pressure, and the adjustable shower head was garbage. After the first shower, I started washing my hair under the tub faucet just so I could get all of the shampoo out. It was pittiful. I wouldn't stay here again simply for that reason alone. Vegas is a dirty place to begin with, I want to feel clean after a nice hot shower. Other than the location and the bad shower, the hotel was great, staff were all courtious, the concierge was very helpful, and the housekeeping staff did a great job each day freshening up our room. Also the room service was great, I would reccomend the quaesidillas! The Silk Road restaurant did an excellednt breakfast, but they are only open 7-2 and there aren't any other places in the hotel to eat. One more quick note: while we didn't use the pool, we did check it out, it was dull and uninviting, small in comparison to some of the other hotels on the strip we have stayed in.

I had just been there a month earlier and stayed at Trump, which while not perfect, was a far better experience. First of all, I had booked a King Deluxe room. Obviously it's not their high-end room type, but I lived in Vegas for years and I know how this works. On check-in, (mind you it was on a Monday, not a holiday or convention week), I politely asked for an upgrade along with tipping the front desk kid a $20. I was \"upgraded\" to a room of the exact same type but with a semi-obstructed view of the Bellagio show. They call this a \"lakeview\" room. Call me picky but partially obstructed view on a mid-level floor is not an upgrade. Then about the room. Sure it's new, and it's all dark woods and modern decor. Pretty to look at but not easy to live in. The automatic blinds and \"blackout\" shades do not adequately block sunlight during the day because of spaces between the multiple windows/shades. Another problem- power outlets. I plug my cell phone into the lamp or at least outlet next to the bed at hotels. Here, there were no outlets in the nightstand lamps and no easily accessible outlets within arms reach of the bed. The lights on either side of the bed don't have light switches in them, you can only operate them with the light switch located next to the front door, so you're in total darkness through the kitchen then living area when going to bed at night. If you don't get the picture from how I worded this, you'll get it when you stay here. Imagine laying down and as you're about to sleep realizing you have to walk to the kitchen to turn off your bedroom light. As for the bathroom, it's small. If you have more than one person trying to get ready at once you will be fighting over mirror and sink space. They aren't double sinks either. Plus the toilet is not separated at all from the main bathroom area which I don't like at all. The living area has a pullout queen bed which I didn't use but a friend did one night and it is horribly uncomfortable. The stories of having a kitchen but no utensils or plates etc are true. I didn't bother trying to ask for any. The location was central and next to Aria. Yay. But because of how ridiculous things were built I wound up having to take a cab to Cosmopolitan which is literally 500 feet away across the street.

So, the hotel smelled fresh and clean and there were no roudy people to contend with. However, just a short walk down a covered passageway led to Bellagio and Caeser's Palace, shops, restaurants, and the Vegas strip about two blocks from the hotel. Also, the CityCenter Tram was nearby so you could take the free aerial tram to the Aria and Monte Carlo Casinos. We asked for a room with a view and were not disappointed...We got the 28th floor looking north across the strip. The room had motor controlled large sheer curtains and shades operated by a wall switch. So, you could let all of Vegas into your room or shut it out completely! This room was the Deluxe Suite. I spent alot of time enjoying the hustle and bustle from our room and a view of the Bellagio Fountains across from the Paris Casino. Everyone was so friendly and the service was great.

When I first booked, I could see there were some mixed reviews. That's fine. Since then, I've noticed it has gone downhill and unfortunately, I've experienced it. *Check-in: 20 minutes with 1 person and 6 waiting at 6pm. Not good enough. *Had organised one extra night prior to checking in under the same name - was told it would be linked to the original booking - was it? No. Had to explain the whole situation. I had already paid for the all 3 nights and he wanted to charge me again. More explanation and it was resolved (so I thought). * There is a lack of staff - everything takes so long - tried getting some service at 10pm and gave up after being on hold for 15 minutes. * Got home and then found out they had charge me for the first 2 nights that I had already paid for - inexcusable, considering the front desk had assured me that after the initial confusion, this would not happen. I sent an email and have never heard back from them....luckily my friend had booked us originally and he was able to have some terse words with someone and our credit card transaction was reversed a few days later. Positives: * The valet parking was speedy - thumbs up to this. * The rooms are ok - there are better rooms and I would rate The Venetian and Trump rooms better. Would I stay at the Vdara again? No. I did wish I was at Aria and Cosmopolitan when we were there.

They attempted to fix it after we gave it a call but it barely stayed in. Their staff is friendly and helpful but the maintenance is very poor.

The Vdera was listed as a 5 star and this was our mini honeymoon so we were looking for a hotel that we could feel a little spoiled at. This hotel had no casino which is great due to my asthma. The prices on line were listed at $189 for Saturday night and $109 the following nights and were so good compared to that of hotels further north on the strip that we thought we would give it a try. At check in the front desk staff was helpful and friendly. Once in our room I was very confused by the kitchenette concept but yet there was not one dish, pot, or piece of cutlery in the room. There was no coffee maker in the room and yet there was a bathroom scale in the washroom. Who weighs themselves on vacation? There was no extras in this room at all. On the web it stated that there were robes, slippers, etc and non of that was in our room. The next morning we started to get ready and while having a shower the base of the shower began to fill with water and wasn't draining properly. I called the front desk and they had a maintenance man come to the room in minutes. He pulled a massive mound of black hair out of the drain. I felt like the first 24 hours we were noticing all of the things we didn't have and were promised on the web. At this time I looked up the advertisement on my iphone and we went down to the front desk. I told the lady that there were things missing from our room and that I was not happy with it. I was then told that if you want dishes then you need to ask for them because they didn't know who would need them. When I asked about the robes, I was told that it was only offered with a Vdara suite and we had a deluxe suite. I then pulled out my phone and showed her what was advertised and stated that if we were not upgraded that we would be checking into another hotel. I told her that this is not what we had signed up for and it now being Sunday, the price of the other 5 stars were not significantly different than at the Vdara. At this point I was willing to go elsewhere and pay for what we wanted. She called her manager and we were upgraded. I know that some of this might sound petty, but when you are going away on what is a romantic trip and you think you are paying for one thing and you get something different, it is frustrating. We stayed there for 5 days and I had to call down to the front desk for extra towels, a shower cap, plates, cutlery etc almost on a daily basis. There was one morning when housekeeping actually took our bowls and didn't replace them and then had to call housekeeping again. Another morning I asked for dish liquid so i could was our bowls and housekeeping left the dish liquid and took the bowls. In our suite we had a coffeemaker. There were 2 mornings that I had to go looking for coffee because there was none left in my room and the housekeeping staff told me that they were out. Finally had a coffee maker but no way to make coffee. If you buy one downstairs at the coffee shop be prepared for the $8 coffee bill. The bottom line for me is that there is NO WAY this is a 5 star. There was just too much stupidity and running around and while the location is good, nothing about this hotel seemed convenient or easy. No one asked us on check in if we needed these items, the guest are actually encouraged to call housekeeping every time something is needed. No wonder they were slow getting the items to the room. The positives are that rooms are clean and comfortable, the tram came every 3-5 minutes making it super convenient to get to the Bellagio and Monte Carlo.

Check in was excellent for us. Arrived around 7pm and went right to the desk and checked in, no line. We tipped the girl on front desk $20 and asked for complementary upgrade. After tapping away she gave us 47th floor and view of Bellagio fountains. Thought it was well worth it. She was very friendly and seemed genuine in her wish to make our stay a good one. She asked if we wanted plates, cutlery etc, we didn't have to ask her. She said she would just send everything up. We thought the room was clean and a good size. After we had been out for an hour and returned to our room we had most of the things we had asked for including robes and slippers. I left a tip for the housekeeper the day after and a note to ask her to leave the plates etc. She did take the dirty ones and replaced them later with fresh ones. Once or twice during the week we had to ring housekeeping for the odd item which had not been replaced. There were times when they could have been quicker, the wait was sometimes quite long. Also one day we had a problem with the cooker hood fan, which seemed to come on by itself and would not go off. We waited a long time for the maintenance man to arrive and had to make more than one call, the last one to the manager, which seemed to do the trick. When He arrived he said he thought it was the aircraft setting them off??!! Anyway it was fixed. The room set-up was good. One criticism was the closet was not big enough for a couple, especially the hanger space, very poor. The fridge was just about adequate, the shelf space was not very deep. No kettles provided but we used a pan to boil water for tea etc. The bathroom was big, but the shower was a walk in one with no door, which made it a bit cold at times. There was only one sink in our bathroom and it was not very deep. If I was having a shave i had to keep the tap running rather than fill the sink up. Not very good for a city with a water shortage!

I warn you, it is a long review, but worth it! This is my 2nd review on this place. I traveled with another friend and stayed at the same location for New Years Eve celebration. On hearing others in the check in queue, I asked for a city view room and did receive it. A note some rooms are owned privately and rented out - on entering the room we noticed it being quite dusty, a few hairs on the bathroom floor and smeared windows. When the bellhop came with our bags we mentioned these things and straight away he placed a call on his walkie-talkie and offered a $50 credit for the room - he was wonderful. Then we asked him for info. on alcohol purchase and he informed us purchasing from CVS - the pharmacy - we said what - that is incorrect=it is a pharmacy! Well, he said, in Vegas it is a CVS pharmacy that sells alcohol - we did not believe him and checked it out and guess what - they sell alcohol - so a great one stop shop for pharmacy shopping, snacks, milk and alcohol. However, we walked to the Miracle Mile Shops a mall across from the Bellagio and the ABC stores sell alcohol too and it is is short walk because, the Vdara has a walkaway that connects to Bellagio. The ABC stores had promotions on the alcohol we bought so a few dollars saved. ABC is touch pricier on other pharmacy products, but still a convenient location to get too and it is inside a mall for those hot and cold days. There are long shaped glasses filled with an alcoholic drink that you can buy at some shops at the mall - try the one with vodka it is blue but, we heard they are all good - another Vegas experience. Back to housekeeping, we had also ordered plate settings and pots to be delivered, since the rooms have a stylish kitchenette, and they had not arrived yet. All was done later, the room supervisor had come with the housekeeper and gone over cleaning the bathroom floor and dusting the room, the window was cleaned on another trip and the plate settings were delivered - Most room service staff leave around 5pm - that was the reason there was a delay in delivery and for room service there was a 50 mins. wait for food. there is an operation tax on room service receipts - this is a service charge for preparing the food, like admin. costs or fees and is not the same as a tip, so it does not go to the person who delivers the food. I know things may sound steep, but we were considering convenience, too cold to walk wanted something light with alcohol - so if you add up all the room service costs and compare to what it could be if you went outside , in the cold, using up time it would be OK to allow yourself convenience of room service. One can also cook something light because there is a kitchenette but, we had not prepared for that- I did save up to come here and still have some savings - so that is another way to do things! The Vdara is located in the Citycenter area right behind the Bellagio so you may not see it (www.citycenter.com). The nice thing though is it is trendy and new, beautifully decorated and non-smoking with no casino on site - Some may say boring but wait, It is quite and has a kitchenette and all hotel amenities and styles PLUS - YOU CAN WALK TO ALL THE BRAND NEW STYLISH MODERN HOTELS AND CASINOS NAMELY- ARIA HOTEL AND CASINO - beautiful, lightly smoky, buffet is fantastic breakfast $15 ( I round up everything) and lunch $20 - HUGE VARIETY! COSMOPOLITIAN - NEWEST MEMBER OF THE CITYCENTER AREA - OWNED BY MARRIOTT (AT THE MOMENT-look it up on the internet if you would like to do some research of your own) - lavish, beautifully decorated, and as already mentioned the BELLAGIO - LOVELY gardens changed every 3 months - beautiful winter decorations - all free to view and photograph. Citycenter.com hotels have easy access to main strip which can be seen by all and more visited - like PH - Planet Hollywood and Miracle Mile Shops - a mall- very convenient. Also a short walk to CAESARS AND THE FORUM SHOPS AT CAESARS HIGH END DESIGNERS LOUIS VUITTON, ARMANI, ETC. FYI - All walks have a short time where you walk outside. VDARA CONCIERGE - WELL I WILL NAME DROP - ASHLEY IS GREAT - very informative and booked great seats for us at O at Bellagio-remember AAA discount- this event did happen in August 2010. - with O bookings! EVAN LANGER - amazing too - he said he has been there since the Vdara opened and we asked him for the buffet prices at the Aria, which he gave us,and in addition, without asking, he gave us a line pass which gets you to the front of the buffet queue if there is one of course, a long line - so no waiting! The line does go pretty quick though. The reason I say do your homework is because of the following: We decided to call front desk and ask whether Haze nightclub in Aria was happening on Sunday night. WELL - ZACK SAID - Oh Yeh, it is all happening at Haze tonight and come on down and I will give you some passes to get in! We were excited! Got dressed went down a few hours later asked for Zack by name, and the other concierge staff - one was bald headed and another lady TRACY were there and they stated he should be right out and was with another customer and we waited patiently - no problem! Eventually he arrived and when we reminded him of our conversation he said it must be the one at Concierge (well we thought we were at the concierge). This meant there may be 2 ZACKS(still not sure). They all stated well the Zack that supposedly spoke to us on the phone had left but hold on everyone, maybe something could still be arranged - all of a sudden TRACY pulls out 2 passes and we just said Thank you and left - Guess what - when we got to HAZE IT WAS CLOSED - DISAPPOINTED - no biggie for us, we just went to the casino and played a little and went to bed - it was our last night- so it was fine. WE HAD A BLAST AT HAZE ON NYE WHERE WE SAW NELLY - AMAZING AND HAD GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH GUYS AND GIRLS. Haze has always been closed on a Sunday night. - the ? is whether, the Vdara concierge that was present, made a genuine mistake - therefore need to back to school or training, since this does give a bad name to all those who are good at what they do at Vdara and The Vdara corporation= this is the reason I name drop because all the rest of the Vdara staff, from being greeted at the Vdara entrance to the Vdara stay to the farewell at the Vdara exit, all staff were superb. If the concierge were playing a prank or joke or whatever you would like to call it, it is very childish behavior, could hurt their (the mentioned concierge staff) reputation as well as Vdara's, effect the guest's mood and could be very costly.

Perhaps my expectations were different to begin with. I received an email from the Vdara offering stay 3 nights get the 3rd night free. I booked it from the link in the email and received many confirmation emails from Vdara over the next several weeks (saying how much they are looking forward to my stay). I arrive and am looking for a place to park. There is no place. I park in the Aria (assuming it to be the closest and as it is in City Center, connected to Vdara...It is NOT). I arrive at the front desk and give my name. He can't find it. I hand him a paper copy of my reservation confirmation. He does not look at it. I spell my name. He finally finds it. I ask about the free night, he says yes it shows here. I ask about internet cost, he hands me the check in paper and tells me to read the paragraph about services. I get my card key and go up to the room. The room is very nice. There is a kitchen and dining area. There is nothing in the kitchen (no pots, pans, dishes, silverware, NOTHING). What good is the kitchen? What good is the dining room? There is no coffee maker or coffee, there is no robe, no slippers. There is a bed and a couch. There is an uncomfortable chair at the desk. There is a good supply of towels, but as the three days went on the maids left less and less of soap and shampoo, etc. There is nothing at the hotel. For all practical purposes, if you want to eat, drink, gamble, see people, you have to walk outside to either the Aria, or and Bellagio (there is no where you can go that you do not have to go outside to get there). Upon check out, I was not shown my bill, but the lady said your balance is $$$. I said that sounds OK (as it was what I thought my three nights less the one free night should be). She then printed the bill and put it in an envelop. I opened the envelop and looked at the bill, and saw that one night was credited. OK. I get home, and on my credit card statement is one night charged when I made the reservation. So, in fact I did NOT get the third night free. I call the Vdara, and have to FAX my paperwork (email offer, reservation, bill) to the Vdara. They then did credit my card one night. I consider myself lucky to have had the paperwork, or I am sure I would not have received my free night. I will NOT be back to Vdara.

There are two bathrooms but only one with a bathtub and shower. The main bathroom has two sinks, toilet, a tub, and a shower. However, the small bathroom has the toilet, a sink, and a empty room next to it. The bedroom was large with a comfortable king size bed and a pull out queen in the living room. The kitchen had a refrigerator with filtered water. I really liked having a washer and dryer in the room as it was very convenient to wash my clothes. The one thing I dislike the most about the room is that the windows are not tinted. I was able to see another room with the bed right in plain site. Make sure you get a room that is now directly across from the other room which would be the ones next to the elevator on the elevator side. Service was slow. We had to wait over an hour to get some extra pillows, so expect them to be slow. However, there were some times when they were pretty quick. We called housekeeping twice. The first time took over an hour where we had to leave the room. The second time took about half an hour. The last time took approximately 5-10 minutes. I would recommend calling in the early morning or late afternoon when they don't have to service any rooms. The evening is when they have the most traffic. aOverall, the Vdara is a pretty impressive hotel.

A non-gaming hotel right in the middle of the strip within walking distance of just about everywhere on the strip. I think a lot of peopel skip onthis hotel because its a non-smoking, non-gaming hotel but for families travelling with little kids, I highy recommend it. The little kitchenette with dual stove top and mini fridge are a God send. Couple of things to keep in mind: - Only valet parking available but if a short walk doesnt bother you then you can park in the self parking at Aria which is the next hotel over in the City Center. - There is a very distinct green tea/lavender odor prevalent everywhere in the lobby area. I loved it but I can see how it can be irritating to others. - Things you should call down to housekeeping for as soon as you check in to your room since these are not placed in the room: -- Robe and slippers. -- Pots and pans and glasses and cups and saucers. -- Extra bedding/pillow for the pull out couch - if you are a coffee drinker, like me, bring a coffee machine and coffee filters as none is available in the room. - if you intend to use the pots and pans everyday then bring a dishwashing detergent and scrubber with you as housekeeping takes it all back if they are left outside. What we did was to wash them everynight and then store them away in the kitchen cabinets. Saves you having to call down to have them deliver it every morning. - same deal with the extra bedding. Do not leave them out. House keeping will take it away. We folded them up every morning and then tucked them away on the top shelf in the closet. - CVS and Walgreen are a short walk away on the strip and thru the aria casino. Youc an get your necessities like milk, eggs, bread etc. Mind you they jack up the prices for the convenience. If you have a car, i suggest a short drive to safeway on flamingo road to get your grocery. The fridge is small so you cant store too much stuff in it. Keep that in mind. - Only one restaurant on the property and its a bit pricey. Bunch of them in Aria ranging from reasonable to expensive. We would have breakfast in the room made by us and then grab a quick inexpensive lunch in one of the myriad of restaurants/fast food places on the strip. We splurged on dinner a bit. It was an excellent hotel and highly recommend it. The difference in walking from a smoke filled hotel into Vdara was noticeable and very welcome. We paid 100 bucks a night for 4 nites.

It's located in the City Center and in easy walking distance to Bellagio, Aria, Cosmopolitan or Monte Carlo. The staff were extremely friendly and courteous.

Not a big deal--except we never received a call. Even after going back to the front desk--well beyond check-in time, it took the staff about 20 minutes to determine if the room was available. Other than this one glitch, the staff from the bell persons, concierge to housekeeping were extremely personable and professional. The quality of the room was outstanding. Although we didn't have a need for a kitchen space, it was nice to have a refrigerator. The room was well appointed, modern and very clean. We did have a couple of maintenance issues--a stopped-up sink and an overpowering sewage smell. Maintenance fixed the sink within 15 minutes of the call. Impressive. The sewage smell, however, was a different item. We were told they were aware of the issue and would spray our room and hall daily. Since they were aware of this issue, it would have been nice if it would have been corrected--instead of covered-up. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Vdara.

The architecture is very avante-garde, albeit with Stalinist overtones. Just not very warm, but interesting.

We stayed for three nights on a low floor and on the first morning I explained that the honking from delivery trucks coming and going from the Bellagio starting at 5:30 A.M. woke me up. \"May we move to higher floor for our last two nights?\" Blank stares all around. Oh well. Minus- we needed a toothbrush and had to walk in the rain to the Aria sister hotel to get one at the gift shop - no amenities at Vdara except an overpriced restaurant ($23 for a full bk).

We were able to get a deal where if we got one room, the second room was half off. Being relatively new, the hotel is pretty spotless.

The hotel itself doesn't really have a theme, though there are some underlying Asian imprints like the Silk Road restaurant. The rooms here are all suites, some have small differences (ie. some rooms have an extra bathroom that is seperate from the living room). The kitchen has an oven, microwave, fridge, and table; you can supposedly call for plates and cups. There is a big screen TV in both the living room and bedroom. The living room has a nice couch that can fold out to a bed. Depending on how close you are to the people you are staying with, you could probably fit 4-6 people in each suite. Bathroom was clean, large, and fully stocked. There's no casino on site, but like others have mentioned, there's a walkway (outdoors, but covered) that directly connects the hotel to Bellagio. There's also a free tram that can take you to Aria/Crystals, the City Center, and Monte Carlo. Planet Hollywood, Paris, and Cesars Palace are all within walking distance. For the most part the staff here is pretty good. It didn't seem like there was any nearby parking, so you're dependent on valet. The valet is slow; if you plan on using your car call ahead at least 30 minutes so they can get your car otherwise you'll be waiting.

I am a business owner with disposable income. Am I not the type of customer you are looking for? My concern and reason for this letter is several fold. The front desk is lacking of speed and promptness. Where is the private check in? I rented the two bedroom condo as I brought some key people that work for me. We dropped our bags and went out for a late lunch. Later that evening we returned and the room was 76 degrees. From what I could tell the room had three thermostats, one in the living room and one in each bedroom. They were all set on cool at approximately 68 degrees. We called down, voiced our concern, then left for dinner and a night on the town. We were out almost all night. We retired early morning for some rest. We were all awoken to the sound of some kind of power washer or construction. It was so bad I called down to the front desk. The noise continued so we took quick showers and left. Keep in mind I rented the two bedroom penthouse on the top floor. The showers are a joke....almost no pressure. I looked at the temp and it was still extremely hot in the room 75 degrees. Well, we ventured out again and grabbed some lunch. When we hit the hall way you could smell the fumes from whatever they were doing. We arrived back later that evening to find the room 78 degrees again. I called down and they sent up a maintenance man. He looked at the thermostat in the living room and said....\"well, it\u2019s on\u201d. He then went into the bedroom where I was and took the grill out by the bed. He messed with it for a while and said \u201cyour all set\u201d I asked him to check the other bedroom and he said \u201cit\u2019s all good\u201d Needless to say we went out on the town and had fun gambling. The cooling unit by the bed sounded like a waterfall all night. It was making noise and weird sounds. The next morning I woke up sweating....77 degrees.

The hotel lived up to our expectations. The room was spacious, clean, well-appointed (2 HDTVs), with a microwave, fridge, and spacious bathroom. Had no trouble sleeping thanks to their wonderful beds (although I'm sure exhaustion played a huge part!). No problems at check-in.

Walking outside, to the south the Aria is across the elevated traffic circle, beyond which lie Casino Royale, New York New York, Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay.

While we did not use the spa, we did use the treadmills at their fitness center. They were in excellent working order, and attendants kept the place very clean. If we ever return to Vegas, the Vdara will definitely be on our short list of places to stay. A final note for those who don\u2019t gamble: try to visit Hoover Dam and/or Red Rock Canyon, both of which are a short (45 minute) drive from the hotel (or you can take the many tours offered).

I simply wanted to let her know that I wasn't impressed with the service at the hotel and she offered me a 50.00 credit to my account. Later that eearly evening, I decided to try out the gym. I went downstairs and the gym was closed. No one at the check in desk had informed me of this and there were no signs indicating the gym would be closing early!! (By the way, the gym is VERY SMALL and can get crowded very quickly)I was ready to check out and move over to the Marriott where I was to stay for 2 additional nights but i thought, lets see if I can get a late check out. I called downstairs and I could get a late check out , but it would cost me 50.00. At that point, I was ready to leave the hotel asap. At checkout, I learned that the credit was on my account, but i had to use it for a spa or restaurant charge. No indication of this when I spoke to the manager in charge. There were only 2 people at the front desk when I arrived and then there was only 1 person, the one assisting me. The line was getting longer and the young lady mentioned she needed to get a hold of a manager. She called and of course, there was NO manager available. She had to hang up and then leave the front desk to look for one. There was about 3 minutes or so where there was NO ONE AT THE FRONT DESK. Had I been a guest checking in at that time, I would have wondered, is the hotel closed???? Nevertheless, I got the issue resolved and I was ready to check in at the Marriott Suites. Where, I was able to check in early, get free breakfast, a complimentary bottle of wine and cheese and crackers for being a Platinum member. Now folks, that's what you call service. If you simply want a great room and dont care about the service, then the Vdara is your place. However, if you expect more from a hotel, I would recommend you look somewhere else considering the service and charges you incur for every little thing.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, NY", "Title": "\u201cAn Oasis\u201d", "Author": "AesRochester_NY", "ReviewID": "UR88877123", "Content": "My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Vdara Hotel.

The lobby is quite classy. Nice d\u00e9cor, quiet, kind employees, and a couple of bars. The room is not very large for Vegas, being a 1 bdrm suite. I liked furniture and modern style, as much as the tech devices for drapes and lighting. The living room was nicely appointed, the bedroom not so large (but with a confortable bed), the bathroom was massive, nice and well lit. Shower, tub and two sinks. I didn\u2019t like the small kitchen, with a lot of wasted space there. I don\u2019t really think a dishwasher could be useful in Vegas, sure a little bit of that space could have been used for something else. Other notable situations: I\u2019ve received a parcel at the business center. They took 10$ for this kind of service. More or less, the same amount I gave to UPS to let a parcel travel from East coast to LV in 1 day\u2026 You don\u2019t have many choice to use your food credit; it could be used only at Vdara and you have a bar and a bar/restaurant.

Those girls really need an attitude adjustment. I had read some comments mentioning the same concerns on Trip Advisor and just dismissed it as a possible bad day for someone. This was not the case. Two days before we wanted to leave I had stepped up to the desk to inquire about extending out checkout to a later time, as our flight didn't leave until midnight. Now after reading several other reviews, people were getting complimentary champagne sent to their rooms for celebrating milestones and having late checkouts for the same reason I was. However, I was told that I would have to call down on the morning of the day we were leaving and find out if we could extend out stay from noon to 1pm (wow a whole hour). I was also given the option to stay until 4pm for an extra $30 if I wanted to and if we wanted to stay until 6 then it would of been half a day's rate of about $60. I figured I had already spent enough money at the hotel I wasn't throwing in another $30 to relax before we had to leave. You would have thought as well they would have taken down my information instead and used some customer service to maybe call me and advise me that morning of my options??? The morning we were leaving I called down and I was now being quoted $50 to stay until 4pm and $89 if I wanted to stay until 6pm. I said no thank you we'll leave at noon and hung up the phone. They were rude with every encounter I had with them from check in to check out. They didn't even ask us how our stay was when we went to checkout and to top it off the computer systems were down and they couldn't bring up any of our info. A smile and courtesy goes a long way, they need a huge refresher course on this! For a hotel that hardly had any guests while we were visiting I thought they would have gone a little ways to make their guests happy. I even noticed when we were checking in there were 2 sets of couples also experiencing issues with the separate girls as I could tell from where I was standing neither of them were happy.

Since we wanted to check out the City Center, loved the idea of a non-smoking hotel, and thought it would be convenient to have a kitchen, we booked the Vdara. We arrived by cab so we didn\u2019t have any problems finding the place, which is located behind Aria and connected to the back of Bellagio. Drop-off was easy and there were a lot of bell hops there to help. Inside, we took in the smell I\u2019d read about here in Trip Advisor. It fit in nicely with the modern, nature-inspired atmosphere. It didn\u2019t seem like a big deal, though. It just kind of went with the d\u00e9cor, which in my opinion was very soothing in a modern, nature-influenced way. The lobby area was small (as expected). But compared to other bustling, airport-like lobbies, the small, intimate feel of the lobby was a definite benefit and later in the trip, it really did feel like an oasis and an escape from casino noise. Speaking of casinos, there\u2019s no casino in the Vdara, but the Aria casino is a 3 minute walk out the front door and Bellagio\u2019s is about 5. Walking was pretty much a non-issue for us because we enjoy it. I don\u2019t like being too cold or hot, though, and I did appreciate that most of the walks from Vdara were inside (save for a few uncovered walkways). Our room on the 22 floor was quiet, had a sleek and modern design, and a whole half-wall of windows with a breathtaking view of the Bellagio pool, Bellagio fountains, and the mountains. The bed is super comfortable and the bathroom is large with a walk-in shower (water pressure is just okay, unfortunately) and soaking tub. The sofa is a pull-out sleeper and the little kitchen is extremely handy. We asked for pots and cups to be delivered upon arrival and they showed up 10 minutes later. Each morning, we were able to boil water and make our instant coffee, plus we had a little refrigerator to store things like milk, juice and fruit. After reading some of the reviews here, I was a little worried about the room, but it was first class all the way, despite the iron being on a cord attached to the wall. That was a little tacky and it irritated my husband, but it was a minor thing. Having a luxury room with a kitchen right in the center strip AND at a reasonable price (if you search, you can find lots of good deals for Vdara) was great.

Hotel is very good, view is the best I had in Vegas (39 floor to Bellagio fountains). Room is perfect, bed is the best. The main problem: Vdara supposed to be hotel and spa. The real spa is absent. Yes, the pool is here, but small and uninviting. In real \"hotel and spa\" there are no charges for using the spa facilities, only for extra services. We had know that the simple entrance to the spa cost $25, but I had not idea of what is inside (there are no good pictures on the website). So my wife decided just to come by and check before pay. And what? She was not even allowed to get inside! Pay first! So I went downstairs and checked the man's side (yes, there are 2 separate facilities). For a change, attendant on a man's side let me see it. What a jock! Nice finishes, a lot of lockers, but one small pool with running water, small sauna and steam room. And that's it! The rest is a private massage rooms. I really suggest the people who runs that 5-star hotel and spa to see real spa (I suggest Kempinsky Hotel in St, Moritz, and spa is free there). Some other small problems: business center is close later in the day, hotel does not have dinner facilities (it was actually a plus for me - there are many good food options in Bellagio and Aria). And last: we had a very late flight, so we asked the front desk if we could stay in the room a little bit late. Usually Hotel would allow you to stay a couple of extra hours free of charge if there are not a lot of people in the hotel. Not here - they asked me to pay an extra $149 for up to 5 hours (from 1pm to 6pm) and that was more then daily rate I paid for the room. I refused. Also, the resort fee I paid at check-out supposed to be tax-free (according to Orbitz, where I booked the hotel), but I was charged a 12% tax on that fee anyway. i did show the reservation letter from Orbitz, but it did not help.

This package included all resort fees so no $15 per day charge on our account. On arrival our booking request for a high floor was honoured with a room on the 51st floor with views of the Bellagio fountains and to the Rio / Palm hotels with mountains behind. No check in queues (lines) seen at any time in our stay, and we checked out through the in room TV facility. The staff were all friendly and the concierge knowledgeable and helpful. We had the smallest Delux Suite at some 580 sq ft but this was more than adequate with two 42 inch TVs a good size bathroom with separate shower and small kitchenette. Agree with previous reviewers that the plug in the bath is badly positioned as it has a knob on it to lift for drainage which could be painful if you relax too much! There is a separate shower head attachment for rinsing hair. Water pressure for filling the bath was good it filled in a few minutes with steaming hot water. The shower pressure was lower but still good, but not to power shower ratings. Good supply of Aveda products except foam bath - shampoo did the job! The kitchen equipment was delivered upon request the first night along with bathrobes and slippers. There are now cards in the room reminding guests that these are available on request as well as advice on requesting bed linen and towel changes - daily if you wish. Take a travel kettle and your own coffee and tea. Supermarkets nearby provided milk, cereal, bread, butter, fruit juice, eggs etc to make our own breakfast. We used ABC and Walgreens. Housekeeping took away the dirty pans, dishes and cutlery and replaced with clean each day. The fridge is small but held two one litre bottles of water along with the provisions above simply by taking out one glass shelf. Housekeeping provided at least two small bottles of water each day and we picked up more at the health club on a few ocassions. Lighting, blinds and housekeeping controls are not difficult, however we agree that some of the switch positioning could have been better thought through. The hotel works well if you consider it as a \"tower\" of either the Bellagio or the Aria without the noise, smoke and number of people. Both these hotels offer excellent facilities including buffets and other restaurants within 5 to 10 minutes of your room. There are multiple ways to walk to the Strip depending on which direction you wish to go, through Bellagio, or via the tram at Bellagio to Monte Carlo, through the Aria / Crystals, or now simply out through the main entrance and turn left down stairs onto Harmon Ave . We didn't use the health club, pool used twice - slightly longer opening hours would be good - 9am to 6pm probably of little use to business guests. We didn't eat or drink in the hotel either. We spent our vacation walking everywhere to shows and viewing the hotels up and down the Strip and used the Deuce buses for Fremont Street and Outlet Shopping mall.

The hotel's biggest drawback for us was its location. Although only two blocks off the Strip, it seems further. Driving there requires following a confusing, circular drive that it shares with its sister properties nearby. Walking there from the Strip is difficult right now, depending on your desired direction, as there is major sidewalk construction that requires long detours. There is an indoor connection to the Bellagio, which is nice, but very long, which again accentuates the feeling of remoteness. I suppose this could also be viewed as a positive, as you completely get away from the noise and craziness of the Strip, and there is no loud, smoky casino to deal with. The hotel has inexplicably removed coffee makers from the rooms - they are available by request. Despite having a kitchenette, no utensils were provided - you had to request them too. We requested neither, as our stay was quite short, but we wondered why they weren't available - we stayed at the Trump a few days earlier and every possible amenity was provided. Our room also had a serious hot water problem - you had to leave the shower on five minutes or more before getting in. We hated wasting water since it is so precious out here. But the hotel has many, many positives, starting with the enthusiastic valet and desk staff that greeted us. We were accommodated on the 24th floor with killer views of the Strip and, in particular, the Bellagio Fountains next door. Everything was new and very clean. The elevators were ample and fast. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, the Silk Road. Although it was tasty, portions were small and fairly expensive for the amount received. The remote control drapes were a nice touch and did a good job of shutting out the glare from the Strip. We would stay at the Vdara again, and would recommend it to others, depending on what type of Vegas experience they were looking for. Note that the Vdara, like many other Vegas hotels, charges a daily resort fee. Valet service for your rental car and high speed internet are included in the fee.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWow!

The concierge desk was very helpful and knowledgeable and the hotel's gym is good too. The casinos in the Aria and the Bellagio are only 1 minute's walk from the Vdara so you are still able to easily access the usual Vegas activities but also have the benefit of being able to get away from the gambling scene when you want to at this peaceful hotel. When in Vegas we can also recommend - the Lemon Tree Thai restaurant (in the Aria), the Atomic Testing Museum, the vintage car museum (in the Imperial), the Porsche Design shop (in Crystals) - lovely friendly staff, the Hard Rock Cafe on the strip (which displays Paul Stanley's Gibson Moderne!!!!) and Cabo Wabo (Sammy Hagar's bar on the strip).", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longmont", "Title": "\u201cDefinately one of the nicest rooms yet.\u201d", "Author": "danandchenae", "ReviewID": "UR84983777", "Content": "I booked a suite at the Vdara for my anniversary, and I really had no idea what to expect.

It was in a great location, with a connecting walkway to the Bellagio for shopping, the buffet and the fountains. It is across the street from the Aria and shopping at City Center, where you can find gambling if you want to. We also chose the Vdara because the price was very reasonable and they offered a $50 resort credit, which could be used at the spa, pool, bar, you name it. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had booked, on the 19th floor, upon checking in. We stayed through the week, Tuesday-Friday morning, so I think that helped us on a room upgrade and the price. The room was amazing. 260 degree views! It was like a condo, complete kitchen, two bathrooms, plush linens, a huge soaking tub looking out over the pool area, a gigantic shower with a bench and huge glass door. Everything was very spa-like, contemporary and trendy feeling. The bed was comfortable. They had automatic blinds and blackouts, so it got very dark when you were ready to sleep. The spa experience is not to be missed. If you don't take advantage of their beautiful spa while here you are missing out! We had facials and they were GREAT, but just the spa amenities alone would've been enjoyable. A huge jacuzzi, steamroom and dry sauna, heated lounge chairs, cozy robes. Teas, snacks and anything you need to get ready when you're done, even a hair straightener ladies! They don't have much for dining, which is really the only downside, however, we had so many places we wanted to try around the strip that we hadn't really planned to eat here anyway. We did get breakfast at the Vdara one morning. The french toast was very good, but the menu is small. The pool is small, but lovely. Lots of nice chairs and large towels. A large jacuzzi poolside as well. The smell was divine. I kept smelling the same thing every time we came in the doors and I had to ask what it was. They said they pump a signature scent of fig throughout the lobby area. I wish I could've bottled it. The staff told me every hotel has their own signature scent, and sure enough, you could tell... At the Aria across the street it smelled like some kind of vanilla scented something. It doesn't pump up to the floors or rooms, just the lobby, but I wish it was throughout. I could see that some people might be sensitive to the smells the hotels pump out, but it beats cigarette smoke! The concierge staff was superb and very helpful. They treated us like VIP's and met every need, request and question promptly. There were long delays a few nights to get through by phone, however. The cleaning staff were so attentive. They come late morning and early evening. Twice a day! I really loved the bath salts left by the tub and asked for more each time they came.

Room # 16-032 This was my 4th trip to Las Vegas and the first with my wife. We were also travelling with Vegas first timer friends. The Vdara met all of our expectations and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. Let me begin by saying that we chose this hotel for 2 reasons: it was smoke-free and had kitchen facilities. The check-in process was quick and efficient (no more than 10 minutes from entering the door and getting to our room - we arrived at 2:00 PM). The front desk clerk asked us immediately if we needed any dishes, etc and they were delivered within 1/2 hour. The rooms were more than adequate in terms of cleanliness, size and decor. It was just such a welcoming and relaxing place to come home to after a long Vegas day walking the Strip. I have to agree with all the previous reviews that state this was the most comfortable bed they've ever slept in in a hotel. Both the bed, linens and pillows are fantastic. It beat our bed at home no problem!! We were about mid-way up and had a view of the Rio and Palms as well as a blocked view of the mountains. And yes, the window shades and curtain are electronic and cool to play with! We were in Vegas for both fun and relaxation, so we used the pool facilities two full days. We rented a cabana for both days, and were treated like royalty. True it may be a little expensive to rent, but we practically had the entire cabana area to ourselves, including a plunge pool to ourselves. I would absolutely like to point out the excellent service we received from Katie the cabana hostess - she was absolutely amazing and really made the cabana rental worthwhile - in fact she's the reason we decided to rent the second time. We were out in the sun all day, and it was not unreasonably hot. We ordered room service numerous times during the trip (both in-room and at the pool cabana) and the service was always quick (within 1/2 hour) and professional. The in-room service even had the kitchen table all set for a romantic meal (even though it was just burger and fries!). There were only two minor issues during our stay - 1) Telephone in the room was not working for outbound calls - took a few days to fix and 2) They take away dirty dishes but do not replace them. Very minor issues that would not prevent us from staying there again. The location is somewhat away from the strip, but it's not an interminable walk, and Bellagio and Aria are minutes away.

I checked in at 11AM, and A.J. gave me a complimentary upgrade to a Lake View room. Staff was very accommodating. My room was clean, spacious, and very tranquil. There was only one night I was awoken by drunk people in the hallway, but other than that, I didn't hear any of my neighbors. Housekeeping gave me 2 free water bottles every day, so long as I hit the \"housekeeping\" button on my way out the door.

Although the kitchen was very nice, it is not provided with any kitchenware but this was made available upon request. It seemed that whilst every suite has a kitchen, the hotel management was trying to persuade you not to use it but to use their restaurant instead.

The room was very clean, unlike our friends who had a shower floor that was quite dirty. They requested it be cleaned several times, but nothing was done. It also took two days of complaining to get someone to plug in one of the TV's (inaccessible plug) and repair a reading lamp. The bedding was very luxurious and comfortable. There are two large screen HD TV's on either side of the room divider. A desk with wi-fi hookup is available at no extra charge. Of course there is a $15.00 daily service charge which is also taxed. The bath is large and well equiped with plenty of plush towels, and notions. There is a kitchen area with a microwave/convection oven, two burner stove and small refrigerator and sink. BUT, there are no dishes or tableware, evidently they are available upon request. The biggest disappointment was no coffeepot. If I stayed there again, I would bring one, or buy one and throw it away when done. It would be much cheaper and more convenient than paying the $3.50 per small cup of coffee in the coffee shop. The coffee shop and small restaurant closes at 2pm. I went to the business center to print out our boarding passes and the pleasant lady at the counter volunteered to do it for me. This was accomplished in only a few minutes. The Vdara is connected to the Bellagio by a short walkway. Access to the tram is very convenient. The hotel is quiet, since there is no casino, and totally smoke free. Overall, it was a very nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cExactly what we wanted\u201d", "Author": "Iamirish", "ReviewID": "UR83908018", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at the Vdara.

They have no stancions, so you just make up your own line and stand there. Then one of the front desk agents comes out from her cave when the line gets pretty deep and guides you to stand in a certain line waiting for an open agent.

Hardly enough room for 2 persons to place all of their toiletries down.

No entertainment during the 5 days we were there. Sad, dead and no reason to drink at the bar. -Smelly Lobby - I did not like the scent. Much too perfumy.... a clean scent would have been nicer.

I had a conference on the South End of the strip during our stay. We tried to find a five start hotel that was within walking distance to the conference when booking. We were attracted to the non-gaming, non-smoking Vdara as I can't stand the smell of smoke-filled casinos. The hotel itself is very nice with many positives. It is easy to get to the strip from the covered walkway over to the Bellagio. (If you think it's too far as others have written... you must never walk anywhere) The rooms were modern, new, clean and the bed is great. It was smaller than I pictured however from the website. We were on the 30th floor with a view of the pool and mountains. I think that all 5 star hotels should have a double sink as a basic standard. Our room did not. The soaking tub was nice and fit both my husband and I with ease. Plenty of aveda products too. The gym was also nice and well-equipped. The kichen is pointless in my opinion (other than having a fridge)... It is evident that VDara was clearly designed as a condo initially then converted to a hotel when the market crashed and the developer knew the units wouldn't sell. We knew not to expect any kitchen supplies from previous reviews (we didn't intend to cook anyhow), but there wasn't even a coffee maker. After calling to request one we were told this wasn't possible (really?....ugh) When you have a hangover, nobody wants to go all the way to the restuarant in the lobby and pay for a cup. We did go down to the pool a few days. My husband and I travel often and have stayed at many resorts with amazing pools. If the pool is important to you, don't stay here. The pool is a very sterile atmosphere with absolutely no shade or greenery. We planned to book a cabana but after seeing them are glad we didn't. VERY basic with uncomfortable looking futon couches. We enjoyed many cocktails by the pool and the waitresses were all great (can't say the same for the arrogant guy at the bar who told us rather rudely at 4:30PM that they were no longer serving food). The food coming out did look good though/ wish we had ordered something earlier. Beware of the wind at the pool. We were almost decapitated by the umbrella that fell down on top of us as were several other hotel guests... It was about 80 and sunny so perfect pool weather. Not hot enough to experience the \"Vdara Death Ray\". We did a TON of stuff while in Vegas, shows, shops, restaurants etc.. and all in all found Vdara to be a great place to come back to at the end of a long day/night. It was quiet and just what we needed. The bed was wonderful. If we were to return however, I would stay at another hotel; a true five star ie/ Encore of the Wynn. Recommendations to the hotel For IMPROVEMENTS: * Put coffee makers in ALL rooms (this is standard in even 3 star hotels). * Add some landscaping/ greenery to the pool/ make it more Vegas and inviting *Invest in umbrellas that are up all the time (instead of having to request the pool staff to put one up for you) and are sturdy enough to not fall on top of guests.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cVegas has better to offer\u201d", "Author": "shrop", "ReviewID": "UR83460236", "Content": "There's a lot said about this new hotel so these are my personal opinions having prevoiously stayed in numerous other resorts in Vegas over the years. True this is a hotel without a casino, it's also non smoking and slightly away from the strip but easy walking distance (I can't believe anyone can say otherwise) through Bellagio or City Center. It's also true that the valet service is excellent and the smell in the lobby is nice. So the not so good, this is a new hotel, however, there are already signs of wear in some places, both public places and within rooms, this hotel won't wear well at all unless it's maintained better than it is being. Rooms are not as good as the photographs portray, they look larger than they really are. Many things in our room weren't working, particularly the lighting with at least 4 not working correctly. What's the point of the kitchen without any utensils, at least cups and a coffee maker would go some way (you get that at the Signature) to making use of the kitchen, otherwise this is a totally wasted space. Bathroom is slightly odd by newer Vegas standards, hard to say why but you will know what I mean if you have been to many Vegas resorts how good the bathrooms usually are. Service is not brilliant, check in was OK but I had to return and then waited sometime even though it wasn't busy. We didn't eat in the restaurant, preferring to use the facilities of both Aria and other restaurants but to me it looked very clinical and unwelcoming. We only looked at the pool area as it was over 100 degrees every day it was too hot to sit out, especially with it's position and no shade but it also looked very small and cramped. So in all there are better places in Vegas, much better to be honest, it's good to try new properties but I'm glad we only stayed for 2 days before moving to a true 5 star Vegas resort at the Encore.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hillsboro, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel overall, but it had a couple downfalls\u201d", "Author": "littleles412", "ReviewID": "UR83457484", "Content": "This hotel is a beautiful hotel but it had a couple things that keep me from saying its perfect. It is very clean, the staff is very friendly, and the bed is the most awesome thing I have ever slept on. It's also nice and quiet because it's back from the strip and no casino. Cleanliness is the most important thing in our book and it definately got 5 stars there. It's location really isn't bad but they are currently doing construction on the quickest route out to the strip so for us it was a little longer. We were on the fence about the valet parking, it's nice to have someone get your car and bring it back but every other hotel has free self parking so it was a little annoying to have to essentially pay to park in tipping...but we would also probably never drive in Vegas again...They also have free wi-fi and we used it a ton! Now the downfalls, 1. The kitchen is a joke, the fridge is not even the size of half of a standard mini fridge! We made a point to say we wanted kitchen \"stuff\" upon arrival, because other reviewers said you had to ask, they brought up 2 bowls, 2 plates, and 2 napkins with a fork, spoon and knife...thats your kitchen stuff!? So much for being a usuable kitchen! 2. No coffeepot, and can't get one, we asked... but you can get really expensive coffee by room service of course. 3. You can't take your own drinks to the pool, now this might be standard in Vegas, I'm really not sure, but come on, I can walk down the street with my drink!

The aroma in the lobby was just as welcoming and calming as it was the first time and the staff was as friendly and helpful as we remembered. We requested a high floor with a view of Aria and our wish was granted. The only thing I'm extremely disappointed in is that the amenities (robes, slippers, coffee maker, bathroom scale) have been removed and I'm sure it's because the patrons steal them and the hotel had no other choice but to remove them and provide them on request. The only thing I called for was a ladies robe and it was to my room within 5 minutes. Can't wait until there's a retail outlet for those, I will purchase one! And the pillows, I would spend a nice chunk of change on those. The hotel was much busier than it was last time we visited; word must have gotten out! We STILL never waited for and rarely shared an elevator or heard a sound out of any other patrons on our 35th floor hallway. My goal for this trip was to at least see everything at the hotel so I could level an opinion about it; still managed to miss Bar Vdara and the spa :( We had breakfast on Columbus Day at Silk Road and it was divine. I had the waffles and a latte and it was pure heaven. After being used to burnt Starbucks coffee, the latte was the best I've ever had; the barista knows how to make a GREAT latte! The waffles were incredible, with fresh blueberries, blackberries and strawberries and a fantastic lemon curd with the lightest, sweetest whipped cream I've ever had. The sweetness of the syrup and whipped cream was perfectly complimented by the tartness of the fresh fruit and lemon curd. My husband had the cripsy french toast and it was divine as well. The atmosphere is relaxing and the chairs were comfortable. We had a view of the canoe sculpture and pedestrians walking by the window we were seated near. The service was prompt and the wait staff was friendly. It was more than we usually pay for Krispy Kremes, but for me, it was worth every dime! The pool area is extremely lovely. We didn't spend much time out there, but in the few minutes we did walk around, we experienced no wind or sun vortexes. There are lots of chairs and cabanas, but it did appear that umbrellas were going to go fast because they're in short supply. We weren't on the deck to see the Death Ray, but we did see it from the room. I couldn't get a good picture of it, but you could see where it was on October 12 at 11:45am because of the lack of shadows in areas that should have been in shadow. Clearly, the sun was reflecting off of the building and I can see how it would be bad if a sunbather drifted off for a nap and ended up in it's path, caught unawares. A few things about City Center; FANTASTIC design. We could have very happily never left the property in the 60-some odd hours we were there. Everything you could possibly want was within a 15 minute walk, at the longest. Bars, restaurants, gift shop at Aria, night clubs, shopping, pools, entertainment, casino, it's all right there. It's extremely easy to navigate and just beautiful to walk through. Crystals was busier than it was during our previous trip, and I don't think it's because they opened just a few more stores. I think it's because people are finally starting to discover the entire City Center property. We did walk into the lobby of the Mandarin Oriental, but we didn't venture up to the 28th floor because we weren't sure how to go about doing that since we weren't guests and the bellmen/doormen were all occupied with paying customers so we walked back out. The Veer Towers are open for residential sales, but we didn't go in because we didn't want to waste someone's time giving us a pitch we couldn't afford to buy. The Harmon is slated for opening late this year, but we couldn't tell just how close that opening will be because you can't get close enough to any of the windows to really see anything. I have to say that I still find the Cosmopolitan kind of obnoxious. Since this hotel/property isn't open yet, I can't give an opinion of it other than that it's annoyingly in the way, blocking views of City Center from all vantage points north of the property. Overall, October is a MUCH nicer time to visit Vegas than June, and not just because of the cooler weather. A different class of people travel in the fall; we did not miss the roving groups of drunken college kids who usually show up in the summer. We were there on 10-10-10 and saw DOZENS of brides, something that didn't occur to me would be happening until the date finally dawned on me. I realize that the Vdara isn't the type of hotel everyone will enjoy. It caters to a different class of Vegas travelers. You're not likely to find a hot party scene there because most college kids can't afford the room prices. High rollers and people who go strictly to gamble aren't going to flock there either. But if you're a casual Vegas visitor who goes for the sites and the shows and the people watching, Vdara is for you. It's a calm, quiet oasis admidst the craziness of what Las Vegas is. If I approved of kids in Vegas, which I don't, Vdara would be a good hotel to take your family to because of the non-gaming, non-smoking environment.

After lugging our bags to the door, we swiped our cards to realise that they would not let us in, after flying in from Toronto, Canada the last thing I wanted to do was to go back to front desk and ask for them to be reloaded. But holding my patience I did so. My partner stayed with our bags on the 46th floor while I made the dash down stairs, told front desk (a new girl) what had happened she reloaded some new cards and said \"If these don't work then come back and I'll have to get security to let you in\" (which for starters is not an ideal situation, would I have to be let in by security every single time???). Came back to the room swiped the card \"Presto\" the door unlocked upon first coming into the room we where amazed at the view from the room, and then we where even more amazed by the view of two naked people in our room!!! YES NAKED PEOPLE IN OUR ROOM!!!!!! They, just as shocked as us, leaped up and began yelling \"who the hell are you\" so terrified we backed out of the room trying to explain there was a mix up. Chased down the hallway leaving our bags behind, when everything was cleared and still shaking like crazy hearts pounding we took our bags and went back to the front counter, the same girl at front desk responded with \"your cards still arn't working?\" with a puzzled look, I replied with \"oh no they work but the problem is you gave us a room that already has people in it!!!\" I explained what had occured, she seemed shocked and did apologise. She called management who then advised her to give us another room, this one on the 22nd floor, and said it was a premium upgrade to a lake view (strange though because we had already booked that upgrade), and then gave us a $50 credit to use towards the Vdara hotel spa or restaurant etc. Did I feel compensated? No not really. My biggest concern was if I could open someone elses door with my card, then could it also be that any other random stranger checking in could also swipe their card and get into mine? Got to the new room \"No naked people\" (boy where we cautious). The room itself was clean, great view. Things missing : coffee machine, cutlery, robes and slippers, conditioner. I called the front desk asking for our robes and some cutlery was told they would be up, then was told there was no coffee machine included in our package yet the internet says that it is included in our package? Now have been at hotel for under 30 minutes and I am not impressed with how they have handled this especially taking into account what has already gone on. Cutlery never arrived (oh pardon me it did arrive 5 days later, yes 5 days later someone showed up with two forks wrapped in a white napkin), our robes arrived after another 3 calls to front desk, and on first day our kitchen breaker cut out and we had no light in kitchen dining area, called that in someone came straight away, but then the two bulbs hanging above the dining table did not work that took about 3 days also and a few calls to replace. I never once got any turn down service over the 6 days but was paying for it in my $15 mandatory fee per day. Newspapers are not delivered to door you have to get them from front desk every morning, and you have to be quick as they go fast, somedays I missed out and had gone to check at 10am ish. On the 6th day, I asked 3 times to have the queen sofa bed made up, once at 9am, again at 7pm that night and after returning from dinner at 10pm nothing was done, it took me letting out some steam (which I hate to do) for someone to be there straight away. I even said just leave the linens and I'll make it up, couldn't even get that right. I was not impressed with little things like that, which other hotels will snap at. The facility itself was however very modern, and gym was great, nice selection of Cybex equipment top of the range. Silk Road was so so. Nothing to rave about. I don't think I'll ever go back to Vegas for a pleasure stay again, and if I do on business I hope that it is at the Aria or elswhere.

My wife and I stayed 5 nts at the end of Sept. I was very satisfied with our stay here and will break it down based on our above rating. Rooms: We were upgraded to the 51st floor overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. Amazing view would be an understatment. The room is big, about 500-600sq ft. The kitchen has alot of cabinet space but not utinsels. I was told to just ask and they deliver what you need. We used this area as storage for \"beverages.\" Two small refrigerators are here too but only one is empty. The other is for the overpriced goodies all hotels offer. The bathroom is larger than most and has a drawer by the sink with the hairdryer in it. There is a closet that looks like it was to be a linen closet just inside also. The main room is separated by a small partition that has dual plasma tv's on each side. There are more storage drawers here. You will have ample space to store all your stuff. The safe is in the closet. I had a bit if a problem getting used to the two types of window shades that are electronically raised or lowered. You will figure it out but the switch takes a bit to get used to. The bed was very comfortable. Rooms and sleep quality 5 star. Cleanliness: I am a clean freak. I bring Lysol wipes and usually wipe things down but this time I found no need. I never saw any stains on bedding or carpet and the bathroom was spotless. Not even water spots. Service: Checkin was quick and they were very helpful. Front Desk 5 star. Valet was never more than a couple minute wait for our car. They were very polite and always asked if we needed directions anywhere. There is complimentary cold water bottles here too. Valet 5 star. My only reason to not give a 5 star rating overall was housekeeping. Perhaps I expect a bit much but the rooms have a light you can activate when you want your room made up. We left every morning before 8, activated the light and our room was not made up until late afternoon. This wouldn't be a big issue but we would come back around 2-3 and then have the maid wanting in. For her credit, they did a great job cleaing and keeping the toiletries filled so I would still give them 4 1/2 stars. We had a problem with our bill on the last day. Someone had charged over 1300 bucks to our room for spa, food and beverages that we never signed for. The front desk took the charges off w/o a problem. Location: Here is the only issue I see. Some have insinuated that its a short walk to the strip. It really isn't. You have to go through Bellagio, take the tram to Monte Carlo or navigate your way through Aria and City center to get to the strip. Its a 5-10 min. walk if you are a fast walker. My other issue was driving into Vdara. You have to know which ramp to take and then how to find the Valet area. It is not well marked. I used google earth and looked at the satelight view along with going on you tube and watching video of people arriving. I was warned about this so I was prepared. We always came in off of Harmon from the west instead of from the strip. It was alot easier. I think they could have done a better job of designing the entrance but its too late now. They should at least put in more signage. Value: This is real subjective. For 100-150 nt. I can't see how people could expect more unless they have unrealistic expectations. The pool is another issue. I didn't go to the pool but my wife did. If you had any compalints they were letting you go over the the Aria pool which is amazing. Again, this to me is good customer service. I didn't think the 15 a day resort fee is so bad either, the wi fi worked great and it was nice having the bottled water each day. You also get your choice of newspapers too if you ask.

Everything about the hotel was beautiful, very modern, European-flavor decor. All the rooms are \"suites,\" in that the sleeping area is divided from the living area by a large wooden unit in the middle of the room that houses a flat-screen TV on both sides. There is a small kitchen/dining area with micro/convection oven, two burner stove, mini-fridge, sink and dining table w/2 chairs. There is also a fully-stocked mini bar - more on that in a minute. What is missing in the kitchen is everything else, and I mean everything. You can request dishes, etc., from housekeeping, but the only thing that is automatically provided are two drinking glasses and two wine glasses, not even a napkin or spoon. Having just moved over to the Vdara from a regular condo with a fully stocked kitchen (where we stayed the previous nights of our vacation), it just seemed a little odd. Guess it cuts way down on buying dishes, though, so I understand that. We were on the 30th floor, about half-way up and the view was beyond beautiful! Every room has one whole wall of windows. The shades are raised/lowered by a wall switch. Central heat/air, so no bulky wall unit. Nice lit closet with wall safe. Bathroom was LOVELY. One big plus, the shower came out of the wall about 7 ft. up, so my tall husband didn't even have to duck to wash his hair. Water pressure was a little weak, but tolerable. Separate glass-enclosed shower, tub, huge vanity. Bed was plenty comfy, lots of drawers to unpack in. Lots of tech inputs, which is needed for us, including ipod input into TV, both wired and wi-fi internet (free), 2-line phone, lots of elec. outlets, etc. Now for the \"bring money\" part - this is a full-service hotel, which is great if you just want to pay/tip people to do everything for you. If you're a do-it-myself person, not so much. The bellman WILL bring your luggage to your room (not an option) and there is no self-parking garage right there at the hotel, it's all valet, although it is labeled as complementary (included in the resort fees), still you're expected to tip. Don't misunderstand, we know the value of tipping and we're generous tippers, but it just seemed like every time we turned around there was someone else to tip. And there is a $15 per night resort fee charged on top of the room rate. I'm not sure what distinguishes it as a resort, didn't notice anything extra. However, I really did appreciate the fact that it did not have a casino, so it was quiet and peaceful (also non-smoking). And finally, beware the mini-bar...it has pressure sensitive tabs in it, so if you take something out and don't put it back immediately, you are automatically charged for it. And the only place this is stated is it's printed inside the mini-bar fridge door (behind the $12 cashews and $7 M & M's). I had picked up several things to look at them before I saw the notification. When I told the front desk clerk, he smiled and said it happens all the time, and it usually takes about 30 seconds before the charges kick in. <whew!> By the way, the front desk personnel were all very professional, but extremely friendly. Summary: gorgeous accommodations, but it will cost you. Will we stay here again? Hmmm, probably not, but that's just us. It was fun once, though, and if you're considering the Vdara, I'd say \"go for it!\"", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "TravelDiva2000", "ReviewID": "UR82618200", "Content": "My Husband and I visited the Vdara September 28 - Oct 1 2010 for our anniversary. I must say I was a little nervous after reading the negative reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised. The Vdara is a wonderfully relaxing hotel among the drama and chaos that is Vegas. You walk in and are greated with a sense of peace along with a fragrance that is pleasant to the senses - especially after walking through the smoke filled casinos. We requested the kitchen utensils at check and within 20 mins they were delivered to our suite along with our robes. Because it was our anniversary we were given a room on the 32nd floor with a view of the Bellagio Fountains and the Strip. The room is truly a treat. The wall of windows is spectacular and having the ability to black them out is great, when you are trying to get that afternoon nap. We had only one little hic-cup that was swiftly taken care of. We left our room late in the afternoon on 1 day and requested the room be clean. That morning we had had room service bring breakfast. When we returned that night, they had cleaned the room - somewhat- they left some of the breakfast dishes and for some reason made up the sofa bed( this was not requested). When my Husband called down and spoke with Brittany she said it would be handled. After 15 mins they had not come up..he called a 2nd time..this time Brittany apologized and offered to waive the $15 a day resort fee---we didn't even have to ask for an accomendation..they volunteered. And housekeeping was ringing our doorbell within 5 mins of that 2nd call. I didn't like that the pool closed so early..it would have been nice to take a night dip in the jacuzzi. As for getting to the strip...people need to stop complaining. There is a tram that takes you to the hotels within the City Center, which all sit on the strip, or you can take an 8 min walk over the bridge that connects you to the Bellagio. I would definitely say, for anyone looking to go to Vegas to relax and enjoy the sites, but don't want all the chaos of a hotel with nightclubs and casinos--the Vdara is the place.

We called down to the front desk and they had it cleaned immediately. - We found the scent in the lobby a little irritating, like cheap perfume or something. That was all the negatives, now i will talk about our stay. We arrived and valeted. It was fast and efficent. However this was our only encounter with the valet as we self parked in the bellagio for the remainder of our stay. This was maybe a 5 min walk tops from car to hotel room. Checkin was fast, however we did have to wait, but once they noticed people waiting they brought more staff out. Our room was the one with the divider in it and we felt it was very large for a hotel room. We used the bathtub every night after the strip and it was fantastic. The shower also have very good pressure. The workout facility was excellent as well. With little waters and towels beside each machine. There was a good variety of equipment with free weights and ellipitcal machines just to name a few. We did not have breakfast at the hotel due to price, but we did go over to the aria for the buffet and we would definitely recommend it there. There was also little waters at the valet if you would like some water while on the strip. There is a small store just outside the vdara in the bellagio if you need to pick up any necessaries.

The bed itself is probably the most comfortable be i have ever slept in, so plush and cozy. Even the pillows were amazing. Every window has a remote controlled shade and a \"blackout\" shade. If you want it pitch black you got it! The bathroom was gorgeous with a full size tub, seperate shower, double sinks, closet, and vanity desk, with chair and mirror. They supply Aveda skin care products which were amazing. The hotel itself is tucked in from the strip but you can cut through Aria which is a hop skip and a jump away or connect throgh Bellagio which is what we did when we wanted to head north up the strip. When we travelled south to Mandalay Bay one day we took the \"Bellagio\" tram stop and took it to Monte Carlo stop, then crossed the street and got on the tram at Excaliber to Mandalay Bay, we saved tons of walking. We did not try the restaurant in Vdara but did try the buffet in Aria (amazing) and the restaurant in Aria near the casino on the main floor (also delicous). We loved the fact that Vdara is a smaller hotel because it doesnt take you 20 mins to walk throught the hotel to get to the elevators, the hotel was always quiet and relaxing. There was no smoking and noise of the casinos which was really nice. The fitness centre located on the 2nd floor was very nice. The had 7 treadmills, 5 olypticals, 2 stationary bikes, free weights, and machines. They supplies, bottle water, towels, cold wet towel to freshen up with, and ear phones to plug into their treadmills. The treadmills also had an ipod docking station to charge. The pool was very nice as well, its located on the third floor and offers appetizers, and fresh blended drinks for sale. All in all we loved our trip and I cant really say anything negative. We had a great experience and will def. be back!", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cHow good is the City Center complex?\u201d", "Author": "slieder", "ReviewID": "UR81267171", "Content": "Pretty Good!

The suite wasn't that big compared to other suites in the same price range but acceptable and furnished in a modern style. I could not check-in before 4pm. The was a long queue at the check-in desk so you can expect some waiting time. Just as some of the reviews stated, if you would like to cook or eat, you have to ask for silverware when you check-in. Different to other suites in the same hotel, the two story suite has a coffee machine in the room. There is a mini bar as well as a large Fridge. The Safe is to small in my opinion, you can't store a large number of stuff in there e.g Notebook and it is mounted upright flat to the wall so you cannot stack things but have to put everything upright. The Safe was closed and I had to call Security to have it opened. It took two attempts to have actually someone fixing the problem but I did get voucher because of the extended waiting time, which was nice. There is Internet in the room but you will be charged automatically not matter if you use it or not. There are not many drawers or closets so if you have lots of clothing or travel with family, you run out of space quickly. Also the single closet is in the bathroom upstairs. You have a washing machine and a dryer in the room which is nice, in case you need it. The panoramic room view is toward the airport and the center of the City Center Complex including Aria or Mandrin. The bathroom is towards Bellagio but although if the view are really nice, when you sit on the couch or in the bath tub you can't really see a lot only if you stand up. The rooms with direction to the Bellagio might offer a better view but after all it was still very nice. The room was not that clean but clean enough when I arrived but the next day everything was fine. If you can afford you should have Breakfast in the room once .. really nice treat! TV was ok too I have not watched lot but the music selection is a little limited but I suppose everyone will still find some acceptable tunes. All in all the room and view was very good and so the staff. It is however, more on the pricy side compared to similar suites in Vegas There is not much going on in the Vdara but within about 5 minutes walking distance you are right in the Aria or Mandrin and about the same to the Bellagio. There is also a train connecting some of the hotels in the Business Center complex. The Strip is about 10-15 minutes walking distance either via Aria or Bellagio.

This was the second stay here. This time for 8 days, 7 nights. Even the cheapest room is delightfully accommodating. I still can't believe how nice the place & people are! The awesome coffee makers were missing this time, this is too bad, a health dpt issue I heard. Since there is a kitchen we just bought the Starbucks instant stuff (pretty good) and 2 souvenir mugs, this worked out fine all week. The in-room coffee service is great too but I'm cheap & don't want to wait for coffee. This time I got one of the rooms with the 2 TV divider between the sleeping area & the living area. Both floor plans were ok for me but people who like a little more privacy or are traveling with family or friends would love the divided suite. Great view this side of building too. Best view I think I've ever had in Vegas, maybe EVER any hotel. I think maybe there are only good views here! If you get a lower room you see the pool, the people or the art scattered about. Higher rooms stunning views of Vegas and the Space-Age architectural designs of the City Center. I watched the Bellagio fountains from my room. If it wasn't Vegas I would have spent a lot of time in that room! Bedding & linens & sundries ultra superior. Aveda products for free! Bed and pillows just right. Way plenty of towels, bathroom quite large. I could even soak in the tub and watch TV with this room design! The Vdara & City Center design astound me. How can they have a good view in every room? Have easy walks to everything I want? Pool, Spa, everything! Both the Aria & Vdara spa good, used them both. Couples will like the Aria's co-ed sky-hot-tub a LOT! The staff activities seem well thought out in advance of my arrival too. They were ready for every request before I made it. For example I found some nice flowers touring the city & called the Vdara to see if they had vases. They were in my room before I got there. (They also carefully got permission to enter the room to do so, totally respecting and protecting my privacy & security. I like that.) Ate twice in the lobby restaurant. Their signature \"eggs eggs eggs\" dish was awesome, also had a seafood tapa appetizer which was really good. I did think on a couple of occasions I would drop in again because I was hungry but found they were closed. I think people who live in Vegas forget how we tourists loose track of time, maybe they'll keep it open later, or maybe they're embarrassed by that gold wallpaper.

The tram system connecting the hotel to the Monte Carlo/Aria/Bellagio was also very efficient which we used lots of times. The hotel itself is quiet, since it is not a gaming hotel. We had no problems with noise at any time so enjoyed peaceful sleep! Service is excellent. We were found a fabulous room at check-in that overlooked the Bellagio Fountains to the front and Rio to the side.

And I never ran into an employee that didn't meet my smile with a gracious response...The room was a little dusty when I checked in, but on the way out a little while later, I asked at the front desk if they could \"swiffer\" and when I got back a couple of hours later, it was done. Oh, and the Vdara bar drinks were delicious, refreshing and strong. Again, great hospitality there, and be sure to ask them to for recommendations and/or their mixes. I was lucky enough to be there before the pool opened, and I got to taste some great cocktails they were planning for the pool menu. And it's so quiet in the lobby, you forget that people are coming in and out. (Mind you, this was in March, so don't know how it was over the summer). I'm going back to Vdara in three weeks. Hoping the pool will be open so I can rest and get some sun. And I plan to finally get around to eating at Silk Road. PS A little tip for getting to the hotel from the Strip from the South. I found that the Monte Carlo was a great alternative for getting to the hotel. The entrance is on the Strip and it's a quick walk to the monorail bay. Then use the elevators to the monorail at the Monte Carlo and Bellagio stops - no one else was ever using them. A lot faster than walking off the Strip through Aria or going all the way to Bellagio.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ventura, California", "Title": "\u201cGood views of the strip for the price\u201d", "Author": "Paulina9077", "ReviewID": "UR80763217", "Content": "Overall experience was great.

Once in the room I immediately noticed how roomy it was for being the smallest room. It is like a mini suite. For being only 4 months old though I was surprised that there was a dent in the wall. But it is Las Vegas what do you expect. And what caught my attention was of course the view and windows. Wow are the windows big and the views fantastic. We were on a high floor by the way. Wish the blinds could block out the light in the early morning though. The blinds kind of sucked - no curtains. Staff was very friendly. Kinda missed having a casino downstairs but at the same time no haha. And also there is entrance to Bellagio and Monte Carlo from the hotel itself. And it is not far from the strip at all.

We didn\u2019t visit Vegas for the nightlife or gambling, but for a relaxing holiday and the Vdara suited this perfectly. THE ROOM We had a a City Suite, booked as part of an offer through Expedia and the room was stunning. The views were amazing, across CityCenter, Monte Carlo, Luxor, etc. and over the mountains to the West of the Strip. Housekeeping were efficient and responded kindly to daily tips we left, making sure we had plenty of complimentary water bottles, coffee sachets for the coffee machine, toiletries, etc, etc. We didn't really make the most of the kitchen, but had a huge fridge (very handy for Cheesecake Factory takeaway!). Bed was amazing, bathroom was large, lounge area was great to have to relax in. I know we were on holiday, but having separate washing machine and dryer in the room was brilliant, no washing when we got home! You also get a complimentary paper delivered every day, either Wall Street Journal or local Las Vegas paper. POOL The pool only ever got busy at the weekend, but even then it wasn't completely packed. The staff that work around the pool are brilliant, they'll take your drinks/food orders (and remember them & you for the rest of your stay!), they regularly came round with complimentary samples of virgin cocktails. Staff will also reserve you your favourite sunloungers/umbrellas for your stay. It\u2019s not really a \u2018family\u2019 hotel, so the atmosphere around the pool is really relaxed, no kids splashing and running around! LOCATION You can reach the Strip via a walkway to/through Bellagio, or walk 30 seconds over to the Aria and walk through there/CityCenter. Very, very easy. We loved the Vdara for its location as it was a bit of a retreat and calm place to be. SERVICES We didn\u2019t use the valet, spa or bar... but did order in-suite dining on our last night as we were exhausted! The order came through in about 20-30mins and the food was excellent quality, well presented and the staff extremely friendly and polite. When we arrived, we were met at the taxi/front door and bags were taken to our room, we didn\u2019t have to lift a finger. The same guys are there to get you taxis from the rank, and again are really helpful and friendly. AMENITIES There aren\u2019t any shops, etc. in the hotel, but a 30second walk over to the Aria and there\u2019s a sundries/convenience store. It\u2019s at the back of what looks like a Men\u2019s clothes store... even the staff there said they were frustrated that no guests knew it was there! Prices may be a little inflated compared to the CVS/ABC stores (which are about 10-15 mins away), but it\u2019s very convenient... and you can pick up international newspapers there too as well as Vegas souvenirs. OTHER NEARBY RECOMMENDATIONS As stated in a recent review, the breakfast buffet at the Aria is amazing. It\u2019s about $20, maybe more than other places, but the variety and quality of food is incredible. The staff are excellent too, always making sure you have the juice/coffee you need. The Aria also has a cute little gelato place called Sweet Chill which does coffees/sandwiches too. But the BEST place is the Jean Philippe Patisserie (there\u2019s also one at the Vdara end of the Bellagio). This is a great place to grab a breakfast... pastries, breakfast criossants, coffee, muffins, etc, etc... the best patisserie/bakery we\u2019ve ever ever experienced!All in all, we had an amazing time at Vdara... and will definitely be going back!", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful but flawed\u201d", "Author": "Allis0nB", "ReviewID": "UR80641136", "Content": "We stayed at the Vdara for only 2 nights, the 2nd stop on our 3 centre holiday and to be honest it was rather disappointing experience despite the high hopes I had for our suite in the luxury new hotel. The trip was booked in March 2010 (6 months in advance) and at that time I requested an early check in (check in is at 3pm and we were due to arrive at 1pm) and a view overlooking the Bellagio fountains. When we arrived, we had to wait for about 15 minutes and were then told no room was available despite the requests and that \"nothing was guaranteed\". They took all our details however, including credit card details and said this would not be required when we came back at 3pm. I was very disappointed and not impressed with the girl's attitude. We requested our cases back from the bellhops and changed in the toilets (not ideal!) but since we had limited time in Vegas decided to just change and go and get some lunch before checking in again at 3pm. The girl at the bellhop desk and the bell hop were very helpful and pleasant (and she was sympathetic, she suggested we change in the conference facility toilets as they were quieter and larger than the lobby ones). When we came back at 3pm we again had to wait for about 10 minutes and then they asked for all our details again! Annoying. We were given a room on the 38th floor, not overlooking the fountains but the view was spectacular both day and night - of the Luxor, Monte Carlo and Mandalay Bay and the mountains in the background. Good points:- Very quiet/peaceful/tranquil No smoking - this was lovely to come back to Smell in the hotel is lovely (as many others have pointed out) Exquisite decor throughout the hotel Possibly the most comfortable bed you will ever sleep in Lovely room Spectacular view Aveda toiletries in the bathroom Cool blinds/housekeeping remote controls Bellhops and concierge both very friendly and helpful Bad points:- Snooty and unwelcoming staff on reception Not getting an early check in or view we requested - and being told abruptly this was \"not guaranteed\" $15 per day resort fee - what is the point? We only got 2 bottles of water for this! Hubby did manage to use the wifi on his ipod touch briefly but not worth it. They should just add this to the room rate. Pool hours too short - when we went for a look at night and before 0900 the door was padlocked Kitchen - what is the point of having a fantastic kitchen with nothing in it? We put water in the fridge but that was it No restaurant or shop in the hotel, we had to trek to the Bellagio to get some water! Coffee makers no longer in the rooms The journey to the strip was OK - we went through both the Bellagio and the Aria and it didn't take too long either way. Everywhere takes ages to get to in Vegas! We didn't find the location to be a problem. We never ate in the hotel but had a couple of take away coffees from the Silk Road. Check out did not take long and there was a taxi waiting for us to take us to the airport. Randy the bellhop was great. All in all, a disappointing experience.

The split design was great for the rooms that had adults who were sleeping on the sofa beds. I would ask for the open style suite if you have a small child. Since there is no casino in the hotel it is better for the kids as well - not so restricted when walking around. Kitchen is compact and useful. Mini fridge is MINI - so shallow I don't think a regular leftovers container would fit inside. There are no amenities in the kitchen at all, not even a trash can or paper towels. You can ask for cookware and I assume other utensils. We just needed the microwave and fridge so it worked fine, but not having anything to wipe up or place to throw the trash was odd.

We arrived at the hotel and found parking a breeze with the Valet Parking guys. Check took less than 10 minutes and were we given a room with a view of Paris and the Bellagio fountains. The rooms are well appointed, however, if you\u2019re planning on cooking you just need to request kitchenware. The room had a kitchen area with table and chairs, lounge area with sofa and LCD TV, bedroom with the most amazingly comfortable bed and another LCD TV and the bathroom had a walk-in shower and bath tub. We had no complaints at all with the room, the air conditioning worked fine and the electric blinds and house keeping service requests were easy to use. One day our room had not been serviced by 4pm, we thought this was a little late and mentioned it and some came right away. There is a resort fee of $15 a day, however, this includes valet parking, in room wifi, telephone calls, newspaper and water \u2013 some places charge this just for wifi. The pool area is nice, however, we found it full of unpleasant \u2018Vegas wannabees\u2019 full of hot air and disrespect and it appeared as though the majority of them were not staying at the hotel. Sun loungers were available, however, sun shades were at a premium and the reserving of sun loungers early in the morning with towels was very reminiscent of Spanish hotels!! The hotel is no smoking which is great, however, there are always the minority who think they are above the rules and think they can smoke anywhere including around the pool and actually in the water. The facilities at the Vadra are somewhat limited, however, the Aria is less than a minute away with all the services you need. Again, I was worried about reviews stating that it took 20 minutes to get to the strip, this is so wrong and can only take this if you get lost. It took us about 10 tops walking through the Aria and the Bellagio and about the same down Harmon Avenue however, you still need to cut through the back of the Aria. The Valet Parking guys were very helpful, we waited no longer than a couple of minutes for our car, they offer plenty of free bottled water and if you get to know them can pick bottles up without going out in the car. Check out was very simple using the in room facility through the hotel. We had no issues at anytime with the hotel staff and found them all very helpful and responsive. I would recommend the Vadra to anyone; however, if you want a casino\u2019s and the usual Vegas entrapments then this is not the place for you. I am not sure if we will be returning to Vegas anytime soon, if we do we would return to the Vdara in a heart beat. Recommendations would include the buffet at the Aria don\u2019t take any notice of the bad reviews, we found it exceptional for price and quality. Viva Elvis was great, however, the theatre was no where near full so try for discount tickets.

We usually stay at the Wynn or Encore, but for the dates we selected these hotels were too expensive. We decided to try the Vdara. We stayed in the Aria before, and we didn't like it at all, so we were a little concerned. My husband got annoyed right away when we found out that there was only valet parking, because he doesn't like to wait for the car. It turned out that the Valet service was EXTREMELY efficient and the most we had to wait for the car was 3 minutes (timed). So, this was not an issue at all. The hotel is very nice, the room is comfortable although a little less \"well thought\" than others. For instance, the switch for the lights is only at the entrance of the room, and it's not possible to turn off the the lights, or open/close the shades from the bed. I was surprised too that the kitchen was COMPLETELY empty. Since they ask for a daily deposit of $100 for the room (refunded at the end of the stay), I would have thought that there was something in there. The bathroom is great, even though the selection of amenities isn't at par with other hotels of the same class (no sowing kit, no shoe mitt, no shower cap). The bed is one of the best you'll ever sleep in. If you're in a lower floor, on the pool side, you might hear the music from the pool, which starts at 1pm. The rooms facing the Bellagio hotel don't have that issue, but they're pricier since they've the \"view\" of the Bellagio lake. I noticed that some reviewers said that the only way to have breakfast is to spend $75 at the restaurant. This is simply not true. There is a restaurant (Silk road) open for breakfast and lunch. The service is impeccable and the food is excellent (much better than many other restaurants in Vegas). The full American breakfast (eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast, coffee and juice) is $22/person. But you can just have a coffee and a good pastry at the bar. Even take it away. There the coffee is cheaper than at Starbuck's. We had breakfast at the restaurant only once and the other days we spent around $10/person at the bar, including s generous tip. The pool is not very big, but adequate for the size of the hotel. The day beds and the cabanas cost as much as in any other luxury hotel in Vegas. There is the possibility to get umbrellas, asking the pool staff. It's free (but tips are appreciated...these umbrellas are HEAVY). The pool staff is extremely helpful and cheerful. I'd like to mention especially Zac, who approached us asking if we needed help the first day, and every day he remembered us, our name, how we wanted our chairs and would regularly check on us to see if we needed anything. They aren't pushy with their services, but if you need them, they're there. The food and drinks at the pool are very good, better than the average pool side fool in Vegas, and with the same price range (which means, not cheap...but it's Vegas). Between the waitresses, Brandie has been very nice and helpful, and she also works at times at the lobby bar. She remembered our order and our preferences from one day to the next. There is a $15 resort fee per day. This is lower than in other hotels (it's generally $20), and it is supposed to include two bottles of water/day, access to the spa/gym, and internet from the room. The problem is that the internet in the room worked only one day out of four. I asked other guests, and it was the same for them, too. If they FORCE me to pay for a service I might not want, at least that service should work. They should really work on that. Internet is like a commodity nowadays, it shouldn't be rocket science. At night there is no restaurant in service, but one can have dinner at the Lobby bar, with some nice simple \"tapas style\" dishes. Anyway, the hotel is right in the middle of everything, few steps from the Bellagio and the Aria, so finding food and fun isn't really an issue. This hotel clearly focuses on the level of service given to the guests, not on the number of \"amenities\". We had a very good, relaxing time and we will certainly consider the Vdara for our next trips to Vegas.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cNot a good stay.

Stayed here because I was paranoid about all the recent bed bug reports for Las Vegas hotels. This \"hotel\" is new and ultra modern, so I thought it would be safe. On the plus side, there were NO bedbugs. However, the mattress and pillows were the ONLY thing luxurious about this hotel. This is NOT a luxury 5 star hotel. This place is nothing but an architect's showcase. The building is stark, sparse, depressing and extremely people unfriendly. You have to walk forever all the way to the Bellagio just to get a cup of coffee in the morning. Alternative is to drop $75 at the Vdara restaurant for a small breakfast. That's okay if you are on a business trip and your company is paying all the bills. The housekeeping service is slow, slow slow. Our \"suite\" reserved for four barely had towels for two and only one cheap roll of toilet paper. The kitchen is stripped bare with no coffee machine and the refrigerator temp can't be changed and is so warm is it useless. MULTIPLE calls had to be placed with the desk to get even the barest of soap and towels in the room. This hotel housekeeping appears to be severely under-staffed. Items were brought to the room one or two at a time, and we ended up multiple tipping over and over again to get things to the room. Forget the robe and slippers. You have to request everything and it gets to be irritating. All the room doors here are hard-edge and very heavy. The hand shower in the bathtub leaked all over the floor and flooded the bathroom. The ice room was a mile away and smelled foul. The halls are hot and under-lighted. In fact, the lighting in the entire hotel is very dark and gloomy. The rare hotel staff member is young, attractive, and very grim and unfriendly. NOT ONE smile or acknowledgment from any staff member in this hotel. Even though we stayed mid-week-- after Labor Day when the place seemed empty-- we still waited almost 30 minutes for the valet to get our car. There are NO benches, chairs, or a single place to sit ANYWHERE on the premises, inside or out. I pity any unknowingly families who stay here with children. The pool is tiny with ugly parking lot views. All of this made sense when I found out later (after we left) that the building was originally built as a For Sale condo and ws then converted to a hotel when the real estate market tanked.

You would have to go to Bellagio or Aria (both on the expensive side). The blinds go up and down with a switch which is really cool (you even have the option of black out). It is also panoramic with windows stretched the entire length of wall. There are Aveda bath products, but everything else is basic as far as amenities. There are 2 flat screen TV's (one in sitting area and one facing the bed--it is back to back).

Another issue was that despite our requests on the phone and then in person to get a free room upgrade as we were visiting Vegas to celebrate a special occasion, our request was finally politely declined although they did offer to upgrade our room for the regular price.

I'm glad I did. I'd read mostly very good things about both Vdara and Aria, but I liked the sound of Vdara's quieter, smoke-free atmosphere more. (And the mystery-booking price of $79/night is probably unbeatable, expect via repeat chance appearance.) As other reviewers have noted, Vdara has several major strengths: quiet, unrushed public areas and rooms (I heard hardly a sound during my 3-night stay), smoke- and casino-free property, and great City Center location with beautiful rooms. I had a room on the 52nd floor, looking south down the Strip toward the Mandalay Bay, etc. The room, with its smart but nonequipped kitchen, was clearly designed for the overheated, investment-purchase/\"flipping\" real-estate market in Las Vegas before the crash. But the property has made a good transition to an all-suite hotel, and it's actually a minor plus to have the kitchen, with its two small refrigerators (one for the minibar, and one for the \"complimentary\" hotel bottled water and your own stuff), which in any event is small and leads directly to the living portion of the suite. The room decor is lovely: modern and sleek, without being austere. And the view from the room-length picture window is wonderful, especially with the south Strip all lit up at night. The bathroom deserves its own mention: huge, with a separate walk-in shower, soaking tub, and Aveda bath products. There are neatly folded piles of thick white towels and washcloths on nearly every flat surface! Vdara has just one restaurant, Silk Road. I tried it for breakfast on my penultimate morning at the hotel; it was expensive (as one would expect) but excellent. I had a fruit salad with tahini yoghurt and breakfast sliders with sirloin and applewood bacon on brioche buns, as well as a blood orange mimosa. The service and food quality were both superlative. The hotel staff are very polished, polite, and professional; the valet guys (and girls) especially so. I don't think I ever waited more than a couple of minutes for my car. (Granted, the hotel was only 35% occupied during my stay, according to one valet.) Vdara does feel somewhat anonymous, but that's perhaps only in contrast to the glitter palaces elsewhere on the Strip, The quiet atmosphere -- and, yes, great-smelling lobby and other public areas -- are a welcome relief from smoky, overcrowded casinos and winding shopping arcades.

I usually go to Vegas to shop, club, people watch,and eat/drink (not always in that order), but this trip was different. My boyfriend had been through a HORRIBLE couple of months. Everything horrible that COULD happen, DID happen. So I wanted to treat him to a vacation so he could just rest. I know I know... Hard to do in Vegas. But at Vdara, it was was not only possible, it was PERFECT. I picked Vdara because it didn't have a casino and the rooms were like condos. I wanted a peaceful place so I boyfriend could just \"veg\" out. There's nothing more jarring to the system than a loud casino filled with smoke. CHECK-IN When you first pull up to Vdara, it DOES give you that Jetson feel. Glass and Metal. Cool exterior. You walk into the lobby and notice that is smell fresh. I think the lack of cigarrette smoke does that. Lol. It's a non-smoking hotel. The lobby is gorgeous and has a very high end boutique feel. The check in was easy. We arrived around 11 a.m., well before checkin . The young ladies at the checkin counter were gorgeous and very helpful. We asked for a room facing the Bellagio fountains. No problem. THE ROOM Took the elevator up to our room 33034. The ELEVATORS were even gorgeous. When you get to the room, it doesn't have a place to insert the key. You wave it in front of the key panel and in you go. The room has a door bell too. I thought that was a nice touch. When you walk into the room, you're greeted with a view of the kitchen/dining room area. Adequate kitchenette with two small fridges (mini bar and an empty one to store food/drink), nice sink, tons of counter space, garbage disposal, two electric glass burners, microwave and lots of cabinents. They tell you upon check in to request WHATEVER you may need for the kitchen. We just ordered plates and silverware. That's one of the reasons I wanted to stay here. I always hate that I can't finish my meal and have to leave it. We saved ALOT of money on late night snacking with that microwave. lol The living room and bedroom are seperated by a dividing wall that has a two large screen tvs on either side. There are hidden hook ups for EVERYTHING. Ipod, phone, MP3, video camera, etc. Very nice. Decor of living room was nice. Dark wood, light floors, green pictures, beautiful lamps and accessories. The room had THREE huge paned windows that stretched the length of the room. The bedroom was beautiful and pristine. Comfortable and crisp linens. Loved it. The shades were automatic. Beautiful fabrics as well. WONDERFUL views. By the front door, they have a buttons you can push to let the maid sevices that you want them to clean the room or not to disturb. No more door hangers. Ample closet and draw space throughout the room. Bathroom was spacious. Aveda products provided. HUGE soaking tub and seperate shower. The ONLY negatives about the room were the lighting and water pressure. VERY MINOR. The lighting system was COMPLICATED. Took me about 10 minutes to figure out. They had too many switches and dimmers. They need to streamline it a little. I understand WHY they did it the way they did, but it was a little overkill. The water pressure in the shower was a little weak, but nothing to complain about. LOCATION The location is fine. I know people complain because they feel like they have to walk a MILE to get to the Strip. These people are lazy and over dramatic. Vdara is connected to Bellagio (CENTER STRIP). You walk through Bellagio, out the main entrance and TA-DA, The Strip. It's not that serious. After a long day of shopping, it may seem a little long, but the welcoming quiet nature of Vdara is well worth it. AMENITIES When at the hotel, we used the pool, the main bar, and the hung out in our room. Because this was a \"chill\" vacation, we wanted to just relax alot. Because the room is like a condo, I didn't feel like I was wasting time by hanging out in my room. The room set up makes it conducive to just \"hang out\". The pool was nice. Adequate. Nothing to fancy. I liked that I didn't have frat boys and teeny bikini girls spilling drinks and singing along to Miley Cyrus songs. It was cool. Main bar was good. Drinks were average price, and STRONG. The hotel doesn't offer much in the area of restaurants. They have Silk Road, but that place is EXPENSIVE. We usually ran over to Planet Hollywood to eat. They do not have a convience store so to speak either. You can run to Bellagio to get some things if necessary. Overall, Vdara was EXCELLANT. I loved it to pieces. My boyfriend had a great time NOT doing his average Vegas thing. If you want a relaxing place to retreat to, but STILL be able to access the craziness of The Strip, Vdara IS IT!", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "McLean, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cHotel was peaceful, the spa was disorganized.\u201d", "Author": "00melena80", "ReviewID": "UR75980566", "Content": "The Vdara hotel had an upscale atmosphere with friendly staff and beautiful accommodations.

The hotel is fantastic overall. It feels brand new. Lobby is expansive and airy and smells incredible. Everytime we left we missed the unique scent that the Vdara lobby contained. We came to the hotel very late on a Friday night around 1am. Our taxi dropped us off the entrance but there was literally no one to be found. We were not overly concerned nor upset at this - no matter what the time, a premium hotel such as this should have available staff to greet new guests to the hotel but generally we like taking our own bags anyway. Check is was a few minutes. This of course had to do with the time involved, but we noticed throughout our stay that the lines never looked longer than a handful of individuals at a time. The attendant was quick and polite. Our room was on the 38th floor. We asked for adjoining rooms with my father in law but instead were given rooms a few rooms apart. Both our rooms were outstanding with excellent views overlooking the rear of the Bellagio Hotel and Pool. The rooms themselves looked virtually brand new. The excellent sofa did not have any indentations to make it appear used in at all. All furnishings were like new. The room consists of a large space that is artificially divided with a large entertainment type center with LCD TVs on both sides. One side contains the \"living\" space with excellent high end sofabed, twin glass coffee tables and desk that is part of the aforementioned entertainment center that bisects the room. On the other side is the \"sleeping\" area that contains a huge King size bed along with two end tables with drawers. The bed was amazing. Sealy Postturepedic Mattress Pillow Top. The same kind we have at home that we paid over $1000.00 for. We had our baby with us and she spit up on the sheets so we peeled them away for the maid. We looked at the mattress and frankly were surprised to see that is was completely pristine. No marks, stains or any kind. That made us sleep even better. The linens, pillows and mattress quality literally made for the best sleep I ever had at any hotel. The room is connected to a small kitchen/eating area that contains a decently sized sink, mini fridge and two electric burners along with a very nice dining table for two. This was the main reason we selected this hotel since we were traveling with our baby and wanted a sink and fridge to clean bottles and store food. For this the kitchen was indispensable. We purchased some eggs, bread, cold cuts, beer and water - light groceries and barely fit what we needed in the tiny fridge. But it still served its purpose. The kitchen initially is completely bare. Any items needed must be requested. We made a list of what we needed and called the front desk. Within 15 minutes someone came by with a saucepan, frypan, spatula, four sets of silverware and four sets of plates and bowls. Everything was newish and the the cookware was high end stainless steel. The bathroom is really the defining feature of these room. It is huge. Styling is very modern-euro. There is a huge tub that could easily fit two people with separate spout and shower head. The stand up shower is large with a separate enclosed sitting area and encased in glass. We loved this bathroom. The hotel is connected by walkway to Bellagio. You can go from the lobby of the Vdara directly to the Bellagio without really being subjected to the elements. From the Vdara hotel to the Bellagio Casino is about 10 minutes or less depending on how fast you walk. I walk fast but with the baby and stroller it took me about 10 minutes to walk from the our hotel room to the buffet area of the Bellagio. The Aria Hotel is directly next door as well. This brings us to the main reason we stayed at the Vdara outside of the mini kitchen - the lack of a casino. Since we were bringing our baby, we wanted to minimize her exposure to smoke and other negative elements commonly associated with Vegas Hotel life. The Vdara was exactly as advertised - extremely chic, modern, clean and smoke free. There is a small bar in the front of the hotel as well a small restaurant that only serves breakfast and lunch. There is no casino. There is no nightlife. You can easily walk next door to the similarly new, chic and modernly styled Aria hotel for all this or walk 10 minutes to Bellagio and beyond. For us it was perfect. We were isolated outside of the strip and strip traffic as well as casino goers in a serene hotel. But once we wanted to venture out, it was very easy to go to Bellagio and the other hotels from there. Anyone going in with these expectations will no doubt love this hotel. Anyone expecting to find a standard big gaming hotel environment akin to MGM Grand with a large casino, tons of restaurants and bars will be sorely disappointed.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex, England", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "lll0412", "ReviewID": "UR75781109", "Content": "Yes, this hotel is off the strip, but it's quiet and its easy to get to the strip through the Bellagio, which in 100+ temps is preferable anyway.

Having walked through every other major hotel on the strip I can safely say that the Vdara is far newer, far nicer and far quieter than anything else we saw. The concierge booked an airport shuttle for us and got us show tickets without any fuss. We ate in the buffet of the next door Aria which is very nice too but has a casino and is very expensive to stay. The buffet food was exceptional, far nicer than the Bellagio which was average. All in all if you want a quiet ultra-luxurious base to tour Vegas than this is the place for you. The Bellaglio casino is less than a 10 min walk away and the Aria casino is literally a 2 min walk across the car park!

It was as if we were staying at a luxurious hotel in Mexico or Caribbean but in the middle of Vegas! When you walk in you smell this amazing aroma. Then there is a bar, and lobby, everything is quiet, you do not have 1,000 people bumping into you, no line, nice people at the check in counter. Our room was on the 41st floor, overlooking the pool and mountains. I have had better views at other hotels but the room is what made everything just great. We had a Vdara Suite, 811 sqft, full kitchen and fridge, living room, bedroom, and large bath. The Bed was very comfortable, great pillows and blankets. The air conditioning worked very well. If you need plates or anything they will bring them right up for you, just call the day you get there and you won't need to worry about it. Pool was amazing! If you like to tan, you will enjoy it here. It is located on the 3rd floor, so you don't need to walk through a casino like all of the other hotels to get to it. There is no one there, plenty of lounge chairs, you can have as many towels as you would like, and they have water and cups out at all times. They also pass around amazing margaritas and pink lemonades for free, very refreshing. It gets very hot though, say it is 105 in Vegas, it is 130 in between the glass hotels in the City Center! I loved it! The Vdara is connected from a sky walk to the Bellagio, literally a 1 minute walk. It also is a 1 minute or less walk to the Aria, you just walk on a pathway outside. Aria is a very nice hotel also! It does not take long to get to the strip. You can walk through either hotel (Bellagio or Aria). Vdara is set back exactly in line with Bellagio, so the distance from the Bellagio to the strip is the same as the Vdara to the Strip. Believe me it is no big deal! If you go to Vegas and want to see Phantom of the Opera, I suggest getting the cheapest seats possible because it wasn't worth the 175 per person for 2nd row that we spent. The show bored me, people literally were falling asleep around us. The week before we went we saw Wicked, and that blew Phantom away!

My husband and I have both traveled quite a bit, and we both agree that this is our new favorite place to stay.

We were pleasantly surprised to learn that this would also include our daily valet parking (except tip). It was also very convenient to have a kitchen and table in the room. There is a Whole Foods about a mile down the road, so we went there for some breakfast foods and snacks. It's easy to request dishes and silverware from the front desk when you need them. The glass shower and separate soaking tub were great. The room has cool motorized shades/curtains that you control with a button. Bed was very comfortable. Large flat-screen TV. Plenty of drawer/closet space. Lap-top sized safe was easy to use. We loved that the hotel was smoke-free and gaming-free. That made everything so nice and quiet and peaceful even though you are just moments from the action of the strip. It's attached to the Bellagio by a walk-way, and it is also accessible to the tram.

It's CityCenter, you can't be much more on the Strip without sleeping on the median in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd, and that itself cast enough doubt on those comments for me to book the room. After checking in and exploring, I think I get the comnents: there's no casino in the building, and it's offset behind the rest of CityCenter and kind of hidden from the actual street. But, again, it's right in the middle of CityCenter so, in my mind, Vdara is a perfect mix of a quiet place to sleep and hang out while being within steps from the action (Bellagio and Aria were maybe fifty yards in either direction, and Crystals is just a bit further but there is a free tram between the three). Apparently the bar does close at 2am, but, again, you're just around the corner from plenty of alternatives. The room was great: clean, well-appointed with full-size appliances, and very quiet. We had a view of the Bellagio fountains in one direction and the Bellagio pool in another (as well as the unused pool in what I assume is a CityCenter condo building). Room service was pricey, but they don't just drop the food off--they set up our kitchen like a little restaurant and asked when they could return to clean up for us. Food was very good. Malted Belgian waffles were unique, but very good (almost too sweet, though, more like a pastry than a regular waffle). Breakfast burrito weighed about 3 pounds. I still, however, give them 5 stars for price since we really just wanted the room, and room service was an unplanned impulse thing we tried since we saved money on the room. All staff we interacted with were professional and helpful--concierge, front desk, MoD, and room service. Lastly, the room was a great value--it was an advertised special of 10% off, but it was still almost 40% cheaper than every other nearby (wanted to be close to the Paris for a show) casino that I price-checked on the web before booking, including, if memory serves, Luxor, Excalibur, MGM, Bellagio, Monte Carlo, Paris, and NYNY. Was very happy with the experience, would definitely recommend to friends and family coming through town. We stayed at the Palms earlier this year, and Vdara blew them away.

There was a big stain on the carpet and the table looked like someone had taken keys and purposely scarred it. My husband and I own a commercial cleaning business so we're usually lenient on janitors and maids but, this must be said. The maids did lousy jobs on cleaning the room and we had to place calls to housekeeping several times over the course of our stay to have the face cloths and cups replaced after the room was so called cleaned. The room was not mopped at all while we were there and there was dust everywhere. It is a green hotel so they cleaned with vinegar which is not very appealing to the nose (they do have green products that are not as offensive). :( The iron is secured to the ironing board so it makes it a little cumbersome to iron your clothes. One of the reasons I picked Vdara is because it had a stove and refrigerator. The refrigerator was very, very small and the bigger side was a mini bar. We thought that we could move the items in the mini bar to accommodate the food that we purchased but found out that we had been charged over $200 because if you open the door and move anything, the refrigerator automatically registered the items as being consumed. Fortunately for us, we got that straightened out but ended up having to throw away some of the food. Its only restaurant closes at 2pm and there is no entertainment in this hotel but you don't have to go far to find it. Overall, the hotel was not the worst but it definitely did not live up to our expectations.

We were given a room on the 27th floor facing the pool, no complaints from us, and it was clean and very comfortable. The lobby was never crowded and the staff were always helpful. I cannot comment on housekeeping as we did not use them during our stay, except for once to get fresh towels. We had a rental car and never waited more than 2-3 minutes for our vehicle. Each time we came out or returned they recalled who we were and addressed us by name, which I thought was nice. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, but I rarely saw anyone else in there either. I was a little bit worried about the walk to Bellagio from prior reviews but I need not have bothered. I took me less than 30 seconds to actually walk the breezeway and then only about another 2 minutes to actually get to the casino. It was never a problem for me. The tram ran quickly and was easy to use to get to Aria and Monte Carlo. I have been to Vegas at least once for the past 4 years staying at various hotels (Mandalay Bay x3, Palazzo x3, and Aria) but the Vdara has been my best stay yet.

The lobby and check in staff were great, we were given a room on the 38th floor with a view of the Bellagio fountains and Paris as well as the freeway and mountains in the distance. The room was very clean as it should be since it is a new hotel. We never had to wait for an elevator during our entire trip. The kitchen is only equipped with two coffee cups, although you can request plates etc if you like (we were advised this upon check in). The two televisions are beautiful. The bed is super comfy and the linens are spectacular. The bathroom was spacious as well. The only negatives with the room: the shower door slams loudly when you close it, only one bar of soap supplied, and the bathroom floor is SLIPPERY!; the blackout blinds are fun (automatic) but where they meet up lets light in, so not completely blackout, the fridge (for our use) was not cold, but we had to fiddle around with it, and eventually it cooled down). The service staff were great as well. One day we were in and out of the room a lot and kept missing housekeeping so they texted us to see when would be the best time to clean the room. The stopper in the sink stopped working, once we called maintenance was in our room within 10 minutes and fixed it in 5 minutes. We loved the modern aspect of it, especially the doorbell and door indicator lights. We also loved getting back to our quiet hotel after visiting the other casinos (Aria and Bellagio are a close walk (5-7 minutes max). The pool was nice, never too crowded. They really should add some palm trees to provide shade, the umbrella\u2019s they provide (lots of them) are confusing and difficult to use) and they should cover up the UGLY parking garage. Just a couple of notes regarding the extra fees. We made a 8 minute call to Canada which cost $40. Insane. We ordered two drinks at the pool (margarita types), they were $30, and two coffees in the lobby were $10. The resort fee is a joke. You get two small bottles of water and a newspaper.

That's how it was with the Vdara. It all made sense when I spotted the sales pavillion promoting Vdara residential sales. We stayed three nights. The lobby was clean and smelled great. The employees were nice. The Deluxe Suite is small. It has tiled floors -- no carpets. There was some hair gel on the counter from the previous tennant. The bathtub stopper wouldn't work. The kitchen light was burned out. There were four hangers and no slippers. Housekeeping was unpleasant: \"We will put in a work order, but we have no idea how long it will take.\" \"You have to request slippers if you want them.\" The view was horrible. Who wants to watch the Bellagio fountains from the back and so far away, especially without the accompanying music -- pointless. You can't see the strip.

BUT it appears Vdara took their guests' comments to heart and really made huge improvements. We found the staff to be friendly and we had a great stay. We spent the 4th of July long weekend at Vdara, and it was truly an oasis in the over-crowded Las Vegas strip. As soon as we entered the walkway leading from Bellagio to Vdara, a calm peaceful feeling came over us. The location is great - we do not like the hustle and bustle of the strip, but we enjoy the restaurants and shopping so Vdara is very well situtated. We never had to take a cab because we used the very convenient tram (free) to get from place to place. We are not gamblers so Vdara is the perfect hotel for us - no casino! We spent the majority of our days at the Vdara pool. While it is not big, it is good enough for a fast weekend getaway. Just make sure to get there early as it does fill up with people looking for chairs and umbrellas. You should secure an umbrella as soon as you find your chairs because umbrellas are not very plentiful and the sun is a killer in Vegas. (Ask one of the very helpful pool guys to help you with the umbrella as they are very heavy to move.) The food was OK at the pool, and we ate there for lunch more out of time-management to stay by the pool for as long as possible. The pool water was warm which I love! There are also a couple of secluded smaller pools which had zero people so look for those if the main pool gets too crowded. My last comment about the pool - the music was just right for me (easy listening dance/pop). It was not loud and pounding like most pools in Vegas which try to go for a club scene. The room was nice and new - the best feature was that is was large. We had a standard room, but it was very spacious. There were actually 2 TV's in the room! The bedding was great - white comforters and the most fabulous bed. I have slept in my fair share of hotel beds and this bed was one of the best - that is a big compliment coming from me. The only downside to the room was that it had some housekeeping issues. I noticed the carpet was not vacuumed when we checked in and it was not vacuumed throughout our stay. Plus the bathroom was not fully cleaned - there was hair in the shower drain from a previous guest (sorry for the gross detail). I would not say this is a 5 star hotel. They need to improve the housekeeping, but I let that slide because I enjoyed the room so much. We did not eat at any of the restaurants at Vdara. But a couple of final fast comments about the surrounding new places...The Aria buffet is not great, but OK in a pinch.

We were only there one hour before check in and were curtly told we had to wait for the official check in time. My inquiry about whether that was because there were truly no rooms ready or because it's just a rule did not get a friendly response. So we wait, along with about 50 other parties trying to check in. Check in time comes and we all get in long lines to check in. So they did have rooms ready. This is an assanine policy for a so-called 5 star hotel! Why would you make your guests mill around in the lobby for an hour and then endure a line if you had the rooms. It felt like a 28 year old club manager ran the front desk. There were other similar interactions...don't have the time to tell about all of them. The bar and pool wait staff were very pleasant.

Check-In: We arrived more than 3 hours before the check-in time, but they had a room ready for us. At the front desk we were asked if we would like a high floor with a good view or a lower floor. Obviously we said higher floor and that's exactly what we got. We got a room on the 39th floor with awesome views of the Bellagio Fountains. The Room: The room was so beautiful. The pictures on the website, or even on here don't come close to doing these rooms justice. They are set up in a very convinient and practical way. The seperate living room area is perfect for relaxing and watching TV, or you can just lay in the bed. There is 2 huge tv's in the room! The bathroom is also very nice. A big shower and a soaking tub, with plenty of counter space, which is good if you are bringing a girlfriend or wife with you! There was a lot of smaller things in the room that we were very intrigued with. First off the black out blinds and shades were controlled by the push of a button, which was very modern and fun. Also, each room had a door bell on the outside, and there was a light ring around the door bell. From a button inside the room you could set the color of the light to blue or green. Blue meaning no housekeeping or do not disturb, and green letting them know it was ok to clean the room. Service: The service was top notch! The front desk agent was very polite and not at all what we expected. All the front desk agents were very good looking and they all looked snobby, but that was not what we encountered at all. I wish I remembered her name, but the gal who checked us in was very polite and helped us out, and got us that awesome room. Another thing to say about the excellent service is how prompt and effective the housekeepers are. We left to go get some lunch, and were gone less than an hour before we came back to change, and the room was already clean and waiting for us. I dont know if this was luck or if there is someone waiting for that light to turn green so they can clean your room, but whatever they are doing it is working! Atmosphere: Like every review states, the atmosphere at Vdara is so peaceful and calming. There is an amazing smell that is pumped in to the lobby and that was our favorite part about returning to the hotel was the fresh smell you get when you walk through the doors. It also helps that it is non smoking and there is no casino so it was always very peaceful. Pool/Fitness Center/etc: We did not use any of the spa or pool, but we did visit the pool on the way up to our room at one point. It was very busy but looked nice. Although I would have expected more from a pool in vegas, but it didn't bother us, we didn't come to vegas to swim! Value: This hotel has great value! We stayed a Sunday and Monday night so we got the cheaper rate, and it was well worth every penny. I would easily pay over 200 a night to stay at Vdara, and we payed barely over 100! The service fee is 15 dollars a night, but not a big deal at all. You get two small water bottles in your room every day. A newspaper, but mainly you get free Wifi and Wired internet. I know you are probably thinking, It's Vegas, why would I need the internet, but it is convinient to have at the end of the day when you are getting ready for bed, or even to help plan out your day in the morning. It also covers Valet cost and bell service (tip not included) Other: The elevators are super fast! Everyone said it in their comments but I had no idea what to expect. We would literally go from floor 1-39 in about 10 seconds. It feels like you are on Tower of Terror (Disneyland or Disneyworld Ride). So those were a lot of fun. Valet and bell service was fast and friendly. Vdara is also very close to the free city center tram and Bellagio, which makes getting to the strip very convinient, and also fun, getting to walk through Bellagio or take the tram. Negatives: I had to think for a while to come up with anything negative about Vdara, but there is a few things, nothing major though. First, like someone previously mentioned, the hallways did seem pretty warm. But once you got into your room the A/C in there was fine. Although we had issues with ours (the guests before us turned the heat on and we kept turning the temp down and couldnt figure out why it wasnt getting cooler until we realized the heat was on) but this was our own fault. Once we got it going it was very cool and nice. Another small negative is it is kind of a pain to find the hotel off the stip. We had to call and ask, but once you find it once its easy to find again. Overall: Vdara was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had, and you can take that to the bank!!

There are 4 room type options as I recall and this was a one bedroom 1 1/2 bath set up with a kitchen, living room, dining area. The room was right at the end and the views are pretty good from that floor. A friend came the following day to stay with me and the pull out couch was very convenient. OK, here's how it all went wrong!! The room developed a really bad smell when you walked in. Short story after maintenance arrived was that the laundry stack machines were not being used and therefore the backed up water started smelling. I later asked why they didn't provide detergent to which I was told that \"I was supposed to ask\" when I checked in!! The internet connection stopped on day two and I just couldn't get it working. In addition, I asked for \"no\" newspaper yet I got one daily. There are no dishes or anything in the kitchen to allow you to use the property for what it was intended. There are two coffee mugs in the lonely cupboard, two water bottles and two coffee canisters in the refrigerator. BUT, you guessed it, no sugar, sweetener, milk or anything to stir with. You better like your coffee black!! The automatic coffee maker was cool When I arrived, there was a sock and underwear on top of the dryer. Yes, they were clean! When I called the front desk to ask about a move because everything smelled, I was told it would be tough but they could get me to a room on the 31st floor. Well, packed up and went to the next room which only had doors that wouldn't shut, no kitchen light and a couple of other minor inconveniences. At this point I thought I was the problem. None of this is troubling, really, more then the staff not really appearing to care that I paid for a premium room and that my stay was impacted by their lack of customer service. The lady at check out did credit back the resort fee of $15 per day (plus tax). A small victory for someone listening. I was not there to complain, I was there on a kayak trip and to see some shows. Perhaps there are bugs to fix but the price sure didn't look like it...... I have had better rooms and am probably going to go back to those hotels I know are prepared to service their guests. Aside from that there's a great statue in the front made up of canoes. You can walk via walkway to the Bellagio but I found Aria a hot inconvenient walk across the driveway. The gym is great and most of the machines have TV's or there are big screens around. Really a nice place to work out. The pool was very inviting as well but I only walked out there. There is a restaurant downstairs but it just never seemed to be open so I don't know what to make of that.

IT'S ALL ABOUT THEM ($$$$$$$$) NOT YOU !!!\u201d", "Author": "Gustavas", "ReviewID": "UR72744463", "Content": "It's NOT a 5 Star Hotel by any definition. If you're expecting Ritz Carlton standards or similar customer service, YOU WILL BE SEVERELY SHOCKED. I travel the world and usually stay at the best hotels possible if only fore a day or two. While no hotel is without its problems, this hotel actually stressed me; ruined my stay in Las Vegas, and has compounded my stress even upon my return home. V'dara's staff are without question, some of the most cold blooded, finance oriented hotels that I have ever stayed. They exude as much customer service as a tax collector's calculator. My travel agent suggested this hotel and I agreed. I am his second best leisure client out of hundreds he serves. You can be certain, after my report, he will not be suggesting V'dara to anyone ever again. The entire four day reservation in one of their suites was completely pre-paid a month before arrival. I understood they also have a daily resort fee of $15.00 plus 12% tax. This is added upon arrival and can not be pre-paid. This was naturally not a problem. Upon check-in no one greeted my car at curbside to assist with bags or welcome me to the V'dara. My driver did. I wheeled my bags in, held my own front door and approached the counter. The desk was not busy as there were only about three people being helped. I approached the next available clerk with a warm smile and a hello. The cold front desk person behind the counter was a tall, condescending, arrogant young man who made no eye contact and NEVER said welcome to the V'dara. Asked my name, then asked for my card. He swiped my card. Put a piece of paper infront of me and bluntly asked (without any measure of warmth) \"How many keys.\" He was ALL business and I was not here on business. I was never shown to my room, never offered any details about the hotel services or even \"offered assistance\" with my bags to my suite in this so-called 5 star glass tower. My suite was on the 33rd floor. The view is beautiful but deceiving from the website. You look at the back of Bellagio and not the strip. The frontside rooms are no better. The room is modern and high tech with some toys that most would appreciate including power blinds/shades. I would not label it as luxurious. Upon opening the closets I found some loose almonds on the carpet from the previous occupant. I picked them up with a tissue and disposed of them. I just wanted it done immediately. I had pre-booked a massage at the same time I booked the hotel but the spa emailed me and insisted on a credit card weeks before my arrival to guarantee the massage even though I was already pre-paid in their hotel. Strange. This was the first indicator. I read on TripAdvisor that Bellagio, Aria and some other close hotels allow charges to your V'dara room account. Later that afternoon I went to the bar at Bellagio for a cocktail to decompress from a day of travel. When I was ready to close out, I was informed that the computer said I could not charge to my room because the \"V'DARA HAS NO CARD ON FILE FOR ME.\" Must be a technical error I thought. Not a problem, a mere $10.00 drink doesn't matter. Rather than deal with this immediately, I moved on with my vacation. Second indicator. Later that day I went for my massage. When I completed the massage standing there is a robe and slippers, the desk robot at the spa informed me that I could not bill anything to my room even though they had taken a $467.20 hold on my card at check-in for a fully pre-paid room. Trying desperately to hold back explosive anger at this point, I had to go all the way back to my suite on the 33rd floor to get a credit card and some cash, come back down and pay for this massage. Totally defeated the purpose of the massage. RE-STRESSED was more like it. When dealing with the front desk you will encounter pre-programmed robots more concerned with their outward appearance than their ability to serve the guest. They are aloof, distant, cold and stereo-typically arrogant. They're not particularly intelligent either. They spit out pre-scripted plastic answers to questions with the artificiality of one of the StepFord Wives robots. With the exception of the girl in the business center, most front desk employees (face to face) lack sincerity, warmth or seasoning. God forbid if you ask them something not in their data-base. Nothing said to them seems to be understood from a guest's perspective. Nothing said to them is absorbed. Very anticeptic attutudes at all levels. I've never quite seen or experienced anything like it in my years of travel. Upon my return home, I was shocked to see that they actually FULLY CHARGED the entire $467.20 to my card as though I owed them this amount. What I owed them was $67.20 ($15,00 per day plus 12% for four days.) I was furious. This was to be a hold, NOT A CHARGE PUT THROUGH. At no time did I charge ANYTHING to this room because they did not permit me to, yet they saw fit to take my money, without my knowledge or permission after their entire hotel stay of 4 days was fully pre-paid. I so dreaded calling the hotel, but when I called the hotel, I had to debate with a world class robot. Indifferent as pre-programmed as she could be. She finally mentioned, without apology, that I was given a credit upon check-out (two days ago) of $400.00. This credit has not appeared. A senior manager in my bank says it has not appeared in their system either and there is no evidence of a credit from V'Dara two days ago. However, upon further investigation they DID INDEED charge this card upon CHECK-IN. As is typical, robots always your bank. My bank is not at fault by any means. It's never the merchant's fault it seems. My bank today did a further investigation and firmly states there is no credit whatsoever showing from V'dara. I continue to attempt to rectify this unfortunate, unfair, unnecessary and unfounded charge. They have simply taken money from me with no valid reason and to date, have not returned it. They offer no apology, no assistance and above all, no return of my money. This hotel's marketing masks their practices. Practices that are both a disgrace and deceivingly border on the criminal. It's all about their bottom line and they get away with it. I did not and do not now owe V'dara $400.00 for anything. They have systematically taken my money. With loads of documented proof, I have today filed a claim against the invincible and unfeeling V'dara of Las Vegas. The hotels restaurant is a joke and it closes very early. The pool also closes at 7 PM. This hotel is a very strange concept. Aside from V'dara, Las Vegas is wonderful. Fabulous restaurants, nightlife etc...most people know all this so I wont waste time here. On a lighter note, I also made an overnight trip to California to see the old Queen Mary at Long Beach which was a real treat for me.

The tiny kitchen I would work around and stay again but it was the pool that makes me want to try something else. As others have remarked: all cement, windy, no view, just not welcoming at all.

After reading a lot of the reviews I really had no idea what to expect, but I was immediately impressed with the service. We were immediately greeted by the Valet, helped inside, and encountered a very positive check-in experience. We stayed in a city suite room which was large but had an odd layout- more of an L-shape than open and roomy. It has a separate dining area, kitchen, living room, desk area, and then a large bedroom with an extremely nice bathroom. The decor is very modern and trendy which is not our favorite. Overall the hotel is missing an identity- even after two nights I just couldn't get a feel for what kind of place it was trying to be, much less the kind of place it actually was. It wasn't a bad stay, but it was far from something special. The pros: Great service, nice, clean, quiet hotel, great rate. The cons: This hotel really is pretty removed from the strip, the hotel (due in large part I would imagine to such low rates right now) is attracting a pretty young crowd of college aged guests which is fine, but may not be exactly what you are looking for. The room service was the worst part of our trip- late, wrong food, and it tasted awful! With so many great places to stay in Vegas, I'm not sure why we would ever return.

First, the hotel appears to be hurting, as the air conditioning was either turned off or was set at an extremely low setting in the elevators to the rooms and in the room hallways. The impression: The hotel was cutting back on costs. Second, the rooms are extremely cheaply furnished. Unlike the lobby which is nice, the rooms are shabby---something that is surprising for such a new hotel. The woodwork appeared to be cheap veneer. Like another review below, doors fell off when opened and woudn't go back in place. The bed looked like it had been slept in. Third, the pool is awful. There is a huge parking structure that looks down on the pool. There is no view that is nice. There are cheap-looking slats surrounding the pool area. The umbrellas are dime-store, fire-sale quality. The wind has bent some of them out of shape, like umbrellas that get wind-blown. There is cement and cement and cement. I do not recall seeing an ounce of greenery. The pool was overcrowded. The cabanas looked bargain basement. Nothing vacation-like about the pool space. Though the room price seemed to be a bargain, there is no rate that would have kept us here. It's just not what the Vegas experience is supposed to be about. There are multiple hotels that would offer a vastly more positive experience. It would not surprise us if this hotel were out of business within a year---and what a white elephant it will be when that happens, as I'm sure it will. We left after one night and couldn't wait to get out of the place. We happily paid slightly more at another hotel, and it was well worth the extra money. Our advice: Unless your desperate, stay away.

Our room was on 34th floor with a view of the Bellagio pool and a bit of the fountains, great to look at day and night. The shades and lights were not too difficult to figure out, nor was the button by the door for housekeeping. Room was clean and beautifully appointed, the bathroom very luxurious. I have read the comments about the bed and after the first sleep I commented that I haven't slept like that in a long time. I don't know what it is but even the pillows are so comfortable (better than my own at home) as opposed to other hotel pillows that feel like a sack of potatoes at times. Housekeeping was done very quickly and effectively, no matter when and for how long we left, when we came back the room was already cleaned and ready, which was great. A couple of times we had to ask for extra lotion or shampoo but were given more than enough upon request. As for the location, yes it is a bit of a walk to the strip, but after a couple of times we found the way through Aria to be more convenient if you wanted to go southbound (towards Mandalay Bay) and the walk through Bellagio works better if you want to go anywhere on the strip towards the Stratosphere. Both walks are no more than 10 minutes. The only negative comments we have are about the pool and the restaurant. The pool area is nice and relaxing, but it is very barren with no shade except for umbrellas which they did not allow to be open when we were there, due to high winds (the pool is on 3rd floor and in some kind of a wind tunnel) and we just could not bear to sit in the sun in the 45 degree Celsius heat. We mentioned this to the front desk and we were accomodated getting access to the neighbouring Aria pool which is an oasis of palm trees and serenity.

CHECK IN The first thing you notice is the lovely smell in the lobby and bar area - it is wonderful and very refreshing. The other thing you notice is the quite amazing architecture of the place - it is stunning, just like the whole of CityCenter! The check in was fast and the girl on the desk was very helpful and informative. They even came over with a couple of bottles of water for us whilst we checked in. Only had to wait about two minutes to get checked in and was on our way to our room within a few minutes. They even gave us a room on the 27th floor, overlooking the Bellagio pool and even a view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains! ROOM/SUITE The suite (duluxe suite - the basic one!) was large and very clean with a massive king size bed (which are just the same as the amazing beds at the Mirage, as again they are the most comfy beds you will ever sleep on!). The room has a massive bathroom with tub and separate shower. The view towards the strip and fountains from the room was amazing. None of the rooms are far from the elevators, and we didn't really ever see anyone in the elevators or hallways during the entire stay. Max wait for an elevator was 7 seconds! Plates and cutlery etc for the room are available - just ask, and the kitchen has a fridge and coffee machine - all included in the price, and you even get a newspaper every morning. LOCATION Vdara is situated in the amazing MGM CityCenter right next to the Bellagio and the new Aria resort. Although it's not directly on the strip, it is close enough and takes well under a 10 minute stroll to get to the strip via Bellagio or Aria (and it is so easy tpo find your way around - only took us one trip through Aria to find our way around - just follow the signs). The direct access to both is open 24hrs a day and the CityCenter tram runs from the Monte Carlo, to Crystals (Aria) and to Bellagio. The tram stop at Bellagio is only a 2 min stroll from Vdara. FOOD/DRINK We again ate at various places along the strip, and didn't get to try the Silk Road restaurant in Vdara (never really up before lunch!). Silk Road is open for breakfast and lunch only, which is a bit of a shame. It does now do morning coffees though. One of the best meals we had was at Cafe Vettro in Aria. It's a lovely cafe with great food and a view of Vdara! The bar at Vdara (BarVdara) is lovely for a pre-meal drink or a late night cocktail (and they even do food now). It is very relaxing and chilled, and a nice change to the usual Vegas type bar. All of the staff are very friendly and will do anything for you. POOL The pool area is quite small, and we were worried about the lack of sunbeds and shade for such a large hotel. We didn't need to worry, as over the 4th July weekend, there were plenty of spare sunbeds and umbrellas, and the pool is a lovely size. The drinks service was a bit hit and miss, so most of the time we just went and got our drinks from the pool bar. Further to other reviews on Tripadvisor, the music is not at all loud (unless you pick a sunbed next to a speaker!), and although it did get windy one day (as the pool is on the 3rd floor), all you needed to do was jump in the pool to get away from the breeze, or move over to the pool bar seating area. ENTERTAINMENT We went to see VivaElvis at Aria, which was a great show, although not the normal Cirque type show. Check the website for discounts etc, as we got $135 tickets for $88. GAMBLING Had a good few $ in various casinos, but didn't win a lot at all - MGM have to pay for CityCenter somehow! We seemed to have better luck this year at Rio, Caesars and Planet Hollywood Resort. OVERALL An great stay at an amazing hotel.

First the negatives: The Vdara was recently built as part of the new City Center complex - an upscale collection of shops, restaurants, hotels and condos. The hotel is more towards the north and west side of this complex a little removed from the strip. At the time of our stay there was construction going on nearby that made access to the strip very difficult without going through the Bellagio hotel. I should mention that the Bellagio and the Vdara are connected by a short walk way, and the Vdara and the rest of City Center are connected by a very short monorail thing. The problem with the whole location is that it is not conducive to just walking out the hotel and taking a stroll. Even our taxi driver got confused by all the ramps in that sea of concrete. Also, I should note that while the Bellagio is just next door it still takes a good 10 minute walk to get through the Bellagio, around the fountains until you are finally on the actual strip. Overall, we found getting from A to B in Las Vegas a difficult proposition. Now the positives: While I was at first uncertain about whether I wanted our hotel to be this removed from the action, I grew to like the fact that we could escape from the casinos and all the other crap that is Vegas. The Vdara does have a soothing ambiance to it that is very welcoming after a long day of dealing with the noise and hassle of the strip. Our room was extremely comfortable and furnished in a very modern, but still inviting style. Although there was no view of the strip, the view that we did have (to the south) was pleasant enough. In terms of amenities at the hotel - we wife really enjoyed the spa, and I thought the gym was very nicely appointed (other reviewers who thought it wasn't plush enough haven't been to most gyms). Believe me, the level of service and attention to detail at the gym were far higher than I've seen at most regular gyms. The one disappointment was probably the pool. It seemed like a bit of an afterthought. First, it didn't seem large enough to accommodate everyone. Second, it needs a lot more shade and greenery - it was just too much concrete which made it unbearably hot outside of the water. I was however surprised at how much I enjoyed the margaritas poolside. In terms of food the Vdara doesn't have a lot to offer, however we did have breakfast at the hotel's Silk Road restaurant one morning and really liked it (despite the high price - $13 for an omelet !). In sum, the Vdara is not for people who really want to be right in the middle of the Las Vegas action. However it will suit those who are happy to experience some of that but are willing to wander back through the Bellagio at the end of the day to a more peaceful, more relaxed setting.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "mikeg82", "ReviewID": "UR70833548", "Content": "I stayed at the Vdara for 5 nights the first week of July.

My friend stayed at the Aria when I was there and all I can say is that you can use all of their amenities while staying at a nice quite, cheaper hotel. The only one issue I ran into was the internet was down for two days during my stay. Your resort fee includes internet access, so after calling the front desk and asking them to refund the resort fee, they did so right away.

Massively friendly and helpful staff everywhere but a special mention has to go to the valet parking crew who were the best around (and we parked at several other resorts during our stay). The suite was clean, well designed and roomy. Its a crying shame some have called this hotel and the city centre 'boring'. I understand Vegas is a (sin) city that never sleeps, but we chose this venue exactly because we wanted that peace and quiet away from the strip yet still feel we were staying in the heart of Vegas. It gave us just that! A great place to crash and a very short walk via a connecting bridge brings you into the Bellagio so I really don't understand the moaning. BTW we're both in our 30s and did our fair share of partying whilst we in Vegas too . Being at the Vdara didn't hinder that whatsoever, in fact it was a welcome contrast to the rest of town!!! The free wifi was a godsend too, used with our iPhone it allowed us to keep in touch with friends staying further down the strip and family at home via email saving a ton on roaming charges. No complaints at all with fresh linen, towels, 2 gratis bottles of mineral water and a Wall Street Journal every day either!

When we opened the door to the room, we were instantly greeted with an awesome view of the strip including the Bellagio Fountains. We had a large kitchenette that was separated from the main room. The main area included a large closet with a safe, a couch, two desk and chair sets, tv, dresser, and king bed. The bathroom was huge with a separate soaking tub, tons of extra towels, powerful hair dryer, Aveda products, and it even had a digital scale. The decor was modern and simple. The bed was super comfortable and it had a duvet instead of a funky bedspread that most hotels don't wash. It had 4 king sized pillows as well. Two plush robes were provided, so comfy I really wanted to take it with me. The room was spotlessly cleaned everyday. There is a housekeeping button on the door that sends a signal to let someone know you would like your room cleaned. The best thing about this hotel is that it is quiet. Not that anyone goes to Vegas for peace, but it was such a great thing to return from the craziness of the strip to a tranquil escape. I've read some of the other reviews that had complaints about the lackluster lobby and lack of restaurants. My theory is that the hotel was designed that way on purpose. No one is coming to gaze at the lobby or to wait in line to eat. Not that the lobby wasn't nice, but you wouldn't go out of your way to see it and people aren't hanging out gambling and smoking on the way to your room. This design keeps it quiet and low-key. Despite its tranquility, the Vdara is centrally located. The hotel is connected to the Bellagio via a covered walkway. You can be in the Bellagio is less than 5 minutes and they have several eateries, stores, and bars. It is also next door to the Aria, also less than a 5 minute walk. The Aria also has several places to eat and of course a casino. We ate at the Aria buffet for breakfast every morning and it was quite good. The fitness center and pool were small, but adequate. We sat by the pool every morning and didn't have any trouble securing a chair. Valet was prompt and easy. The concierge was always available and helpful.

The hotel rooms are lovely and the hotel staff are extremely polite and helpful, particularly the hotel concierge who can't do enough for you. If you need any information about restaurants, shows, excursions etc, they will sort these for you. The Aria also opened the week that we were there, however; we are glad that we decided on the Vdara. This was the second time that we have visited vegas. Previously, we stayed at the Venetian. I prefered the Vdara as it was brand new and is non-smoking. Although, I don't mind smoking in the casinos and bars etc, you really notice a difference staying in a non-smoking hotel. We also liked the fact that the hotel didn't have a casino, which meant that it was quiet and relaxing. After a busy day and night on the strip, the Vdara provides a comfortable base away from the hectic strip and crowds. The room was finished to a really high standard and was cleaned everyday. We liked the way that the open plan room was divided into different areas, kitchen, lounge area, bedroom and large separate bathroom with large bath and separate shower. The room also featured 2 large flatscreen televisions in the lounge and bedroom. It was like having your very own mini apartment in vegas! Even though we didn't do any cooking, I still liked the small kitchenette and dining table area. The fridge also came in handy to store drinks. The bed in the room was really comfortable and with our jetlag, we sometimes found it hard to get up! The only small downsides are that it is a little bit out of the way compared to other hotels on the strip. Although the Vdara is located on the main strip, it is behind the bellagio and city centre. This means that to get onto the strip you have to walk over the skybridge to the bellagio and either go all the way through the hotel to get outside or catch the sky train from the bellagio to the city centre. Also, the Silk restuarant in the hotel is very expensive, but the food is amazing. We ate there twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner. The service you receive is immaculate and the food is presented beautifully. However, if you want a cheap and cheerful breakfast or dinner, this is definitely not the place to go. All in all, the hotel was great and the issues mentioned are minor drawbacks which didn't affect our holiday as the quality of the hotel far outweighs these small details.

Find soe umbrellas to hide under because the sunlight reflects off the huge glass towers and you will burst into flames. Better yet, head over to Aria for Liquid Pool Party!!! Drinks are twice as expensive but there is 100 times more fun. * Food: The room and pool service food was really delicious. Unexpected! But you will wait forever for the pool waitress to decide you can order something. Go to the bar, the bartender is very friendly. Spa: I had a massage and a pedicure. The clinicians are professional and the spa is gorgeous. They serve you beverages and snacks while you enjoy your treatments.

Resort fees annoy me but it seems most hotels are charging them now and at least at Vdara you are getting something for it. The Pool area was fine, lots of sunbeds available at anytime of the day, probably a little too many, they are a bit too many crammed together, they should remove some and free up space. They do play music at the pool and generally is a nice relaxed and chilled atmosphere.

My husband and I liked the design, it was pretty, modern and comfortable. It also smelled great walking in the door, and it was super quiet. A nice couples resort. We absolutely loved the bed and pillows! The bathroom was also nice with a soaking tub and great shower. We did not experience any problems with water pressure like others mentioned or maintenance issues. The pool area was also nice, but nothing really extraordinary. Here's what we didn't like... Our experience checking in was a nightmare!!! First we had to wait in line forever (there was a line at the desk everytime we walked through the lobby), then the front desk person told me that since I had a Visa debit card instead of a credit card I would have to be charged a deposit of over $100 a night, for a total of over $300! This was in addition to the $15 a day that you get charged for water, internet, newspaper and fitness center, too bad the only thing that we used was the water. At least I was aware of the resort charge upfront, the deposit blindsided us and since we were there on a strict budget and carry no actual credit cards I was practically in tears at the front desk. The person there called to a manager and got the amount lowered to $200 + resort fee. After discussing this with my husband we were still not satisfied and asked to speak to a manager who went through the whole explanation again, that basically it is to cover their butts if we trash the room. Once I pleaded my case she said she was able to credit my account back another $100, but they \"needed something.\" I asked if we should wait in the lobby and she said yes, but after waiting about 20 minutes I asked the conceirge if she was coming back. He went and looked and said he didn't see her and advised us to go ahead up to our room. After another 20 minutes or so I called to the front desk and was told she was in a meeting! At this point we decided to go out exploring and by the time we returned there was a message on our phone that the problem was taken care of. We were not the only ones that were having an issue with this, we saw several other people during the check-in and out process that were complaining about the same thing, this could be part of the reason that the lines were so long! Other things that we weren't crazy about... The hotel was not very convenient to the strip. Having never been to Vegas we weren't sure where to stay, but I did not feel like the City Center was any kind of hot spot. It seemed pretty dead most of the time. I felt like they were trying to be overly fancy, and it just felt like a ghost town walking through the Aria. The food and drinks were way over priced as was the spa, so we really only had one drink poolside. My last complaint was that many of the staff members were really snobby, several that we encountered had very arrogant attitudes. There were a couple nice people, but overall they came across very high and mighty.

This was one of the best stays and hotels I have have ever experienced in Vegas and I go there quite frequently. Upon checking in, the clerk noticed I had celebrated my 40th birthday earlier that week. With no prompting from me, me and my partner were instantly upgraded to a deluxe suite on one of the tower's highest floors. Upon walking into the room, it was heaven, 50 stories up. A mini kitchen with top of the line appliances, 2 flat screen tv's, a lovely living room, a huge bathroom with a separate soaking tub, and a wonderful bed. And the view - one of the best. Out one window were the dancing fountains of the Bellagio, and the other set of windows were a view of the Rio. The property itself reminds me of a sleek, chic hotel in Soho or The Meatpacking District. And whatever scent they pump into the air system should be sold in the hotel's gift shop. It is relaxing without being obnoxious. The pool - very relaxing and best of all, there's none of that gross Vegas \"pool scene\" like one would see at other mega resorts. All quiet and people wanting just to get a tan. The tower is a no smoking, non gaming tower which makes it a welcome oasis from the Strip. If you want action, go to the centerpiece - Aria.

Compared to the other 4 and 5 star hotels I stayed at, the srvice was just not up to scratch! There were three of us to a room. Extra sheets and bedding was not provided. We had to ask for it and then waited about 2 hrs for it to arrive. Although the deluxe rooms feature a very nice kitchenette, there were no bowls,plates, knives, forks or any utensils for that matter. Again we had to request these. One morning I woke up with a terrible hangover and not being a fan of tap water I called room service to request bottled water. The water again came about two hours later. The rooms were nice but there was a very poor use of space and our view left a lot to be desired. I hurt myself on the room divider several times and please do not be fooled by the videos on the vdara website of the suites as they really are not that spacious. At the end of the holiday, we were told we had to pay a 15 dolla a day resot fee. We were told by the agents that we booked through that we would not have to pay this as this was included in the price we had paid upfront. When we queried this upon check in, we were again reassured that we had already paid the resort fee. You can therefore imagine our horror when we were hit with this at the end of our stay. We argued with the less than understanding manager until she agreed that we would only have to pay half of the total cost. I would not recommend this hote and would certainly suggest the signature at mgm if you are looking for a luxiourious non gaming hotel with good service!", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cQuality at it's best, even for a clean freak like me!\u201d", "Author": "Kiaren", "ReviewID": "UR68625340", "Content": "It was a truly good experience, the hotel was fabulous, we stayed in a deluxe suite.

We were left only two cartons of coffee per day, powdered creamer and a straw to stir! The view from our suite however (floor 42) was great, especially an night, through a full wall of windows. The bed was one of the comfiest hotel beds we've ever slept in. There was a double wardrobe containing a safe - however this was only a few inches deep and was tricky to get your belongings in. Could have done with a few more hangers. The bathroom was compact, but clean, modern and bright, with plenty of towels and toiletries provided - the robes were lovely, but I had to ask for the free hotel slippers. The maid service was quite late in the afternoon - quite anoying on the evening we wanted to get ready and out early. We enjoyed a morning in the spa, but this carried a separte charge (sauna, steam room, jacuzzi) however, the men and women had separate areas. A big letdown was the pool area. It was way too small for the size of the hote. It did have plenty of loungers, but they were all crammed close together. The music speakers around the pool were also very loud. There were'nt many umbrellas - even though it was 110 degrees, and the staff were always coming round and putting them down or taking them away, as it gets very windy in this area, and someone told us an umbrella had blown up and over the barriers - quite dangerous! The pool area was very plain with mininal planting - it was just not relaxing to sit around. The lobby bar was comfortable, but had no atmosphere and the main restaurant was always empty. Yes, it is quite a walk to get onto the strip, either through the Bellagio or through the Aria (the Aria buffets by the way were very good), but you do a lot of walking anyway.

Check in was slow, not because of the clerks, however, but because of the people in the queue in front of us who queried every last detail of every last word on paper you sign stating that you acknowledge the Vdara is a non smoking hotel and has no casino and what the resort fee entails. The room was uber clean, uber modern and the bed was even more comfortable to the one we slept in at the Bellagio last year. I also wish I had a suitcase large enough to take the entire bathroom home with me! Just to clarify a few things. When you leave your room, press the house keeping button by the door, our house keeper said that it all gets collated by a computer and when there are enough house keeping signals, they come and clean those ready to be cleaned on your floor. The walkway to Bellagio is literally a minute's walk and it's also faster to walk to Aria through the front doors of Vdara than it is to take the tram - we found that out the second day! If you want to save your legs, it takes 3 minutes on the Tram to get from Bellagio to Monte Carlo or about 10 minutes (at a very leisurely pace) to walk from Vdara, through Aria to Monte Carlo. We didn't use the turn down service but housekeeping in the morning will bring you two small bottles of water and the keurig coffee pods and creamer packs so you don't need to have the turn down service to get them! Also, if you do want to kitchenware and utensils, it took about 5 minutes for housekeeping to bring them to our room. We used room service, and I thought it was very good value for money. We didn't use silk road though but it now has a grab and go coffee bar for those who don't want to use the coffee maker in the room. Again, if you don't want to use Silk Road, your best bet would be to walk through to Aria for the fastest coffee. Location, yes Vdara is set back from the strip but it's still close to the action.

We flew in May 29 at around 10:30 pm and the strip itself was packed because of the UFC fight but the hotel check in was a breeze, only one person in front of us. The front desk explained the $15 daily resort fee (which I knew when I booked so we brought our laptop) and that the hotel was non-smoking, non-gaming. The hotel is literally a breath of fresh air as others have mentioned comparable to the smoke filled casino hotels. We cut through Bellagio to get to the strip, about 5 min. walk so it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. We were on the 30th floor overlooking the Bellagio pool and could see a bit of the fountain and the Eiffel tower. My bf was impressed with the room right when we walked in. Room was very clean, big, comfy bed, clean bathroom with all the amenities mentioned on their site, 2 big screen tv's and small fridge in the kitchenette. We didn't use the pool, room service or spa so I can't say anything about those. We hardly used the kitchenette except for storing our water and drinking coffee.

We payed $159 / night but they wanted $259 for the sat hence the two different hotels The hotel is located in the new city centre location beside the aria and the mandarin. The whole city centre set up reminded me of delta city from the film robocop. All very futuristic with a fancy shuttle linking most of the hotels. We had a room on the 43rd floor that had amazing views onto the bellagio fountains. The room itself was nice and modern with the usual nice bathroom & kitchen. We really liked the kitchens in the room and had one previous in the signature but this was more modern and out of sight from main room as in the hallway which the signature didnt have. An annoyance of the kitchen however is that there is no cutlery or cooking utensils or crockery??? were we to pack our own pots n pans? Seemed mad to have a kitchen with no bowls etc....we only used the fridge for waters but we liked buying cereal to have in the morning but there was no bowls or spoons....crazy! The other annoyance was that we were hoping to relax by the pool during the day but both days the pool was closed due to high winds so we got to use the Aria hotels pool which was actually pretty impressive. Liked also that there was no casino attached so you could get away from it all. Liked also that there was 2 lift lobbies...1 for the lower floors and 1 for the higher....made commuting from a high floor pretty quick.....maybe seems a petty comment but at the signature when we travelled from the 35th floor down there was at least 7 stops on way down.

I chose the hotel based on the corporate website (it looked lovely) and then read some of the reviews on here about service, so went in prepared that things may not be ideal. That said, my experience with TripAdvisor is that its best to look at what \"most\" people say, versus wrrying about minor complaints from a few. We paid $117/night and received a $75 resort credit so the price was definetly right. $30 cab ride from airport - seems closer but because of the street setup seems you have to go in a few circles to get there. Check in was FAST, only a few minutes (we arrived at 6pm), room was ready and we were upgraded to a Vdaha suite (separate bedroom, full kitchen, two bathrooms) - we were impressed. Room was super clean, fully equipped. I had to call to the front desk to find the hairdryer (in a \"hidden\" drawer betweent the two sinks in the main bathroom, fyi!). Free wi-fi (incl in your $15 resort fee), but note you need to sign up every 24 hours. Our room was not cleaned/made up on the second day, but that was my fault as I had used the electronic system to \"do not disturb\" and forgot to turn that off when we went out for the day - I would guess this would explain some of the other posts, too, where they have stated their room was not cleaned. When we got back to room, there was a message from housekeeping, I requested new towels and got then within 15 minutes, so for me the service was very good. Hotel smells lovely, as others have stated, not at all overpowering, and much better than the \"smoking hotels\". Pool was nice, agree it is is on the small side if the hotel was booked solid, but was fine during our stay - expensive drinks though, $14 - coffee to go downstairs cost me $8 - all of a sudden Starbucks seemed Cheap! Our only complaint was around the 2am evacuation on the night of the 14th - like others we were required to head down the stairs (was glad we were only on the 10th floor and glad we did not have small children with us, as some other guests did) - as we headed down there was mild panic in the stairway as no one knew if something had actually happened or if it was a false alarm. When we got to the bottom there were ABSOLUTELY NO STAFF, ANYWHERE, directing people what to do.We stood outside for about 20 mintues, then a man in a City Center Safety truck drove up and said it was a false alarm, we started to go back in, but then a younger man (night manager?) said no one was allowed to go back to rooms - poor communication and no one clearly in charge - this caused unneccessary panic and then frustatration for many of the guests - we just took it in our stride. They did seem concerned about making sure the property was safe before allowing people up to their rooms. This was a study in people watching, the staff had brought a few racks of robes from the laundry to assist people who had come down in various states of dress and unfortunately MANY people took advantage of this (after the crisis when we were lined up at the elevators) and took robes, even stating it was \"the least they were owed\" - Shameful, particularly the man with the young daughter who was the ringleader and encouraging this behaviour! I sincerely hope that the management of the Vdara learn from this false alarm to be better organized & prepared if there ever was an emergency. When we checked out, the front desk did acknowledge the incident (without our prompting) and requested our contact information as the managers were working on compensation for the inconvenience. The manager (?) at the bell desk also acknowledged the evacuation, which we thought was great. We did not receive the email/ phone call we were told we would receive, and although I understand it was an unfortunate event and do not expect anything from Vdara, I do think it reflects poorly that they have not followed through. We would stay aa this hotel again, the location was not a problem for u (though may be for someone older). We saw VIVA ELVIS (really great), but do not get sucked into visiting their \"VIP bar\" before the show to use the 2-for-1 coupon for a drink - our two drinks cost $17 WITH thecoupon, and this was the only time we received poor service (at Aria) - would like to stay at ARIA next time, though, looked very modern and nice. Ate at Todd English's P.U.B in Crystals Mall - very good. Also ate at the Wolfgang Puck resto there (cannot remember name), it was ok, SPAGO at Caesar's was better (our favorite).

Its almost as though its in a wind tunnel though, on two separate days there were pool chairs being blown into the pool. Drinks are also quite pricey $14 before tip.

The lobby consisted of one restaurant (Silk Road), a small seating area, a bar (Bar Vdara), and a small front desk all within relatively close quarters. The hotel room was modern looking, but definitely 'confused'.. You'll know what I mean if you stay there. The service was mediocre.. B- at best if even. We did use the bellhop/valet service who were surprisingly attentive. The front desk was nice (gave us a complimentary upgrade on the 47th floor with the Bellagio fountain view..) but room service (housekeeping, coffee refill, etc) were mediocre. The linens were dirty (all of the guests we stayed with came home with small rashes on our bodies) and the resort fee which included coffee/water never showed up in the two nights we stayed there. The room also had a pull out sofa bed but strangely no linens whatsoever in the closet.. Two requests and a \"I'll come down myself if it would speed up the process\" later, someone arrived with them. The bathroom amenities were sparse and missing quite a few things that the website promised. There was no face wash, lotion, toothbrushes, or even conditioner. There was two shampoos in the shower and a new bar of soap in the dish. And a strange number of towels... In haphazard locations. The dust also noticeably began to collect on the dark wood the following day. We do not order housekeeping room service during our stay unless the hotel has proven its ratings... And after reading some reviews we decided it was best not to. Also.. the lines during check in and check out were not as bad as some people have experienced. The restaurant was OK. We were confused at the decor and its name... We got to eat as part of the room voucher so can't really complain at the quality I suppose. FYI I didn't know, you have to pay the gratuity even if the dollar amount should be covered by the voucher.. So much for the happy tip I thought I left because I wasn't happy after I found out when I was checking out. Anyway, it was a journey to get from the hotel to the strip as other reviewers have stated. We just played at the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace but when we tried to find out way to Planet Hollywood / Paris, it was quite an epic journey.. Somehow we ended up at Aria finally and then after walking through Aria did we finally make our way back to Vdara. Unless you plan to only play at Bellagio and Caesar's Palace.. Probably not an ideal location unless you plan to take taxis everywhere. Of course, we were rejected from a taxi because they said Vdara was too close.. from across the street. Overall I wouldn't stay here again. Dirty linens is just my number one pet peeve. If you plan to make no requests to housekeeping and keep to the connecting hotels, this may be the place for you. We were able to stay for $125/night + 15% hotel tax + $15.99 resort fee and booked on the Vdara website two weeks in advance.

We were comfortable, treated very respectfully, and considered it a good value. (We got a crazy good deal on Expedia - 6 nights, airfare, and free Beatles Love tickets all for $450/person, so we really couldn't have gone wrong.) The deluxe suite had a cute little kitchen. We were told upon check-in that we could call the bell desk for any kitchen supplies that weren't already there. There were two refrigerators, one was a pay bar and one was a regular fridge. Our room service meals were set up on the table in the kitchen area. The living room was small but comfortable. At one point, we had seven people sitting in that area fairly comfortably. The bed area was spacious enough for us and comfortable. The bed itself was very comfortable, and they also provide robes and slippers. Some people might find the entire space a bit too small, but having stayed in European hotels, I found it perfectly adequate. Also, the living room and bedroom areas are not completely enclosed; there's a divider (with a flat screen TV on each side) that divides them. If you're traveling with a group or kids, that may be surprising and off-putting, but my friend and I though the setup was great. The bathroom was also very comfortable. It did have my one pet peeve that's present in almost all hotel bathrooms: No fan. What is up with that? The shower also took quite a while to heat up, but otherwise it was a very comfortable bathroom. Overall, I felt extremely comfortable in the room. Being from Seattle, I feel very dry in Vegas, but I didn't feel as dry in this room as I usually do. One weird thing about the setup of the room: The switches to the large lights by the bed, and to close the window shade, were basically in the kitchen. Why not have these by the bed? Small complaint, but a weird design choice. We had room service a few times. The portions are smaller than you'd expect from room service, but adequate and tasty enough. As room service food generally is, it wasn't exceedingly fresh but good and delivered with a smile. We also had breakfast in the Silk Road restaurant downstairs. It's the same as the room service food only fresher. Not stellar service but passable. I used the pool on a couple of occasions. Even though I'm not a Vegas pool hard-body type, I didn't feel awkward. There was a variety of shapes, sizes, and ages, and the staff seemed friendly to all. The staff was generally very helpful and kind. They always ask where you're from, so be prepared for that. :) We did have a couple of times when we called down for something and nobody came to our room, which was kind of frustrating, but definitely not a dealbreaker. Also, there was a fire alarm one night, and I think the staff handled it very well. Being a new hotel, they didn't quite know what to expect from the automated system, but they kept us as informed and comfortable as possible. I felt that they valued our safety. The next day I requested to move to a lower room (we moved from the 25th floor to the 7th floor) because after the fire alarm, being so high up made me anxious. The staff handled this very politely and sympathetically, and very efficiently too.

It took almost an hour to check-in. Partly my fault for picking the 'wrong' queue, but it's really annoying to see people who joined other queues 20 minutes later than you did getting checked in first. If they can't have enough reception staff on duty, how about one queue for all the desks? When I eventually got to the front of the queue, the welcome was indifferent. Whatever - I just wanted to get to my room. Having got there, I discovered it hadn't been cleaned. It looked like a bomb had hit it - if that's how people regularly leave their hotel rooms, I feel very, very sorry for housekeeping staff the world over. Anyway, having got back down to the lobby and asked the concierge (he was very nice) to help me as there were still huge queues to check in, I did eventually get a room, but it wasn't a good start. And there were numerous other people milling around in the lobby complaining that they couldn't get into their rooms yet (it was 7.00pm) so my problem was not an isolated one. On the plus side, the room I eventually got was lovely, on the 47th floor with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. The rooms are large, with a dining/kitchen area, separate sitting and sleeping areas (both with their own large, flat screen TVs) and nice bathrooms with separate shower and tub. I thought the room was excellent value for the $135 I had paid. My only complaint would be that the electronically operated blackout blinds don't completely cover the windows and therefore don't block out the light particularly effectively. There's also some noise from the main road which runs behind all the Strip hotels. The location is not as inconvenient as I'd feared. With no casino to walk through in Vdara, it's a very short journey down in the lift and along a covered walkway to the Bellagio Spa Tower wing, from which you can either continue through the Bellagio and out onto the strip, or take a tram to Aria/Crystals and continue from there. I certainly wouldn't let the location put your off if you want to be center strip. Anyway, even when I got into my room, Vdara hadn't quite finished with me. The fire alarm went off at 2.00am, very loudly indeed, and with flashing lights to boot. It was not a pleasant awakening, and nor was the thought of walking down all 47 floors to get out. Weirdly, the lifts were still working while the alarm was ringing, so with a couple of other guests from my floor, I exited that way. I'd had the presence of mind to get dressed & grab my purse on the way out, so I went off to the Bellagio and played on the slots for a while, but it was 3.15 by the time they figured out what was wrong with the alarm system and we all got back into our rooms.

The second room was an upgrade overlooking the pool (actually on a much lower floor). The sink in the kitchen area smelled terrible. Its a waste disposal unit and hadn't been cleaned out. When temperatures are at Vegas levels this isn't good. Back to reception for another upgrade this time on the 36th floor overlooking the Fountains of the Bellagio. Thank you Rachel on Reception for being so helpful. I actually think she was terribly embarrassed about the whole situation. The hotel itself is pretty lifeless. The restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch. Room service ends at 10pm. During our 7 night stay we were awoken by the Fire Alarm at 2am. The very few staff on duty at this time were as confused and disorganised as the guests. After decending 36 floors some staff members were telling us to return to our rooms (while the alarm was still sounding), others told us to evacuate. Not good. No one seemed to be in overall control of the situation. After about an hour we returned to our rooms only to be woken again about 20 minutes later by the PA system telling us that the cause of the alarm was unknown and that they were still investigating. The next day we were still unclear whether it indeed had been a false alarm. The Concierge also managed to book us a restaurant reservation on the wrong evening which could have been quite embarassing if we hadn't double checked ourselves.

I go to Vegas fairly often and have stayed at Bellagio, Palazzo, Venetian, Encore, TheHotel etc. And strangely enough I had the best time at Vdara. Maybe I was just sick of the smoke and tired of the ringing sounds and endless crowds the hotels with casinos bring. So Vdara was a welcome change. After a night of shows, drinking, dancing, and partying it was nice to come back to a serene, spacious and beautiful room. When we first arrived, however, I have to admit that it took about 45 minutes to check in. I was fuming mad but knowing how the hotel industry worked, I asked very nicely if there was anything they could do for me since I was so patient and I was promptly upgraded to a one bedroom penthouse suite! They also delivered a free bottle of champagne to our room. The next day I called the concierge and Evan, who is awesome, booked us spa appointments and got us on the list to a few of the hottest clubs in town. We weren't in our room when the alarm went off at 2 am but that sucked I'm sure. The spa appointment was great! You can't beat 130 bucks for a 60 minute massage at a 5 star hotel. Had breakfast at silk road. The food was fine but the service was so slow! Don't know if I'd eat there again. It's about a 5 minute walk to bellagio and a 2 minute walk to aria so there are plenty of casinos and traditional vegas excitement nearby. There is also a tram that connects bellagio, vdara, aria, and monte carlo. Monte carlo has a ton of cheap eats and also had a 24 hour cafe that fulfilled my 4am craving for steak and eggs. Essentially, I got to relax and unwind at vdara after hitting the strip pretty hard all night. Keep in mind that it is a new hotel so it's going to have a few glitches. Also, it's a condo/hotel so that may explain why it's not as heavily staffed as other hotels. Finally, even though the lag time on service makes you angry, ask nicely and they'll pretty much give you anything you ask for. For me, I paid 120 a night for a penthouse suite, got free champagne, free brunch, discounts on spa services, and vip at haze, the bank and xs. Pros: huge, beautiful, clean rooms. A peaceful environment and friendly staff. Great location. Vons.com delivers to vdara since it's a condo/hotel. (I got alcohol and snacks delivered free). Cons: super slow service.

Upon walking into the Vdara, the smell of men's cologne is overpowering. Why the hotel chooses to use this scent as air freshener is beyond me. The front desk line was long and slow. On the plus side, the elevators were fast and our room was new, modern, and nice. Everything we needed was there, except coffee creamer. The hotel charges a $15 per night resort fee for coffee, water, a newspaper, etc. Fine-so where is my creamer? I called housekeeping several times for creamer. It never arrived. I had to approach housekeeping in the hallways and hit them up. The lack of customer service was just getting started. At 2:00am Friday night, as stated in a number of other posts, an emergency alarm blared and told us to evacuate immediately. We shuffled into the lobby and were milling around aimlessly. Not a SINGLE employee knew what was going on. The hotel is clearly understaffed, and the employees actually present are clueless. Not a single employee said \"I don't know what is going on, but I'll look into it and get back to you.\" We decided after 10 minutes to go back upstairs. When we got there, I phoned the front desk and they said that we should not have gone back to our room. I inquired why a hotel employee wasn't at the elevators telling the hotel guests this. They weren't telling the guests anything! We went back to sleep and were woken three more times by a blaring message stating that the emergency alarm had been cleared. The next day, we went to the underwhelming pool and were served an overpriced drink by a surly and slow cocktail waitress. I'm willing to pay Vegas prices obviously, but with a bad attitude and no lush palm trees? No thanks. We'll head over to Mandalay Bay for our expensive drinks and hotel rooms. Don't do us any favors by overcharging us to stay at your charmless hotel. None of the staff mentioned anything about the false alarm (via a letter in our room or a telephone call or a posting somewhere). Nothing! It was like it never happened. I understand that things happen, but the lack of any response by a single staff member is just poor customer relations. I asked the lady at the front desk upon checking out (another long line at 8 am) about what the hotel might be doing to compensate guests for the false alarm and she told me vaguely that a manager will be contacting me within a week. What that means, I have no idea! Honestly, an explanation and maybe a free drink coupon would have satisfied my husband and me. Extra coffee creamer packets even! Anything resembling customer service would have been appreciated. By the way, there is one bar in the lobby, so if you want to buy coffee or breakfast or anything else, you're walking. There was a restaurant in the lobby, but it never looked open and the reviews for it are poor. I have been telling all my friends and family to AVOID the Vdara.

What a disaster! We arrived late on our first night (around midnight) and were told that our room still wasn't ready. The hotel suggested that we have comp drinks in the lounge while we waited. After waiting 30 minutes for our first round of drinks, it was last call. We ended up waiting an hour and a half for our room to be cleaned up, 9 hours after check in time! On a positive note, the room was beautiful! Great bed and linens, large bathroom with a soaker tub and a large standing shower. Although it has a small kitchenette, don't expect anything stocked aside from coffee mugs. It would have been nice to have at least a couple plates and some utensils. The pool and spa are great! Nice and small compared to a lot of the other Vegas properties. On our third night, the fire alarm went off at 2:00 AM and they evacuated the entire hotel. It was a mess and we did not receive any clear communication from the hotel on what was going on. My partner and I noticed that the fire alarm strobe lights in the hotel had turned off, which was the only signal that we had that we could go back in. About 30 minutes after we were back in the room, the management got on the PA system to say that the alarm had been resolved, waking us back up again. There were a total of eight such announcements, we didn't get back to sleep until 4:00 AM. The hotel's response to each issue was lukewarm at best. With the room not being ready, I had to search out a manager to speak with. We agreed that a couples massage would be a good way to resolve the issue (unfortunately, they ended up booking us separately). With the evacuation, the hotel was still trying to figure out why the alarm went off and they were not providing any immediate compensation for the issue. Apparently they are working on a package for all the guests at the time. I would assume that this would be a discount on staying there again, which I have no plans to do.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cFantastic - great location, smoke-free and central - so quiet too.\u201d", "Author": "Welly_China_Girl", "ReviewID": "UR64180558", "Content": "If you are wanting a smoke-free, quiet but central hotel, then this is the place. I choose this hotel as I wanted a really nice Vegas experience, and the other 5-star hotels seem to be showing their age (based on other tripadvisor reviews). I wasn't disappointed - this place was great, and even my hard-to-please boyfriend was impressed. Because we preferred smoke-free, it was a toss-up between Signature at MGM Grand and Vdara - Vdara won out because it was newer and I think better-located. In summary - we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting smoke free and a quiet retreat but still central to the rest of the Vegas action. Staff friendly, rooms and lobbies beautifully appointed and well-maintained, what more could you want! No issues with service or staff. Aria casino and restaurants is only 2 mins walk away if you need a casino. If we come back to Vegas, we will definitely stay here again. Lobby: Being a brand new hotel, the lobby is beautifully decorated, perfumed with something heavenly, and very pleasant to be in. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and there were 2 people in front of us. (Later that afternoon we wandered past Caesar's Palace - there was a queue of 100 people waiting to check in). Checkin was quick and efficient. Yes there's a $15 resort fee but that seems to be standard at this level of hotel. We booked a Vdara suite (via Travelocity) and were hoping for an upgrade (as previous reviewers were lucky to get!) but unfortunately not this time - maybe we stayed too long (5 nights). Ask for a higher floor to get the best views. Vdara suites have a choice of City or Mountain views (no strip views, apparently) - we chose City views and got room 52005 on the 52nd floor. Not sure what the mountain view looked like, but the city view was mesmerising. We could see the back of the Luxor (see photo) and a few of the strip hotels. In the corridor outside our room, we could see the Bellagio fountains at night. Every night I would turn off all the room lights just to look at the view - very calming. Either Vdara is a hidden gem that not many people know about, or it's not doing so well - the lobby was one of the quietest i've seen on the strip, we never saw any other guests on our floor and only sometimes had to share a lift. Lift by the way is very quick for 50 floors! So nice to come back to Vdara every night after the hustle and bustle of the Bellagio. Room: Room was beautifully appointed. This suite comprised an open plan living-dining-kitchen area, a king-sized bedroom with desk, and a bathroom with shower and bath. All three rooms had 180-degree views, and being on 52nd floor, you could even use the bath to enjoy the view without any worries. There were 2x 42\" TVs and a media hub that output HDMI as well as charging ipods etc. Great selection of HDTV channels. Wifi internet only (there was a ethernet cable but it didn't seem to have internet access). In-room safe is vertical which means laptops/netbooks need to be standing up. Sofa and seats weren't that comfortable, although i think the sofa was a foldout queen bed which could explain the hardness. Blinds and blackouts electronically controlled - although black-out had a couple of gaps. We slept really well but there was a weird fan noise on one side of bed that wouldn't turn off with the air-conditioning. I didn't get around to asking about it so can't complain. Downside would be the kitchen amenities - Keurig coffee maker provided but standard package of sachet cremer sugar and plastic stirrer provided. No teabags (I'm a teadrinker, but had brought my own) and had to request a kettle for boiling water (Later on i figured out how to do this with the coffee maker). Despite providing a fully-functioning kitchen suite, only mugs and glasses are provided. Would have been nice (given quality of rest of hotel) to have provided plates and knives and forks etc - we often came back with a dessert or leftovers, but nothing to eat them with. When I checked in, I did ask for the kitchen to be stocked but this request was never filled - after day 2 i figured i probably wasn't going to cook anything so didn't request again, but plates would have been nice anyway. Even a dishcloth would have been useful. There is a working dryer and washer - but no detergents. While Bellagio has a couple of shops neither stocked washing liquid or fresh milk. The CVS has a much better selection of snacks and stuff. I ended up buying a bottle of Tide and hopefully leaving it for the next guests. (CVS is best located by catching a tram to Monte Carlo, and walking through casino to the strip, and it's on the left as you exit Monte Carlo). You can try going by Bellagio & strip but that requires crossing two road walkways and takes longer). Bathroom: Quality fitout, two sinks and nice Aveda toiletries that were always well replenished. Towels still lovely and soft. Almost forgot, our suite had a 'guest' toilet as well - having 2 bathrooms came in handy sometimes! Location We didn't have a car so can't comment on valet parking. This hotel is located behind the Bellagio (a 2-min walk) but probably about 10 minutes from the strip by the time you navigate Bellagio's lobby corridors. It's a 2 min walk to the free tram that runs between Bellagio and Aria/Crystals and Aria/Monte Carlo. Or it's just a 2min walk to Aria, where there's a casino and lots of eating places. I felt this was really centrally located, smack-bang in the middle of the strip - you have to do lots of walking in Vegas anyway if you want to see stuff. The bus that goes up and down the strip (the gold ones go to the Premium Outlet more) departs from Paris across the strip, and drops off at Bellagio on the way back and costs $3 for a 2-hour pass, or $7 for a 24 hour pass. We never go to try the restaurant or bar as we were often out and about. We did use the Aria buffet a couple of times and charged it back to the room which was handy. Standard buffet fare there ($15 for breakfast, $27 for dinner I think - dinner included king-crab legs). Also didn't use the pool as it got really windy and cold the week we were there. It looked nice though! Didn't use gym or spa either. Service was great. The housekeeping was really efficient and friendly, tidied up all our mess every time and always replaced anything we'd used up. I was a little worried given some of the other comments on tripadvisor, but no issues whatsover. We had a great stay and I would thoroughly recommend, especially if you get a good rate. We used travelocity and got a nice rate of $1060 for 5 nights (Sun thru Thurs) for Vdara suite including flights from SFO (baggage and resort fee extra).", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cVdara S*U*C*K*S Worst Experience at a Hotel\u201d", "Author": "kittykreidler", "ReviewID": "UR64078664", "Content": "I have worked in the hotel industry and this place IS TERRIBLE! My best friend and I decided to take a short trip to Vegas for our birthdays. She lives in Seattle and I live in LA, so I drive, pick her up at the airport in Vegas and we excitedly proceed to check in at the Vdara. We chose this hotel because of the non-smoking and non-casino atmosphere. First, we couldn't FIND it. We could SEE it but getting on the road to FIND it was ridiculous. Lotsa u-turns later, we pull up. I don't like valeting my car. I was FORCED to valet. Then the check-in line was almost OUT the front door. After TWO HOURS we finally get to the desk. By this time it's 5:30. We drove up at a little after 3!!!!!!!!!! -- In part here is a complaint letter I sent to Jim Murren Chairman of the Board and CEO of MGM Las Vegas (who I might add WAS one of MY clients at a 5 star hotel not so long ago... -- Navigating the maze of surface roads had us going in circles. The check-in line was outrageously long and took us more than two hours from entering the lobby until getting in our room. The front desk staff were EXTREMELY RUDE, totally unprofessional, kept mispronouncing our names, and the longer we stood there, the more money they wanted us to provide as a deposit! As it was they wanted $650 for us to stay for three nights!!!!!!!!!!!! The front desk manager was so obnoxious we were actually standing there with our mouths open, and other guests checking in could overhear him belittling us, which was horrific. Even before checking in he accused us of \"wanting to trash the room\" and insinuated repeatedly that we \"may smoke in the room\". Neither one of us smoke, and in fact are both ALLERGIC to cigarette smoke, which is WHY I specifically chose a non-smoking hotel! The only reason we didn't walk out then was because it was a Saturday and rooms were pricey and already booked up. The staff sneered at us despite my having pre-paid our first night on my debit card (which is a VISA). They spoke condescendingly and loudly and unprofessionally about us using our debit cards. I had to ask for mine back twice, and he (the front desk manager) held my friends card up and loudly said \"THIS IS A DEBIT CARD\"!!! When I reserved the room (with a lovely reservation agent on my debit card) never once did anyone disclose 'the fine print' about prices, security deposits and the true resort fee price and taxes. Those prices changed several times depending on who we spoke to at the front desk, and WE WERE HUMILIATED!!!!! I worked for the Montage Beverly Hills from its opening and provided outstanding customer service on a daily basis and I must say I have NEVER BEEN treated SO poorly upon checking in anywhere. In addition, the hallways and room smelled like raw sewage. They sent us an inexpensive bottle of champagne (we think) to 'appease' us for the room smell but nobody called to explain, apologize or try to remedy the situation. So we decided NOT to spend another cent at Vdara, and moved to another hotel which upgraded us, took our debit cards WITHOUT a security deposit and treated us beautifully...even comping us a free breakfast AND dinner!! I wrote my letter and know that Mr. Murren got it. So I gave them a chance to rectify the situation and make it up to me and my friend. I received a letter apologizing today. They asked us to COME BACK and they would upgrade us. FAT CHANCE! Never will I set foot in Vdara again.

The spa is HUGE and gorgeous. Spend some time there... lots of amenities, snacks, teas, etc. And, all the girlie things if you forgot something (hair gel, curling irons, deodorant, qtips, baby powder, etc). The gym was very busy in the mornings, practically empty afternoons and early evenings. It would have been nice if the air-con was set to something cooler... kind of warm for a gym. Complimentary coffee and bottled water, which I made use of through-out the day. The pool is nice... not poor, but not amazing. Just nice. The first time I went, the guys at the front bent over backwards to help \"how many towels? let me help you find a chair? do you want shade? here that towel got wet, let me bring you another\" and I felt bad that I hadn't brought a couple of bucks cash for a tip. So the next day, I was prepared, but the two ladies at the entrance couldn't care less... \"grab a towel, sit anywhere you want\". Hmmm. The food at the pool is extraordinary, so even though I didn't eat at the restaurant, I'll assume it has great food too! The music is only too loud if you sit on the far side where the speakers are. Service pool-side from servers is slow.... I don't know if there's not enough people, or if the hold-up is at the bar and restaurant. Seriously, I sat half an hour and no one offered me anything, I finally snagged a waitress and asked for a menu, then she never came back to take an order. I waited about 15 minutes, finally snagged a guy to order, and then another 20 minutes for drink and food. Wow, good thing the drink was good and the food amazing. One day they were handing out free slushie drink samples at the pool, I thought that was a nice touch. Kitchens have no utensils... so if you bring any food home, grab some plastics. Nice oversize aveda products in bathroom. Comfortable bed. The housekeeping service was over-the-top... they've clearly picked it up a notch in that department.

And I compare the two because when I made my reservations theHotel and Vdara were exactly the same price, and I suspect they would be most other dates as well. Frankly Vdara feels like a Courtyard by Marriott room with a few extra $$, whereas theHotel is actually a luxury hotel. Where does theHotel outshine Vdara: 1) Location - Vdara is really in the back alley of CityCenter, very long walk to anything. theHotel being attached to Mandalay and the tram there is pretty well located. 2) Rooms - theHotel just feels a lot classier; and there are touches like the desk chair at theHotel is a real desk chair, at Vdara they cheaped out and just put another side chair from their tables - it doesn't have proper support or any height adjustment. 3) Bathroom - TV in the bathroom at theHotel and the tub is significantly larger at theHotel as well. Plus the washbasin and shower are larger as well, and the toilet has a door at theHotel, not at Vdara. 4) Room organization and layout is just a lot better at theHotel as well, and theHotel gives you an extra 1/2 bath, not at Vdara except the most expensive suites. 5) Gym is really a 'workout room' at Vdara - no freeweights, it's very small and ill-equipped. 6) Pool at Vdara is also weak in comparison.

I was hoping for a suite on a higher floor, but once we got into the room we were so happy there we didn't bother moving.

There is a hallway leading to the Bellagio, and the new Aria hotel is across from the front entrance, so entertainment is always close at hand. Vdara is not directly on the strip, so we found that going out through Crystals, part of the CityCenter, was the best way to get to the strip, right across from Planet Hollywood. Taking the very frequent tram between Bellagio and Monte Carlo with stops in between was great as well. The pool is heated and huge fluffy towels are among the ample deck loungers.

I knew very little about it before I went, besides some of the comments from reviews I read here. First thing I noticed that it is set quite far back from the strip. It is connected to the Bellagio which you have to walk all the way through to get to the strip, and there's also a tram that stops at Aria and the Monte Carlo. Bring comfortable shoes or be prepared to cab it everywhere. I read something on here about the hotel smells amazing, and it really is true. They pump in this scent that is VERY noticeable, I liked it. Not sure it would be to everyone's taste. The hotel is very much a hotel, not set up for the bar or casino crowd (which is what we were going for this time around). The one bar/lounge they have is pretty small but open and has a seating area outside that's very cozy looking. It wasn't very busy ever, despite the hotel being sold out when we were there. Didn't try the restaurant, only because there were other places I really wanted to go to. On arrival, we were upgraded to a bigger suite since all the regular rooms had been sold out to people booking a special package deal they were offering. Nice! The suite was huge and beautiful, on the 45th floor with a pretty nice view. It had a kitchen, dining room, two bathrooms, a washer and dryer, separate bedroom. Bathroom had a massive soaker tub. Decor was contemporary and tasteful. The room smelled new. My complaints are not huge but they impacted me. This was an expensive room, and there were NO TOWELS anywhere in the suite, in either bathroom. We had to call down to get them, and they only put them in the main bathroom on the second day, and finally put a hand towel in the second bathroom the day before we left. The microwave had food in it. We couldn't get through to the spa for three days even though they were open from 6 am to 9 pm. Couldn't get through to housekeeping or the front desk at midnight when we needed extra bedding for the pull out. There is no place in the hotel to go grab a coffee or a snack or even a magazine late at night, which I'm used to in most hotels. I'd have to take a ten minute walk over to the Bellagio. All the staff we talked to were very pleasant, friendly, and helpful. They seemed genuinely interested in making our stay great. I was a little disappointed to be told that we had trouble reaching the spa, front deak and housekeeping because they were \"fully booked and the level of service this week has been substandard.\" Wasn't sure what to say to that! I would say it's a nice place to stay if you want to avoid crowds and the bar/casino atmosphere. It's very quiet here.

That being said, I have to agree, the Vdara is a beautiful hotel, the rooms are modern and clean, the kitchenette is a great feature, the bathrooms are nice, and the bed is comfortable, however... there are some flaws that need to be fixed. When we arrived at the hotel the bell man got the doors for us and took our bags, then we went to the front desk and the check in went smoothly and they even gave us a free upgrade! Good start. Went up to our suite and it was gorgeous, we had a beautiful kitchen, which was a HUGE plus, having the fridge and the microwave was convenient, especially for left-overs. Called down to the bell desk, they brought up the bags right away. Then, when looking around the room, we noticed we didn't have any towels or soap, lotions, etc. Called down to house keeping and they said they would bring some stuff up. Also, noticed the toilet hadn't been flushed either, which was gross, there were drink rings on the glass tables and the microwave hadn't been cleaned inside, so it really wasn't perfect. Then we left the hotel. Came back to the room and we had our towels and a plastic bag on the counter with our soaps and stuff, as opposed to having it set out. We then called down to housekeeping to have the sofa bed made up, but there was no answer, so we called down to the front desk, no answer there either. Tried a couple more times, no luck, so we used some of the bedding from the other bed. We were able to get ahold of them the next day to ask them to make up the sofa bed, which they did for the rest of our stay. On our second to last day, we tried to call the spa to book massages for our last day, but there was no answer, we tried to go down to the spa in person, but didn't make it before closing, so we didn't get to try out the spa, which was more frustrating than anything. When we checked out we mentioned it to the front desk clerk and she said the hotel was booked to capacity, so their service standards were falling short. As far as location goes, it's not bad, the tram to the Monte Carlo is convenient and walking to the Bellagio is good to. The only problem is there isn't a coffee shop or convenience store at the hotel at all, so you have to go pretty far to get something like a pop or tylenol.

The last 3 or 4 times we have stayed at The Hotel at Mandalay, which has consistently offered good service and great rooms, but we did find it a bit of a hike to get to some of the other places on the Strip. This time we decided to try Vdara, one of the new hotels in the recently opened City Center complex. Vdara sits towards the back end of City Center, about a 70 yard walk from the North Entrance of Aria. It also connected to the back of Bellagio (near the pool and convention center) and is very close to the City Center monorail station that leaves from this location as well. We got to Vdara on Thursday evening, around 8pm. There was no lineup and we immediately were checked into our Deluxe Suite. We did not pay extra for the Strip View and our room, which was on the 46 floor, still had a nice view. We faced out towards The Palms and Rio and also had a great view of the mountains. We could also see the part of the Bellagio and a small portion of their fountains. The room itself was very nice. Compared to the standard suite at The Hotel, it was a little smaller. It had a small cooktop, microwave, and small fridge. Iron/ironing board were in the room. It had one bathroom with a seperate large tub and shower. It did not have the second half-bath that The Hotel suites have. There was a seperate sitting area with a 42\" flatscreen tv and then a partial wall with the bed on the other side. There was a second 42\" flatscreen on the otherside of the wall where the bed was. The suite in The Hotel are more of a classic one bedroom layout while the Vdara room is more of what I would call a \"bachelor suite\". The room had nice big windows with motorized blinds and shades. During the day the room was a lot brighter than the rooms at The Hotel. The blinds kepts things nice and dark when sleeping. Housekeeping was efficient and provided us with free extra coffee pods for the single serving coffee maker in the room. Vdara has a small bar in the lobby and a restaurant that is open only for breakfast and lunch. We ate a late breakfast/early lunch meal their one day and it was good but the rest of time ate elsewhere. Vdara does not have a casino. This could be a big negative for some. For us it was a plus. We enjoyed the tranquility and both Bellagio and Aria are a very short walk away. We enjoyed the location of Vdara and did a fair bit of shopping at Bellagio and Caesar's this time, so it was nice being close. The biggest advantage of Vdara was on Sunday when we were getting ready to leave at about 2pm. We had just walked over from Aria, where there was a huge lineup for cabs and the valet was swamped. At Vdara there were just a couple people waiting for cabs and we got picked up right away. There were also no lines at the checkout. Big plus. Vdara charges a $15 daily resort fee, but this covers internet, gym use, a daily newspaper, and what not. I used the gym a few times over the weekend and it was clean and well maintained. I never had to wait for machines but it wouldn't surprise me if at times it could get full. I went in the mornings on Friday and Sunday. There is wireless and wired internet in the rooms. I stuck with the wifi and it worked great - very fast and no issues. At The Hotel you pay per computer that you connect which was a real hassle with two people and two different laptops plus my Zune and my wife's iPod touch. No issues at Vdara. All could be hooked up with no issues and not having to pay more than the $15 resort fee. We would definitely return to Vdara in the future. I still liked the suites at The Hotel at little better, but my wife said she preferred the Vdara room. The location is great, the less crowded atmosphere nice, and the lack of lineups a major plus. Hopefully they keep things up to the high standard.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201ca beautiful high-tech inconvenience\u201d", "Author": "znine", "ReviewID": "UR61051949", "Content": "Before we arrived at the Vdara, the hotel sent me an e-mail that was so over-the-top it bordered on the suggestive, containing sentences such as, \"We are committed to providing personalized experiences, leaving you emotionally connected to our employees and our brand.\" As it turns out, I definitely felt some emotion about the employees working at the hotel, but it probably wasn't the kind the author of the e-mail intended. The Vdara is a beautiful, quiet, high-tech hotel located a half block off the Strip. But it's actually really hard to get to the Strip from the hotel -- you either have to walk through the Aria (and its dark smoke-filled casino) and then do a complete circle through the Crystals mall, or you can take a circuitous route through the Bellagio for 15 minutes, or you can try to negotiate a construction zone. I'm not even sure the third option works at the moment. So if proximity to the Strip is important, you might want to stay somewhere else. We had a two-bedroom penthouse on the 54th floor. The view, particularly at night, was stunning, and I imagine it would be even better on the other side of the hotel. The room was equally lovely, and included a huge kitchen that was devoid of any cooking utensils other than coffee cups and wine glasses. A nice touch was a fridge with free water bottles. There was also a washing machine, but it was one of those wash-and-dry-in-the-same-unit machines without any venting to the outside, so the \"dryer\" proposed taking 3 hours and 50 minutes to cook our clothes dry -- not a great thing to learn two hours before you were planning to check out. Maybe a warning sign would be in order? Our kids loved the pool, which is cleverly perched above the entrance to the hotel and is about as secluded as you can get a few hundred feet from an Interstate highway. The Spa was also a hit, as was the French toast at the restaurant, which is only open for breakfast and lunch. My main complaint about the hotel involved the staff's complete inability to deal with the numerous high-tech failures that afflicted our room. 12 hours into our stay the management decided to turn on the system that forced you to swipe your room key in the elevator before it would take you to your floor. At this first this wasn't working for anyone, but then it seemed we were the only remaining victims. Every time we wanted to return to our room we would have to seek out someone, usually at the front desk, who would first accuse us of improper card swiping. Then they would use their secret power key to let us push our floor number. But at that point, they assumed the problem was solved. I guess they thought we would stay in our room until we checked out? No one ever followed up or tried to find a workaround. Our phone stopped working the last day -- calling the front desk would just ring endlessly. The response? \"We've been having problems.\" A visit to the front desk resulted in someone \"resetting\" the internet, which didn't help. After complaining to the management, we were offered about 5% off our bill, which I suppose is appropriate given that we probably spent 5% of our stay trying to figure out how to get up to our room. Another annoyance was that after contacting the hotel about an item I left behind after departing, it took three phone calls over the course of three days to get someone to deal with it properly. If you are willing to gamble that nothing will break and you won't need any special attention when you stay at the Vdara, you might have a perfect time. I suppose making bets is what Las Vegas is about, but shouldn't a perfect hotel be about predictability, no matter where it's located?", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cA qualified thumbs up\u201d", "Author": "sydneytraveller69", "ReviewID": "UR61043179", "Content": "We were in Vegas for a few days and wanted a central hotel so we could walk everywhere. Vdara certainly fits this bill, and the No Smoking policy was also a big factor in choosing this hotel. Everything was top-notch in quality. We were in a Panoramic Suite - nice large bedroom, separate sitting area, decent size bathroom (with Vdara branded towels that felt and smelled fresh and new) and an kitchenette/dining area. The bed is wierd though - on one had it is incredibly comfortable, but also felt very hot - probably due to the mattress protector (or whatever it is). The whole CityCenter complex takes a while to work out how to get around - another important thing to note is that Vdara is set back from the Strip. Which means its a bit of a hike to even get out onto the street. It may well improve once the final construction work finishes, which doesn't look that far away. We didn't interact much with the staff - what little we did was pleasant enough. Two complaints: firstly, when we checked in, the girl checking us in absolutely gushed about the view from our room. I mean she REALLY raved about how good it was! Unfortunately she put us in a room on the 9th floor, which meant that all we looked at was the side of one building from one side, across the large circular driving entrance to the sister ARIA hotel on another and across to a car park on the third side. Considering the hotel has 57 floors, we needed to be much higher up to warrant the staff raving about the view. Particularly as Vdara is set back from the Strip itself. Once we discovered to walkway connecting it to the Bellagio, we tended to use this to get out to the Strip. Secondly, the pool area, which had only just opened a couple of days before we arrived (and is very nice), was spoiled by a DJ who felt the need to pump up the volume to an earsplitting level. I don't know about anyone else, but I was trying to use the pool to relax from the hectic-ness of the rest of Vegas. We didn't try the spa or the restaurant so can't comment on those.

He was friendly and well knowledgable of the hotel, he even provided us a complimentry upgrade to our existing room.

The waiter was a little off so to say in a polite way. I then proceeded to the concierge as I needed to find a house phone since I locked myself out of my room, she was very rude. The way I see it, there are always a few in every group. I was not going to let this discourage me since everyone else had been so polite and accomidating. I went to the workout room and the spa for a treatment. Again, everyone was so polite and knowledgable. The 90 minute lavender massage that I was treated to by \"Jasmine\" was amazing to say the least! She definately is an asset to the spa! Soon after our spa treatments, we went to the pool. It was clean and the pool attendent found us 3 chairs and provided us towels, Within minutes the waiter came over for our food and beverage order. Great food and yummy drinks!

It is very convenient as they have a direct pathway that leads you into the Bellagio with no hassles. I am a frequent traveler myself and have stayed in numerous hotels. IE: Hilton, Marriot, Starwood and the list goes on and on. Infact, I work at a 5 star resort in Phoenix for the past 3 years so I am very familiar on hotel and resort operations. I would recommend Vdara to anyone that appreciates strong customer service within a beautiful hotel. I have decided for me that I will stay at Vdara in the future when we visit Las Vegas again which is very frequent.

If it only claimed to be a four star hotel (which is what it really is), it might just have squeaked a four circle review from me. The problem is that it falls far below the standard it has set for itself. However, that said, the room rates that are being offered at the moment are also much lower than you would expect for a five star property, so it balances out somewhat. First, the good things. Vdara is a brand new property of exquisitely modern yet comfortable design. The lobby/bar/restaurant area is extremely elegant. The guest rooms are very spacious with a separate kitchenette, and the bathrooms have a separate walk in shower and deep soaking tub. The outer wall is slightly curved and the window runs along the length, providing a glorious panoramic view. The reason for the unusually large rooms is because this property was built primarlly to be a condo/timeshare resort - but given the current economic climate it is only likely to attract regular hotel business. Now, the bad. The doors to the guest rooms will not swing shut behind you as is normally the case - especially in a modern hotel. You need to pull them firmly closed (and it is easy to forget this). That is a terrible design flaw and a serious security issue. The lighting in the bathroom is poor. It is too dim for applying makeup (even using the lit magnifying mirror) and yet it still manages to be completely unflattering (they clearly did not have a female designer check it out!). The pool was closed during my visit, even though the weather was sunny and in the 70s (the reason cited for it being closed was poor weather). The pool is highly featured on the website and is something I, like a number of others, wanted to make use of. It strikes me that they don't want to pay for a pool attendant while the hotel is under capacity and it was extra galling for me as I had a view from my room of the Bellagio guests sunning themselves by their pool. Your resort fee covers entry to the fitness centre but not to the spa. That will cost you another $25, which is inappropriate for a five star property, especially when you are already paying a resort fee of $15 a day. Service is poor. Don't get me wrong, everyone at the hotel is extremely nice and polite. They just haven't got their act together yet and are inefficient. The first day, the maid was a no show until late afternoon. She managed to forget to replace the empty tissue box and replenish the coffee condiments. The next day, the room had still not been serviced by 9pm! We called and got them to come up while we went to dinner but again, they did not replenish the condiments and nor did they provide a fresh toilet roll even though the current one was down to the wire. The next morning we called to get this fixed. The rigamarole we went through to get a roll of toilet tissue was almost comical, with a plumber showing up at one point to unclog the loo - no, all we need is a roll of toilet paper!! It took a couple of hours to acheive this simple goal. The Silk Road restaurant at the hotel (which is recommended, although I did not get the opportunity to try it) only opens for breakfast and lunch. I just don't think a hotel without an evening restaurant gets to be rated five star. I guess it may start operating in the evenings when the hotel begins to acheive a higher occupancy rate and to be fair, as I said earlier, the room prices are not five star yet either. There are some complaints from other reviewers I would like to address. No, the kitchenettes do not come stocked with equipment but, they now inform you at check in that housekeeping will gladly bring it on request so that is no longer an issue. The walkway to the Bellagio is NOT difficult to find. It is clearly signposted and there are plenty of staff to ask for directions, but I entirely agree it should be kept open past midnight. Getting over to Aria is a bit of a pain. The official sidewalk takes you on a long walk. The most obvious looking path tricks you and takes you off into the parking lot and what is actually the shortest route, is a hairy dodge in and out through the taxi rank. That's just poor overall design of City Center though, rather than of Vdara itself. As to the resort fee issue. Well, the value of that depends on what you want to do at the hotel. It covers wireless internet access. You can expect to pay at least $15 a day at other Vegas hotels for that alone. It covers gym access, which you would also expect to pay extra for at the other hotels. You also get, in addition to the minibar, a fridge for your own use which is stocked with water and coffee, which is not common in Vegas and although not worth $15 on its own, is good in combination with the wireless and gym (which for me, are amenities I want and use). One more thing. There is no self parking at Vdara. Valet Parking is complimentary - but obviously you have to tip. In summation, Vdara is not bad value at the moment and offers spacious and attractive accommodation. If you are familiar with the five star experience and go in expecting that, you will be disappointed, but if you accept it for what it really is (a four star serviced condo property) you will be fine. And one tip: request a room on a high floor at the back of the property - they have fantastic views over the Bellagio fountains.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wheeling, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cOne Awesome Honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "LasVegasLovers", "ReviewID": "UR59731511", "Content": "From the moment we stepped out of the vehicle we were in, to the final step we took off the prperty on the final day, it was like being in heaven. Our stay was for 6 nights and we were not disappointed at all. From the Front Desk to the Bell Hop as well as the maid service, it was all 5 Star impecable service. The linens in the room was superior. We had a room that had the divider that divided the living room from the dining room. We had a view of the Effel' Tower and a partial view of he Fountains at The Bellagio. Because we were on our honeymoon, we were greeted with a bottle of Champagne on ice when we returned from getting some dinner. Check out was very easy and everytime we called the front desk or anyother service, they always greeted us by our last name. What we liked about it as well, is that there was a FREE Tram running from the Vdara to the Monte Carlo. It stops at Aria (hotel next to it) Crystals (Mini-Mall) and the Monte Carlo. If you are looking for cheap eats, we would recommend going to the Monte Carlo. They have a food court with resonable food selection and prices. We ate at Aria's The Buffet on a Sunday. It was brunch and cost os over $50 for two. The food was very exotic, so if your not into international food, then its not for you. They do have breakfast buffet for $15 during the week, but do not forget that Las Vegas has a 8.75% sales tax on EVERYTHING.

I got back yesterday and couldn't wait to right a review of the hotel, especially to counter the negative ones that nearly dissuaded me from staying there. As I said above, if I were to listen to have listened to the negative reviews placed about this hotel I wouldn't have opted to stay there. The hotel is very clean, very relaxing and very serene. The staff are ALL polite and friendly, made more impressive by the fact that many of the staff are in their 20's and 30's. The first thing that hits you is the smell of the place .... it's a light non-intrusive perfume which is very soothing and not at all nauseating. The other things that you'll notice is that this is not a gaming hotel so there is noisy casino to trawl through nor smoke (as it's a non-smoking hotel - great!!!!) and it's very serene and offered a nice peaceful oasis of calm - even though it's slap bang in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. I felt very fortunate to have chosen this hotel. I stayed in their standard room, but upon seeing my room had to ask whether they'd given me an upgraded room by mistake. My room was on the 31st floor and the views were amazing .. I was able to watch the Bellagio water fountain display from the comfort of my sofa. So let me describe the room: upon entry to the room you are in a kitchen area, where there is a huge microwave, a small cooker hob, cupboards, drawers, coffee making machine, a sinke (complete with it's own food disposal port) and two fridges - one fridge was for my own use, the other housed the mini-bar. 'My' fridge housed never ending supplies of coffee (for the machine) and bottles of water. Once past the kitchen you're into the bedroom, which has a table (complete with two chairs), a 36\" flatscreen television and a sofa and coffee table, a king size bed and desk and leather office chair. Additionally there is a wardrobe which includes hangers, suitcase rack, his'n'hers bathrobes and slippers. The bathroom is in a seperate room, which is joined to the bedroom, this houses a bath, walk-in shower, sink, toilet, mirrors (including one that can be lit up), and lots more cupboards lots and lots of towels of various sizes, hairdryer and lots of Aveda products for your use. There are three telephones in the room; by the lavatory, on the desk (this one can be used wirelessly) and next to your bed. The hotel charges a $15 per day resort fee which covers daily newspapers, magazines, wireless internet access all over the hotel, free use of the computers for flights (online check-in, boarding pass printing etc.) amongst other things I cannot quite remember. The staff were very very good, efficient and friendly. The concierge desk was very very good in meeting my needs from booking show tickets to helping me out when I sprained my ankle in another hotel. If you wish to hire a car (like what I did) no need to stress, the hotel has its own pool of cars which it hires out - the smallest being a Ford Focus - I would recommend you hire with Hertz if you want the car for longer than a few days as it may be cheaper. Having said that the hotel allows you to drop their car off at the airport should you prefer - so no need to worry about transport to the airport at the end of your holiday. As said before the hotel is situated right on the strip in an area called City Center. It ajoins the Bellagio Hotel and is next door to the equally modern & stylish Aria hotel. The Aria & Bellagio are both on the free monorail that runs long the strip in Vegas. The hotel has a pool, spa and hairdressers on site - you need never go anywhere, but I recommend you do and see the delights of Vegas. The lifts are very very quick and are split (this saves an incredible amount of time) - in the left corridor the lifts take you to the floors 1-28 and the lifts in the right corridor take you to floors 29-53 - each corridor has 6 lifts! In addition, you can charge food, shows and services attained at other hotels to your room at the Vdara. My friend and I ate and saw shows at the Mirage, MGM, Aria, Mandalay Bay etc. and was able to charge it all to our hotel rooms at the Vdara. The only thing we were unable to charge was afternoon tea at the Four Seasons (which was good, but not as good as the afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab in Dubai). On the last day my friend and I had lunch at the Silk Road restaurant .... the food was amazing, the stass were impeccable and I can't recommend their homemade ginger ale enough yummy beyond yum! The hotel lobby has lots of seating and a bar which has a very zen outdoor space. When I went on a helicopter ride I got talking to some other people who were staying at the Riveria (a hotel I stayed at 10 yrs ago) and they complained about the lack of peace and the fact that there was no where in the hotel they were able to have a quiet sit-down drink at, without having to put up with the noise of the casino or walking through the casino hall just to get anywhere. I felt very fortunate to have found the Vdara, it's a gem of a hotel! I can't recommend this place enough as it's a great escape from the noise of Vegas without being out of town. Go and experience it. I intend to go back next year without a doubt ... Vegas is more than just gambling and this hotel helps facilitate such thought!

This was my seventh trip to Las Vegas, and my first stay at Vdara. I have previously stayed at Flamingo, Imperial Palace, Bellagio, THEHotel at Mandalay Bay and Tripicana. I got an offer through Southwest Vacations that gave one night free, which worked out to be a very good value. The hotel was priced similar to the GO room at Flamingo, which is the other hotel I also considered. To begin on the negative aspects, as others have noted, the location is not very good. If you have stayed in the South Tower at Bellagio, it's about the same distance but the walk is not nearly as convenient. It will improve once all the construction is complete, but at this point if you are almost always better off taking a cab unless you are in the immediate vicinity. Be aware of the route to the hotel as well. Some cab drivers are not aware Harmon is completely connected all the way East to West from Las Vegas Blvd over the freeway. If you are coming from an off strip property, this route will save plenty of time. This is the sole negative to this hotel. I found the level of service by everyone to be exceptional. Everyone was friendly and helpful at each turn, if you are willing to ask, they are willing to deliver. I arrived at 9 a.m., and they were able to check me in immediately. They also accomidated my request to have the larger room with two TV's and a wall removing the living area from the bedroom area. This gave us a room on the 51st floor with the most incredible view of any hotel I've ever stayed at. We looked right down the strip to the Stratosphere (with a view of the fountains at Bellagio) on the right side and then a gorgeous view of the mountains on the left. The bed is very soft, if you prefer a hard bed, this is not going to be an enjoyable sleep. However, I found it wonderfully comfortable. The bathroom is on par with the rest of the hotel, which is to say it is of top notch quality. For me, water pressure in a shower can make or break a hotel, and I found it to be perfectly acceptable at Vdara. I was worried that along with the LEED Gold rating, they would fit some sort of low flow showerhead in the bathroom, but my fears were quickly put to rest. The soaking tub is an odd choice, and no one in our room tested it out. All in all, I loved my stay at Vdara.

Vdara is definitely an experience unlike any I've had. We went to Las Vegas for my youngest daughter's wedding and my 55th birthday. My oldest daughter and I shared one room and the happy couple in another - both on 51st floor overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The view was spectacular! We could see the mountains all around as well as the view of the Strip looking north. Check-in was fast, as noted by others. I tried the \"$50 trick\" for an upgrade - no luck, although the desk person Ashley did appear sad that she couldn't help. She did place us on 51st floor, though, so I gave her $10 for effort. The rooms were not ready and took over an hour to get made up, but the bell staff held our luggage so we could walk around and go eat. The main reason we wanted to stay at Vdara was the smoke-free property. The air was fresh and had a faint fruity odor - pleasant but unidentifiable. The rooms were fairly clean, but hadn't been dusted. The refrigerator and one light in kitchen area were not working. We told the front desk about it that evening before we went out, but no one fixed it. A bottle of wine and two glasses were left on the table - no explanation, no charge. I wish they had asked - we ended up leaving it as none of our party drinks wine. We did get both of the above fixed the next day by a very nice engineer named Bob. The blackout shades didn't blackout the light due to the three piece design. The pull-out sofa was horrible, although the sofa itself, without being pulled out, was fairly comforatable to sleep on. Warning - don't sleep in the bed if you have back problems! Maybe some find it comfortable but there was absolutely no back support - like sinking into a marshmallow or fluffy cloud. That's when I moved to sofa and gave daughter the bed. The coffee pot took special pods(Keirug, or something like that). I am always generous to housekeeping and was supplied plenty of coffee, water and toiletries. My youngest daughter (the bride) did not tip and did not receive good housekeeping service. Maybe Vdara doesn't pay enough? We asked for plates, forks and a knife to cut the wedding cake and it took almost 2 hours and 2 calls. There is no excuse for that. When we called the second time, the person acted like she didn't know we'd asked. Now - for the distance from the Strip and access. This is the reason why I probably would not stay at Vdara again. There is no straight shot to the Strip! The walkway to Bellagio was covered but open to elements and the wind speeds during our stay were from 20-40 mph! Vdara needs a coffee shop/convenience store for sundries - even getting a newspaper or evening snack was a 20 minute trek. Daughter #2 used fitness center - said it was very nice with good equipment. None of us used spa. Pool wa closed. High-speed internet was fairly good most of time. The $15 resort fee was irritating, considering cost of room. Aria was ok but very dead - no energy. Table minimums during day were $25 for BJ - and a lot of dealers were standing around doing nothing! Hmmm - maybe if you lower the limits your dealers could work and earn tips? We ate breakfast at the Aria buffet and it was outstanding! We also went to Monte Carlo for quick meals in food court a couple of times - it was the nearest spot but still inconvenient. There was an overhead walk to Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile of Shops but you couldn't get to it unless you went outside and walked around construction area. Dangerous and a long way to walk. Vdara is lovely. If you had unlimited funds and could afford a taxi to go everywhere, it would be a great place to stay. (Or if you had a chauffeur-driven limo) I can afford neither so would not stay again or recommend it to friends.

We had contacted the hotel ahead of time as it was my parents' anniversary and asked if they could possibly be accommodated on a high floor with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. The hotel replied to us that they had noted our request on the reservation. Upon arrival however, there was nothing noted on the reservation and we found that we had been assigned rooms on the 12th floor. Fortunately the front desk host had no problem in moving us up to better rooms on the 36th floor with great views. We were pleased that there was only a short (5 minute) wait to check-in, and also that the lobby was very spacious and smoke-free, as there is no smoking and no casino on property. One complaint is that even though our stay was prepaid through American Airlines Vacations, the hotel needed to put a credit card hold of more than $500 for each of our two rooms. We were not aware of this policy in advance, and that could be a problem for some guests. The elevators were very fast and the rooms well appointed - except we could have used an extra trash can in the kitchen. Bathroom toiletries were plentiful and readily replenished. Although we had booked our reservation through American Airlines Vacations, we were disappointed to find that we were charged an additional resort fee of $15/day per room - especially as (1) the pool was closed and (2) our water was not restocked. The hotel advised us that we could use the pool at next door Aria, but really who wants to walk across to another hotel for a swim. Still, the gym was very good and both the wired and wireless internet were free, which in many properties you would pay $15/day for that alone. The room was well furnished and the bed was comfortable. The windows had automatic shades and blackouts, however (1) the switch broke on our second day, when we pushed the button, the faceplate broke off and disappeared into the wall, and (2) the blackout blinds were separated into three panels, each with about a one inch gap between them, so they really didn't blackout the light, which came streaming through the gaps early in the morning. Trying to walk back to the hotel from the strip was difficult. I had to either walk into Bellagio and then back across the walkway into Vdara - or walk into the Crystals shopping center and then take the monorail to the Bellagio station and walk back. Perhaps pedestrian access to the Vdara will improve once construction has been completed. On the evening of our second day, the toilet got blocked. We called housekeeping before going out for the evening and they said it would be fixed by the time we got back. When we returned back to the hotel after midnight, it had not been fixed. We were tired and didn't want to wait again for them to send someone who may or may not show up, so we had to use the public bathroom in the lobby. The next morning we called housekeeping again, and they were surprised to find out that it had not been fixed, because according to the notes in their system, the maintenance person had reported that he had fixed it - clearly not true. At that point they did send someone up who arrived in less than 5 minutes and fixed it. He was very nice and again apologized for their failure to fix it the previous evening. The kitchen had a nice coffee maker with pods of coffee. As a tea drinker, it would have been nice to have tea available in the room as well - I'm pretty sure they make pods with tea the same as with the coffee. Instead if I wanted tea I would have had to pay for in-room dining to provide it. A few times we had to wait for a taxi because there were none there, although they were lined up waiting across the other side of the circle outside Aria. We found over the course of our stay that several taxi drivers either didn't know where Vdara was, or weren't sure how to get to it. We often found ourselves giving the directions to the taxi drivers. We didn't eat on-site, but we did go across to the breakfast and lunch buffet at Aria which was AMAZING, and we highly recommend it. Not gaudily themed or cramped - very spacious, light and modern, with four chefs, one of whom is chocolatier Jean Phillipe - outstanding food in a wonderful atmosphere, and the friendliest server we met throughout our whole trip. Whereas some buffet servers seem to disappear during the meal, she was always available and kept our cups full and made wonderful conversation with my parents. She also told us all about the chefs and the food that was available. In summary, Vdara is a great hotel, with spacious modern suites. It is smoke-free and very calm and quiet - a welcome retreat to come home to after the hustle and bustle of most strip based hotels. It is nice not having a lobby full of tourists or a casino to navigate through to get to your room. Most of the issues mentioned here are service related which can easily be corrected once management have been made aware, and the appropriate steps taken to prevent their recurrence. I think we would stay here again once we feel that these concerns have been addressed.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cVdara\u201d", "Author": "VegasInza", "ReviewID": "UR58576537", "Content": "I\u2019m a Vegas girl from way back.

I must admit, MGM Mirage\u2019s newest creation made me stop in my tracks. Over the last few years I have watched this blank piece of land take shape into some of the most beautiful buildings to ever dot the Las Vegas skyline. On Wednesday December 2, 2009 I got my chance to check out Vdara. The first thing that hits you when you walk through the beauty entry way is the lack of smoke. For those of us who enjoy having pink healthy lungs this place is heaven on the Las Vegas strip. With Vdara\u2019s massive size it is oddly quiet and quite serene. The lobby itself is a feast for the eyes. The architecture is simply breathtaking with the blending of calming colors and clean lines. The Vdara stats themselves are equally as impressive as it\u2019s beauty. * Non gaming * Smoke free * 10,000 square feet of meeting space * 1,495 private suites * Full service wellness spa, salon and fitness center * US Green Building Council LEED Gold Certified Building * Sky pool and lounge featuring a sparkling pool, bar and lounge, cabanas and event space. * Silk Road, a modern and innovative restaurant by chef Martin Heierling.

The hotel itself was beautiful; nicely decorated lobby and very clean. We were greeted by staff every time we walked through the lobby. It was very quiet all over the hotel and to be honest we never saw another person in the hallways or elevators throughout our entire stay. The suite was spacious and spotlessly clean. While we enjoyed some of the things that made the room interesting (automated shade up/down, etc) it was apparent even after only a few months that these items will not hold up well. Our shades were already showing signs of hanging obviously crooked on one of the windows and I can only imagine how they will look and perform after a year or more of use. It was nice to have a refrigerator in the room, but this is Vegas - is someone really going to use much of the kitchen? In my opinion I think they could have made the kitchen a little smaller and devote that extra space into the actually living area. The bathroom was a nice size and very clean. We did not use the tub, but as others have commented, I am not sure how comfortable it would be as the drain is in the center of the floor of the tub. Also, for a tub that large it would have been a nice touch to have included jets. It was nice at times to not have a casino downstairs as it was very quiet, but there were also times when we missed it. The walk to Bellagio is short, but still not terribly convenient when you just want to run get a soda or pick up a newspaper. The location made it a little more involved to get anywhere as you essentially had to walk to Bellagio first and go from there. There is no pedestrian walkway from Vdara to the Strip itself. We did not try the bar or restaurant, so I can't comment on those.

Driving up to the hotel at night the hotel and the city centre development stood out and looked very modern.

There was no queue at check in which I've heard can be over an hour at some other hotels in Vegas and check out was very quick. There was no issue with the staff but I didn't really ask for much, the door men were friendly and chatty. The whitener for the coffee was missing one day and it took 20 minutes for some to arrive but I forgave them as house keeping got fresh ice to keep my half bottle of wine cool which was nicely chilled by the time I got back from shopping. Nice touch. I didn't notice any issues with the cleaning, we loved the room, modern and well laid out although its strange they had a kitchen area when very few people will use it (so they told me). We also had a partial view of the Bilagio fountains and a good view over Vegas every evening which we loved. The bed, pillows and bath robes were excellent and I'd have loved to bring one home if the robes weren't $101 each. One improvement they could have made was to the safe, it needs to be bigger and at least horizontal rather than on the wall as you are limited on fitting an SLR camera and laptop in at the same time - obviously two expensive items I like to secure. I didn't try the restaurant but did eat at the Bilagio and Aria buffet and both for excellent value and good quality for $14 before 11am, in fact we preferred Aria's because the Bilagio's was a bit old fashioned for me.

The Vdara is by far the best hotel in Vegas. Having stayed in numerous other hotels/casinos, we decided to try Vdara, even though the reviews on tripadvisor were mixed. Please do not listen to the negative reviews, this place is amazing. I apologize for the length of this review, but I really wanted to set the record straight on this fantastic hotel. First, upon check-in, we were greeted with no wait and two smiling front desk clerks. We asked for a room on one of the higher floors and our request was granted without a problem. The check-in was fast, courteous and extremely friendly. We were given a room on the 53rd floor, one of the upper floors of the hotel. As we entered the room, we were blown away with the sweeping views of Vegas from so high up. Since Vdara is one of the tallest buildings in Vegas, the view is incredible. However, the view was just one of the best parts of our amazing room. We entered into the kitchen of our room, which was just the perfect size. I know that some past reviews stated that they thought the kitchen was \u201cwasted space,\u201d but we found it to be perfect. The appliances were all top of the line, with a combination convection oven/microwave oven and a double refrigerator, one of which was fully stocked with a mini bar and the other was left empty for our use. Leading off of the kitchen was our amazing bedroom. We had a king sized bed, a chair, a sofa with a queen sized pull out bed and a desk. The LCD TV looked to be about 42\u201d and the entertainment center included a very convenient \u201ccharging center\u201d with numerous outlets and usb ports for charging cell phones, ipods, etc.. The bed was one of the most comfortable we had ever slept in. The linens were soft and luxurious, as were the pillows. The bathroom equally matched the greatness of the bedroom. There is a large shower with bench, as well as a large soaking tub. The soaking tub was truly fantastic and easily fit two people. We enjoyed a relaxing bath each night of our stay. The lighting in the bathroom was exceptional, by far the best I have experienced in a hotel. Finally, all of the Aveda products were an awesome touch; we loved the shampoo and conditioner so much that we took them home with us. I also wanted to address the service that we received during our stay. I know that some reviews stated that customer service was lacking at the Vdara. However, we found the service to be nothing but top notch. Our bags were brought to our room within five minutes of calling the bell hop. Twice, we called the front desk to bring us silverware and dishes, and both times, they were brought to our room within five minutes. In addition, our room was kept spotless and our coffee and bottles of water were restocked daily. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and all of our requests were fulfilled promptly. We could not have asked for more. We also wanted to recommend the Silk Road restaurant. We ate there for breakfast one morning, and while it was pricy ($60 including tip for the two of us), we did not mind because everything was top of the line. We walked away saying that it was the best breakfast we had ever had. I had the french toast, which I highly recommend. Again, service was impeccable. I also wanted to address some comments about the location/aura of the hotel. Although the hotel is set back from the strip, we found it quite simple to walk to and from the strip from the Vdara. We usually used the walkway to the Bellagio, which also led to the tram. In addition, it was quite simple to walk to the Aria and through the casino to get to the strip. From staying at other properties, we found the walk to the strip actually shorter than other hotels. Finally, one of the best parts of the Vdara is that it is a non-gaming, smoke-free resort in the middle of lively strip. We were able to enjoy all that Vegas has to offer in gambling, shows and dining, but it was so nice to return back to the Vdara each night to the tranquility that this property offers. The fragrance of the hotel is so welcoming compared to the smoky and low ceiling hotels/casinos of other places in Vegas (Aria not included, as we found this casino to be relatively smoke free with high ceilings). Granted, I understand that the Vdara does not offer night clubs etc., but if you want this, it is a couple minute walk away to either the Aria or Bellagio. In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Vdara. From the beautiful design and furnishings, to the great customer service, no part of this hotel was overlooked and the attention to detail is quite extraordinary. We really believe that this place is the best that Vegas has to offer and will stay here from now on.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cBeware.....oder is really bad\u201d", "Author": "BerthaMcNasty", "ReviewID": "UR57210953", "Content": "this hotel is very beautiful, but beware of the scent in this hotel...

The walkway over to Bellagio was convenient and the tram to Crystals (shopping) and Monte Carlo was speedy and efficient. We found the staff eager to please and genuinely gracious. When we checked into the room the safe was already locked and closed and the water had not been replenished in the small fridge. Our bellman told us he would be personally responsible for making sure these things were rectified and he did just that. The room accommodations were lovely - one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in with loads of fresh white linens on both the bed and in the bath. I especially liked the robes in the rooms - soft, comfortable and warm. We had breakfast in Aria most of the days we were there - a huge cafe with lots of choices, excellent service.

No problem with my shower on the 39th or 32nd floor (I forget now). Did have a couple of service issues. Plates not cleared away after room service and had a message that housekeeping couldn't clean due to my due not disturb blue light being on (rather than a door handing your doorbell changes colour, very cool) even though it hadn't been on and they had actually clearned (!!!) got the same message the next day too. Again light hadn't been on and they had clearned. Little details, couple of loose bathroom fittings and strangely I also had a cloth left by a maid during my stay but these in now way detracted from the overal niceness of the room and the friendliness of the staff. Feels like the final snagging list wasn't followed up. It was very quiet, but everywhere seemed to be and had no problem finding the Bellagio or the Tram (once I asked). I completely agree about getting out of the Aria, is convoluted and you have to go through the casino and citycentre shopping centre (there may have been another way but I couldn't find it) this also involved either going up or downstairs depending on where you were coming from, all a bit much when you've been wandering the strip all day.

We did actually email the hotel (twice) to ask for their comments about some of the negative reviews ie asked for some re-assurance however they did not reply which is very poor customer service. We got married in vegas last year and stayed in the Four Seasons (amazing) This time we wanted something more central and the fact it was brand new really appealed to us. The check in desks when we arrived were quiet and we asked for a room on a high floor. We were offered one on the 17th floor however came back 30 mins later and at this time one on the 40th floor was free so we took this one. Great views of mountains, Rio and Palms to the left and to the right we could see the Bellagio fountains and the eiffel tower. The room was fab. Ok the kitchen area for us was a waste (we did no cooking etc) however it was nice to have the feel of an apartment when you walked in rather than just a bedroom. The bed was amazing - the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in and we do travel a lot. We kept the blinds open at all times just to take in the views both day and night however this wouldn't appeal to everyone! The cleaning was done every day and we have no complaints about this. Lots of clean towels every day. The shower was amazing too (not sure re some of the reviews re a poor shower - different floors = different water pressure???) Would just say one thing, the cleaners didnt do a very 'thorough' job as the window sills etc were getting very dusty in the week we stayed there (was tempted to DIY!) The location was great. We were a little unsure of the connection to the bellagio however this was by a covered walkway and only took 2 minutes to get to the bellagio (why some people couldnt find it was v odd) Despite sign saying it closed at mid-night we still used it after this time on a few occasions. It was then another few minutes walk to get to the lobby of the bellagio and this was great as it meant you didnt have to walk through the casino. City centre itself wasnt completely finished and to be honest it does kind of spoil the strip in some ways ie very very modern in contrast to the themed hotels. NB did not like to Aria at all.

Loved the architecture and unique design and blend of materials. The Silk Road restaurant was very good. (ate lunch twice) We live in San Francisco, and eat out at many places that are the same restauranteurs that are in Vegas. So we are used to higher prices and the style of food that these chefs deliver. (we use trip advisor frequently before we travel and I am sometimes amused by the comments so I will give a few opinions based on others reviews here) The food could be considered pricey, but it's what you are used to paying. High prices don't always mean \"BIG FOOD\". many times it represents quality of ingredients and preperation. If you want big and cheap go to a chain. Seems that most good/great food is expensive now in Vegas. Anyway everything regarding our room,service. ans spa experience at the Vdara was very good/excellent. Only 2 issues. The TV controller doesnt always cooperate with the TV menu when changing channels. (I know this is a digital issue that can be resolved) Second the soaking tub drain plug is in the center of the tub. So if you lie in the tub, the plug will be right in your tailbone and you have to cover it with a towel or not lie down while soaking. (not a well thought out tub design) Our room was cleaned everyday and ammenities replenished. We asked for more soap/shampoo and we were delivered a weeks supply promptly. No other problems with blinds/ maid service/ etc etc. Spa was very very good. Getting around the City Center: Yes the Vdara is in the back of the property buts very quiet. As far as walking the the strip. The way you have to walk is about 3-4 blocks compared to how the crow would fly. but after doing it once its very simple. As far as getting from the Vdara to the Aria, you go out door and to the right or left around the circle on the sidewalk.(someone said theres no walkway and you have to walk in traffic???? huh?) You can pretty much cut right through the Aria( and yes it's smoking allowed in the Aria bt come on it's Vegas and eventually you will be able to avoid going through the casino) one of two ways and pop right out the front and then down to the right or left and about 2 blocks down to the strip. (people here always complain about walking??? if you don't want to walk in Vegas get a cab there are plenty. and unless you can't walk then maybe some of the overweight or unfit folks that seem to be more abundant as we have aged would benefits from more walking and could benefit from some smaller food portions that they complain about as well). Most of our time was spent at Vdara, and Aria, and the Bellagio. eating, walking, going to the spa and gambling and the over all trip was great and all the employees were on the ball and friendly. However the Bellagio (that people always rave about is clearly aging and seems very old (age wise and design wise) compared to the City Center hotels. Many of the other hotels seemed somewhat rundown as well and the Strip very dirty and low budget especially walking toward the Mandalay Bay from City Center. If you like super high end modern architecture by world class architects then you will find the Center very interesting. And walking around exploring the various art/sculptures is very interesting as well. i would deffinently recommend the Vdara.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cSlightly above average\u201d", "Author": "raven40", "ReviewID": "UR56018414", "Content": "Property opened in December so some kinks are still being worked out and the downturn seemed evident in lobby traffic which was sparse.

Anyone who reviews this hotel badly I honestly just don't get it. First of all it is new and VERY stylish so my wife LOVED it! The moment we walked in the door the great smell hit us and was so refreshing. The doormen were VERY friendly and whisked our bags away. We arrived around 3:00--their busiest time to check in and we had no problems. It was our anniversary so we asked for an upgrade--and we GOT one--no charge. We were on the 46th floor over-looking the Bellagio fountain and WHAT A VIEW of both the fountain, the strip and the mountains. We went up to the room and were blown away when we entered as to how beautiful and awesome it was. While we were checking out the bathroom about 30 seconds after our arrival I thought I heard a doorbell ring and sure enough it was Joe with our bags! He gave a great presentation/rundown of our room and the facility and was SO dang friendly--as everyone at this hotel was! The next morning we had booked a couples massage at the Vdara Spa and we SO recommend that! The spa staff was friendly and got us set up prior to our massages where we could relax beforehand. I took a 30 minute steam sauna then met my wife for a cup of hot tea then we went in for our massage. Being a guy I had never done that before and MAN I CAN'T WAIT TO DO IT AGAIN!!! Spoil yourself and try it! I was STUPID relaxed afterwards! When the massage was over our massage therapists (mine was named Cassie--very good--just the right pressure) put us in a meditation room that had trickling water and was VERY relaxing. Then I hit the steam sauna again for 30 minutes to finish out the experience. It was awesome and SO worth it. Our room had a mini kitchen that we did not use but we were offered plates, flatware, etc. if we needed it. We called for turn-down service every evening when we left the hotel to go out and our water was always replenished and the bed turned down. The light swithes were a little funky but it certainly does not take a rocket scientist to figure it out. There is a \"do not disturb\" and \"maid service\" light on the door that is very nice. It is tucked back in-between the rear of the Bellagio and the new Aria resort. The Aria is a quick five-minute walk and it is worth seeing as well. Very nice.

We've been to Vegas a number of times and always try to stay at a different hotel as there are so many fantastic places to choose from. This time the choice was between Vdara & Aria as we'd previously seen the CItyCenter development being built and decided we'd like to stay there. In the end we decided on Vdara but in hindsight feel the Aria may have been a better choice. We arrived more or less bang on check-in time and the first thing we noticed was how quiet the lobby/reception area was, we were given a room on the 35th floor facing down the back of the strip looking towards The Mandalay Bay, however the room was still being cleaned at the time (we only found this out on arriving at the room). This wasn't a problem as we knew we were a bit early, however the maid must have forgotten to vacuum the floor which was quite a mess from the last guest, so we called reception to ask for the floor to be cleaned. Without hesitation the receptionist apologised and instead offered us an upgrade free of charge to the next level of suite on the 48th floor, which we thought was a fabulous gesture for a fairly minor problem. The room itself wasnt that different from the first one, however the view was out of this world - looking up the strip with the Palms & Rio to the left, Paris to the right, the Stratosphere & downtown straight ahead, and right below us The lake at Bellagio. The view in daylight was amazing, but at night it was truly spectacular, especially during the fountain shows. The view was by far the biggest positive of our stay at Vdara, there were a few negatives, the worst of which occurred on our last morning so therefore left a lasting impression on our stay. For some unknown reason the in-room safe malfunctioned overnight and wouldn't open so i called reception who said they'd send someone immediately. To cut a long story short it took 2 phone calls, and a personal complaint at the reception desk before someone finally came to open the safe - almost 2 hours after the first call. What was particularly annoying was the guy who came said he'd only just had the call from reception and seemed genuinely shocked when told we'd been waiting so long. It was fortunate that we didnt have an early morning flight as passports etc were in there, but it ruined our plans for our last few hours in Vegas as we only had time to grab some food then head to the Airport. If you like the hustle and bustle of a typical Vegas hotel such as the Bellagio or MGM Grand, then the Aria would be a better choice as we passed through it daily and it was much livelier. We were really surprised by how quiet this place was and whilst we knew there was no Casino here we couldnt believe there was only 2 bars, 1 restaurant and no gift or amenities shops. This is a beautiful hotel and the problems are mainly just teething ones in its early days, but we couldnt help but wonder how it will compete with its neighbours - you can walk down the strip without passing Vdara as its behind CityCenter, and there's nothing to draw you in either. In fact you could probably stay in Vegas without even knowing the place exists. This would be a fantastic place for a get-away-from-it-all break, but thats not what you go to Vegas for is it ?

Vdara was our respite from the craziness of Vegas. Our room was very well-appointed and clean. We stayed in the basic suite and never made use of the kitchen space and barely used the living/den space. It was more than big enough for us two. Yes, there is only one sink in the bathroom, but there are large surfaces on both sides. We had plenty of room to prep for the evenings at the same time. We did experience some of the technical glitches mentioned in other reviews. Our housekeeping/do not disturb light wasn't working upon check-in. A nice serviceman came up to repair it after 4 calls in 2 days. Also, the light switches are odd but certainly not rocket science. We had figured them out by the second day.

Firstly, before expanding, it must be said that this hotel targets a specifictype of Vegas tourist. If you are looking for a tranquil, beautiful, non-gaming and non-smoking place to stay, this is the place for you. Any reasonable individual, who may not be thrilled by the vibrant, crowdy and smoky atmosphere of the big casinos, will no doubt love this place. Upon our arrival, bell men welcomed us very kindly and took care of our bags. The modern decor and nice odor blew us away upon entering. Check in was quick and efficient. We were pleasantly upgraded to a larger Suite with full size kitchen, living room and large bathroom. Once in our room, a quick call to the bell desk assured the delivery of our luggage minutes afterwards. Also, the bell man took a few minutes to explain how the blinds worked, discussed a few services and told us pots and pans, as well as plates and utensils could be requeted at any time if needed. The room itself was beautiful. Since this was our first trip to Vegas, comparisons to other hotel rooms are off, but it must be said that one would need to be overly demanding to view this room with disregard. The bed was amazingly confortable with giant size pillows. Two 42 inch HD flatscreens with plenty of channels, (including McCarren flights) decorated the room. As opposed to many other reviews, everything worked fine: TV, Blinds, fridge, heating, lights...There is no issue whatsoever with light switches. There are plenty of them, true, but many control the same lights from different areas of the suite, in order to maximize the efficiency of its users. Also, hot water was never an issue. Water pressure in the shower was not the most powerful i've seen, but plenty enough to enjoy their huge showers. Being on the 6th floor, and facing the bellagio, the tram, and some construction, we were sure we would be disturbed by some noise. In fact, not a single time did we even notice some noise or any type of disturbances. We never waited for an elevator for more than 5 seconds, and it was great. The hotel charges a 15$ dollar resort fee per day as well as a small tax (about 2$), which is something they could include in the room rate from the start. But, in retrospective, this fee is not disproportionate with the available services such as free internet, free local and toll free calls, free bottles of water, free usage of the resort's gym, all of which would cost much more in other hotels if paid seperately. Also, position and access to this hotel was great for us. You can access the strip either via the bellagio, which is about a 5 to 10 min walk, the aria, and soon, once the cosmopolitan opens, a sidewalk, which is temporarily blocked by construction, will lead you to the strip in no time. Finally, the hotel's staff was great. Employees were very kind, saluting us constantly and always ready to answer some of our questions. They all seemed quite competent and we would be hard pressed to find them major flaws, based on our experience.The maids offered us great service and even complied to special demands for extra hand towels and so on. It seems to us both, that most of the negative reviews of this hotel were contrary to the experience we had during our 4 night stay. One can always find reasons to complain about a particular hotel, but I strongly feel that if you are looking for a quiet and beautiful place on the strip, and you have high but reasonable expectations, this will more than satisfy you.

The couch in the living room was not very comfortable. I couldn't sit there long while watching TV. It is supposed to be a foldout bed, but I didn't try it out. Noise complaint - there is a vent fan in the kitchen, just above the fridge. It can't be turned on or off and it is quite annoying. You can't enjoy a quiet meal in the dining area, nor watch TV or sleep comfortably in the living room. I wonder if the front desk can control it as they can the automated lock on the mini-bar. Following up with complaints that there is no coffee maker, they might be installing KEURIG single-cup machines in every unit (as of Jan 10, 2010) One major annoyance is that there is no easy entry by car from FRANK SINATRA BLVD, the back road that can save you from having to drive up the busy, and often clogged STRIP/Las Vegas Blvd. The only true back way is from Harmon Ave on the other side of I-15. Even then, you have to ask the Aria valet staff to allow you to get past their pylons and over to Vdara. The $15 mandatory daily resort fee includes HIGH SPEED INTERNET/WIFI, access to FITNESS CENTER, daily delivery of Wall Street Journal, TURNDOWN SERVICE with 2 free mini bottles of water. Here are some tips to make the most of your stay: BRING YOUR OWN KEURIG coffee capsules/K-Cups (from your home or office): I believe they provide them in their mini-bar for a fee, so bring your own! There are NO STARBUCKS within City Center. The closest one (by walking) is at the entryway/down escalator to MONTE CARLO from ARIA, close to the TRAM stop there. ARRANGE FOR TURN-DOWN SERVICE: You get two free mini water bottles each day, and this is the only way to get them. Call in late afternoon, or before you leave for dinner. They automatically place them at your bedside tables. Shame on them for not letting you know this. FREE MINI WATER BOTTLES AT VALET PARKING (by ticket window): I noticed this during my stay. Not sure how long they'll be doing this. HIGH SPEED INTERNET: You can attach not just one device, but MULTIPLE laptops/handhelds. WiFi is available of course, and a single ethernet cable by the desk. Just enter your room number, and last name on the initial web page that will pop up. It supports finicky VPN connections by allowing you to select a \"PUBLIC IP ADDRESS\". WALKING OVER TO ARIA: Go out front entrance, walk along the path to the left that takes you straight there. Takes just 1 minute. WALKING OVER TO BELLAGIO or TRAM: as you exit elevators in Vdara, make left down the lobby (opposite check-in), then another left that takes you down a corridor that leads you to Bellagio and City Center TRAM. Less than 5 min. SELF PARKING option 1: you can easily park over at the Bellagio Self-Park and walk over. Drive on the STRIP to main Bellagio entrance, look for SELF-PARK signs towards left. Take elevators to CASINO, walk past the check-in area, then past Bellagio Garden and you'll see signs leading you to VDARA. About 5 min. SELF-PARKING option 2 (especially if you have luggage/groceries and don't want to traverse the busy CASINO): park at the ARIA's self-park garage, by driving up CITY CENTER DRIVE from the STRIP. Look for signs to your left as you drive up the ramp. Once parked, take the free CITY CENTER tram. As you walk out of the garage and towards escalators to CASINO, follow TRAM signs to your immediate left. Go through automated mirrored glass doors. There will be escalators to take you to platform. You will be at the \"Monte Carlo/Aria\" station, it then takes you to \"Crystals\" mall, and then get off at last stop \"Bellagio/Vdara\". Take ELEVATOR down (not escalator) and it will put you within footsteps of the VDARA. You can take escalator, but it's a much longer way. (REVERSE these steps to get back to Aria Self-Park.) CVS and WALGREENS within easy reach: If you need snacks & sundries, CVS is just at the foot of the property on Las Vegas Blvd. Walgreens is not much further, but across the street. It may be easier to take the CITY CENTER TRAM to CRYSTALS mall and walk out to the street from there. DRIVING TO VDARA: The only entry to VDARA is accessible from the STRIP/Las Vegas Blvd. (Do not go up CITY CENTER DRIVE). At HARMON BLVD. (You can also get there from WEST of I-15 by taking Harmon Blvd, but it places you at the back entrance to ARIA and you have to ask the valet staff to move pylons to your right that will allow you to navigate the rotunda over to the VDARA.)", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "littlecookiemonster", "Title": "\u201cNice..but could be better\u201d", "Author": "littlecookiemonster", "ReviewID": "UR53693679", "Content": "When took a cab from the airport to the hotel on x'mas day around noon or so. We tried to check-in but the guy from the front desk said check in is at 3PM, so we dropped off our luggage to the bell desk and headed out to check around the other hotels around the area. We went back at 3PM to check-in...only to find that there were around 20 people trying to check-in. The line-up to check in took more than half an hour. However, they were nice enough to offer us bottles of water while we were lining up. We did not get any upgrades or anything since I overheard the person in front of us was asking and had to pay extra each night. I only asked to get a better view or a suite on a higher floor. The lady at the front desk told me that we were going to get a room on the 35th floor which is the highest floor that is open as construction is still going on the levels above us. When we finally got our key to the room, we tried to take the elevator to the 35th floor. At that time, I think they just opened the floor that day and there was something wrong with the system, so there was no access to go to the 35th floor. It was fixed about 10 minutes after since other people have been complaining before. I was quite satisfied with the view that we got in our room... our room faced the south side of the strip and we also saw the Aria hotel. One thing I found pretty neat about the room was the curtains on the window. There was a control near by the kitchen which allowed you to adjust the \"shade\" or \"Blackout\" of the curtains. However, I must have to say the lights were a little hard to manage, it was like a trial and error thing. One thing I thought was surprising is that there are no toothbrushes or toothpastes provided. I asked the bell boy when he came to deliver our luggages, it seemed like he was caught by surprised that I asked if there were toothbrushes and he directed us to the convenience store at Bellagio to get one. I must have to say the furnishings are quite nice...the bed and sheets were very comfortable. I also liked the shower and had no problems with hot water. They also have a scale in the washroom which I thought was quite neat...but never used. I also like the back-lit mirror in the washroom for me to do my make-up. The towel rack that they have was also quite convenient. I was quite upset when there was no internet in my room. I had tried to go on with my iphone and it said that there was something wrong with the gateway and I should contact for assistance, I called the front desk and they directed me to some other line. They told me that they would ask an engineer to test the spots and would be coming in shortly. Since my bf was still sleeping and didn't want to wake him up, I asked if they could come up at 8:00-8:30AM. I also specifically asked if i needed to call again to make sure someone would come up. They told me no....No one came until 9:00..and when I opened the door, I was kind of surprised to find out it was just housekeeping. They ring the doorbell everyone morning to see if cleaning is required. So be sure to turn on the lights beside the door if you don't want to be disturbed! When I left my room for the day, i dropped by the front desk and complained to them that I called earlier and no one came.I also told them I had to leave for the day and will talk to them when I get back. I went back during the afternoon because I had to pick up some stuff. I went to the business office asking them about the internet..and somehow it managed to work afterwards. On our second night back, we bought 2 bottles of water since the ones provided by vdara are relatively small. When we came back from housekeeping the 3rd day, they didn't replace our water bottles as they saw that we still had some left. They didn't replace our waters since that day. Just a side note, for people who like to drink hot water.. I could not find a kettle in the room. We booked our grand canyon tour from the hotel. We first went through concierge, and he then directed us to the bell desk. Both of them are very helpful and were really nice. When i checked out, we had to go through the check-in desk again..which I thought was a bit of a hassle. The girl asked me how my stay was. I told her about how I was quite surprised that there were no toothbrushes...her response was did I asked housekeeping. I told her i did talk to to the bell desk..and her response was kind of like \"oh\". So i was quite confused if we were supposed to get it or not... I also mentioned about the internet issue that I had...But she didn't seem to say too much. Well anyway, I looked at the pamphlet she gave me and inside it said there was a link to satisfaction email. It was no where to be found. So i looked up the website to email them. They responded and told me that their system was not working. They also addressed me as \"Mr\" instead of \"Ms\" or \"Miss\" when it clearly shows my name is a girl. Well I wrote them an email identifying the issues that I had and was not satisfied with and expected more from a 4-5 star hotel they claimed they were. I never got a response from them, but it looks like they credited my resort fee. Now would I go back again? Maybe...after they worked out their management a bit better...but i'd probably give Aria a try next time since there are so many other hotels to try out along the strip.", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Duisburg", "Title": "\u201cBEWARE\u201d", "Author": "TaraDuisburg", "ReviewID": "UR53658924", "Content": "In November I booked two suites at \"Vdara\" (one week in February) and I had to pay about 300 USD by Creditcard.

We were on the 42nd floor with great views of the Strip and surrounding areas - Rio and The Palms to the left, Paris and The Bellagio (including the Fountains!) to the right. Rooms were clean and well-designed; the lighting is a bit complex but tolerable and we didn't find any problems with the water pressure of the shower. The only two negatives would be -the $15 resort fee per day, which was pretty much useless to us -the location of the hotel: it was too far off from the Strip. Vdara is connected to the Bellagio and yes, there is a tram, but it is definitely a more inconvenient location compared to so many other hotels.

It is a green-friendly, smoke-free hotel, conveniently located in the center of it all. At this time it is new and very clean. The deluxe room is spacious and elegantly decorated with contemporary simplistic furniture and minimal decor. The wood finish was nice. The kitchenette was also nice, but unnecessary. The bed was comfortable and the dual television sets were a nice tough. We were on the 12th floor and our view was'nt very much. We could see the mountains beyond and the Rio and Palms properties and on the other side there was a partial view of Paris and the back of the Bellagio which looked like some sort of loading area, not much at all. I quess I should have asked for a better view or a higher room. The bathroom was a bit less to be desired. There was only one sink, no big deal, but two is better than one. The tub, although it looks very nice is just too small. It may be suitable for people 5'6\" or shorter. Almost impossible to fit a couple hoping for an intimate experience. The floor is very slippery, would recommend sacrifycing some towels as mats. And the shower pressure has now reached infamous proportions as just about every review online tells of how weak it is. There is a setting you can change it to but it does not add much if anything at all. The staff at the hotel is rookie. At check-in, the representative fumbled around with our identification, our room keys and our money. She made very very minimal eye contact and seemed uncomfortable, maybe it was her first day; but still. The concierge seemed to make lame recommendations and didnt know where a chain steakhouse was despite being located directly across the street from CityCenter (S&W; I would avoid if I were you, try Craftsteak instead). In addition, the toilet paper on our arrival was so low that it ran out the second time it was needed. On one day they didnt replenish the water. On another, housekeeping did not knock and just entered and announced \"housekeeping.\" Two minutes later, someone rings the bell twice, waits 10 seconds and enters the room. I jump up and say \"excuse me\", she just tells me that I should press the do not disturb button if I do not wish to be bothered. And on a bit of a disturbing note, on one day, when housekeping came in to do their routine, they went a bit too far IMO, they folded and therefore touched my wifes intimates and folded them on our bed, even though that portion of our belongings was tucked away in a corner and not even touched on the previous housekeping visits. My wife was freaked out as she claims that items were removed from her luggage. We called to complain and got our resort fees back (currently $15 pernight + tax) We simply just wanted fresh towels and a made bed, maybe we should have communicated our desires beforehand. I have nothing to say about the restaurant as I did not try. It looked kind of sad as business seemed very slow and servers were outside fishing for guests instead of being on a floor running wild providing service. Bellagio is just a few minutes away and is connected by a walkway. Once inside you go down an escalator and go thru a few hallways before entering the lobby. On the other side is Aria, which is even quicker to get into. Both of course offer something unique in their own right and this is where Vdara's niche can really be appreciated. When you go thru these other places, it is just pure Vegas. There are just herds and herds and herds of people. Hundreds and thousands of people. Cigar smoke and stores and bright lights and casino noises and did I mention the hundreds and thousands of people. But in Vdara, its just a a nice calming, environment. Its a break from all that you see out in this concrete bright light jungle. We toured Vegas by foot most of the time and this hotels proximity to the center was nice, however the hotel is a bit tucked inside the complex so just a few additional steps will be needed if you plan on the same strategy. Overall, I give them a 4/5. They did not really wow me with anything special. Being a new place they made some common mistakes they will have to improve on if they desire to be a true 5-star hotel. Their niche is a good one and they should be able to compete. Im not sure what the properties long-term goals are but this a tough city to compete in considering they do not have gambling. But if they can turn 1st timers into repeats, they could do very very well. I greatly enjoyed my last Vegas trip and am sad it has come to an end, a review is always good closure and I encourage all of you in the future to share your experiences and reminisce.

And I was prepared for some small problems (particularly after reading the previous reviews here). While there are, indeed, a few snags, overall this is a great property. People have complained about the lack of shops and restaurants and casinos on property -- but this is exactly WHY I love Vdara. It's amazing to have all of the Vegas insanity steps away, but return to a peaceful, quiet, smoke-free oasis at the end of the day. Perhaps people who voiced those complaints didn't read the hotel's description when they booked, since this is the very concept behind Vdara. It would be nice if the hotel was closer to the many nearby options (more on that later), but I didn't miss having them on-site (though a Starbucks and a small grab-and-go cafe in the lobby would be a help). I believe this was slated to be a condo building, and when the recession hit they changed plans -- which explains some of the quirks, but also the unique, tranquil vibe here. The rooms are great, the decor is groovy, and the light switches really aren't ALL that complicated (though I'll admit that labels or a quick instruction card would be a huge help). My one pet peeve with the lighting is that you can't turn off the bedside lights from anywhere near the bed -- so you have to get up and go to the kitchen (where the switch is located) and then go back to bed in semi-darkness. As many people have noted, the water pressure in the shower is somewhat limited -- but it's bearable. Given that the water pressure in the sinks and bathtub are great I'm assuming this is a choice and undoubtedly has to do with the building's \"Green\" certification. Annoying, but understandable (and for a noble cause). I found the staff friendly, the rooms great, and the views impressive (I believe that the \"view\" rooms face north, but I faced the other direction and loved my view). They're running specials right now since it's new -- and if you can get a good deal it's worth it. The $15 resort fee is annoying if you're not going to use the services -- but for me it was great. I rely on internet when I'm away and most hotels on the Strip charge $15 (or more) for the internet alone. At Vdara, the $15 fee gets you internet PLUS access to the fitness center, which is a unique perk (every hotel in Vegas that I know of requires you to pay hefty day fees to use the gym), which I took advantage of. The gym itself is very clean and the equipment is great. It's on the small side by comparison to a real gym (or even the other gym/spas on the Strip), but huge by comparison to a free hotel gym. Oddly, the \"resort fee\" only gets you access to the gym itself -- if you want to use the locker room/spa area it's another $25. I asked for a tour and was not impressed. It's pretty, and stocked with tons of Aveda products and other amenities. But it's really just a nice locker room with a jacuzzi, steam and sauna. If that's your thing, skip the upsell and head next door to either the Bellagio (same $25 gets you access to their bigger/better gym and a larger/more impressive spa area) or Aria ($30 gets you access to their huge gym, plus a large spa area with everything at Vdara plus meditation rooms, heated pool deck, etc.). The only thing that's irritating about this hotel is the location. It's a great location in that it's in the heart of the strip. But it's so tucked away and hidden, it's like the entire hotel is in a witness protection program. It's virtually inaccessible by foot, unless you cut through the Aria or Bellagio (or take a creepy stairway to a side street that looks like a loading dock). To get there by car, you take a barely-marked ramp off the side street and then go through a maze of driveways to get to the entrance. It's like the hotel was shoved into an odd parcel of land behind something else -- but it was built from scratch with the rest of the complex!!! Who on earth designed this?!?! I guess when it was going to be a condo they wanted private exclusivity -- but now that it's a hotel, at least some bigger/bolder signage would seriously help matters. It's honestly like they don't want anyone to find it. Overall I think this is a great find in Vegas, and definitely has a unique bent that separates it from the other higher-end properties on the Strip. If you're looking for the quintessential Vegas experience, this is not the hotel for you. But if you're looking for an oasis of civilized calm, get thee to Vdara.", "Date": "January 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland", "Title": "\u201cAwesome time!\u201d", "Author": "rvajda", "ReviewID": "UR53326849", "Content": "I was taking my girlfriend to Vegas for her birthday present (both first-timers) and could not wait.

If you have friends staying at Aria and vdara, is best to get drop off at vdara, for Aria has two seperate drop off point, one shared with vdara and the other by itself (and you will have to walk through the casino and outside to get back to vdara) Citycentre was somewhat open, LV and Tiffanny was open, but quiet. The bank club is in there, seems packed on saturday night. Would i stay there again? Yes, but not for my next trip to Vegas. The location makes it inconvenient to access the strip quickly, lack of casino and restaurant also mean you have to walk or cab everywhere. If it is your first time to Vegas, and want to experience the thrill of Vegas, skip this hotel. If you have been there many times and looking for comfort of home and excitement that is available minutes away, vdara is your choice. ps.

Now to the great experience, on 38th floor directly over looking the Ballagio and her fountains beautiful view and a great vantage point to oversee the fireworks and the hustle bustle of the Las Vegas strip. Read a few reviews of people complaining about the long walks to the strip.As im a lil on the large side (well lets say built for comfort rather than speed lol)i was a lil apprehensive of staying at the hotel.After being at the hotel for a few days these fears were unfounded the hotel was in for me a great location 10mins from the strip with 3 ways to get there via the ballagio ,through Aria or a short walk out past Crystals to Planet Hollywood there is a tram to Crystals or Monti carlo but its quicker to walk so for me tram waste of time. Great to get back to this hotel as all rooms are only minutes from the main lobby as opposed to 30-45 mins like the venetian and mgm grand.Ive stayed in numerous hotels on the strip over the years and this by far was my favourite the non smoking non gaming side i enjoyed probably saved me losing a lot more than i did.Room service was nice.Found the maid service a lil over zealous with numerous messages to my room most days saying they hadnt cleaned the room and they needed access but every time the room had already been cleaned . On the whole great hotel great location great room lay outs but then again the room i eventually stayed in was brand new never before used .What i will add is that for a new hotel thats only opened a few weeks the first room they offered my looked like a rock group had stayed in it and trashed the place.Tommy fae Scotland best 10 days in Vegas by far [--]", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cGreat potential but not quite there yet\u201d", "Author": "hangbo", "ReviewID": "UR53054340", "Content": "We stayed for 5 nights from Jan. 1-6. We had to wait until 3:30 to check in, but we did get a room on 43rd floor with great views. There is a very modern feel to the room. Bed was extremely comfortable, and the blackout shades allowed for sleeping in very late without the sun waking us up. The refrigerator didn't work and the minibar wasn't stocked, but a person from maintenance brought us up the drinks we requested on the house to make up for minibar being empty. We only got the free bottles of water once during the entire stay despite having evening turndown service at least three times. Service from housekeeping (Emanuel) and maintenance (Harris) were very helpful when I became ill during the stay from some bad food one night. Housekeeping during the day though seemed spotty - our shampoo, conditioner, soap,etc. weren't always restocked. Bath salts appeared on our 3rd night but weren't replaced. These are things that I expect will be ironed out over time. In general though the attitude of most of the staff seemed to be very helpful. Location isn't ideal. We're still debating if we'd stay here again because of location - in general loved the room but the location makes it difficult to get around.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cIn serious need of new management\u201d", "Author": "shinrai", "ReviewID": "UR52669461", "Content": "This place is beautiful and has potential but because of some of the staff our stay was fouled.

No hot water on the first night of our 5 night stay. No plates/cups/utensils etc. in our suite so it's not a true condo/suite hotel as of yet. Bath tub drain did not work properly etc. The detail is not there and can be compared to a upper class hotel in China. Currently there are no customer comment cards available?! However the hotel's fitness center and fitness staff are worthy of compliments and are top notch.

They need to fix the TV systems. 1st room we got (all rooms very modern and pretty), the TV was broken. The moved us to a second room, only to see large red stains on the carpet, 5 total, all around the bed. Not something I want to walk on barefoot.. 3rd times the charm? Not really. Upgraded to a suite to make up for it. A half hour into the room, TV broke. It took them 45 minutes to send up someone to fix it, and then, it broke again 30 minutes after he left. 2. Don't go if you plan on showering. There was absolutely the worst shower I have ever taken. Took 30 minutes to get hot water, seriously, 30 minutes. (after the TV debacle, didn't want to call down again). I figured lots of guests must be getting ready at the same time, no excuse, but whatever. Nope, I took 3 miserable showers at 3 different times of the day. NO HOT WATER, when you did get the water going, the water pressure was a joke. I mean, really, it was BAD. Took forever to get the shampoo and conditioner out. At one point i considered rinsing off in the sink, it was really that bad. 3. No direct access to the sister hotel Aria (where the casino is located and entry to the mall). You have to walk outside, across the valet and street area and then back inside. I thought this was a huge mistake on their part. It was freezing and SO inconvenient. I would think a tunnel or something would be a no brainer. Encore/Wynn are connected, Mandalay/THEhotel are connected, wth? There is a tunnel to Bellagio though. Oh and there was no pool when we went. In relation to City Center: 4. The tram, seriously, what were they thinking??? We took it from Crystals to Bellagio. 1st of all, no street access. You have to leave the hotel, walk outside, into Aria, leave Aria, go into the mall, go up 2 or 3 escalators, or the oddly placed elevators, and then go outdoors again to get to the tram. What were they thinking with this design?? 5. Crystals Mall, wow. There is no flow to the design. Dead spaces, no staff, can't get to the elevators or escalators easily at all. There is some great visual aspects, but I can't believe how obviously bad the design is. 6. The whole City Center entrance looks like an airport. No landscaping, just concrete ramps and signage. 7. The Aria casino was dark as some people mentioned, I tend to like dark decor, but there was something I couldn't put my finger on, it wasn't warm/inviting at all. (It was a little airportish in some areas, but that wasn't even it.) A few more design blunders/oversights here too. Like the taxi line and Haze nightclub. You can tell they didn't really take into consideration people waiting to get in or lines for events, so they just kinda winged it last minute. People are crammed behind the escalators to that floor. There is no staff back there, and minimal light. When we were there it was covered in trash people had discarded while they waiting to get into a concert. The only place ot get a taxi in the whole hotel/casino, is blocked by this line of people and the front of Haze. You have to literally go through a maze of people between the line and the club to get to the cab line. Then once you are there, you walk to walk outside and down about 40 yards to the cabs, it looks more like an alley than anything else. On the whole: It's bad design with even worse execution.
