{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beautiful Tuscan Villa in Florence In our recent trip to Florence, we have spent some wonderful days at the Park Palace Hotel. When we first saw we were amazed to see this beautiful old Tuscan villa. Surrounded by luxurious vegetation. The personnel was very friendly and helpful with directions and tips to visit Florence. The rooms were large and wonderfully decorated in old Tuscan style. We really appreciated the feeling of being in an old stylish, refined atmosphere. I was very surprised to realise that we could hardly hear the cars passing in the street in front of the hotel. The beds were really comfortable and even my wife that has a back problem slept wonderfully. I definitely recommend a dip in the swimming pool in the shadow of a centenary Lebanon cedar. If you appreciate vegetation you will be happy to find beautiful centenary trees not only in the hotel premises, but also on the streets leading to Florence. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel and the town centre is just 15 minutes away by foot. If you have a car you can also park it for free inside the hotel. The quality was worth the price, and I would return anytime.", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR577811236", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Luis_alfacinha"}, {"Content": "This could someday be a great place to stay, but beware of it's present condi I booked 2 rooms in this hotel for our very recent rip, relying on the aspect of the pool and outskirts to give us both the feel of staying at a Tuscan country villa while being able to tour and eat in Florence. The last time I was in Florence in late May/early June, it was scorchingly hot and humid so having a pool to cool off in and to have early evening cocktails at was our plan. It was very disappointing and embarrasing to me, since I booked this for the four of us, to arrive and see an empty pool under repair. It was 4:00 PM on a Friday so the thought of getting another cab to take us and our luggage back to town to find another accomodation seemed daunting, so we decided to stay. I negotiated a 30 euro per night per room price reduction with the manager, so that helped. But still, I would have rather booked in town if I had known there was no pool to enjoy.The villa is quite charming in it's decor(, but the exterior gardens were all overgrown and not well tended to. Even if the pool had been operating, there is a huge pine tree (that's been poorly groomed through the years and should be removed) that would have blocked most of the sun.We were given 2 rooms on the top floor and were quite nice. Brand new carpeting, very nice and tasteful brand new bathrooms, comfortable beds with new linens, brand new flat panel TV, and quite roomy. They still have some touches to finish, but it was a nice room as long as you are under 6' tall. There are dormers, especially in the shower, that would make it uncomfortable for a tall person (the lower floor rooms had enormously tall ceilings). We had the room with the only terrace, which I enjoyed. The views, especially south, were very nice and lush. The view of old Florence, however, was not so great. Trees, hills, and buildings blocked the best of it, but you do get to see a sliver of the duomo dome.The other problem was the renovations going on in rooms below, and we heard banging, saws, etc. throughout our stay. Hearing these sounds prior to commiting to stay upon our arrival, I asked if this was going to be continuing through the weekend and Monday holiday, and the manager and attendant both promised it wouldn't. Big lie. Also, the pool repairman showed up early Sunday AM and was making all sorts of racket until 9:00 PM.", "Date": "Jun 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR591352157", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Jeff2131"}, {"Content": "Lovely people The Park Palace has a lot going for it, lovely friendly staff, a beautiful building, spacious light airy rooms, delightful terrace to sit and eat breakfast.

Quiet area, no trouble or problems.Sadly all is not wonderful, there is a large tree in the gardens which not only covers three quarters of the pool with shade but also is home to more mosquito's than I would try to count, apart from the vast number of bites my wife and I had to endure. The hotel put mosquito machines with tablets in the rooms, which was kind, but a bit of a giveaway too. We used sprays but these beasts seemed to ignore it. I know you get this problem all over the world, it was very itchy but we still loved the place and the people, out of mosquito season it must be delightful.", "Date": "Aug 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR846346804", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "devonroamer"}, {"Content": "Badly in Need of Renovation This is a grand old villa located just south of Florence.

This hotel never purports to be a palace and should not be judged as one. The reviewer from England must have taken the hotel name literally without reading up on any of the information prior to arrival. It is an old villa. And very well kept. All of the advertising says that it was once a private villa. It does not even resemble a palace and never claims to be one. Do not regard the poor review given by a misinformed person. The one from Japan is correct. The bathroom was very clean and the room was large. The furniture and decor should be updated but those are minor points.

We had a corner room on an upper floor so the view was on 2 sides of the room. It was great to look out and see other villas on the hills. The view was really cool. The staff was very helpful. The breakfast room was nice with average food. Eating on the veranda was nice. It is a long walk to the main sights of Florence. We did it once and then took taxis after that. But if you are driving a car and do not want to deal with the traffic in Florence then this is a perfect place to park and not have to deal with getting lost in traffic. ##OH, DO NOT RENT A CAR FROM TRANSHIRE. They ripped us off when we pre-paid for our rental and they told us to take the compact car even though we paid for an Audi A4 or similar. Go through THRIFTY. Trust ONLY American companies. TRANSHIRE IS A DODGY BRITISH company.## Anyway, the hotel is clean. The bathroom was huge with 2 sinks. The airconditioning worked well.
