The location is great: about 10 minutes from Alexanderplatz and Museum Island, and very quiet, It's about 50m from Markisches Museum station so also well connected for getting to Potsdamer Platz and restaurants in Franzosiche Strausse. Definitely worth wandering round the area and going to the museum. Nice walks along the river. The staff were great. I particularly valued the reception staff who went out of their well to be welcoming ( let me check in early, for example) and followed through until I was off site (I booked an early taxi at 5.45 for the airport and was, predicatably, early so they rang the taxi people and hurried it up). Simple clean unfussy and comfortable rooms. Some people won't appreciate the adulation of the dollar!

The hotel was nicely decorated. Everything of course had something to do with the wallstreet theme, that includes the huge wallpaper behind the front desk in the lobby: 3 seemngly ecstatic men, looking up at dollar bills falling down from the sky. Hilarious at first. Apart from that, decoration is simple and classy. Rooms were very nice, with custom made drawers and closets. The bathroom would have been perfect if not for the absurd \"decorative\" 15 cm gap between both glass panels that are supposed to stop water from dripping outside the tub rather than helping it escape. One other noteworthy detail, the room is much smaller than what it looks like online. And the king bed is actually 2 beds brought together, can get very inconvenient at times. However, breakfast is great and varied, even despite its exorbitant price, and food at the bar is awesome, tastiest food I had during my stay in Berlin! Drinks are okay too. Staff is super helpful and nice, everything was crisp clean, rooms heated...

One great thing at this hotel is its proximity to the underground, which will take you anywhere in berlin! Otherwise, the location is not close to anything much. Overall, I would stay here if I were more interested in price and a good night's sleep than a view or being able to walk to the sights.

I would love to have their carpet in my office! The staff at the hotel were very courteous and spoke very good English. Especially the intern from Holland, Niginia, who was very friendly and helpful at all times and always had a smile on her face. The hotel was clean and the rooms were spotless. Our room was cleaned daily to a high standard. The staff even helped my wife (via email) to order some cake for my birthday and have it in our room as a surprise. Breakfast at the hotel is a little bit pricy. We always ate at \"Milly's Cafe\" around the corner, which can be found enroute to Alexandar Platz. WiFi at the hotel was easy to access, although the username and password changes every 24hrs so you have to go to reception to obtain the new details. We landed at TXL and took the bus to Ernst-Reuter-Platz and jumped on the U-Bhan to SpittelMarkt. The hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from here. The hotel is between SpittelMarkt and Markisches-Museum (which is a little closer) This was a much quicker route than taking a bus to Alexander Platz and walking/u-bhan from there. The costs are the same and there are less tourists with luggage on the route we took. We felt really safe walking around Berlin at all times of the day and late at night, including the area where the hotel is. We generally walked everywhere in Berlin and the hotel is in a great location within walking distance of everything: 10-15 mins to Alexandar Platz 10-15 mins to Museum Island 30-40 mins to Brandenburg Gate I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Berlin to stay here (business or pleasure) as its in a quite location, but not too far from all the attractions.

Here were my takeaways from my stay in May 29th and 30th, 2011. I hope this feedback is as helpful to you as other reviewers posts were for me. :-) Accommodations-- I was so impressed with every aspect of the accommodations in this hotel. It was SUPER clean and had very stylish, modern decor. The Wall Street theme was a trip! As an American visiting Europe for the first time (and staying in Berlin on the last two days of our eleven day journey), it was comforting to see George Washington's face on the dollar bill carpeting on the floor. LOL! It was fun but also tastefully done and not overpowering or hokey. Even with as modern as the furnishings were (sometimes modern = uncomfortable), the accommodations were wonderful! The bed was super comfortable, had a great comforter, and nice pillows. You won't be disappointed with the great night's sleep you'll get. The bathroom was sleek and stylish-- and HUGE! The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure. I also soaked in the deep tub one night after a long day of walking around the city. It was just what I needed for my aching muscles. Such a great hotel to come \"home\" to on our trip. Service The front desk attendants were absolutely amazing. They were so polished and professional and really went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. They gave us special access codes to the internet for free wi-fi and were super helpful in directing us how best to get around town. On our last day there, they made sure we knew best how to get to the bus stop that would get us to the airport easiest. Seriously fantastic service!!! I will also note that upon our return to the States, we actually got a bill in the mail for $25 for the mini-bar, which we did not use. I emailed the Park Plaza Wallstreet Berlin Hotel to dispute the charges and the manager removed the charges immediately and refunded my credit card instantly. She was extremely apologetic for the oversight on the part of their housekeeping staff and took care of us right away. I don't mind oversights... it happens... it is how they are dealt with and this property proved again that their service was top-notch and extremely professional. Great people! Location The hotel is located in a quiet, safe part of town and close to the Alexanderplatz area. There is a subway station SUPER close to the hotel, so getting around town was easy and convenient. Best of all, we felt really safe getting back to our hotel late at night. Amenities My hubby took advantage of the 24-hour gym and really loved that they had a sauna to give him a relaxing post-workout experience. While we didn't take advantage of the hotel restaurant or bar, we saw others enjoying good food, drinks, and conversation in those dining areas. Pics I posted some photos of our wonderful room and hope this review and the pics help you to realize that you can't go wrong with this fantastic hotel! I kick myself for wasting so much time researching any other hotels after reading the great reviews about this one. It was a fantastic experience and, on future trips to Berlin, I would stay there again without thinking twice!

The towels were a tad on the small side too. Having said that, I would definitely choose to stay here again. The journey from Tegal airport took about half an hour and cost around \u20ac20. The underground and bus network is very easy to follow (even when we were thrown off for 'engineering works') and having the hotel on the main tube line that runs through the city was a definite plus. The Christmas markets were great for food and handmade crafts. You can see nearly all of them in a short trip and still have time for sightseeing and shopping. A useful point to note is that there is a small cafe \"Millys\" close to the hotel (right out of the front doors, first road on the left) which serves a good breakfast at a rate far cheaper than the hotel.

A great location right next to a U Bahn station, good rates and big modern fun rooms. The lobby is nothing special and the bar area kind of ugly in that cold Ikea modern way. The elevator is decidedly slow. The hotel is a converted old courtyard building and should somehow be very charming and cozy: but isn't. Or at least I didn't find it to be. My three grievances are, in no particular order: they offer: \"free Internet\" as a marketing ploy, when you book the room. OK free Internet is a good thing and something essential to me as I am always uploading pictures and online or streaming videos that I might want to post, etc. I won't stay in a hotel if internet isn't included. Well what you quickly discover when you log onto the the free Internet is that it is basic Internet. So you really can't stream videos and to upload 4 pictures it took 15 minutes and if you uploaded too many you got a warning message saying you have reached your data quota (or some such thing). And to get proper actual working Internet it was 15 Euro a day ($20.36). Which the first several times I tried to buy it I was not able to as I kept getting error messages. And when I asked the front desk they said: sorry we don't control that it is done by an outside company so you have to call them. I did. They didn't understand the error message either, but in the end when I paid for it on my credit card instead of to my room it worked fine. And was very quick and allowed me to do everything I needed. So, not a hotel for business. Here is another example of why this isn't a hotel to stay in if you need to get anything done: A friend bought me a \"pay as you go phone\" so I would save some money while in Germany and as a birthday present. She brought it by on the afternoon of the 11th. The front desk of the hotel made no effort what so ever to contact me to say: hey you have something at the front desk. When I went downstairs to ask if they had something for me I was told: We are very busy and can't find it now can you come back Monday? (This was Saturday) I could not. So I waited until they found it (took all of three minutes). I stayed here at the start and end of my trip and I was both times just down the hall from the 5th floor elevator. First time across from a slamming fire door next time adjacent to the fire door which every time it closed slammed causing my door to rattle. Every banging foot going up and down the hall wall reverberated in my room. Every word spoke was crystal clear in my room. Unlike most hotels there is no little hall way with a bathroom off of it to buffer sound. Similar issues occurred with people dragging their luggage through the courtyard.

I came back as the location of the hotel is hard to beat at the price for a long-weekender tourist: U2 underground station is literally 1 minut walk, Gendarmenmarkt, Museuminsel, Unter den Linden are within easy walking distance. The room was clean and had a nice, minimalist, modern feel about it. Early check-in was not a probem with the reception and I must point out that they also have some green credentials: the sauna is open from 6am to 10pm but you need to let them know if you would like to use it as the system is not in operation all the time. This was pointed out to me right at the time of arrival, so when I phoned at 6.40am the response was that the sauna will be ready in 20 minutes. And it was - very efficient. The rooms and the surroundings are very quiet. I liked the firmness of the matress in the bed - for me a must-have for a good sleep. I do not bother buying breakfast from a hotel nowadays because of the extortinate prices all of them tend to charge for it. Of course it is nice to take the lift down to the restaurant in the morning, read the paper and have a croissant and coffee without leaving the hotel. However, if it is not raining, one can stroll to Housevogteiplatz or Gendarmenmarkt and eat there ... But it is everyone's own call. In the evenings ... I could not locate a pub in the immediate vicinity of the hotel but this is when easy access to the underground has its benefits again. You can enjoy the beer in the Prater beer garden in Prenzlauer Berg and still be in the hotel within 15 minutes after you have left Eberwalder Strasse (subsitute the drinking hole with anothe establishment along U2 line). The net is that this is a relaxed, quiet, very efficiently run hotel in a great location from the perspective of a tourist - no pressure on the guests but if you have a request, the staff will go to great lengths to deliver.

We were assured that the intercom problem would be fixed, but as we left the car there during our stay, never had cause to use it again to see if it had been. It is ideally situated for the underground, about 200 metres walk away and Alexander Platz is only 2 stops away. The Berlin Card is brilliant and can be bought at the hotel reception.

Extremely large bathroom, quality toiletries, comfortable king sized bed, mini fridge, complimentary internet, work desk, tv, and seperate area between bathroom & bedroom, which could be used for dressing, storage & even had table & chair, so we both had work areas for our laptops ! The breakfast was self service, with an excellent selection of foods available. We certainly didn't go hungry. My only criticism was that on the 1st morning I had asked a very pleasant waitress if decaf tea was available and she said yes & actually brought it to me. The single tea bag cover stated \" decaffinated tea- infuse for 4 minutes\", but on the 2nd morning, that waitress was not there & I asked another member of staff, who said they didn't think they had decaf, but would ask. A Manager type person approached my partner & told him that they didn't have decaf tea - to which my partner said that that was strange as I'd had some yesterday. They did have decaf coffee & I settled for that, but the attidude of staff was not good as we were made to feel as though we'd made the whole thing up. On our 1st evening we ate at the hotel. As we approached the restaurant I said that we had a reservation, but I'd like to go to the bar first for a drink. The waiter said that he could see to our drinks & what would we like ? 23 minutes later we got our beers !!!! The food being served after ordering was just as slow and very small portions by German standard. So the next night we ate out & went to the Kartoffelcabin which was fantastic.

But the guy couldn't really understand what that was. Maybe is bigger in Sweeden. But F.Y.I cider is like a soda with alcohol.

The hotel looks great, especially around the public areas, with a US Wallstreet/dollar theme throughout. The bar was very well stocked (with plenty of rare whiskies) and had a great selection of cocktails which pleased my wife. The hotel is very well situated for the U-Bahn station M\u00e4rkisches Museum, which is on the U2 line, although we made the mistake of taking the exit marked for the museum at the station when we arrived, which takes you out the wrong side (i.e. further away). Breakfast was buffet style, with a large choice of food on offer. The hot food was boiled and scrambled egg, sausage, meatballs and bacon (there was something else as well I\u2019m sure). The cold choices where very numerous from smoked fish, various cold meats, rolls, bread and of course the essential, UK style white sliced bread and toaster. Overall there was plenty of choice and a ready supply of tea/coffee, 3 types of fruit juice and iced water. Check-in was fast and pleasant, although entry to the room was not until 2pm. However it\u2019s not a problem to leave suitcases and wander about or enjoy the bar. The room was fairly spacious with a good sized bathroom (although it only had a shower in ours, but some rooms do have a bath). The surrounding area was pretty quiet at night, so noise is not an issue with this hotel. Bed was on the firm side, but okay. It was a double with 2 pillows on it and an extra in the cupboard. Only thing I\u2019ve not seen before (maybe this is a German thing) was although it was a double bed you got to single duvets, not really an issue, just a bit strange. Room was well appointed having a safe, hairdryer, coffee machine, mini bar/fridge, TV with pay channel option, fast wireless internet (via free voucher from reception \u2013 each voucher lasts 24 hours so get one for each day) and controllable heating/cooling (the cooling action modest in our room). The cream carpet in the room (which features the dollar bill motif) showed signs of age, but I\u2019ve been informed that they are in the process of replacing them. Room overall was of good quality.

Just make sure you exit out of the right set of stairs.... For the hotel itself I was rather disappointed after reading some of the glowing reviews and seeing pictures. The rooms look MUCH better in photos than in person. We found them rather tacky and cheap looking which can be easily overlooked. My biggest complaint however is that it was filthy! I had to wipe down the counters in the bathroom because there was hair and soap residue on them. The floor was really disgusting with hair everywhere and stains like someone kept their shoes in there. We asked the front desk if they could mop it quickly the next morning but it was never done in the 3 days we were there. I think they just swept it once. There is so much dust and grime built up that it was really disgusting. It's like they never dusted, even though there are ledges right beside the bed. Sleep quality was poor for myself and my husband. We don't really like hard beds and these were like sleeping on the floor. The good thing was that you don't get any street noise as the hotel is located in a very quiet area. Oh and there is free internet you just need to ask the front desk for some vouchers to get the username and password for 24 hrs. There isn't however free breakfast which was rather disappointing as this was the only hotel we stayed in that didn't provide that. You'll have to go to Alexanderplatz or somewhere else to find some restaurants as there didn't seem to be anything close to the hotel. For a hotel that was recently renovated I expected the rooms to be in better shape. Overall it wasn't a bad price for what you got but I'm sure there are much better hotels out there.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery Good\u201d", "Author": "Pierre4823", "ReviewID": "UR93087250", "Content": "Stayed here for three nights, including New Year's Eve, in two Junior Suites.

Overall, our long stay was extremely comfortable, we would definitely recommend it to our closest friends, with only a few minor points of critique. The check-in was quick and effortless. We had made an online booking for the executive suite. We were placed on the fifth floor. Minor critique: no help with luggage. Tip: use the whole name of the hotel if you get a cab. They only know the Wallstreet Park Plaza. Furthermore, there seemed to be a difference between the offer we booked online (Booking.com) and the service the hotel was able to deliver. Nothing big: just no fruits or free bottle of wine, or a free movie every night. The promoted cinema in the hotel was closed most of the time. The staff at the reception was exceptionally friendly, informative and helpfull, be it on Xmas eve, new years day or late at night. Even a simple call downstairs for a new (free!) access code to the hotel wifi internet was treated with hospitality. In addition, we were very impressed by the quality of the food from the bar menu and the available wines, and by the warmth and friendliness of the staff behind the bar. We specifically enjoyed the Riesling and the Montepulciano. Not cheap, but good value for money. Great non-alcoholic cocktails too, by the way. After a few days, the hotel bar became our favourite place to unwind and digest the day. The executive room was very comfortable, with modern design, and especially the bathroom was very spatious. The room had a creative twist: the money/Wallstreet-theme was in the carpet, tissues and more. Regrettably, we did not have a very impressive view, despite of being on the top floor. This was, according to one of the receptionists upon checking in, true for the entire hotel. Lastly, the location. The 'WPP' is only a minute away from the Ubahn nr. 2, M\u00e4rkisches Museum, and within walking distance of the old city sites, such as the Nikolaiviertel. This ubahn, by the way, is a central line that will bring you directly to, among others, Prenzlauerberg, Friendrichshain, and Olympia Stadion or Potsdamer Platz, thus connecting east and west-Berlin. Go here if you're looking for a modernly designed quality hotel with good rates and a hospitable staff in a quiet, but central part of town.

Overall, the hotel is excellent value for the quality of service, cleanliness, design concept and room, although breakfast at 17 euros is a tad over-priced. And yes, better signage both at the U-Bahn station and the hotel corridor would help (the corridor leading to my room was \"hidden\" by a door with no signage at all and I had to enlist the help of a hotel staff to track down the location of my room), but this is only a very minor inconvenience.

Hotel still hardly looks worn, especially considering the dollar bill print cream coloured carpet. Super comfortable beds, good pillows. Only niggle in the room i would say is the lack of an iron and ironing board in the room but loads of storage space and in room safe and honesty mini bar. As i spent most of the stay enjoying the nightlife, it meant sleeping in most days really late, not a peep from the corridors or the adjoining roms. Be warned though that the maid service does end a little early so you may awake at 3pm to find some fresh towels, toilet roll and toiletries for the bathroom in a bag hung on the door handle which i guess is better than them not servicing the room at all. Managed to try the sauna/fitness room this time round, quiet and relaxing which is how this should be. Bar food was okay and bar prices for drinks are reasonable compared to the UK for a starter on a night out.

I usually check reviews here when staying at a new hotel but did not have time as these reservations were made for me last minute. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a nice boutique hotel. More than that it also seems to have really thought through the design. My room had a cute dollar bill rug. Two modern desk chairs. Lot's of storage in the well thought out design. There is a typical wardrobe(although no iron/ironing board that I could find) but also has plenty of storage on the sides of the bed (two cabunets with mini bar and coffee station). The cabinets extended over the bed as well making a nice cozy sleeping area. I thought the room was very spacious compared to other European hotels I have stayed at (Room 302). The bathroom was just a glass walled section of the room - not terribly private but fine if you are alone. I did not have the water issue mentioned below but they may have taken care of that as there was a plastic lip on the bottom of the shower door to prevent leakage into the rest of the bathroom. The bathrrom was not spacious (would be hard for two to share) but well appointed. Best hotel hair dryer I ever used. The beds were twins pushed together with two twin duvets. I should have called and asked for a queen duvet, but did not think it would be an issue. Sleep ing on the twins together was fine as I only take one side usually but the twin duvet was way too small. The room was quiet but you could hear foot falls as people walked down the hall - not a big deal - I usually sleep well. My only disappointment was the slow service at breakfast. After sitting down it took over 10 minutes (and I had to ask) for some one to bring me coffee. The staff seemed very distracted. The rest of the service was fine.

The good part is that the room is clean and has cool decors and it also has coffee tea maker in the room which is nice. The location is good, it's only 100 meters away from the U bahn station and it's also quiet. There is a supermarket and a bakery at the other side of the hotel. The breakfast is way too expensive 17 euro, the bakery is very nice fresh made bread pastries and sandwiches... only for a euro or 2. You can also get big bottles of water and soda from the supermarket for a fraction of the price that the hotel charges. The negative part of the hotel is the service. One day nobody even made our room even when we had sign on the door to clean the room. We requested the room to be cleaned in the late afternoon when we returned back to the hotel, but the reception said the clean crew only works from 1-3pm which was a lie. We didn't know of course until the very last day that another reception girl said if the clean crew has left, the reception girl would have to clean the room herself and that's part of her job. Apparently the girl was too lazy. We were out of bath gel and shampoo for 2 days and nobody came to refill them. Also they had a false fire alarm set off in the middle of the night around 12am. It was so blasting loud and woke me and my husband up. The announcement said that everyone should get out, so we did go out, but after we got down, nobody from the hotel was downstairs to give any direction or explanation. We had to wait down there for quite some time then the fire truck came to turn off the false alarm. We found it to be very unprofessional and rude of the hotel not to inform the guests what's going on and how long we had to stay out etc which they could do as they had loud speakers earlier to tell people to go downstairs, and afterwords no apologies of any kind for situation like this. In addition, the reception girl gave us the wrong information when we asked how to go to the museum island. She directed us on the wrong bus that actually went a different direction, and it took us more than an hour to get there instead of 10 minutes or so. Free internet is good, but they make you to get this paper every 24 hours to for a new password to login. It'd be easier if I just use one password for the entire stay. A good hotel to stay if you don't need much of their assistance or services. We also complained this situation to the manager, but she was very reluctant to solve any problems. At first she offered a free upgrade of the room for next time which costs them nothing and we didn't think we would want to stay in this hotel again. Therefore, we didn't like the resolution, so at the end she gave us a very small refund for not cleaning and making up the room.

We found the hotel very easy to find from Schonefeld Airport. We took the S-bahn to Alexanderplatz and then got the underground line U2 to the M\u00e4rkisches Museum. As another reviewer pointed out, when you get off the train, turn right, and when you exit the underground station the hotel is across the road on your left hand side. The reception staff were very friendly, and we asked and got a quiet room on the second floor. The room was fine, very modern, bedding very European - 2 single duvets on double bed - but we were a bit disappointed by the room size. It was on the small size. But as we didn't plan on spending much time in the room, it did the job. Bathroom was curiously almost as big as the bedroom, and again is very modern and bright. We had a few drinks in the bar on one of the evenings, and found the staff very friendly and professional. The bar and lobby area is also the only place were free WIFI is available. I find it strange that many modern hotels still insist on charging for Internet usage in guest rooms. It smacks of greed, and for me leaves a feeling of being taken for a mug! I found the hotel location to be very central, after all it is not even a ten minute stroll from Alexanderplatz and there are plenty of restaurants and bars in that area. Also the huge 3 storey Alexa shopping centre is located there. As another reviewer pointed out, there are Lidl and Plus supermarkets located at the back of the hotel, through the courtyard - handy for picking up a few beers or wine for drinking in the room.

The room - on the second floor - was still newish, with high ceilings and the stock exchange decor much discussed by other reviewers.

The bathroom (with a shower) was also good, even though it had a rather strange configuration .... the shower was almost as big as the rest of the bathroom. But this was probably due to the fact that the hotel was built into a converted building. Breakfast (which was included in the room price) was more than appropriate, in a veranda in the second courtyard. I did not eat at the hotel, but had a drink at the bar, which was stylish, but - don't ask me why - was not very cosy. It gave me the impression of a Soviet sanatorium lobby.

It was particularly important to us that we had a good hotel, as we'd saved up for some time for the trip and were hoping to make it one to remember - we weren't disappointed!

The decor was unusual and modern (a nice change to the identical hotel rooms that you find in most hotel chains), the bed was very comfy and the room was spotlessly clean.

The receptionist was very helpful and quickly moved us to room 111 on the other side of the hotel (a long way from the lift). I think we were upgraded to an Executive Room as the new room had a great bathtub, rather than just a shower! To echo other people's comments - the beds were very comfortable and the hotel was quiet at night - the best recipe for a good night's sleep! The bathtub was also full-sized and very deep - good for soaking in after a day of trekking round the sights.

I can't add to this as we didn't breakfast at the hotel, however, if it does look a little steep, we found a fantastic little cafe called Millies Cafe, less than 10 minutes walk away (on the corner of Gertraudenstrasse and Fischerinsel) which did a range of breakfasts; from the French (consisting of croissants and marmalade) for under 5 euros, to the biggie, a Millies Breakfast (including yoghurt, four bread rolls, salad, boiled egg, smoked salmon, meats and cheeses) for less than 8 euros, and very nice too!

The only issue we found was with the tea/coffe making facilities, where there was only powdered milk available, which, rather than mixing nicely into my coffee turned into lumps and spoiled it, however this is such a minor point, and other reviewers have offered tips on where to go to buy your own proper milk, so no biggie.

However, there is an underground station less than 1 minute away which is one of the central routes from where you can get to Friedrichstrasse in less than 10 minutes. The hotel is superb.

The breakfast was more than one could ask for and beyond the usual, albeit delicious, meat, cheese fruit selection. There were many small nice touches. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful including checking train times for us to the airport. Berlin is a gem of a city and has to be visited. The eastern sector of the city, in my view, has the best of the city and has been well maintained.

And what a Zoo it is, it leaves UK Zoo's wanting. The staff at the hotel are great, especially the bar staff who are extremely friendly and all speak very good english. There have been other people who complained about the cost of breakfast at the hotel, we didn't have breakfast but we did have a couple of evening meals and with a Steak at 16 Euros and a Burger meal at 13 Euros, the prices are very similar to those of a pub in the UK but of better quality, so I can't imagine the cost of the breakfast being too over the top and you do appear to get a lot for your money.

As you get off the train go right to the exit and go up the steps.Walk straight forward across the road and you will soon see the The Golden Buddy-Bear. The hotel bar opens until 1am, obviously if it is not too busy they will close earlier but in the five nights we were there they were open from 11am until 1am. The rooms have hair dryers, which my wife found to be excellent as it is an actual hand held dryer so you have control over the temperature and not the constant heat which you get from those units which are stuck to the wall in other hotels. If like me you enjoy your cups of tea, the cups in the rooms are small mugs and not the two sip cups as in other hotels.

We had room service one night and were happy with the burger & chips, service and price. Overall, I would recommend the Park Plaza. Berlin is a fantastic city, loads to see and do. Visiting in December allowed us to visit the Christmas markets which were fantastic, and the best of which were within walking distance of the hotel. I would recommend the Park Plaza as a base for touring Berlin.", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cexcellent hotel...\u201d", "Author": "volcomcito", "ReviewID": "UR13106607", "Content": "we stayed at the Park Plaza Wallstreet Berlin from January 16-22. the cab from TXL is 21euros. staff was very helpful regarding restaurants, washing centers and internet cafe. hotel room is minimalistic but very cool. the GW carpet is nice, as well as the bathroom and tub. we had room 501 and it was quiet during nights... we opted for the 24hrs internet access for 17euros the last night of our stay, so we can stay in touch with our family and check in for our flights from our room. the U-Bahn station (markishes museum) is just 45 seconds from the hotel front door. from that (U2 Line) you can go anywhere in Berlin.. we also used the sauna, and it was good.

Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for 5 nights over the New Years. We had some good experiences and also some concerns during our stay, which are as follows: Good 1. Very close to two underground stations, less that 1 minute walk. (its on the u2 red line) 2. Excellent location, about 15-20 min walk to the Brandendurgh gate/Tor. About 6 minutes to Unter den Linden 3. We were upgraded free of charge to a suite. This room was spacious and bright and decorated in a modern \"wallstreet\" style. The bathroom was also spacious, shower pressure was excellent and the bath was bigger than usual. 4. All hotel employees that we dealt with had good conversational english. Bad 1. Breakfast price was not included in the room price and this was not made clear during the booking process. 2. 17euro for breakfast per-person is excessive in a relatively low cost city. 3. Room service is exceptionally weak. One night ice was ordered but not delivered. The following night more room service was ordered from an exceptionally weak menu (the menu had no main course, two starters, four sandwich options, one salad option and one desert option, and stops serving at 11pm). At least a quarter of the listed menu was not available when we called. Ice this time was delivered but we only got 5 ice-cubes in a smal glass. Must not have heard of an ice-bucket? 4. Bar atmosphere was atrocious, there was barely 15 people there over the course of 5 nights. 5. The room was frequently cold, although on closer inspection we could adjust the heaters. Finally, the age old question, would we stay here again? The answer is yes, however I would first check other hotels in the area.", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cPleasant hotel\u201d", "Author": "Yezzie", "ReviewID": "UR11546654", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel 23 November-26 November and we (me and my boyfriend) had a pleasant time there.

The room was freezing though and when we put heating on the cleaner turned it down when sprucing up the room (sorry but my feet cared little for their carbon footprint). My only warning is the food at the number 23 at the Hotel, it was awful (breakfast is nice, buffet) think they were trying too hard , far too hard. Cannot however fault the staff.

Would recommend you get the U to Potsdamer Platz as there are so many restaurants and bars to choose from, atmosphere is great too.
