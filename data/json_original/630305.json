It is centrally located with most of Madrid within easy walking distance. I paid extra for a room on the 5th floor with a private terrace. While this was a nice feature, it probably eliminated some of the interior space. In addition, with no outdoor furniture the terrace was mostly useless. I agree with the other reviewers, the rooms are quite small, in part caused by a very large minibar unit in the room. However, the rooms and bathrooms are very nicely appointed and the limited amount of time I spent in the room - did not care so much about the smaller size. While it was still cool in Madrid at night, the rooftop bar was not fully functioning outdoors, but it did provide a nice view of the surrounding square and city. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful - making you feel very welcome. I did eat in the restaurant for the breakfast buffet. It was nicely done with many options, although I do agree that 25 EUR is quite expensive - although consistent with other breakfast options throughout Europe.

When I am travelling I like to stay SUPER CLOSE to the nightlife (makes it safer that way) and walkable distance to all the major attractions. I did NOT take any public transport or taxis during my stay in Madrid. I was able to walk to all major attractions including the 3 museums (museo del prado, arte reina sofia, museo thyssen- bornemisza), retiro park, palacio real, gran via, plaza de espana, puerta del sol, calle del alcala, plaza mayor, arco de cuchilleros, chueca, salamanca (probably the farthest). ***If you are interested in participating in the nightlife (a must do in Madrid) I would recommend staying in this area rather than near the triangle of museums. The nightlife in this area is unbeatable- many great restaurants, tabernas (bars), tapas, and tucked away small clubs and much larger nearby clubs. ###SERVICE // Ritz The service here paralleled the Ritz. The staff was friendly and approachable. There was never a sense of arrogance and they were able to anticipate and/or respond quickly to any needs you may have. There is even an \"everything is possible\" speed dial on every phone ;). ###Fitness Center THEY DO HAVE ONE! I like a quick run before I start my day. The fitness center is small (just how I like it) with 2 treadmills, 2 ellipiticals, and 2 stairclimbers and free weights. This is where I got half my breakfast- scrumptious green apples alway stocked here (hehe). (There is also a nearby upscale gym if you care to pay). ###Room I went with a friend and we got a great steal via expedia on deluxe room for $140-160 US dollars/night (usually the price is > $200). We stayed for 8 nights. The room was small as many European hotel rooms are but the room was very clean/modern and the details were cool. Free WI-FI by the way. There were two electronic buttons on either side of room which turned on various lights and had a \"hey you sexy thing\" button that turned on this purple light in the room which gave it the same purple glow as the outside of the hotel. There was also a stereo system and a speaker with separate control in bathroom! We were on the first floor and faced the inner courtyard of hotel which although without a view may have been a blessing as it was SUPER QUIET. There was only a small hum when the rooftop bar was open from Wed-Sun night. Who needs a view anyway when you're out of the room (most of the day... and night...) anyway? ###IF I travel back to Madrid, I will definitely stay here for all the reasons above.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Intcopiers", "ReviewID": "UR127622406", "Content": "I have stayed on three occasions, so good we are back again in November.

For older folks, the ME is like a Marriot Courtyard hotel but with a hip ambiance that's useless to you. Pluses: Staff are pleasant and friendly. The Supreme room is a nice size. Street noise was not an issue (in February). Noise from adjacent rooms and hallway was suitably muffled. The room was kept spotless by staff. Minuses: The room curtains don't block out all the light. The rooms have a complicated lighting system. Supreme rooms may or may not have a view, as the ME counts rooms facing the little triangular strip on the side of the hotel (Plaza del Angel) as having a view. I got a rug burn on my elbow from the sheets. Everything is overpriced, e.g., a mini can of Pringles from the minibar is 6 euros; a drink at the hotel bar is 13 euros. Key cards demagnetize frequently - we had get ours replaced twice. We received our wake up call one hour early (ugh), but instead of acknowledging the mistake, staff hung up.

Did you go to any museums?\" He told us that going through security can demagnetize their cards.

It's a somewhat cozier and brighter plaza than some others in Madrid, and only about a 10-minute walk from El Prado. Our flight arrived early in the morning, so our room wasn't ready - but the staff were very accommodating. They stored our bags, invited us to have breakfast in the dining room, and gave us suggestions for things to see within walking distance. We headed to El Prado - and, within half an hour or so, the front desk clerk called my cellphone to tell me our room was ready. How nice was that?! Our room was very comfortable. It faced onto the Plaza but was surprisingly quiet. We loved the room lighting - different buttons for different moods (work, romance, reading, etc.).

I received a corporate discount of EUR 149/night. The ME Madrid is a luxury boutique hotel located a short walk from the heart of Madrid, including Puerta del Sol and Plaza Major. It is about a 20-minute cab ride from the convention center, which can cost 15-20 euros, depending on your cab driver's route and traffic. The cab ride from the airport should cost around 40-45 euros, except for on Sundays when there are additional fees. It's a good idea to agree to the price of the cab ride at the airport before you get in the car. I opted for an interior room because the check-in clerk said it was the quietest in the hotel, which is what I requested. There was essentially no view except of a concrete inner courtyard and the windows of the other interior rooms across the way. However, I was okay with this given the tomb-like quietness of the room. The rooms are very comfortable and well designed. The bathrooms are spacious, made of marble, and with a shower that has different shower-head options. There is no bath tub, which seems pretty typical of Madrid. The desk area had plugs that worked with American equipment (like my laptop) with no need for a converter. One interesting detail is that there are about 8 lighting options at the desk area and another 8 next to the bed. It may take a while to figure it out, but you can definitely have lighting exactly as you like it, including a setting called \"You Sexy Thing\" which basically lights the room up pink. The rooms have large-screen flat TVs embedded into the walls as well as a stereo that sits in a cabinet. Toiletries are Aveda products. A colleague of mine opted for a room with a view and he LOVED it. He looked out over the Plaza de Santa Ana. The only drawback was that it was noisy well into the morning given the partying happening in the plaza. There are many bars and restaurants nearby as well as shopping. What struck me about this hotel is how incredibly warm, friendly and helpful everyone was, from the front desk to the restaurant to room service.

The roof top bar did not open before 9pm and it was really great to have a drink up there why they dont open these excellent facilities earlier I do not know We found the downstairs bar dull dark and dingy no bright colours here everything was dark brown. Breakfast was excellent but was served in a room without natural light on holiday we expect to see lots of light and plenty of sunshine there are enough miserable dark places at home. So my advice if staying there would be book a non standard room and enjoy all the beautiful places to visit like the Grand Palace near Plaza Mayor which was magnificent not the Glass one which was empty but situated in a lovely park with boating on the lake and for the Art lovers the Prada takes ages to get around so allow plenty of time.

Madrid turned out to be a fantastic destination for a short break; even if (like us) you are not interested in Spanish art, it is a worthwhile experience just for the architecture and the buzzing atmosphere. As for the ME Reina Victoria, its location is ideal. For a major European capital, Madrid has an amazingly compact city centre and everywhere of importance was within comfortable walking distance of this hotel.

This wasn't a problem to us as we was aware that normal check-in was at 2pm so we was happy to wait for a bit. He then took time our and explained where everything was i.e restaurant, breakfast room, bars etc and then asked us if we had visited Madrid before and what our intentions were whilst we were their. We explained that it was our first visit and that we was looking to do the normal sit seeing. The receptionist then took time out to explain his recommendation of the various sites and places to see/go to whilst we were there he also offered to booked anything that we wanted. After this brief conversation he told us that our room was ready and gave us our keys etc and asked for a porter to show us to our room. I booked us in a Deluxe room but was upgraded complimentary to s Supreme room which was amazing. Our room was fitted with the usual TV, free Wi-Fi, a 32-inch plasma TV & usual bathroom amenities as well as our own private balcony and views of the Plaza de Santa Ana and the Plaza del Angel which set the long weekend off to a good start. Once we unpacked we decided to take a little look around Madrid and see some of the sites that the receptionist talked about. After walking 5 minutes we came across the Grand via and realised that the location of the hotel was in fact better than first thought. After walking around for a few hours and see the sites we made our way back to the hotel to freshen up and the go our for a drink and bite to eat. Once we entered the hotel we was greeted by our names by the staff there. When we checked in we was recommended to to try the hotels own \"Black Mojito\" so we decided to give the hotel bar a quick go before we went out for a bite to eat. I ordered the Mojito and my girlfriend ordered a cosmopolitan. Both drinks arrived within 5 minutes, The Mojito lived up to it's recommendation and the cosmopolitan was left with it very own shaker for my girl friend to keep.. Obviously it's a small touch but these things make a difference. It was my girlfriend birthday on the Friday and we made our way down the the breakfast room for breakfast upon our return we saw a message left on our voice mail from the check in manager wishing my girlfriend a happy birthday, again another small touch which made a difference. We decided to take a bus tour around Madrid which the hotel booked for us. The tour took the whole day and once we arrived back at the hotel a complimentary cake and bottle of champagne was left in the room for my girlfriends birthday. This wasn't requested but it was gratefully received. For the rest of the weekend we visited other tourist attractions like the Royal Palace and Plaza Mayor and found that all attraction were within a good 15 minutes walk from the hotel.

It has a balcony that overlook the Plaza Sta Ana. And there was no noise from the plaza nor from the Penthouse rooftop bar and club reported by most in their reviews.

With this suite came a variety of upgrades - which to be honest - I had no idea about when booking, which made the visit all the more engaging upon arrival....Our own \"guest experience manager\" 24 hours a day, privileged access to a VIP area on the rooftop penthouse terrace and unlimited easy access to drinks at the Midnight rose bar even when full of general public on Friday evening. The hotel is superbly located in the centre of town more or less and has walking distance access to almost all of the tourist hotspots in the city - it really depends on how much you like to get out and about. We found all of the hotel staff extremely helpful and friendly with really good local knowledge - plenty of advice given on the best places to visit and the best times to visit them - which to me, is even more important as Madrid is one busy city! Throughout the hotel you are greeted with a different fragrance depending on where about you are and what time of the day - Wonderful. The mini bar (we had two!) is well stocked with an excellent selection of refreshments (as you would expect from a 5 star) as guess what.....you can even purchase the various fragrances from your own mini bar! - Nice touch I thought. The room was equipped with an iPod which had the full selection of the various styles of music which is constantly playing around the hotel, and it even had the selected playlist from the exact room where you will have heard it playing - lobby bar late evening for e.g. - Genius!! Hotel could have done with a gym or massage facility as we liked to walk around the city and see the sites, so the end of the day would suit a foot massage! This is offered at the sister Gran Melia hotel near-by though and can be arranged by reception all too easy. Breakfast was excellent - with a wide variety of delights - if anything the breakfast room was a bit small - but well kitted out. Restaurant had great reviews - We didn't actually eat there but we met several people during breakfast that had nothing but good things to say. Drinks where good - beers & wine were cold, and the speciality \"dark mojito\" was excellent - but be warned, the cocktails are pricey around 14euro per mojito....but it is a 5 star and you do feel like a privileged individual drinking it at this hotel.

I have stayed at many hotels in that time and discovered the ME Reina Victoria in early 2010. I have stayed there many times and can honestly say that it has become a home from home for me. First the down side - cost. It's not cheap, and a beer in the bar is quite pricey even by central Madrid standards. It also doesn't have a pool, but nor do most Madrid hotels. Simple solution - book early for the best deals, and limit your drinking (there are plenty of alternatives nearby if needed). Now the up sides. The outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff. The service is truly exceptional - no detail is missed, everyone from senior management to the \"doers\" is completely dedicated to making your stay as pleasant as possible. There are two bars - Midnight Rose on the ground floor which was voted \"best in the world\" in 2008 I think - and the Penthouse on the roof. Both are uber-cool, frequented by beautiful people, and are the place to be seen. The Penthouse is only open during the warmer months and is often hired out for private functions, but it's worth a trip up there just for the views across Madrid. The restaurant food is high class, and the tapas menu in the bar is outstanding (also reasonable value). The rooms are modern style, wooden floors, minimalist, but very comfortable. Most rooms seem to have superb walk-in showers and very good bathroom facilities. You have the usual hotel TV system, but also a DVD and connection for iPod and radio with excellent sound system. All rooms have irons too. If you can, go for the higher floors because Plaza de Santa Ana is busy until the early hours, but the hotel thoughtfully provides ear plugs, and actually the sound insulation is good anyway. There is a gym in the basement which has two each of running machine, cross-trainer, stepper, and also free-weights. It's rarely busy. If it's not too hot outside, then the Retiro Park is exactly 1km away and is a great place to go running. The hotel is well-placed for the top cultural attractions: the Prado, Thyssen Bornemisza, Plaza Mayor, Royal Palace and the shopping around Sol.

I stayed in Madrid for 2 nights on the front end and one night on the back end of my trip. From the moment I booked my trip the staff at the ME Madrid made me feel like a welcomed guest. Miriam De la Horra, an Experience Manager for the ME Madrid, contacted me by e-mail to make sure that I had everything I needed for my trip. She arranged for car service to and from the airport to the hotel and when I arrived at the hotel, she personally took me to my room and described all of the wonderful hotel amenities. I stayed on the LEVEL floor - which I highly recommend. On the front end of my stay I had a spectacular terrace off of my room with a 6 person dining table on one level and 2 relaxing lounge chairs on the other. The room and terrace had a view of the sky and after a long trip from the States to Spain - that is all I wanted to gaze at. On the back end, I stayed in a LEVEL room with a wonderful view of the Plaza that sits in front of the hotel. From my balcony I could hear the street musicians play and gaze at all the people enjoying a good bottle of wine and a fabulous meal. Speaking of fabulous meals - Miriam did it again with a wonderful restaurant recommendation when I mentioned my craving for paella on my last day in Madrid. I must admit that up until this point I was not very impressed with the customer service I received in most restaurants throughout Spain. Whether it was a negative American sentiment or the lack of a tip incentive (which is silly - I tip for good service no matter the country) - the restaurant staff in Spain was pretty consistently rude. Not my paella restaurant - the service was sublime. From hot dinner rolls, to LARGE water bottles at our table (you will only get that if you have ordered water at a meal in Spain) and attentive service (plus fantastic food), my niece and I could not stop raving about our dining experience. It would not be fair if I did not mention all the other staff at the ME Madrid that made my visit so special. Many thanks go to the room service staff who not only kept the Cava bottles coming - but took the time to recommend places to visit and bars that would be fun for my niece and her friends. Also, the front desk staff, each time I left the hotel and entered it I was greeted with a big smile and warm greeting. And housekeeping - my room was always clean and tidy and I welcomed the turn down service at night. The ME Madrid far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend the hotel without any concerns to business travellers, couples and people travelling with older children that want to be in a lively area of town. Fabulous restaurants are steps away from the hotel and the museums are a healthy walk or quick cab ride away. Last note, each night at turn down a pair of ear plugs was left for me. I have lived in NYC and many other major cities so street noise is not a problem. But if you are a light sleeper - the hotel has a very trendy bar on the roof and the noise may be a bother.

The conceirge is called \"everything is possible,\" they make a point of telling you that everytime you call them; except when you actually ask them to do something-- as simple as a massage, turns out no it is not possible. The staff was awful, uncoordinated with eachother, unreliable. They were not rude most of the time, but they also were very incompetent and misleading. For example, we arrived with a rental car that was suppose to be picked up the next day. As we took a Level (upgraded) room, we were told that we had a car wash and parking complimentary. We told them, thats ok but the car is being picked up next day in the morning by the rental company. The next day in the morning no one came to take the car. At 3 pm i called the reception worried, the reception told me that they had spoken with the rental company not to worry that they would come by the end of the day. The same day after dinner at around 12, we went to see what was up with the car... it was still standing there and unwashed-- and there were only two other cars in the parking lot ( the lot had at least 50 spaces-- it was not hard to miss our car). So again we went to reception, as clearly they should have notified us that the car was still standing there and unwashed not as they had promised. In the evening when we spoke with reception, it was a different person and they had no idea that the car was even in the hotel (there were only 2 other cars), and promised us to make a point of having reception call the next day, first thing in the morning about the car, and accepted a very nice tip. Next day in the morning, I call reception at 11 and ask them about the car-- again they have no idea, of course no one has spoken to the car rental company, and the car is still there and they told me that no one even spoke to them the day before since the rental company was closed-- so we were clearly LIED to! So we called the rental again ourselves, since the hotel clearly could not handle something so simple as returning a car. At 3 pm we checked again with reception, and found out the car indeed was taken, but of course it was too much for the hotel to have notified us. Basically our whole stay we were chasing the reception about the car. Not to mention, at checkout they tried to charge us 20 Euro for those two calls after they told us local calls were complimentary and we should not have even had to call the rental as the hotel claimed they handled that. Again LIED! And they tried to charge us 30 Euro a day parking (60 Euro total), after telling us that parking was no extra charge. The internet-- slow is an understatment. It loads google and nothing else. We even tried to use the internet that you pay for on the TV which also did not work and cost 11E. When we told them this at the checkout, we were told \"oh yes, we had a problem with internet yesterday and today\" which is not the case, the whole stay the interenet was nonexistant, and clearly it still doesnt work... So again they have a convenient LIE to explain. The resteraunt which they are so proud of was very very mediocer-- a whole table next to us sent back their food-- we ate there lunch and dinner twice and it was all very average if edible at all (the tuna tartar is good), and of course super overpriced-- which does not bother me so much if the food is good but here it was not. Even the person who sat us for Lunch, acted very rude as if she didnt have the time of day for us when the whole resteraunt was empty-- only when I yelled at her that we were guests she paid attention as she realized she had no choice. Also in check in, one person promised I could have 3 shirts pressed because of the Level room complimentary. The next day a different person claimed that was not true and I had to argue with them. They told me all the shops would be open on Sunday, except 80% of shops were closed becuase it was the first of the month. Youd think a hotel would realize the date, but that was too much awareness for them. The card keys dont work if you go through a metal detecter of any kind, like the ones at the meusems and all the other shops-- but the hotel didnt even tell me this. Guests told me this becuase everyone was having that problem the whole time. And you have to use the key to go up the elevator, so people wind up just going up and down (saw several lost people before we all figured it out). They advertize on the TV in the room \"ME spa\" except as everything else, it is a bluff. There is no spa. There is a small room in the basement where they can bring a masseus from the outside to do a massage. I tried to do this as my boyfriend's back was completely ruined from the very soft beds in the hotel. but this day not everything was possible. AFter I pointed out how misleading they were, they managed to find someone although I have no idea where from. Every charge in the hotel has another hidden charge which they do not tell you about. For example room service theres a charge, a gratitude charge is added (7%), and tax... at check out there is a mysterious \"habitacions\" charge of 5 Euro added each time. Even at the check out, we put our bags into a room to be held for a few hours since we had to check out before we went to the airport. We came back the guy claimed they were not there. We told him he was looking in the wrong room, but he insisted it was the right room. Finally he listened to us, and brought our bags.... But basically everyhing you asked the hotel to do was impossible. And at checkout, there were 2 men at the desk, one was a manager who we had spoken to about the issues with the bill and had very reluctantly taken off the phone charges, but could not be bothered so he sent us a very petite blonde girl to help us drag two very heavy suitcases. She tried to explain to us that the guy who usually helps with the bags is \"fixing something\" (she made hand gestures to demonstrate) and said she would help us, except she couldnt lift the bag. So then she went backt o talk to the manager who then reluctantly came to help us. One of the managers was by far the sleeziest. He is a huge CONARTIST!!!! and if you speak to this man I would beware. In general, do not trust anything the hotel tells you becuase at best it is a half truth. Especially not what the manager says. You will notice that he has very bladly bitten nails, probably from all the stress of his scams and skelletons in his closet. He is short with black hair, BEWARE... this is serious. He will try to suck you dry for everything you have while he very politely smiles in your face. On the plus side, I agree with the posts below that the shower was pretty coolwith the jets (although it leaked) and also the cleaning ladies were awsome, on surface everything looks nice and chic(emphasis on surface), and with our upgraded room we had a very nice balcony facing the square which was very pleasant and espresso machine. And the location is very convenient. But do NOT go to the \"tapas\" bars in the square that the hotel reccomends. In general be weary, when someone says Tapas to you with a lot of excitement, sometimes its not even Tapas.. more like crapas served the same as in any other resteraunt around the world but tastes bad. My final reccomendation, if you must stay at this hotel since it has a central location, and its aesthetic appeal, do not expect to have any service and you are better off going to a internet cafe and figuring things out yourself. The hotel will simply lie to you and misinform you. Also do not eat at the hotel-- average overpriced food. Do not expect a spa, internet, or any modern functioning electronic equipment. And my main issue with the hotel is the conartist service you recieve. They lie to you instead of admitting that they did something wrong, which puts you in the position where you simply do not trust what the staff tells you. On a vacation you do not want to have to worry about all the little things when your staying at a hotel in this price range.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location & restaurant, good room\u201d", "Author": "andre_in_oz", "ReviewID": "UR106939167", "Content": "The hotel is very new and well designed (modern design, if you like \"oldfashioned\" style then it's not your type of hotel).

A showcase of forward thinking destined to raise eyebrows. To blur boundaries. To tempt, to tease and ultimately to transform\" We booked the level room and on arrival were shown into what was in my opinion a single room !! The size was a joke and their trendy design consisted of some puprle lighting around the tv area which when switched on resembled an Ikea style brothel. ! Another trendy piece of furniture was the purple minibar which had it not taken up half the window blocking the light and also almost in the bed due to the small room might have been acceptable. Lucky our room was changed next morning as that is one item we would have put on the balcony to give us more space !! That said the staff were lovely down to the last one and when I told them that the only blurred boundaries were mine and the only transformation was of us into 2 walking zombies as we had not slept a wink all night due to overlooking the very noisy Plaza Sant Ana, they did kindly show us another couple of rooms and we moved. A huge loss of time when we only had a few days to spend there. The new room had very much the same decor but in a slightly less noisy location and much bigger.I say slightly less but that still did not ensure we had a good nights sleep as it was still noisy. When I also queried that we had booked a level room as we had expected that to be bigger, they said that the only difference to a superior and level room is that the level rooms have extras such as a free car wash---we had no car with us. Free local phone calls---no big deal and free newspaper which we never saw for the duration of our stay nor were we asked if we wanted this. Oh and a nespresso coffee machine which I admit was constantly refilled with capsules as we needed but not in my opinion what makes the difference between one room standard and another. The room service I must say was spot on and really polite and super quick so full marks there. Reception staff were polite and knowledgable so again full marks to them. However, I feel that their website is totally misleading and apart from the afore mentioned \"sexy\" lighting, the purple minibar and a few quirky expressions written on the mirrors etc it really did not tick any of my design boxes. The suites did look nice but the standard and superior rooms in my opinion leave a lot to be desired. The quiet rooms we were shown all overlooked a rather dowdy inner courtyard and so we declined them . Breakfast again was avaerage and not the amazing extensive buffet their website led us to expect. We did have breakfast there a few mornings but it was always an overheated and crowded atmosphere with no great design or appeal to start the day. It reminded me of being in a very bleak and dark overcrowded cafe rather than a showcase of forward thinking. Hotel Location is very central and easy walking distance to Plaza del Sol Plaza Mayor and Prado etc but boy is the location very noisy so beware. We were also somewhat taken aback at the goings on in and around Plaza Sant Ana which saw hoards of drunken youngsters with bottles of spirits etc all over the place. Not nice to be honest. So would I stay there again? No and that does make me sad because the staff really were to be given full credit. They just need to be honest and rethink what is trendy and boutique really means.

I felt like Mick Jagger for 3 days, what a treat. See photos and check for yourself! The suite consists of a living room with a sofa and a bedroom. Two (huge) dressing closets and two bathrooms (yes, Mick Jagger always needs two). There is also a coffee machine that makes great coffee (a Krups). There are also two Marrantz amplifiers (though a little bit difficult to use). The suite's main bath has two walk-in showers and a bath tub. Two sinks, tons of cosmetics (4-5 only for him, 10 for her). There are two flat screens in the room, allowing us to view the World Cup Final in there (we stayed right during the Soccer World Cup 2010) as the children were (supposed) to sleep. Spain won, we hit the streets, what a night! The staff was very friendly, did their best to teach us the room's specifics (we tried to skip that, as there were too many electronics - even a wii console). Everything is clean and the view is terrific. The plaza outside is very handy, with a few nice places to eat. If you're there in summer, delay dinner after 8:30PM as earlier is way too hot. Because of this we had to return to our room at noon, way too hot for visiting the city with two small kids. Review above is for a suite, but many things apply to a regular room. I suggest to try anything at the Level (as they call them) if you can afford it. However, you may wish to avoid the inner court rooms. They don't really have a view and it's less privacy for them. Talking about that. the hotel seems to be targeted more to couples or people without children. The pink room light, the bar downstairs and overall ambiance are suggesting that. Our kids were welcome and the staff always had a smile for them. If I am to really pushed to find a downside, some of the furniture and outside terrace wood start to wear, being several years old.

When we returned to our hotel around 1 AM, I called concierge and they were at our door within minutes. My jeans were ready within hours and they were returned in perfect condition.

The Midnight rose is quieter, classier and with excellent food, cocktails and chill out music. The roof top penthouse bar has great views and is a lot busier with long queues to get in, hotel guests get VIP access to the bar.

I loved the breakfast buffet with champayne and orange juice, assorted cheeses and fruits and all the other items you would expect on a buffet breakfast in a hotel of this class. The hotel is not well marked and it was difficult to find because it looks like a condomunium from outside, but you will best identify it by the large floor to ceiling windows and white framed facade on the outside. They have a business centre available to all guests and the price was right too. loved this place, hope you do too.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic - couldn't fault it!!\u201d", "Author": "cabernetsue", "ReviewID": "UR54328428", "Content": "I just had to write a review of the ME, following our stay earlier this month.

This was a corner suite on the 4th floor overlooking the Plaza Santa Ana and had a huge living room with plasma, wii, nespresso etc, along with the bedroom (with another plasma) and small bathroom. The bathroom was *ok*, with the standard small Aveda amenities (which weren't always replenished) and whilst it had a bath (small), and a nice power shower, it was the kind you have to step into, ie not a walk-in shower. This isn't a big deal, but there's always the risk of slipping when you have to step up and out of the bath. Shame that with all the space that the bathroom couldn't have been configured to accommodate a bath AND a separate walk-in shower. Also one has to fill the bath via the shower head....bizarre. We checked in painlessly and several minutes after arriving in our room our special \"Level\" manager came to the room to show us how all the technology worked. (She was super nice but had no knowledge of Madrid!) It's a good idea in theory to have all this kit in the room, but without proper instructions it's easy to see how guests can reconfigure the settings...an engineer was called to fix the speakers in our room, which was done within a matter of minutes - very impressive. When we came back from our walk, a complimentary bottle of cava and strawberries was in our room. Each day we were left a small dish (small, mind) of chocolate covered popcorn, which was a nice surprise. Another comment about the suites - again, all very well to have huge speakers and subwoofers in the room, but the noise from next door during the day was bad! We politely asked reception to deal with it, and they did, fast - but we were a bit surprised the rooms weren't better soundproofed. However, there were clearly some glitches over the Christmas period with staff. I completely understand that staff numbers may be reduced at this time, but if that's the case, I think that the rates should be lowered accordingly - we were paying over \u20ac430 per night...which to be honest, and having stayed at many other hotels at a similar level, was a bit steep for what we got. Christmas Eve meal was nice, but we spotted our waiter doing his real job as a barman the next day...we had to ask for courses to be served, plates to be cleared etc - and at \u20ac100 per head, again, not what you'd expect. In the bar, the service, apart from one excellent lady bartender, was bad. Nobody was interested in serving during the day, and several of the wines by the glass were unavailable. Two ports were on the menu, neither of which were available, neither was one of the dessert wines..so for a hip hotel that promotes its bar, I thought this was poor. On our last evening we ate at the hotel again and the food and service were excellent - so clearly a Christmas staff issue on C. Eve - but trying to get seated in the restaurant, having made a reservation, and being a guest at the hotel, was laughable. Good job we had a sense of humour really! (Lots of computer checking and headset talking. ) BUT - it's in a great location, and the concierge (guy) was really really helpful. (We went to an incredible flamenco show at Cardamomo on his recommendation.) Everyone was friendly, the breakfast was great (but at \u20ac27 it should be, although this seems to be the going rate these days - consisting of the usual meats, cheese, all kinds of bread, bagels, danish etc, and delicious scrambled and/or fried eggs etc. Good quality food it has to be said. Somehow though I felt that we'd paid five star prices for four star quality - I guess you're paying for location and the buzz that the hotel has generated. I should think in summer it does buzz and that the rooftop bar is amazing. All in all we felt a little bit let down having looked forward to our holiday/Christmas for some time - there was little soul or atmosphere. I'd recommend the ME, but would strongly advise you to negotiate your rate...and get breakfast included.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cAlways go at least for 'supreme' room (not deluxe)\u201d", "Author": "goofy75", "ReviewID": "UR52199231", "Content": "We spent fantastic five days in Madrid at Christmas 2009 and we just loved the hotel.

Location is perfect - all sights and attractions are within walking distance. There was plenty of walking space in the room and the bed was very comfortable. Cleanliness was good throughout and the AV facilities are also very good. The shower was spacious and very powerful. This is most certainly a young people's hotel. I would say that it is targeted towards the 20-40 age group. Everything is trendy, cool and modern. The entire concept of this hotel from design through to lobby music is intensely focussed on being 'cool'. If you want traditional, do not stay here. Service for me was excellent. Check-in was instant and pain free. On my final night (possibly because I was staying with my partner), my room was candle-lit upon my return with several heart-shaped chocolates left at the bed-side thanking me for choosing ME Madrid. I requested a wake-up call using the menu on the AV system. This worked perfectly, however, reception also called to ensure I was awake and asked if I would like a taxi to the airport. This was a nice touch. Check-out was polite and quick and the taxi was ready as promised. An excellent stay, excellent service and overall very comfortable. I would say the trick to a good stay here is to ask for a larger deluxe room at the time of booking. Try and stay on lower floors away from the noise of the roof bar/club. Also, ask for a room facing the side street of the hotel so you don't get the street noise from the Plaza (though you will miss the nice views of the Plaza).

I have been in Madrid twice before and knew of this hotel from previous visits as it looks spectacular when standing in Plaza St Anna where the hotel is located. On reading reviews I decided this would be the best base for our weekend in Madrid. The hotel itself is in a great location as so many bars and tapas bars nearby and also in the middle of the old town. The hotel has a great design inside and the rooms are also well designed if a little on the small side however big enough for a city break when you really only use it to catch up on some well needed rest. We were booked in room only so cannot comment on the food. To be honest there are so many places to choose from nearby it would seem crazy to spend money on hotel food. I can comment on the roof terrace which is stunning. It has been designed by Randy Gerber (Cindy Crawford's husband) and no expense has been spared. The views over the city are amazing and would recommend that you try this place out at least once. Only point about the hotel was the price of the drinks. The roof terrace attracts a who's who of Madrid at the weekends and the bar prices reflect this. Typically a cocktail will set you back 15 euros and at the current exchange rate that amounts to a pricey drink. However if you are prepared to spend the money it is a great place to party at the weekend and you only have to fall into the lift to your room when you have had enough. All in all a great hotel in a superb location and with access to an amazing roof terrace.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGood location.

I stayed there for 4 nights in late March. If you\u2019re looking for a classic luxury hotel, then this isn\u2019t for you. However, if you want a \u201ctrendy\u201d, clean, well functioning hotel with a great location then this is definitely it. If the price is right, I would definitely recommend it to all my friends when they visit Madrid. In my case they honored their best rate guarantee and took 10% off of the quote I found. Location can only be described as perfect! Facing the lovely Plaza de Santa Ana, the hotel is within a walking distance to most sighs, restaurants and shops. Santa Ana square is also lovely for sitting on a terrace and drinking wine / eating. If you\u2019re driving to the hotel (as we were) get a GPS or a very good map. Most of the roads leading to the hotel are very narrow or one way. We had a supreme room with a wonderful view of Plaza de Santa Ana. Room was modern, clean and had an impressive list of equipment, such as a 32\u201d plasma, free wifi, cd/dvd systems, safe, good lighting, bathrobes and an iron and a board. The room isn\u2019t big but suited us well for 4 nights. Minibar is called Maxi Bar and it takes out a rather big space of the already small room. It was well stacked, but I found it to be rather expensive. Bathroom was clean as well, had a large mirror, shower and good selection of toiletries. We didn\u2019t hear any music from the bar upstairs, some noises from the Plaza in front of the hotel, but not enough to bother us. Breakfast at the ME (as in most hotels) is expensive compared to the local price levels in cafes etc. However, as a member of Solmelia we got breakfasts 2 for the price of 1 which made it affordable. It was very nice with a number of different juices, cereal, cheeses, etc etc. A nice touch was that there wasn\u2019t too much, but enough and most of the plates and jugs for juices were rather small. This made sure that product didn\u2019t stand there for too long and thus was always fresh. We didn\u2019t try the hotel\u2019s restaurant as there are many outside close to the hotel. We had drinks at the bar upstairs but it seemed quiet (it wasn\u2019t season just yet). Great views, and probably a nice place to sit for a while in the evening. Service at the ME was very efficient. Although I really can\u2019t complain, as the check in was swift and was handled with a smile, I missed something overall. The staff would seem to focus so much on ME\u2019s everything is possible brand that they forget the personal touch, which I appreciate. This however, was a minor detail and didn\u2019t affect our stay at all. All in all, a great stay, lovely room / view and a perfect location.

Check-in was very welcoming, quick and efficient. The front desk agent even escorted us to the elevator! We booked a deluxe room directly through the hotel website for 118\u20ac and had the good fortune of being upgraded to a superior room facing Plaza Santa Ana. This upgrade was likely due to our being enrolled in the MAS program. The room was great! The aspects of the room that we appreciated were that there were no electrical cords to be seen: the floor lamp outlet was in the floor under the lamp base (very clever), the room offered exceptional and flexible lighting, the floor to ceiling windows had shears drapes as well as black out curtains and a sliding door that provided additional soundproofing from the hallway (although we encountered no noise issues). The room has a nice sized marble shower room (no ugly bulky bathtub) with modern finishings and very strong water pressure. The bed provided ultimate of comfort\u2026 although we were excited to explore Madrid each day we had to force ourselves to get out of the comfy bed! The windows are double-paned and open up to let fresh air in as well as the happy and bustling sounds of the plaza outside. The views from the rooftop (The Penthouse) are wonderful too! The plaza outside offers a mass of cafes with outdoor seating. Meson Cinco Jotas, the place with green chairs to the left as you exit the hotel, offered very affordable and delicious tapas. Most places open at 9Am or later so it can be hard to find a coffee and morning bite for us early risers. There is a nice place to start the day at the far end of the plaza on the right side. The location is perfect for exploring Madrid. One can walk to all the main sites and back. There are tons of cafes in Madrid so it is easy to rest and enjoy a drink on the way. We walked to Campo de Moro after visiting the Palace Real and did not want to walk back to the hotel from there so took the nearby dark blue line metro from Principe Pio to Tribunal and then transferred to light blur line to Anton Martin back to the hotel area. The final stop is only a few minutes stroll from the hotel. The metro was very simple to use. We only used it this one time as we found the city very accommodating for walking everywhere. The Catalonia Las Cortes and the Hotel Room Mate Alicia are both at the far end of the plaza, but the ME dominates the plaza area over these other properties. The Urban is a few blocks away too, but again the location of the ME is far superior.

The other mornings we ate at a local cafe - we were too full from all the tapas we ate in the evening to justify eating a large breakfast. again. The hotel is walking distance to the 3 great art museums in Madrid and the only time we used the metro was to go to Real Madrid football ground to do the stadium tour. I guess you get what you pay for - if you choose the cheapest rate you will get the smallest room, if you choose a mid rate you will get an excellent room with a great view. By joining the Mas Reward programme we were able to receive two English newspapers for free every morning and to have the buffet breakfast in the restaurant for half price - how great is that.

Loved the lighting options too! We had booked on the \"ME wants you in Madrid\" package, which meant that there was a bottle of cava with strawberries and dipping chocolate in our room. The bathroom was also huge with a fantastic double shower. Contrary to some of the other reviews, we didn't have a problem with noise at all (We had an internal room with no view but probably the best bet if you prefer quiet at night).

There are a number of packages available on the hotel's own website and I found these to be similarly priced to supposed discount websites. The restaurant and downstairs bar are fantastic, very hip and trendy but certainly no attitude, and the service was very good. The upstairs bar is great for views (although very windy!), the only frustrating point was that despite going up there early (9pm), all seats were reserved - which doesn't make sense given that there wasn't a queue at that point to sit on them - I think the hotel needs to manage this better.

To minimise on cost, we took a Deluxe room (which despite the posh sounding name is a standard room!). It was very small, but as we weren't planning on spending that much time in the room and it was a short stay, we didn't mind. If we had been there for a week then we definitely would have chosen a larger Supreme room. Our room was clean, cosy and comfortable though. All we could see from our window was a white wall outside, but we weren't too fussed about that. The DVD player was a very nice touch, as TV channels in hotels can often be quite limiting. When you come back in the evening, there is a nice lips-shaped chocolate on your bed, along with a small candle by the bedside. The bathroom was lovely, and the shower is amazing!! They provide lovely Aveda products and good quality robe and towels. There is plenty of storage space too. I took my own teabags but unfortunately there was not a kettle in the room, I am not sure if the larger rooms would have had one. Although we didn't ask them much, the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. This is definitely a hotel for the younger crowd as the staff are all young and hip, and often wearing designer clothing. The location of the hotel is excellent, Plaza de Santa Ana is where there are a lot of cafes and bars for the evening, and it is within walking distance of the main shopping area (Sol/Gran Via). We even walked to the museums, although it took about 20-30 mins, but we wanted the exercise. We popped up to the rooftop bar to have a look, and it looked really nice but was closed when we went (monday evening) but on a weekend it is supposed to be excellent. The whole hotel has a nice modern funky feel to it. Although this is a hotel review, I will say a few other things about my trip in general! If you have a sweet tooth, you must have some chocolate y churros (long donuts with very thick hot chocolate) from Chocolateria San Gines, they are to die for! we had it about 5 times in 3 days, so you can imagine how much we loved them! Also just opposite it is a nice italian place with excellent quality pizza, but I forget the name. We also went to a chain called Ginos but the pizza there was awful! A friend recommended Siam which is a Thai restaurant on Calle San Bernadino near Plaza de Espana which was really nice, and although was hidden away, seemed to be popular and full of people. Somehow I didn't manage to find a good place for tapas, but am sure there are plenty of places, probably in side streets.

Perfect weather and almost perfect hotel - just missed the mark in a few minor ways so don't let my 4* review put you off!! Reception From the welcome at the door as we stepped out of the taxi, to the fluent-in-English staff behind the desk, to the more than helpful concierge this was one of our better experiences. The hotel aims to be 'boutique chic' while actually being quite large, and manages to pull it off easily. The decor in the reception area was spotless and apparently effortless. Room The bedroom was tiny - but probably because we'd booked it through lastminute.com! But despite it's size was very serviceable, the bed comfortable and very quiet (but it was an inside room). If you really like looking out of the window at the nightlife at night time rather than sleeping then this room (533)probably isn't for you. The negatives were that despite being adcertised as having twice daily maid service our room often wasn't attended to until 7.30pm which was somewhat after the turn down time! As a result we were handed our chocolate lips and candle before the maid had been to tidy up. Sheet changes were also a little variable - some days they did some they didn't... On the up side the air con was perfect and the 'sexy' mood lighting was very amusing - you have to see it to believe it! The maid on our first day had only one word of English - \"Sexy\" which I didn't immediatley understand as she closed the curtains for us, turned down the lights and pointing to the bed said 'Sexy' several times. This was not quite the welcome I was expecting but was a source of some amusement when we realised it was not my animal magbetism she was referring to but in fact the button on the light switch which selected aforesaid mood lighting! Food OK it's Madrid and capital city prices can be n the up side - but we paid 96 Euros for two breakfasts which were OK but nothing special before I realised the error of my ways and we had a better breakfast for a fraction of the price in the plaza outside. Go to El Lacon if you like Tapas (200m away) 60 Euros for 2 with wine, Indian Spice if you like curry (250m away) 55 Euros with beer and St James (taxi) if you like paella and upmarket fish dishes 140 Euros with wine. Location Perfect for the 3 major Art Galleries, within easy walking distance. Go on Sunday and you get into Reina Sofia free 10am - 2pm and The Prado 5pm - 8pm Get a city Vision open topped bus for a look around but don't bother with the blue line - go for the historic red line which is slightly more interesting.

The hotel is located in a convenient central part of town at the north end of the Plaza de Santa Ana. It's only a few minutes walk from Puerta del Sol and about a 10 minute walk to the famous El Prado museum. We arrived by taking the metro to the Anton Martin station and walking about 5 minutes. The Plaza de Santa Ana, right outside the hotel, contains kiosks selling handicrafts, scarves/gloves, etc. We found the checkin staff and concierge to be perfectly nice. They spoke fluent English and were happy to answer any questions. The outside of the hotel is impressive and nicely lit at night. Our room was very small. In other words, there was just barely enough space to walk around the bed and not a bit more. You better go with somebody whose company you enjoy, because there's no privacy at all. The bathroom was clean and modern, sporting marble surfaces. There was no tub but the water pressure in the shower was very good. We did see a bug in the bathroom once but otherwise, the whole room was very clean. There is a free in-room safe that was big enough for my large laptop computer. The technology in the room was better than average. There was a flat screen TV recessed in the wall, a stereo system with DVD, and free wireless Internet that worked, albeit a bit slowly. The light switches were unnecessarily complex and let you set the lights in a bunch of different permutations. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant or bar. Although they looked nice, we preferred to go out. We arrived in the early afternoon, walked around a bit, then took a nap. We got up around midnight and decided to go look for food nearby, since there are many restaurants within a few blocks. We walked a block or two east of the hotel and felt uncomfortable and unsafe. There were drunks, aggressive club doormen, and maybe worse on the streets. We circled back to the north of the hotel and found a bar with snack that was only a block west from the hotel. The club was smoky but seemed perfectly safe. I understand they also have live jazz earlier in the evening. All in all, this was a good experience.

Also, its right around the corner from Puerto Sol which is the hub of the city. Plaza Santa Ana, where the hotel is located, is where all the tapas bars/nightlife is and it seemed that there was always something going on day or night. A great place to people watch.

We had a deluxe inside room which was smaller than other hotels we have stayed in but the room was very well laid out, had one of the most comfortable beds we have slept in and a GREAT shower. The atmosphere of the hotel is very young, urban, sophisticated, and sexy, and the crowd the same. This really is one of \"in\" spots in Madrid. The restaurants and bars had great atmosphere, including the rooftop penthouse which had a great view and great crowd. Finally, I want to comment about service and say that it was ABSOLUTELY EXCEPTIONAL. Room Service, maid service, and wait staff were top notch, but we the level of attention of and service we received from the Concierge at the ME was really in a class of its own. We received great suggestions on restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. but one night, Lucas from the concierge staff helped turn a bad situation we experienced into a great one (of course one that neither he nor the hotel controlled). He went out of his way to help us, i have never had a concierge or hotel provide that level of service for myself or for anyone that I have ever know.

I wanted everything to be perfect. I booked each part of my trip myself since I have traveled to Europe many, many times. I was just in Spain a few months ago and I had drinks on top of the outdoor terrace at the hotel and I was really impressed by the hotel and location so I booked it. It was a GREAT experience that was truly flawless. There are 191 hotel rooms here from $350 (with tax) all the way up to $2,000 a night rooms. We stayed in a nice suite that was about $500 a night with taxes and it was great. The room was spacious, the bathroom very high end with marble throughout and the room had a big LCD TV with a DVD player (which we didn't use). The lighting system was great with controls on both sides of the bed to control lighting for the entire room. The mini-bar selection was very good. Also, there was free hi-speed wireless internet and internet with a cord and it was very fast and FREE. I was impressed as we had arrived from Buenos Aires earlier than our check-in and they had everything ready and let us check-in early. Fortunately, we flew first class so we both slept on the plane as there were seats that folded completely flat into beds so we were both ready to explore. Right away the concierge called up and asked me if I needed anything and to let me know that she would be available for anything I needed. Then the manager of the hotel called as well. I'm not sure if this is normal but it was great. Then shortly after their call, they had a nice card welcoming me and they also included both of their business cards as well and let me know if I needed anything they would be available. I thought that was a very nice touch and I was impressed. I'm in the hospitality business and I'm also a real estate developer. I could notice they spent a lot of money on the finish out of the room and they used very good items. The bed was VERY comfortable, the pillows were excellent and the room had black out blinds so we could sleep in. Also, something which was nice was they put sound-proof windows on the windows. I read a review of someone that said it was loud but I can assure you that the room was totally quiet and we didn't hear a thing. The location is PERFECT right in front of Plaza Santa Ana and it's in Central Madrid close to all the museums and not far from all the shopping on Serrano Street. There is a metro station very close as well (Banco de Espana). We ate dinner one night in the restaurant and it was great. We also drank drinks on the terrace and it's a really cool place. The staff was great and always went out of the way for us. I highly recommend this hotel. We had a great experience here.

A friend with me had her purse stolen from the lobby of the hotel. Honestly, she wasn't watching it like she should have been, but it was discovered quickly. The staff jumped to action, helped her to contact the police, the credit card companies, and gave the security tape to the police. Then sent a apology card and fruit plate to her room. The bed was like sleeping in heaven!

The views from the rooftop bar were amazing, although part of the bar was closed for a private party the night we went up there. We ordered room service for dinner one night and it was surprisingly good, although a little on the expensive side.

We were in town for a Rolling Stones concert and to sightsee in Madrid. This was our first trip to Madrid and our first stay at a Sol Melia hotel. Overall we thought this was a superb hotel with a gorgeous location on Plaza Santa Ana. Arrival: We arrived at the hotel around shortly before 2PM on Wednesday, June 27th. The front desk staff was very friendly and spoke good English. Upon arrival, we were excited to learn that we had been given a complementary upgrade from an deluxe room (courtyard view) to a supreme room with a great view of Plaza del \u00c1ngel! I considered this to be a pretty generous upgrade \u2013 probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 Euros per night. The clerk at the desk didn\u2019t mention why she upgraded us \u2013 later we thought it may have been because we had joined MAS Rewards before booking our reservation. Room: In a word \u2013 spectacular. First and foremost: ice cold air conditioning. Secondly, gigantic windows that provided stellar views of Plaza del \u00c1ngel and let in a wonderful natural light glow. Interior was very modern, very new, and fairly Hard Rock-ish (former owners): wood floors, plasma TV (with like 7-8 English speaking channels including Fox News), DVD player, stereo with subwoofer, large desk area, huge closet with safe etc. Frankly there were so many creature comforts in the room that you may not want to go out and sightsee! For you light sleepers, they have placed another pane of glass over the original windows to ensure absolute quiet. (There is also a sliding door that separates the entry way from main bedroom to completely eliminate noise from the hall.) Finally, it was nice to see free Internet in a full service hotel. Most similar places in the States (i.e. Hilton, Marriott, etc.) never gave away Internet at their full service properties. Bathroom: Again, very nice. The shower was great. It\u2019s a full size walk-in shower stall with a bodyjet shower system. The toiletries were Aveda brand (I love the tingle from the Rosemary Mint shampoo!) and there were ample towels (including a few wash clothes). The bathroom is one of the few places where the Hard Rock is still directly evident \u2013 the mirror has a quote from the David Bowie track Oh! You Pretty Things. Transportation: The Sol metro stop is the closest one to the Hotel. Coming to the Hotel from Barajas airport, we took the metro (very cheap \u2013 2.5 Euros). I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone except the hardiest of travelers as (a) it requires 2 transfers, (b) the red line can be very crowded at times, and (c) the many streets converging on Puerta del Sol can make finding your way to the Hotel very confusing. At first, we relied on the metro to get us places (i.e Sol to Opera for the Palacio Real and Sol to Atocha for the Prado museum), however after we learned our way around, we found it very pleasant to just walk (it\u2019s only about 1.3 miles from the Prado to the Palacio Real). As many guidebooks note, the city is very walkable. It\u2019s actually a lot of fun to just walk and get lost on the streets (they don\u2019t resemble anything even close to a grid \u2013 there\u2019s generally no rationale to how they twist & turn!) We left the city from the Atocha rail station. To get there, we took a taxi from the hotel and it cost us about 8 Euros. Laundry: Need to wash some clothes? There\u2019s a nice Onda Blu laundromat at Calle de Le\u00f3n 3. It\u2019s all of 3 blocks south of the hotel (walk out the front door of the Hotel, walk three blocks, and then hang a right on Calle Leon.) There\u2019s 8-10 self-service washers and dryers plus someone who works there full time to help you. She speaks a little English and was very nice to us. We washed and dried two loads for about 10-15 Euros. General Area: Puerta del Sol is a madhouse. Construction occupies about half the space and tourists overwhelm the rest. Gran Via isn\u2019t much better. Plaza Santa Ana, on the other hand, is just gorgeous. It\u2019s quiet and serene by day, but by night, all of these cute little restaurants and bars setup tables on the square. It\u2019s a great place to end the day with a drink or something to eat. Food ideas: Chocolater\u00eda San Gin\u00e9s (Pasadizo de San Gin\u00e9s 11) is a must. They are famous for their churros which are served with this gooey, chocolate pudding dipping sauce. This is another good place to end your night as they are only open from 7PM to 6AM! Complaints: I don\u2019t really have any. A few reviews have noted the price of rooms (we paid 230 Euros/night with tax), but I really felt like we got what we paid for. Having researched Madrid hotels relentlessly on Trip Advisor, there really aren\u2019t any others that appear to be as nice and new as the ME Madrid Reina Victoria. Furthermore, during our 2 days in Madrid, I never walked by any other hotel and said \u201cwow, I wish we would have stayed there.\u201d Overall, this is a great hotel.

The location is right on the Plaza Santa Ana, which has all the buzz you expect from downtown Madrid. Despite our room overlooking the square, we were not disturbed by the noise except briefly on Saturday night after Real Madrid had just won a match and were likely to win the league. The room was very comfortable with a huge TV, sound system, DVD player, and electrical points for the UK and US as well as Europe. Bathroom with Aveda shampoo etc. The service was very good - UK newspapers in the morning, a turn-down service in the evening, decent breakfast, friendly staff. We did not eat in the restaurant other than for breakfast as there are hundreds of bars and restaurants within 100m of the hotel.

There was minimal space to walk around the bed. There are no tea/coffee making facilitis in the room. The shower is nice, but no bath and frankly i would have loved a relaxing bath. The hotel has a roof top bar which had a private party while i was there and consequently unavailable to the guests, and the NOISE was just awful. There was no breakfast included in the room tariff, and breakfast was 30 euros per person on the menu card. Concierge was less than helpfull. Before my trip i emailed the hotel to ask if they picked up their guests, i was told yes, BUT not told that this was at an extortionate rate. On the last day, i discovered the charge was 113 euros!!!!!!!!! A taxi on the way back was 38 euros. I would not return, and would recommend staying elsewhere.
