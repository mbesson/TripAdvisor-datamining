We had a one bedroom unit on the first floor looking out on the pool with sliders to access the pool area and the table and chairs on the small patio area directly in front of the unit. The unit was spacious and decorated in a modern style with large shower and a large living area with kitchenette and dining area. TV's with cable in living room and bedroom (only a couple of channels in English though if you do not want to stretch your viewing interests!). The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The Pueblito was a very peaceful place to stay as there was often no one else at the ground floor pool where there were individual lounge chairs and a couple of bed style loungers. Even at the 4th floor common area with the infinity pool, loungers etc, we always found space and usually only a few others there. There are staff constantly cleaning the common areas and maintenance was prompt when we had a couple of issues. As noted by others, the beach is reached in only half a block of sand walkway but not a location to sit on the beach. The walkway splits the Mahekal Resort and their beach chairs and roped off areas take most of the adjacent beach area. There was also a constant sulfurous smell in this beach location that others have noted and I suspect may be due to stagnant water in sand-blocked drain sewers as rain water does not drain from the end of the street nearest the beach. The hotel provided vouchers for free loungers and an umbrella at Mamitas Beach Club (also at the Canibal Royal beach club) which was a comfortable walk along the beach and you can get reasonable snacks and drinks there if you are ok with the booming music. The attached Origenes restaurant had good food for breakfast and dinner and great live music (guitar/singer) at night (if you are over 30 that is - as we are!). Pleasant walk up the street to junction with 5th Av to some bars and restaurants and a mini-market. Then along 5th Av. for about 5 min walk to the main 5th Av action. Great to visit that area but glad we were staying away from it. Taxi to the hotel from the far end of 5th by the Cozumel ferry and bus station was only 50 pesos so very reasonable if you do not want to walk back after a night out.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel in excellent location\u201d", "Author": "AMurthy", "ReviewID": "UR122442222", "Content": "We stayed here for 6 nights in December 2011, and had a wonderful time.

I needed to stay in a non all-inclusive resort for business near 5th Av. in Playa del Carmen. My business partner brought his young kid and the hotel turned out to be great for both of them as well. The rooms are condo-like, equipped with a kitchenette and fridge. They all have standard kitchen utensils handy and I recommend doing an inventory at check-out just to make sure they don\u00b4t charge you for any missing item. Besides the hotel, a small restaurant called Or\u00edgenes is open most of the day and night with great food and service, so no problem if you don\u00b4t want to cook. Positive Very clean rooms, white pillows and sheets. Excellent furniture, kitchen, TV and DVD equipment. Air conditioning worked great, pools very clean and pool furniture was in excellent condition. Friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is great for bringing young kids since the kitchen allows you to feed them with no hassle and there are good grocery shops near the hotel (three blocks) to buy anything you need. This is an excellent option to save money compared to an all-inclusive if you want to bring all the family. Free in-room wireless internet service. Negative The hotel does not have private beach access, however it is still is one block away. I don't like the public beach near the hotel because of a strange smell and there are not seats and shades.

Well, finally we were up-graded to a suite that has roof-top access to a private pool. Even though it was a penthouse suite, it was no nicer than our original room. The important thing is that we were again cool. This place is a great value! Our AC issue, although frustrating, took about 2 1/2 hours to resolve.

Make sure you make an inventory of all the items in the kitchen, as they are often missing on check-in, and attempts will be made to charge you for items on your check out- you'll need to stand your ground and refuse to pay. The restaurant next door has a great breakfast and the staff there is very nice. The first day we were there was no hot water which previous reviews have mentioned - after that no problems. One of the other guests while we were there was complaining about problems with their toilet and seemed upset.

It was a similar experience to staying in a Villa with many positive and unfortunately negative aspects. I don't know that any of the negatives were really big enough to not come back (and it certainly didn't hamper our vacation) but they are worth noting. First the good: Room: we were in PH 305, a 2 bdrm, 2 ba duplex with the private pool. This apt was spacious, clean and comfortable for an adult family of 5. The private pool we didn't use as the roof top infinity pool was so beautiful, we opted to use that. The kitchen was fully equipped except for a dishwasher. Free wireless in the room, huge plus. After a week I was stuck in Playa due to a blizzard in NYC so my family left and I stayed a few extra days and switched to room 107- ground floor 1 bdrm that was HUGE, actually bigger living area than the PH. Food: Breakfast was included daily in the restaurant. Service was slow but this was because everything was made fresh to order. It was good food, lots of fresh juices. Location: can't be beat. Steps to the beach and 5th Ave, everything we needed was walking distance. Negatives: major hot water problem in the hotel. We complained the first day. By day 2 when I took a cold shower I was somewhat enraged. They apologized and said it was a boiler issue and they were working on it. By day 3 they shut off the water without warning and it wasn't on again until 6 pm (toilets were not working during this time). Zero water pressure throughout the stay. There were never enough towels in the room. When we asked for more they told us they had to charge us. Um, I don't think so. Some firm albeit polite words had numerous towels in our room 10 min later. Staff was friendly and accommodating so we couldn't fault them on anything, but management is definitely poor. There was no memo, nothing to let us know about the water situation. Once I switched to room 107, the phone was not working. They sent several people to look at it but could never fix it. Normally this wouldn\u2019t be an issue but I had to contact the airline to book a new flight and had to keep going to a pay phone. Some people commented that the staff doesn\u2019t speak English well- they don\u2019t. But you know what? We are in THEIR country and they don't need to speak our language. Practice your Spanish. Beach access: as mentioned, the beach was steps to the hotel. However, please note this hotel doesn't have an immediate area where one can sit with beach loungers/umbrellas. That being said, you have the option of a few beach bars. We had to take a stroll down the beach (turn left on beach and walk down about 5 min) to Canibal Royal- a restaurant/beach club where we could use the chairs etc without a cost. The place was amazing- good DJ and vibe, yummy food (best cerviche and fish tacos). Young/hip staff and everyone was so nice. On Sat it was similar to Nikki Beach- house DJ, def a vibe. Other days it was chill music or they played salsa/meringue, lots of locals. One day we ventured to Mamitas and wow, what a difference. The place was huge, crowded and lacking personal service. However if you sit near the area where they have the beds, it\u2019s also a good crowd and the DJ was pretty great. Overall, we had the feel of a villa with hotel amenities. Unlike staying in a villa where you are self sufficient, you had the room cleaned each day which was nice. On the flip side, there is nothing extra in the apt- cooler for beach, smaller beach chairs, umbrella etc. Also the kitchen didn't have anything if you plan to cook- no salt, pepper, napkins etc. You need to provide everything. Tips: we used Balam Transportation for round trip airport transport and also when we did a day trip. After they picked us up at the airport, we asked to stop by a grocery store where we stocked up on food/water. We did Tulum and Akmal Beach which I would highly recommend. Our driver was professional, on time and wonderful to spend the day with. Overall: this hotel is great if you don't encounter any problems during your trip and its well worth the value. I booked in August and got 30% off the rate so we had a deal. However, its not service oriented and while the staff is very friendly, they are somewhat clueless (we had to call 2x for them to bring a roll away bed and when they finally came, house keeping showed up with a pillow and a sheet, no bed.. Ha ha). The water issue was beyond annoying but what can you do? If I were to get another good rate, I would book again.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIdeal vacation spot\u201d", "Author": "calivea", "ReviewID": "UR63169153", "Content": "We have been to this hotel twice in the last three years.

I'd booked Pueblito Escondido at the solid recommendation of a friend who frequently travels to Playa, yet mixed reviews here on Trip Advisor had us more than a little concerned. Our fears were completely unfounded, and all in all we enjoyed a fantastic stay here! PROS: location, location, location!!! On the North end, just a mere stone's throw from the beach, and walking distance to 5th Avenue and your choice of restaurants & bars, including the phenomenally cool La Cuevo de la Chango! Very short walk down the beach to the beach clubs; we loved Las Palapas, with their beachfront bar and palapa-style umbrellas. The condo offered tons of space for the money, including a fully-furnished kitchen (yes, with a blender for margarita-making!) I loved the layout of the space, and how the bedroom windows faced an inner open-air hallway, which made for very dark sleeping conditions at night & well into the late morning (of which I am a huge fan!) The resort features contemporary decor, & is kept very, very clean. The rooftop pool is a beautiful space, but the water was just too cold to really enjoy while we were there in March. Pueblito Escondido was a great value for the level of accommodations and such a superb location; we paid $200/night for a Jr Suite booked through Splendia.com, a full $80 less than the official hotel website had charged us. Free wi-fi! CONS: Management is not up to par & seems disorganized in general. While our reservation was on file when we arrived, the hotel had no record of the deposit we'd already paid, or at what rate we had booked our room. Bring printouts of your online confirmations -- you will need them! I honestly don't think that the false charges other reviews are complaining about are malicious or intended...it really seems to be a language barrier and lack of solid bookkeeping that's to blame. (Note that there is an additional room tax on top of the rate, and this was charged to us upon checkout...wondering if some people mistook this for an overpayment?) We had no issues with theft as also mentioned in prior reviews, but we used the in-room safe religiously. It operates differently from most hotel safes I've used, so its entirely possible that other users didn't actually have it locked when they thought they did. Our friends rented a Penthouse suite -- probably not worth the extra money, unless you just need the extra (twin beds only) bedroom. While beautiful, the plunge pools are not at all private, are actually very accessible to anyone at the rooftop pool. We did, however, enjoy their \"private\" outdoor seating area at night...a lovely spot from which to enjoy sips of our new favorite, Clase Azul tequila! The pool bar was only open one afternoon during our stay, while we were lounging in the cabanas on the roof; very inconsistent bar service available. A Mexican restaurant is now open at ground level of the hotel, but there is still a general lack of amenities, such as fitness center, spa services, etc. I would stay at Pueblito Escondido again without hesitation, but when we return to Playa (and we most definitely will return!), we will probably explore some of the other great lodging options that Playa has to offer.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cAwesome location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "graveetrain", "ReviewID": "UR60189838", "Content": "We actually stayed here a couple of years ago when it first opened, but since we are planning another trip back I felt the need to write a review of this place.

We booked the hotel sight unseen, attracted by the newness of the property and the size of the rooms. On the whole, our experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Likes: - The old reservation manager Gloria was professional and competent and managed all of our bookings without a problem (PE now has a new reservation manager Bertin...more later) - The property was clean and quiet. The pools were well maintained and the view is as good as advertised. - The beach is closer than advertised...literally across the street. The beach clubs are easily accessible and the beach is gorgeous. The heart of Playa is somewhat of a hike, but not inconvenient. - The front-desk staff was always helpful and friendly, even when dealing with our many problems with the rooms. Dislikes - Our room was filled with mosquitoes. I should have been tipped off by the small dried blood marks on the couch from previous victims. We got 4-5 new bites a night as we slept. I wasted a lot of time trying to kill them. I thought all rooms were like ours, but learned later that wasn't the case. Maybe it was our room's proximity to the pool? We stayed in 102. I felt lucky to not have swollen bites on my face during the wedding. - Stuff not working. Our room was fine in this regard, but many of my guests had problems and I felt responsibility to deal with them as the host. One room smelled of sewage and was uninhabitable. Multiple rooms had ineffective A/C, and the older guests in my party were not comfortable. My guests uncovered and reported these problems upon check-in, and some were never resolved satisfactorily during our stay. I wasted many hours dealing with these issues. My expectation is that all the rooms would have working A/C and be checked for foul plumbing problems BEFORE our checking in. I also hoped for a more hands-on/interactive approach to fixing these things once we identified them. The hotel became an unnecessary distraction that only added to the stress of hosting a destination wedding. - Billing. The reservation manager Bertin promised one group of our guests, who were forced to cram 8 to a room due to the sewage problem, a discount on the \"extra persons\" charge. Really? An \"extra persons\" charge when the original room was uninhabitable? Well he wasn't available to confirm the \"discount\" when that group checked out, so they were forced to pay it with the understanding that Bertin would resolve the issue later. We had confidence that he would make good on his promise. About one month and 10 emails later from both myself and the paying guest, and he's stopped responding altogether. Hiding from your customers is not a good way to make an impression, and neither is breaking promises. In short, I can't recommend the Pueblito Escondido.

It was only 25 pesos for the washer and 20 pesos for the dryer. A few blocks away is also the Mega Store - like a Wal-Mart where we did our grocery shopping. Very reasonable prices there. We took a cab back to the condo due to the distance and heavy bags. We walked to 5th ave. which is filled with little shops for T-shirts, jewelry, liquor, pharmacy and Mexican crafts.

There is plenty of seating up there as well. There are even electrical outlets, which allowed us to watch a movie outside one night one our portable DVD player and take in the cool night breeze. As others note, the rooftop pool has the best views. Arturo, the bartender, was friendly and made very good drinks (expect \"resort\" prices). We were not bothered by the music on the roof as others have mentioned. We did not use the ground level pool at all, but it looked nice. The room itself was nicely accommodated, with housekeeping performed daily (usually around 2:00 for us). Our maid was friendly and went out of her way to make us towel animals and clean our dirty dishes in the kitchen sink each day (make sure you leave her a tip). The only snafu we ran into was that our air conditioner started leaking on our last night there. There was a lot of water coming into the master bathroom area from above the ceiling. It was around 10:00pm and the front desk did not have any maintenance people around to come take a look at it. They did offer to have housekeeping come and clean up the water, but the only solution they offered was to turn up the A/C so that it would not freeze up (sounds like this has happened before). It got pretty warm in the room without the A/C, and had it not been our last night we probably would have been more upset with the way it was handled. However, I have no doubt they would have been more responsive had it been a decent hour of the day. The location was great. So close to the beach, and about 10 minutes from the main section of 5th Ave. We enjoyed the extra walk as a good way to burn off those dinner calories and to see more of the town. We always felt safe on the walk, and they were installing extra lighting along 38th as we were there which should make it even better. There are plenty of convenience stores near the hotel for stocking up your fridge with snacks and drinks. The Mega is not all that far away either and probably has better prices. We did not try the hotel's Italian restaurant, but it was pretty dead the entire week we were there. No more than one or two tables occupied every night.

We were looking for a quiet location within walking distance to the main part of town and this was an excellent option. We rented a penthouse as a treat for my husband's 40th and it was nicely decorated with a kitchenette, two bedrooms and bathrooms, two plasma TVs, DVD player, dining area and a rooftop deck/pool. The rooftop area is not 100% private, as it is connected to the infinity pool/bar area and all residents are able to go up there; however it was still nice and quiet and the infinity pool is the best place to be anyway (best views!). We wouldn't really recommend the penthouse to a group of people as the setup was a little odd...you enter the penthouse through the first bedroom and therefore there would be little privacy if you were not all on the same schedule. The staff was very nice, but you have to ask a few times to get what you need. The beach is about 200 feet away and is cleaner and less crowded than the downtown Playa area.

Our main concern was getting a nonstop flight from Los Angeles to some fun and warm destination. After an extensive review of exciting yet affordable destinations, Playa Del Carmen (\u201cPDC\u201d) became the most likely choice. Just 40 minutes (with traffic) south of Cancun, this resort Riviera differs from so many of the Mexican resort towns by having a more European flavor to it. If you are looking for \u201cSenior Frogs Bar\u201d and getting plastered over cheep Tequila then you may want to go Cabo San Lucas (West Coast) or Cancun (East Coast) where you will certainly find the typical American college brothels to get wasted at. However PDC has a unique mix of elegant young hip and somewhat posh Europeans and Argentineans\u2026.beautiful and trendy. A cross between the French Riviera (St. Tropez) with possibly Barcelona meets the Greek Islands! Pueblito Escondido was truly the best choice we could have selected. We checked out other hotels while we were there and confirmed that our choice was the right one, unless you are willing to spend $1,600 per night for the Mandarin Orient hotel (which is really nice). In fact we will be going back there to Pueblito Escondido again soon. It is a \u201cCondominium Hotel\u201d that combines a fully furnished apartment lifestyle and amenities with a full service hotel. The building exterior design is nice (not exactly my style though), while the interiors are really well designed with modern pieces (my style). It is finished and furnished like a Four Season hotel while rented out at very reasonable rates. The best 1-bedrooms to get are #102 & 103 because they have direct access to the family pool, while #202 & 203 have ocean views, and #302 & 303 have direct roof access to their own private pool and roof deck lounge (totally not worth it). For a 2-bedroom avoid #105 & 106, 205 & 206, 305 & 306, which face the hotel building itself and offers no views. All others are fine. As a side note, the Penthouse units with the private pools are really nice but not worth the money simply because they are not very private and are integrated to the rooftop pool. So it may not be worth the extra money. See photos. The apartments are relatively clean (not as clean as a Four Seasons but clean enough), and are well equipped with everything you possibly could ask for. You can ask the front desk to provide you anything else you may be missing. The management was great (the onsite manager is a beautiful kind and professional lady) so was the front desk staff. The hotel includes about 40-units, so it is small and quaint. Always quiet, clean and well kept. In fact all the reviews said that it is quiet and we only saw another couple once by the family pool although the place was fully occupied. The hotel is right by the beach and most people spend their time at the beach (by the way, the beach is literary across the sand alley, where the guest of other hotels hang out anyway). The beach is very nice, quiet and clean. Bring your kiteboarding or windsurfing equipment if you have it because it is windy between November and May. Windy enough to enjoy a good kiting session but not too windy that beach goers can\u2019t sit and enjoy the sand. Pueblito Escondido has three pools, two on the ground floor (one is a shallow toddlers pool), and a third is on the roof. All the reviews I read raved about that rooftop pool\u2026\u2026well yet again words can\u2019t describe how awesome that rooftop pool is. It is all that rave and some more. It is a very trendy roof top with an infinity pool and walk up wet pool bar. A whole bunch of daybeds and a lounge area overlooking PDC bay. For those that have been to the Sky Bar in Los Angeles, or the Shore Club or Delano Hotels in Miami, or Nikki Beach anywhere\u2026well it has that feeling but it just sits on top of a four story building with unobstructed views. See photos below. There is a full service bar and a live DJ mixing the right mood music to accompany your relaxing stay from 10:30 AM to 6:00 PM. Drinks are reasonably priced. There is NO restaurant associated with the hotel (except for the rooftop bar which serves beverages only), but the hotel building has an Italian restaurant attached to its\u2019 street level, as well as a hand full of restaurants within a 1-minute walking distance. Parking is plenty and free. The area feels safe and well lit. The building has its own 24-hour security and there is plenty of security across the alley at the Shangri-la Hotel. Finally, the hotel is within a 5-10 minute safe walking distance to 5th Avenue where most of the restaurants, cafes and bars are. That Avenue is for pedestrians only and extends out 40-blocks (yes that is FOUR ZERO). The hotel is at the northerly end of the Avenue by 38th Street, while the highest end section is around 16th Street, with excellent restaurants and bars. The area gets a little touristy around 6th street.

It was a perfect choice for us! We have stayed in Playa several times in all different areas of the city. By far, this is now our favorite location. We fell in love with the Mamitas beach area and our favorite breakfast place La Cueva del Chango years ago so this hotels proximity to both could not have been better. Even though Pueblito does not have ocean front rooms, the rooftop pool has priceless beach & full ocean views and the sand literally spills onto the steps of the property so you really are \u201con the beach\u201d. We booked a junior suite, which we loved, & stocked up our kitchen at the very convenient Mega store just a couple blocks away (very short and cheap cab ride; to get a cab back, go downstairs in Mega and in the back entrance cabs line up). The bed was extremely comfortable, as others have commented on & we always had plenty of towels even considering that we used them for the pool daily. The rooftop pool really is incredible. The chairs/beds/music/view\u2026.all perfection for us. The only area of the property we did not try out was the restaurant as it was closed when we visited. If you have never been to Playa, you should know a little about this resorts location. It is on the north side of Playa which years ago was very sleepy and from our perspective, not so nice. We only used to go that far north because of the beach & breakfast place as I stated before. Now, the famous 5th avenue pedestrian road has almost spread as far north as Pueblito. So now, you have awesome beaches on one side and just a short walk away you have every restaurant and bar you could imagine as they are spreading more and more to the north. The area still has a residential and more laid-back feeling than the developed and established resort areas to the south \u2013 we really were able to get a feeling for how it would be to actually buy a condo and live there. There are so many great restaurants in Playa it is hard to recommend which ones to choose\u2026just walk around, look at menus and go where you feel drawn. I cannot think of one really bad meal we have ever had. The prices aren\u2019t necessarily cheap right on 5th but we still seem to find better prices than we do in Chicago overall - just go when there is a really good exchange rate and ALWAYS change your dollars and pay in pesos EVERYWHERE. The one place I will recommend to stay clear of when you\u2019re planning your day trips is Xel-Ha. Disappointing to say the least. If you want to snorkel, book a trip with Fat Cat Catamaran. If you want to see ruins, rent a car, take the bus, or catch a cab to Tulum (take swimsuits, bottled water, and a hat). If you want to learn more about the areas history and culture, go to Xcaret and make sure to stay through the evening performances and take the time to go through both of the underground rivers.

This was our first visit to Playa del Carmen. My comments will echo many of those already noted in previous reviews. POSITIVES: Pueblito Escondido was a good value; spacious accomodations, newer property, contemporary furnishings, nice rooftop pool, good proximity to the action on 5th Avenue, but also far enough away from the crowds to be a quiet locale. If you're going as a couple, unless you have money to burn, I wouldn't splurge for the Penthouse Suite. As others have noted, the plunge pools are clustered around the main rooftop pool and aren't really private. Plus, as I mentioned before, the Junior Suites are plenty spacious. Service from the staff was efficient and friendly. We seem to be two of the few guests, so we pretty much had the place (including the pool) to ourselves. NEGATIVES: As others have noted, the kitchen was poorly appointed. No dish soap, paper towels or corkscrew. Suite had a musty smell; noticed some mold on shower ceiling. Comforter was stained (nail polish? blood?). Eurodisco music at rooftop pool was a mild annoyance. OTHER COMMENTS: Property is a stone's throw from the beach (half block). Walk out to the beach, hang a right and walk 5 minutes to Kool Beach Club. Chair/umbrella was about 6 bucks per. Drink/food service was fast/friendly, prices were very reasonable and we found the food to be surprisingly good. On the subject of food, I would highly recommend Babe's for Thai (we ate there 3 times...make sure you try one of their towering margaritas) and El Fogon for authentic Mexican (one of the best meals I've ever had and dirt cheap). We had breakfast and 2 lunches at La Cueva del Chango, which is a few steps away from Pueblito. Good food, cool atmosphere and appears to draw a lot of locals. 100% Natural on 5th Avenue is also recommended for breakfast. We had room service pizza the night of arrival and it was very good (delivered from a pizza joint across the street). Finally, we tried Carboncitos, which is rated no. 1 here on trip advisor. We really didn't see what the fuss was about. Food was decent, but nothing to rave about. We had a much better meal at El Fogon (be warned: as others have noted, El Fogon is a dump and a few blocks back from the tourist area...menus are in Spanish and waitress didn't speak English...still, if you're a little adventurous, the food is fantastic). Overall, we found Playa del Carmen a nice alternative to the Americanized, drunken frat boy scene of Cancun. The crowd, at least this time of year, seemed to skew 30s-40s, and included a mix of Americans, Europeans and Mexicans. Granted, Playa can be tourist-y, especially on parts of 5th Avenue, but it nevertheless hasn't been scrubbed and \"Disney-fied\" like Cancun. Pueblito Escondido is a nice option for travellers who want to get out and look around, vs. being sequestered in a resort compound where you never leave the grounds.", "Date": "November 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cA gem in Playa Del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "AxelFrance", "ReviewID": "UR19806348", "Content": "My friend and I stayed in this hotel for 12 days both in a junior suite and a penthouse (with private plunge pool). The suites: They are very large with a very nice modern furniture. I think the junior suite has enough room for a couple. We were in 102 on the first floor with a terrace just steps away from the \"familly pool\". I guess 101 to 104 have the best location. The penthouse has one extra bedroom. Beware: when you look at the pictures on their website you have the feeling that the roof terrace and plunge pool are private. In fact there is no privacy at all especially 301 and 303: their pool is right next to the infinity pool. As we were already on site in our junior suite we were able to choose our penthouse (after a little argument with the staff). We chose 307 witch is one of the most private with an excellent sea view+++. However as the hotel is so close to this very nice and quiet beach we didn't use a lot the plunge pool. The beach: Instead of going on the right arriving on the sand to the beach club we preffered walking up left 10 minutes to a very quiet spot with almost nobody (and thankfully no music). The resort: Nothing to complain about it. It's brand new and the staff is friendly. The infinity pool on the 4th floor is Whouah! Almost nobody except the bartender. Didn't really appreciate the music though. The location: It's on the north end of the touristic Playa so it's not crowed and quite calm. On the other hand you have to walk a good 20 minutes to get to the south area of 5th ave. That was OK with us because a calm and not crowed beach was our main criteria. Go check the distance on google earth, the hotel is next to the blue one behind Shangri La Caribe. I was really disaponited by the food in restaurants in Playa: not good and quite expensive. We were not impressed by the Cueva Del Chengo but didn't have a breakfast there as we had it in our room (the kitchen is fully equipped). Don't take a cocktail in a restaurant (almost no alcohol inside) they're much better in the lounge bars. Overall: I would definitly recommend this hotel and go back there. I would stay in a junior suite as it is cheaper and the private pool is a little bit useless with such a wonderfull infinity pool and the proximity of the ocean.", "Date": "September 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cSpacious rooms near the beach\u201d", "Author": "avb13", "ReviewID": "UR17472178", "Content": "We stayed at Pueblito Escondido Resort for five days in June. I choose the resort for location, the roof top pool, price and the services we desired for this part of our holiday. The location was fantastic just a short walk from a beautiful part of the beach five minutes from several beach clubs. Since we hired a car it was no problem to be in the \"little italy\" section of Playa a bit away from the busier part of 5th Ave. There are quite a few good restaurants nearby and an easy walk to reach the action on 5th. One of our favorites was a little coffe shop called Coffee Cafe, really good coffee and great musice They also had internet sevice if needed. We stayed in a Penthouse two bedroom apartment, room 301. The rooms were spacious and well laid out. A flat screen tv was in the living room and bedroom. The sofa in the living room is not the most comfortable I have ever sat on, but not bad. We did not have any problems with the bed post being in the way of the tv in the bedroom, as others have mentioned. They offer lots of channels in spanish a quite a few in english. We didn't watch much tv, just a few times when it rained. Free internet service was provided as well. The kitchen had a large fridge freezer, but not much in the way of bowls or utensils. I thought it rather strange they did not have any wine glasses at all. But, maybe most people drink tequila while in Mexico. However, we love our wine and champers so our request for glasses was promptly met. The main shower was large with good pressure. The closet had drawers and plently of hanging space. Although the closet rail is a bit high. They also supplied an iron and ironing board. However no hair drier. There was also an inroom safe. We had a problem with it at first, but my husband discoverd the batteries needed replacing, this was taken care of for us at once. Our private roof top pool was fantastic and we would use the pool when coming back from the beach or one of our excursions at the end of the day. Perfect. Well, one time there was another couple in the pool when I came up with my drink and towel. I guess they thought if they could get away with it, why not. The private pools are quite close to the main pool and there is easy access. I liked having our own space and didn't mind paying a little extra for it. The roof top pool had a great view and a swim up bar. We didn't mind the lack of shade at the private pool, but an unbrella probably would't go amiss. The air conditioning worked very well keeping the rooms cool. We also had a small balcony with a view of the sea, but there were no tables or chairs on it. The front desk was very helpful upon check in. As were all of the staff we dealt with. I would say my only complaint was the irregularity of the towels they left for you. There never seemed to be the same amount or no beach towels left. Other than that it suited our purposes very well and I would recommend this property to our friends. We did not use the pool bar or the any room service offered.", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cVery much underrated\u201d", "Author": "palapa_man", "ReviewID": "UR17420301", "Content": "Just returned from Playa and our stay at Pueblito Escondido. We had previously stayed at La Tortuga, (about 20 blocks south)which we had thoroughly enjoyed, in January of this year. We found Pueblito Escondido to be superior in almost all ways, and less expensive. The room we had, first floor junior suite with King bed was really nice. The one point that did not come across in previous reviews is proximity to the beach, just steps away, and the beach clubs are best reached by simply walking down the beach, first Mamitas, then Kool. Both had advantages, but Mamitas filled up earlier, especially in January when we were here previously. Kool has more comfortable(padded) chairs, but was about $6 per chair compared to $2 at Mamitas, try them both, and decide for yourself. The restaraunts near the hotel were more reasonable, and I felt better. I must say that the eateries in the mid to south portions of 5th Avenue were overpriced and commercialized. The Italian restaraunt around the street from hotel, will be moving into the restaraunt space at Pueblito recently vacated. We ate at this eatery twice, they also deliver to hotel, thought the food was good, I shared a tequila with owner as I waited for my takeout order. Babes on 5th was very good, the blueberry margeurita is huge, you can definitely share one. Stopped at La Vagabunda about 6-8 blocks down on 5th and had a nice lunch of fish tacos, pretty good. La Cueva del Chenga was nice for breakfast, it is 50 yards from hotel, we ate there twice, and also returned to La Tortuga for breakfast one day, we really enjoyed breakfast there when we stayed in January, we saw the waiters and they definitely remembered us, they were super friendly during our stay. We arranged transfers thru the hotel but they were actually less than the amount we were quoted by e-mail from the front desk. We paid $60 to Playa and $50 back to airport. We toyed with idea of taking the \"air conditioned luxury bus\" and then a cab to hotel from bus station , but I was in a rush to get there. The endless pool on the 4th floor was incredible, see for yourself that the pictures do not do it justice, you see the water, Cozumel, cruise ships, it was awesome. The bar is open til 6 pm, most days and closed on Monday. We brought our own bottle of champagne in the absence of bartender, who was good and made a nice drink-no low end liquor used here, all drinks were billed to room with a signature. There is also a pool on the first floor, we had a nice view of it from our room. Both pools were at times empty. We did manage to meet some nice people at the adult pool on the 4th floor, (LA, Denver, Dallas, New York, and New Jersey) The front desk was very helpful with all of our requests, ice, (there is an ice maker in the freezer, good luck) a blow dryer, extra towels, I just made sure to always tip the person who delivered item(s). In summary, this hotel was a bargain, I would recommend to friend and family. I can see minor details, such as the location of the 40\" LG television, but how many people have a TV this size in their hotel room, there was also a 15\" in bedroom, and we did not have any problem with viewing from bed. We moved the two ottomans to the loveseat by TV and they stayed there for our entire stay, I would definitely return, but it may be a year or two, as we have been here twice this year. We booked thru Orbitz, they had the lowest prices of major websites and the hotel website. Purchased some liquor at Cancun airport on arrival, never thought to do this before, nice savings, remember, there is a fridge and blender in room.", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "jpdilly", "ReviewID": "UR17378615", "Content": "Amazing Condo!
