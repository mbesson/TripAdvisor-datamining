When we weren't in the room, we explored the surrounding Fisherman's Wharf area - mainly to eat at the In and Out burger and the ice cream shop located in Ghirardelli Square.

It's located right in Ghirardelli Square with great views of San Francisco Bay and Alcatraz. Fisherman's Wharf is right down the street. The hotel staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful. Our \"room\" was unbelievable. \"Room\" is in quotes because we were upgraded at no extra charge to a two bedroom, 2 1/2 bath suite with a full kitchen, dining area, living room, and washer and dryer. The hotel offers free bicycles, and except for one good-sized hill, the bike path to the Golden Gate Bridge was very easy. Complimentary cheese and wine were served every late afternoon, and the free continental breakfast was outstanding. However one of the best things the hotel had to offer was a free car service. If the car was available, a very nice Cadillac Escalade, one of the butlers will drive you anywhere you want within a two mile radius of the hotel, and you can call them to pick you up! The hotel staff was careful to remind us that the car service was first come, first served, but we never had a problem getting a ride whenever we needed one, which was several times over the course of our 3-day stay.

If we stay at a hotel I actually get a break, but chances are we are on top of one another, & eating out every meal, which isn't optimal either. The Fairmont Heritage Place is the best of both worlds. Adults and kids had their own bedrooms and bathrooms, we had a very serviceable kitchen, but the twice daily housekeeping service, concierge, and friendly staff waiting to attend to any request had us feeling pampered and rested. The rooms are all equipped with ipads which makes for easy checking of the weather and any other web-based research you want to do when planning your day. Hailey got our vacation off to a great start with a warm greeting, easy check-in, and tour of the property. We rented a car which really wasn't necessary. The house car can get you almost anywhere you need to go, and the staff will get you a taxi if your destination is farther away. If you have a daughter you must take her to \"The crown & crumpet\" for tea in the square--that was a great experience, and of course fisherman's wharf, alcatraz, and Pier 39 are all within walking distance or a short car ride away.

I have had trouble finding the perfect hotel. Although I've found some properties I've liked, most of the rooms have been too small. Problem solved with the fantastic residences at the Fairmont Ghirardelli Square. We reserved a 2 bedroom residence over Thanksgiving week for 7 nights for us and our four children, as they advertised they could accommodate six, with a queen size sofa bed in the living room. Prior to our arrival, I exchanged several emails with the concierge staff, who arranged several dinner and brunch reservations. Upon arrival, we were greeted pleasantly and efficiently and shown briefly around the property before being shown to our room. The first impression is most impressive. The furnishings and colors are understated but elegant. Exposed brick, wide plank wood floors, a spacious kitchen and bedrooms, and the lovely art work makes you feel as if you have your own luxury apartment in the city. There is a bathroom in each bedroom, plus a half bath in the hallway. Only the 'master' bedroom had a tub, however. The beds in the bedrooms are large with excellent linens and mattresses. The sofa bed, however, was very uncomfortable. The kitchen and dining area was spacious. Cookware and dinnerware is adequate, but not generous. The pullout fridge and freezer are quite small. The wine cooler is a big bonus. The location is great, but one of the huge perks is the hotel cars which are new Escalades that will take you within a 2 mile radius and often more. Much better than a taxi! We utilized this service often. Drivers were friendly and very confident. The very nice BMW bicycles are a big perk although one day the brakes on one of our bikes were junk. The terrace overlooking the square with fire pits and heaters was very nice, as was the complimentary wine service from 4-5pm, but the property really needs a full service, full time bar. Complimentary Breakfast was simple continental with stale pastries, but the fruit, tea, and coffee were good. Room service is available with delivery from a few local restaurants but the delivery charge is hefty. The flat screen TVs are great, excellent lighting and central air and heat. Free reliable wireless is awesome. The only thing that really marred the excellent experience were some service issues. Service was generally great, but there were some glitches. The bathroom light was out in our room on arrival, and it took three days and four requests to fix it. I spilled wine on our bed sheets one night and the next night after the room had been serviced, I got in bed and saw the sheets had not been changed, as the wine stain was still there. It made me wonder if they had changed sheets on previous nights. There were also never enough towels. Most of the concierges were really great, but we had a couple of negative experiences with what may have been the same concierge, a female, who gave me wrong directions as I was waiting downtown for a house car pickup, and also when we requested a tailor, basically told us it couldn't be done. We asked another concierge who had a tailor for us in minutes. My adult sons working out in the fitness room got treated rudely by a staff member who challenged whether they were staying on property and called security apparently to verify, thus creating a little scene which was unnecessary. None of these little problems were sufficient to turn me off the place though, as it is a gorgeous property and good value for what you get. I would, however, for more than four people, get the three bedroom. The sofa bed just isn't comfortable and with only one tub and two showers, it doesn't work well for more than four. we'll definitely be back, especially as they're planning on adding a spa next year.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLoved it, loved it, loved it\u201d", "Author": "JimiMcV", "ReviewID": "UR121068849", "Content": "From the moment we arrived we were treated as treasured guests.

My husband and I took our two boys (9 &14) for a long Halloween weekend trip and got a 2 bedroom city view. It was HUGE! There are 2 masters -- each with own bath - ours was a bit more posh -- but you could definitely have 2 couples share a 2 bedroom. The kitchen and living room are very large and brand new -- you feel like you are in a NYC loft apartment. (I was hoping they would upgrade us to a \"Bay View\" and I asked several times -- but it was fine having CIty view since we rarely looked out the windows.) This hotel suite was so light and airy you didn't feel the need to have the shades up. The hotel is in a great location -- close enough to walk to Fisherman's Wharf and all the sights but tucked away at Giaradelli Square which is much more mellow. There are restaurants all around and a great Cupcake Store and Candy Shop right outside. Also, a Starbucks and the Buena Vista Restaurant is 2 blocks away (where the first Irish Coffee was \"invented\" or brought to the States -- advice-- go for the Irish Coffee - but DO NOT eat a meal there -- not very good!). The water is literally 2 blocks away or less. And there are 2-3 bike rental stores also right around the corner. This is a Fabulous place to stay with kids and the Wharf area has great things for kids to do. But you can still get around to other parts of the city and there is a Cable Car stop one block away as well. Breakfast is included -- They have a lovely comfy breakfast room (with upholstered chairs) and also a great outdoor patio with coal fire pit, which we sat by every morning (in light jackets) and ate our breakfast -- alone -- it was as if we owned a huge house in downtown San Fran. The Breakfast is really nice -- coffee, fresh juices, 3 kinds of cereal, very nice fresh fruit, an assortment of bagels and muffins. (Might have been some boiled eggs.) We ate there all 4 mornings and were quite satisfied with it. One of our best experiences was that they have a \"House Car\" which we used every day and it was always available when we needed it. The first day we were driven to the Alcatraz Ferry and our driver (I wish I could remember his name he was so nice) decided to give our boys a thrill so he drove us down a few winding, bumpy streets, including Lombard (most crooked street)!! He did this even though it was a bit out of the way to our destination but we had time and just loved the adventure! That that started our morning off with a bang and the boys were thrilled. It saved my husband and I having to walk them down it the next day! The hotel also gives a Wall Street Journal or New York Times each morning and the staff could not have been nicer and more helpful. Each driver we had was friendly and personable and really made the trip! I can't say ENOUGH great things about this hotel!

We arrived rather late after a flight from Orlando. Was freezing cold but was greeted but the lovely staff at the hotel. I felt rather overwhelmed if i'm honest as we were in shorts etc and others in the lobby were dressed up for the evening. Felt as if i shouldn't be staying somewhere so beautiful. This didn't matter as the check in was amazing very personnel and everything explained. We had a one bedroom apartment with a sofa bed in the lounge for the children. We had a balcony overlooking Ghirardelli square, others have mentioned noise but we found it very quiet. The loft style apartment was very modern just to my liking, the kitchen had everything you could think of wine cooler, fridge etc washer and dryer. My only gripe was the shower, but then i have found that water pressure is very different in the usa to the uk, in that there is non. They had even left chocolates for us as a welcome gift. A member of staff (can't remember her name) showed us to our room and explained how everything worked, a godsend for all the gadgets. We had to nip out for some milk almost as soon as we arrived for our kids, there is a little store over the road that we went to. As we were in there two homeless people came in but to our amazement the door man from the hotel was in there waiting for us to escort us back to the hotel. Made us feel very cared for as silly as that sounds. They have a 700 dvd library where you ring down what you would like to watch and they deliver it to the room. Excellent touch, we tend not to venture to far in the evenings with the kids as we were all tired from sightseeing. We had a major problem when we arrived in the chaos of things i forgot to book a trip to alcatraz or anythings else. The receptionist (again can't remember her name) explained that alcatraz was booked all week i was crest fallen.. all that way and we were going to miss the one thing i wanted to see. After the excitement of arriving, the room etc i was so down i was nearly in tears. She said to leave it with her and she would see what she could do. After a sick feeling all night next morning i slump to reception to find her ringing round trying everything she could to help us. To my delight she sorted us a two day bus loop tour, alcatraz island trip and a bike ride over the bridge to saulsilito. Still to this day i can't thank her enough, we had the best time ever..! The hotel offers a continental breakfast which is lovely you can even grab some bits and have it in your room. By the end of our stay the waiter bought out croissants for our youngest as soon as he see her :) We didn't venture to the roof terrace until the day we left, it was a glorious sunny day and we could see alcatraz and all the hustle and bustle of ghirardelli square. We never used the house car during our stay as we love walking plus was sightseeing all through the day. All the staff here are wonderful remember your name, are friendly and go out of there way to help with whatever you may need. Every night we had a turn down service and the maid got ready the bed for the children. I didn't really want to write this review as i kinda want to keep this hotel secret as it was so amazing. I would return to San Francisco in a heartbeat it's the best city i have ever visited (although the weather did get me down abit) and i would 100% stay here again, yes it's more expensive than other hotels but believe me it's the little things that make it amazing. Another tip we used Blazing Saddles tour company for our sightseeing trips, they were brilliant to, we had to pass there office everyday to get back to the hotel. Everytime the two guys working in there asked weather we had a good day, what we had been up to etc. Spoke to the kids about the bike ride was really nice and personnel that they remembered us each time. After a 22 mile bike ride we did get why they were called 'Blazing Saddles'... Day after the bike ride we had a 12 hour flight home sitting on another seat took me a week for my rear end to feel normal :D Amazing hotel, Amazing staff..

Rooms: This is an appartmnet hotell consisting of different types, studio, 2,3,4 bedroom and various location within the buliding. Some with terraces. We stayed three nights in a 2 bedroom with bay view and a direct access to common terrace area, 2nd floor and four nights in a 2 bedroom city view, 2nd floor. Two very different feelings, the bay view is light and spacious in the living area, but both bedrooms face the city. People are able to see you when you are in, without taking blinds down of course and all the others need to pass your appartment on the way to theirs and since it is free use for all, it is less privacy and more noisy outside. But very nice view even on second floor. City view have all the windows facing the street. It is a bit darker but cosier and we personally think this was a better. Floorplan was fine, fx you will not hear the washing machine going when sitting in the livingroom, which happens in the bayview appartment. And much more private, wich suited us better. Since we were two persons it is obviously more than enough space. We loved the ambience, the very luxurious ameneties, like all you need the kitchen, bathrobes, towels and amazing beds!! Maybe some of the best we ever have been sleeping in. Windows facing street are double, no disturbance during the night. Service: Generally good service. Only one of 7 days, housekeepng was late. Small thing, like a box of delicious chocolate welcomed us back. Nice. (We spend one night in LA before returning to SF) House car, Cadillac Escelade will take you where ever you want within a range of 2 miles. Younger peolpe working there, wich we found great!

We were travelling with our 3 year old son - whom the staff made such a wonderful fuss of - so the early start time of the breakfast (lots of fresh produce) was very helpful as was the unexpected proximity to a little sandy beach.The convenience of having a washing machine & tumble dryer was great too. We made daily use of the town car which always appeared to be available when we asked and the concierge staff both pre arrival & once at the hotel went out of their way to find out information to help us make the most of our visit.

Before we even arrived, Sarah and team at front desk contacted us via email to answer questions we had, helped us w/rental car reservations, and gave us recommendations to restaurants. Once we arrived, Sarah gave us a tour of the facilities, the multiple terraces, etc. to acquaint us with hotel. Our 2-bedroom suite was spacious. Great kitchen setup, fully furnished. Traveling w/kids, it was really convenient having a washer/dryer in the room. Location was fabulous (2 blocks from Hyde Street Cable Cars). Being on the Bay but slightly down from the Wharf, it was convenient if you're interested in biking along the bay or to GG Bridge, going out for a run in the morning, or just having plenty of restaurants or shops (cupcakes, desserts, etc., which our kids frequented daily) to satisfy almost anyone traveling. I initially thought being so close near the Wharf that it would be too noisy or close to all the tourists, but the location is far enough where it never became an issue. The best amenity was the House Car. We practically used it daily, and over a full week, including the July 4th weekend when the hotel was completely booked, it was only unavailable once to us when we needed it. If you plan on staying here, I think you can absolutely go without a rental car (unless you plan on going outside the city like we did for a day). We also used the house bikes (BMWs!) - should definitely take advantage of this if they are available (one note of caution - the kids bikes are small and they did not fit our 9 & 11 yr-olds, so we ended up renting for them). Great breakfast daily (fresh fruit, bagles, etc.) and my wife and I did the wine/cheese one afternoon. Had previously read on Tripadvisor where city view rooms were noisy,. Although we heard an occasional bus/cars, it was never that bad...just keep in mind you are staying in the city! The only negative I could come up with was the small closet space. Could use a bit more room/space...other than that, would have to say this was an excellent facility and definitely one everyone should experience!

However, a month later we still have a glow from a warm and wonderful stay. The apartment was exactly as portrayed on the web site. We were on the 3rd floor looking over the square and rooftops to the Bay and Alcaltraz. Really recommend the bay view - the apartment was very quiet with a balcony that we used daily to watch the cold water swimmers lapping the cove in front. When that got too cold we returned to the gas log fire and cosy lounge. The location was terrific, with bus routes directly in front and the cable car terminal at the back of the Square. We used the hotel car only once, to commence a walk atop Pacific Heights, but the ride was like catching a lift from a friend. Staff are one of the highlights of this Hotel and seem genuinely pleased to see each guest, and all act as if they know you well. All of the hotel areas were spotlessly clean and we had the impression that l the staff enjoyed their work and chatting with guests. A light breakfast is served each morning and my only only wish while staying would be that a tray be available to take breakfast back up to the apartment. The dining area was pleasant but after late nights many guests carried plates of food back to their rooms, and a tray would have been handy. We also joined other guests for wine and cheese on several occasions (4-5pm daily) - very good wine and cheese and knowledgable staff. The lack of a restaurant was not a problem, with 3 restaurants in the Hotel square, Fisherman's Wharf only 5 minutes away with other dining options along the way. Breakfast options are limited if you wish to start the day early but the Hotel breakfast was available from 6am.Only regret was that we didnt avail ourselves of the Hotel offer to have groceries in the apartment when we arrived. The nearest Safeway is approx 15 minutes walk away so we didnt bother to cook, a shame as the kitchen is fully equiped, and the occasional hot breakfast would have been good.

Not quite a conventional hotel property, but I knew what to expect as I booked it. It is actually a \"private residences club\", one of six properties that Fairmont manages, in which the primary goal appears to be selling a 10% time share in each suite, while renting out the suites in the meantime until they are all sold. 3 of the 6 properties of this type no longer offer rentals any more, so I suspect this property will end up this way one day. In the meantime...it's a great choice for a stay in San Francisco. Just be aware that there isn't a lunch/dinner option right within the property, although with such a wealth of excellent restaurants nearby, this shouldn't be an issue. The staff were great, very friendly and accommodating. The house car will drop you off and pick you up within a 2km radius of the property (which covers most of downtown San Francisco). The continental breakfast is very good - fresh fruit, sumptuous pastries, bread and bagels to toast, yogurt & granola, juice and coffee. I didn't use the fitness facilities, so can't comment on them, except to note that they are temporarily housed in one of the suites, while the regular fitness room is redone. I requested a shuttle to the airport, and they arranged an excellent option, and even pre-arranged the billing, which threw me for a loop, when I tried to pay at SFO, and was told by the driver \"don't worry about it, sir\".

The location is perfect, the service is impeccable and the stay is worth every penny. First, the location. You're in Ghirardelli Square, so you have great shopping and food right outside your front door. Not to mention the greatest hot cocoa I've ever had at the Ghirardelli Cafe. Outside of that, you're just a minute or two walk from the cable car turnaround, which can take you to Chinatown, Lombard Street, Nob Hill and Union Square. Fisherman's Wharf is also just a few blocks to the east, so there's plenty to do there as well. Next, the service. All of the staff were extemely helpful with restaurant recommendations, directions, stuff to do, etc. They all make you feel valued to be a guest. The courtesy car is a great feature of the hotel. We often wandered around town and then called for the car to pick us up when we wanted to come \"home.\" And, oh, the amenities. The Business Center was top notch and very private for me to get some work done. The evening wine and cheese tastings were a lot of fun, and gave us the opportunity to mingle with other guests. The complimentary breakfast was better than expected (bagels, pastries, yogurt, granola, etc.) and perfect for taking back to your room for a sit down breakfast. The terraces were my favorite, though. There were two - one small one off the lounge and a large one overlooking the bay off the second floor. Both had large natural gas firepits that were the perfect complement to the cool Bay evenings. I could have spent my entire vacation reading and watching the Bay from atop Ghirardelli Square! And let's not forget the rooms. Our room was immaculate, and provided everything we needed: dishwasher, stove cooktop, washer/dryer, silverware and plates - it was like having our own apartment on the waterfront!

We entered the sedate-looking brick building and the lobby was incredibly calm and sparing...hmm, I thought. Then a couple of well-mannered, friendly Fairmont staffers immediately greeted us and gave us the lowdown about the one-bedroom cityview unit I'd booked at a comparatively low price several months earlier (less than $350) for me and my two teenagers in tow...and then staff proceeded to tell me we'd been upgraded at no cost to a two-bedroom cityview unit! Yo! Well, OK! We were pleased, without question! The building is more like a condominium property than a hotel, so it's rather quiet and there aren't tons of folks hanging around. I liked that. And then the unit itself, well, it was gorgeous. The full kitchen gleamed, with a center isle and sufficient pots and pans, silverware, dishes, a medium-sized drawer-type refrigerator, an icemaker and a small dishwasher (I rarely used any of this stuff except for tea-making!), The living room was genuinely spacious and comfortable with a lovely couch and a few chairs and a big ol' flat screen TV atop a gas fireplace. The bedrooms were also quite spacious and each had its own large TV and bathroom - one, even, with a jet-stream-type tub...VERY nice! I like firm mattresses and these were a tad bit less than firm, but my teens thought the beds heavenly, so I'm sure you will, too! We also loved the continental breakfast...boiled eggs, pastries, toast, fresh fruits, orange juice, milk were the major offerings and, of course, coffee and tea. The late afternoon 4pm-5pm refreshment bar of red/white wines and sodas and cheeses/crackers was also a nice touch. Again, it seemed like there were never many folks around, although we knew there were...they just - like us - stayed largely in their own units and enjoyed the amenities there! However, note that the property also has a great deck facing the San Francisco waters and this deck has lovely firepits in the evening that blaze seemingly all night, with plenty of outdoor furniture on which to lounge about... One of the best features of the Fairmont is that it's intimately connected to the Ghirardelli Square shopping square...a small, high-end place with lots of fun little shops and wine-tasting places and some good restaurants. This square was extremely close to the water and within immediate walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf. What's not to like???!!! We loved it and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The Fairmont town car came in very handy when my teens decided to catch a night movie in the city. The staff's attention to ensuring their safe arrival and pick-up was much appreciated by me. The only downside of note, and there was only one and I feel like I should mention it to be genuine, was that the city view wasn't exactly a skyline-type view...it was of smaller-type rowhouses immediately across the street. Now we were on the second floor, so keep that in mind. It wasn't a Ghirardelli Square high-end-type view, but it wasn't bad, either. And the windows have some super nice curtains including pulldowns that let light in but keep outsider viewers out. I easily found ways to arrange these to my absolute satisfaction.

The $50 a day valet was not so nice but typical for the city. The only things that prevented me from giving it a 5 star rating was that there was a heap of dust behind the master bedroom bed and all of the fixtures in the bathroom were really dusty - I am not THAT picky but for the $$$ this could have been taken care of. The other issue was that in rooms that back on to North Point Road are crazy noisy - I had to pull out ear plugs or there was no sleeping - I let the concierge know about both things - but he was not that phased by it???

We tried to speak of it to them in terms of moving us being a choice for us to do or not, but it became clear to us that despite our longstanding reservation that they did not particularly see it that way. To their credit they arranged for us to stay at the Fairmont at Nob Hill and they picked up the room charge. Was that generous on their part? Yes, it most certainly was generous. Was staying at the Fairmont Nob Hill a convenient or satisfying experience for us? No, it was not. If we had wanted to stay at a business oriented hotel, not within walking distance to many major attractions, without en suite kitchen or laundry, and not particularly friendly to young children -- then we would have booked at the Fairmont Nob Hill in the first place.

The hotel features 1, 2, and 3 bedroom suites which are basically fully furnished luxury city apartments. At the time we were booking, a 2 bedroom suite at the Fairmont Ghirardelli was priced slightly less than 2 connecting rooms and a lot less than a 2 bed suite at a comparable hotel in the city. If this is still the case, this represents an excellent value for families looking for 2 or 3 bedroom suites. The selling point of this hotel is the outstanding quality of the rooms. The single level suites are decorated in contemporary/modern style with granite countertops throughout, modern kitchen appliances (dishwasher, full size microwave/oven, stove, wine fridge, full sink, toaster, coffee maker, full set of stemware, full set of porcelain china, flatware, cooking knives, etc - probably better equipped than your own kitchen), baths with separated toilet (WC), spacious tubs and showers with excellent water pressure & temp, outstanding beds and linens/pillows (super comfortable, better than W Heavenly), and in-unit washer/dryer. Living room is very spacious with gas faux fireplace and all units (it seemed) have their own generous balconies. Didn't have any issues with sound from neighbors. You could hear other family members within the suite between rooms, but it was manageable. The service at the Fairmont is pretty darn good. They try really hard to exceed your expectations, and everyone really steps up to meet your needs without a single complaint. The only issue I had was that the housekeeping during my stay only cleaned beds and bathrooms, didn't straighten up living room or kitchen. Location is unbeatable for tourists - you are in Ghirardelli Square, steps away from the Pier, Marina, GG Bridge. Kind of far from nearest BART station, but the hotel has a car (Maserati) which will take you to/from the BART. Free continental breakfast every morning with a good selection of pastries and such was much appreciated. Guests who join their frequent traveller club (Presidents Club) get free in-room Internet and free local calls. Valet parking is $50/night.

I was expecting a good stay, and hoping that the service would match the top notch service at the Four Seasons. Overall, we were blown away by this property. I cannot say enough about the staff, who almost glow as it seems they love their jobs so much. Either that, or they are very good actors. Some taxi drivers still do not know about this place and we were taken to the other Fairmont by mistake, so give them the address in addition to the property name. The location is quite good, near the Russian Hill area, and many good restaurants are within a 15-20 minute walk. The (free!!!) house limo will take you anywhere within a 2 mile radius, plus PICK YOU UP, which is almost unheard of. The property is stunning -- the pictures on their website do not do it justice. We were upgraded to a two-bedroom, but it was at ground level and by the makeshift gym (they are still working on the gym and Willow Stream Spa) and the exit out to Ghirardelli Square. So, during the day, it was fairly noisy --plenty of slamming doors, plus I don't think they put in triple pane windows as you can clearly hear conversations on the street of passersby, and street traffic. If you are on the Ghirardelli Square side, you have to deal with the noise from the nearby businesses and tourists. However, by evening, the noise is diminished quite significantly. We did not hear any noise from the other suites beside or above us. If you do not like big city noises, I would not recommend staying here. We found the bed in the master bedroom fairly soft (we like firm beds) and we moved into the second bedroom for the remainder of our stay as the bed seemed firmer. We asked the staff if they could put a board under the mattress, but that was the only request they could not accomodate. Both bathrooms were gorgeous, with plenty of soft, fluffy towels. Shower pressure could have been a bit stronger, and though high-end, the amentities were strongly scented with a men's cologne type fragrance, which was disappointing for me. The kitchen was extremely well equipped and what impressed me were all the high-end touches; Henckel knives, Cuisinart cookware, and Villeroy and Boch dishware, plus a Wolf gas range. They spared no expense outfitting these kitchens and I only wish I had time to cook during our stay. There was also a Bosch washer and dryer in the suite, so you can pack light and leave room in your suitcase instead for shopping. Detergent and dryer sheets are provided. There are two business centres with internet access (free for guests) and free Wifi throughout the property, though I found it very spotty in our suite. There are also two terraces with propane firepits which overlook Ghirardelli Square and the ocean. The daily wine and cheese is sponsored by the sales staff, and we appreciated that they were very discreet re: sales They seemed to notice when people weren't interested and were pleasant people to talk to, not pushy at all, plus gave us some good sightseeing tips. The continental breakfast is simple, but again, very high-end; fresh squeezed juice, Illy coffee, organic tea, Ghirardelli hot chocolate, organic yogurts, beautiful pastries, and plenty of cut-up fresh fruit. It made a great start to our day. If it seems like I'm raving about this place, I am! We would return in a heartbeat, trust me, it may seem pricey but for the service and amenities, it is really good value.

Kinda, I picked the hotel. So after talking with other travelers and reading reviews I thought Fairmont Ghiradelli Square would be the best fit for a variety of activities and people going. I WAS RIGHT! First off, the hotel is gorgeous and the service is top notch! I received an email from their concierge, Jeremy, a week before I was due out with contact information and any needs or requests I may have. (Which were none, but just the same). When I arrived Jeremy was there to greet us and made us all feel right at home. I booked a 2 bedroom city view which we were escorted to and given a run down of room and hotel amenities. The room was nicely appointed with spacious kitchen, dining and living area. There is one master bedroom with a king bed, separate shower and tub, robes and excellent linens (I let my parents have this room). The second bedroom also has a king bed with high thread count sheets. Shared bathroom has a walk in shower and large vanity. The room itself was great but there was quite a bit of street noise. The only downfall. (Opt for the bayview and you'll skip the traffic noise). There are 2 patios, one with a great view, both with firepits which are nice on a cold SF night! I think I spent a little time out there every night with a glass of wine or cup of tea! The hotel also offers a small gym, which I did not use, I was really on vacation and a great lounge area. The lounge had a pool table, which we did use almost every day. They offer a wine and cheese happy hour too. There is a spa going in, but was under construction when I was there (too bad). Lastly, location. You are AT Ghiradelli Square, literally, there is a back entrance that steps out to the square. You have a choice of many restaurants in your back yard. I highly recommend McCormick's & Kuletos, great seafood! Of course, chocolate and ice cream is steps away. Try a cupcake at Kara's too! Short walk from the hotel is the Cable Car turnaround, the bay and Maritime museum! Quick cab ride or bus ride anywhere! All and all, Stay there! The cost was comparable to anywhere near by and you couldn't ask for a better location! The staff really made it for me! They were attentive and really made you feel at home!

We got a quick tour of the property, which includes two terraces, one of which has a \"fire pit\" and daily wine/cocktail hours, as well as a lounge that serves a complimentary continental breakfast. The lobby is small but tastefully appointed, as are the common areas. The elevators are freight car size and quick and responsive. The Room: All of these \"hotel rooms\" were originally built as condominium units, and the size of each room is truly apartment like. Our one bedroom had a full chef's kitchen as you walk in, complete with Bosch dishwasher and Sub-Zero drawer fridge/freezer. A living area has a large exposed brick wall and large windows facing out onto SF Bay and Alcatraz. Flatscreen mounted TV with DirectTV and a surround sound system (there is probably $2000 of AV equipment built into the wall). The bedroom is a good size, with the same view and there is a large bathroom. The bathroom, however, was probably my only complaint about the room itself - there is a lot of wasted space that could have been used to create a larger shower or a sitting area, at least in my unit. More importantly, for one of the nicest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in - this shower stunk. No door, so it was freezing when you weren't under the water - pressure was just so/so, as well. The beds were incredibly comfortable, as expected. Oh yeah, and a washer/dryer, which we used (they provide detergent and dryer sheets). The Perks: A concierge contacted me a few weeks in advance of our trip to see if I would need any help planning an itinerary. They were kind enough to book multiple lunch/dinner reservations as well as a guided wine tour through Napa. New York Times delivered to the door every day. House Car (Maserati) which will take you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel if it is available, and it was every time we needed it. Chocolates on the pillow (Ghirardelli, natch) and they will do grocery shopping for you in advance of your arrival (if you want them to pick up a bottle of wine, etc.). 500 movie DVD library which we took advantage of on a night we stayed in.

The location of the hotel is great, walking distance from most neighborhoods (Russian Hill is great for restaurants and 7 blocks away, downhill on the way back). Check-in and concierge servers couldn't have been more helpful and the hotel car is very handy. Will definitely stay again when we return.", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cGreat find - luxury at a great price\u201d", "Author": "miamipickytravelers", "ReviewID": "UR24224126", "Content": "We liked the Fairmont in Ghiradelli Square so much that we changed our reservation at another hotel on our return trip to stay a 2nd time.

One of the best vantage points from where to see Alcatraz, Tiburon and Sausalito. The hotel consists of four buildings surrounded by some excellent restaurants, shops and attractions. The rooms feature kitchens with mini-Wolf stoves, Sub Zero refrigerators, Bosch washers/dryers and an awesome surround sound setup in living rooms AND bedrooms. Continental breakfast and afternoon wine / cheese add to the flair of this truly unique property. Moreover, Gary Danko will soon open up a restaurant on the property and their menu will be available as room service for the property guests on china from the restaurant. Service is by far the best I've seen in a long time. In fact, you can order groceries from most any local vendor and have it stocked prior to your arrival. Imagine having fresh dungeoness crab waiting in your room directly from Fisherman's Wharf. The property has one, two and three bedroom lofts all decorated in a unique modern style - it reminded me of some of the better items you can purchase at the Pottery Barn. Mattresses only add to the flair - Stearn and Foster matresses specifically designed for the Fairmont! Slept like a baby. The property is in the old Ghiradelli Square building - you can't get any more San Francisco than that. Additionally, you're close to North Beach and downtown. In fact, they'll drive you anywhere within a two mile radius in the properties Maserati sedan! A must see to believe propery with rates comprable to room only hotels in San Francisco. One of the best values for your money. I highly recommend you see this property. I work in the travel industry and have seen some real nice properties (paradors in Spain, etc.). I was very impressed by the property and (moreso) by the professionalism and attention to detail by the staff.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNew Property can turn into a gem with time\u201d", "Author": "Travellady22", "ReviewID": "UR22316461", "Content": "We on our annual trip to the Hawaiian Islands and we always stop over in San Francisco on way back to DC. We enjoy 4 and 5 star hotels, we have stayed at the Fairmont, Huntington, Hyatt, and several Kimptons. This time we had our 33 year old son, who wanted his own bedroom and bathroom. Since this was a family trip over Thanksgiving, we wanted a 2 bedroom suite, with a living room, and possible kitchen. I found this brand new Fairmont Residence Hotel with fractional ownership, which also sells its units now nightly to the public. We could find NO reviews of any type,as it had really just opened this past August, but we decided to gamble and try it. Good points: Brand new, immaculate, 3 flat screen tv's, living room, and each bedroom. Lovely sheets and beds, great bathrooms, separate showers and bathtubs, modern furniture, table for 6 in the kitchen dining room, dream kitchen, washer and dryer, etc. Nice first floor breakfast room with free continental breakfast served from 7am to 10am, and nightly wine and cheese from 5pm to 6pm. Also 2 free computer rooms in lobby. Staff very pleasant and a Maserati sedan to drop you within a 2 mile radius to restaurants and shopping if you can get it. Two great terraces overlooking the Bay with fire pits and lots of chairs outside for guests to sit outside with their own wine (no bar in hotel, but wine shops below in plaza This hotel does NOT have a restaurant but does have limited room service from some restaurants below in the plaza. The possible down sides: Not for people with walking problems. As you have 5 buildings connected by stairs, long halls, walkways, etc. For those who like to come back to the hotel and have a drink at the bar, or have a small cafe or restaurant, it has NONE. There seem to be a lot of different floor plans. Our unit had a terrace bay view all right, but the view was blocked by a gazebo with tables and chairs.. Our unit ran from front to back, as many there do,, and the two bedrooms were on the street, bus, cab, truck, people noise. The units have a lot of huge windows 12 feet high and NOT double paned. You can hear everything outside from some lower units, ask for a high floor if possible. The place is built right into a new shopping and dining plaza, below you. Rooms with bay view hear all this below. Our building and terrace was over a Gary Danko Restaurant which is opening in Spring 2009. That could be noisy also. The staff is pleasant, but clearly finding its way still in this new property. Finding the front door first time is a challenge. Summary: The guests we met were intelligent, articulate, quiet, with pretty well behaved children and dogs. The hotel inside is quiet. When the summer tourist crowd is below in the plaza and all the shops and restaurants are open, the noise level will increase and how it will effect many suites, I do not know. Over all, we liked it for our needs, It is not for everyone, the location is not central, and the area across the street is still dicey with a garish liquor store across from the hotel entrance. However, it is up and coming area, and they did a nice job of redoing the old Ghiradelli chocolate factory buildings. The minor complaints most guests agreed on, noise through their windows from the street or plaza, wanted more good small dining choices in that area, wifi would work in all rooms (ours did not)and that the hotel had its breakfast cafe open till 11pm. The restaurants in the Plaza below are nice, but not many of them, the all seem to stop serving or close by 10pm except for one bar which is a bit rowdy. Since they have that lovely room for breakfast, that stays empty the rest of the day and night, they should sell soup, salad, and nice sandwiches for guests till midnight. And if you arrive there after 10:30pm, there is NO place nearby open to eat or order from room service, nothing. As we found out our first night when our flight arrived late. They only have \"room service\" from the few dining spots in the plaza\" and those were closing. I was not offered a menu. So, I would highly suggest to them that they use their \"breakfast room\" for all day and evening snacks. We would have eaten bagels, juice, tea, apples, bananas, sandwich, anything, when we finally arrived at 10:48pm. They did not suggest a thing. From a property touting 5 star service this is not acceptable. They have food in their mini kitchen, for breakfast and the wine and cheese hour, they could have offered at least apples, oranges, juice, cheese, something. They did not. We give this new place a low 4 star and when all the plaza construction is done and new hotel bugs get worked out, we want to return again PS A sandwich plate, cheese platter, cookies, juice, tea in our room, which we would have paid for, would have been welcome. Instead of \"everything in this area is not serving meals at this hour\"", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fairmont Heritage Place, Ghirardelli Square", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d1175274-Reviews-Fairmont_Heritage_Place_Ghirardelli_Square-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$631 - $1,158*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">900 North Point Street</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Suite D100</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1175274", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/39/ef/39ef14e44fe02130ecc55153b43a87438large.jpg"}}
