It was their first trip to Napa and based on their experience at Meadowood, I have created some very grateful monsters! with a significant amount of help from Will and Casey at the concierge desk, I put together a packed itinerary filled with wineries handpicked for their exquisite gardens (Viansa, Domaine Chandon, Darioush) and got large tables at our preferred times in all the restaurants we requested - Brix was a particular favorite for its elegant patio overlooking acres of herb and flower gardens. The resort is tucked into a mountainside road...just outside the charm of St Helena but offering a cloistered setting that almost reminded me of my native South Carolina with its shady lanes, low rise cottage style rooms and massive tree canopies. The sense of arrival immediately relaxed us, with staff in crisp resort wear and friendly smiles. Jesse escorted us to our room which was majestic - the Meadowood suite with french doors overlooking the immaculate croquet lawn (really! there was a tournament that we watched over our coffee cups on Tuesday morning), soaking tubs and nespresso coffee makers. But the piece du resistance was the large stone wood-burning fireplace already set with a box of matches at the ready - decadent for the cool California evenings! We dined one night in the casual Grill where Paul was a gracious host and made several excellent wine recommendations. Coincidentally we met Cameron the young chef at the 3 Star dining room while we were there and realized that he was the same friendly gentleman who had given us directions as on the mountain road where we found him harvesting some fresh pine herbs for the restaurant! The grounds were worth the trip alone...quiet garden paths and well designed lighting made it easy to explore even at dusk, and the gobble of a friendly turkey and some local birds welcomed us each morning to explore. The roaring fire in the reception hall was always stoked to a beautiful flame in the cool mornings and the resort staff couldn't have been more accommodating in setting up last minute spa appointments and organizing our wine shipments back east. The sales department was hosting some new clients for future meetings while we were there, and given the beauty of the setting and the quality of the facility, I'm sure it was an easy task.

The prices have really changed over the years but it is still the best place to stay. You do need to know it is very expensive not a room under $500.00. The place is just gorgeous with tree line roads in and out and all rooms have private areas. Most rooms have wood burning fireplaces with high white washed wood ceilings. Bathroom are large some with just a shower but most with showers a tubs. The only caution is if you are not fit request a room in the lodge as most rooms are on hils with many steps to climb. Not a problem for us but I think it could be difficult for some. The Grill is my favorite as the food is great but down to earth and not outrageously expensive. Wine list are really good too. The main resturant is very expensive as it does have Michelin stars. I have eaten in better resturants than this one. In fact I think Cooks and Terra are better but I prefer more down to earth food. The wine list is very good at this resturant . The service is excellent. If you like to Golf the fairways are long and narrow. There is Tennis. The spa is nice but not as nice as others in the area. However, they seem to have the best therapist. I love Morris! He is fantastic. I have gone to other spas and get a wimpy massage. If you are having a business meeting, they really do a meeting well. Food is great. They even have an expresso maker for breakfast for folks to make expresso. The Vitner room is very nice nice for a meeting especially in the Winter as they have a really big fireplace.

You have two choices: (1) abstain: put your car keys in the room safe and forget the combination; or (2) lengthen your stay by at least 2 days and suffer the financial consequences: spend 2 days in tasting rooms or wineries and 2 days at the resort. Some might consider it a flaw that Meadowood has only limited food offerings and, at least at present, no grand entertaining rooms or intimate, wood paneled bars. I don't. If you want a spectatular, and really expenisve dinner, you can go out at night to any of the absolutely wonderful nearby restaurants.

A few highlights stand out. We had dinner in the Restaurant -- very inventive cuisine, extraordinary service. We booked a private wine excursion with the sommelier, Gilles de Chambure, and got a real insider's view of three wineries (including two fabulous small places that we never would have gone to on our own). And, believe it or not, the croquet lession was fabulous, something I'd never get anyplace else. Two things set this place apart from the rest. First, serenity -- everything about this property is calming. We did a lot during our stay and yet I left more relaxed than I have from any vacation. It felt like a private club, set out just for us. And the biggest asset of this resort is the service. Every single staff member (and there are a lot of them) seemed dedicated to doing whatever we wanted at a given moment. I'd give particular recognition to our concierge Bob, who set up all sorts of cool activities and visits for us.

There was a kiddies pool at one end of the lawn and a lap pool/adults pool at the other. I was a little bit annoyed one day, when 3 teenage girls were in the lap pool having the time of their lives, just doing what girls do best - having fun. They were asked to leave as they were making too much noise. The very next day, we sat by the pool and there were 8 very LOUD\" ladies who lunch\" working their way through the cocktail list and getting louder and louder - did anyone ask them to move or be quiet, no of course not, let them just disturb the other guests.

Dinner at the Meadowood is a crazy expensive affair, and one that was more than a little off-putting. The restaurant was the main reason we came back to Meadowood, and the fresh California cuisine we loved was gone, replaced with course after course that seemed more like science experiments than great food.Things spewed billows of smoke, foam was everywhere and there was nary a memorable course.

The facilities, rooms, service and amenities are all world-class.

Where else does your mini-bar come equipped with a split of cult California cab for a cool $170/btl.? Pros: Extremely elegant, refined, quiet and peaceful. Also great pools, tennis, croquet, and dining facilities. Staff moves quietly and efficiently to meet every desire. We often felt like we were only people there. Also, VERY conveniently located so winery visits and to St. Helena shops and restaurants were short drives away. Cons: VERY expensive. Most rooms are detached from lodge and require a bit of a hike to carry bags to/from car. Highly recommend using bell staff if you are not able carry heavy items up and down hill. Probably would not recommend staying here unless you have your own car since walking to town is a couple of miles away. Our room was very nice - almost everything was white with exception of a little natural wood. Also loved their hiking trails and seeing all of the wildlife.

The menu was very small...either an 8 course tasting menu of what the waitress described as \"bite size\" portiions or a 3 course menu of not bite size portions. We opted for the latter and were shocked at the portions. The non tasting menu was literally 2-bite portions! I ate my asparagus wrapped in salmon in 2 bites and my chicken was a bite size piece of chicken breast and another bite size portiion of pressed dark meat. The cheese course was 4 tiny servings of overengineered bites on a 4 divider plate. Not only were the portions tiny but prices were high. I will say the quality of the food was good. The atmosphere was very sterile and formal. Another complaint is somebody came to our table literally every five minutes or sooner to interrupt us to attend to something...can I fill your water (don't interrupt just fill the friggin water, can I take your radishe-there was one tiny radish left on a plate..who is it bothering??)

Our Treeline room was on the older side, but very well-kept. The bed was comfortable, and the room had a nice fireplace and seating area and a small patio for dining. While the bathroom needed refreshening (small tile floors, wainscoting, and some outdated lighting fixtures), the look overall was clean and classic. (A remodeled Treeline cottage was available, but at a higher cost.) I didn't want to spa, so my wife ended up getting two treatments. Late the second day while my wife was at the spa, I walked on to the golf course -- and had the entire course to myself. I played the entire 9 in just over an hour, and then replayed the first two holes again just for the fun of it. The Restaurant at Meadowood was fantastic. The food was (surpisingly) right up there with the French Laundry. Other notes: Service was excellent overall. E.g., we ordered breakfast from the golf course one day, and it was delivered to our room just as we finished our round. The wine director (and Master Sommelier), Gilles, gave us two excellent winery recommendations -- Viader and Gargiulo. The free handout map of Napa wineries is the best that I've ever seen.

Along the way you pass the tennis courts, the gym and spa and you think to yourself, I've made the right decision here, this is just wonderful. We stayed for three all-too-brief nights. When we saw our room we wanted to be moved to a larger one, but there was nothing available, it being the weekend. But true to their word, come Monday morning, they did offer to move us to larger accomodation which we declined, having settled very happily into what we'd been given. I know this might sound petty, (do I care?), but just one sink in a bathroom which has masses of space for another, is very annoying, especially when you're married to someone who likes plenty of undisturbed sink-time. And while I'm on a moan - why the Molton Brown toiletries? Nothing wrong with them, they''re very nice, but they're British for heaven's sake, and I want quality American stuff when I'm in the States. Our room was a cottage in the hillside, so when we stepped out onto the decking, we were half way up amongst the trees with no one overlooking us and no disturbance except for the welcome noises of the birds. This property has successfully managed to blend all mod cons with rugged nature and even the most stressed-out person could not fail to find the experience relaxing. And a fireplace in the bedroom is always wonderful. The spa was excellent. I took two deep-tissue massages with Vinnie, and cannot begin to tell you how much more limber I felt afterwards. The gym was good, but locals also use it, and it was rather busy when I was in there. Wish I could have taken the studio classes, but hey, with all that shopping to be done, something's gotta give! We ate in their fine dining restaurant and it was excellent. We did the wine pairing thing, and it made the meal that much more special, but when my dessert wine failed to arrive with my chocolate dish, the waiter (I think I'm supposed to call them \"servers\" these days), immediately said that there would be no charge for the dessert or the wine. Well done him for offering, instead of me having to take the matter up when the bill arrived, which would have taken the sparkle off the evening. We ate lunch twice in their more casual restaurant, and being able to sit outside in March was a treat in itself. Good, prompt service from Roberto. Who wants to waste time having lunch when there's so much else to do! When we arrived we were given a comp bottle of champaine (sparkling wine, actually), which housekeeping saw fit to whisk away the next day, along with my cherished champaine bottle stopper. (Yes, it is an essential piece of travel kit). I raised the matter with reception, who could not have been more apologitic, and within 24 hours the stopper had been found (some poor soul probably had to rummage through the days rubbish), and a fresh bottle of champaine, plus a box of hand-made local chocolates had been delivered to our room within minutes of my phone call. When you stay at a hotel, things can go wrong, they sould'nt, but hey, sometimes they just do. But its how the situation is dealt with that makes the difference - and the Meadowood folk did their utmost to solve my problem. Josh Miles on the front desk gets full marks for this. It's how you're made to FEEL that makes all the difference, and he took my problem seriously, and got it sorted, turning a negative into a positive. Overall, I would say that the staff here are outstanding. This is definately the sort of place for folk who like to be active, but you can just a easily settle down and read for the day, or hang out in the spa.. Tennis seems to be very popular. The property is very spacious, so you never feel like you're in a crowded area. Buggies take you to where ever you want to go, which is good for the less mobile.

The hotel restaurant was delicious. The grounds were quite spread out but you could drive everywhere, or you could call to be picked up in a golf cart.

What I like about Meadowood is that it is a beautiful property, well-maintained, great meeting space, great food, wonderful facilities (and of course a choice location near St. Helena), but in addtion to all that the service is down-to-earth and friendly all the time! The front desk staff, the banquet staff, and all the staff I worked with were top of the line helpful and responsive in every way. No minor detail was too much for them to handle and they move quick! If you go with a group of people, you MUST play croquet! Jerry, the croquet pro makes it fun and easy to learn. He knew everyone's name within 10 minutes. Our group had a great time, despite their apprehensions with the \"dress all in white\" rule. It was a great, no-stress team building experience. Our \"happy hour\" by the lap pool was one of the best social hours we've had, and the addition of a representative from a local winery to talk about their wines (Alpha Omega) and serve samples was magical (this was their idea).

We did pay for our food, but the lodging was free (well, she was working the event, so she earned it in my eyes.) That being said, this is a really nice property. Secluded. Quiet. Upscale goes without saying given the price tag. But not pretentious -- I have a low tolerance for going places where people are there to be seen: this is not one of those places (but when you tell locals you're staying here, they always say, \"oh how nice!\" as they raise their eyebrows). To get the most out of this place, you really need to stay probably 4-5 nights and use the pool, spa, tennis courts etc. We didn't have a chance to do any of that since we had a full schedule with the Wine Auction and attendant gatherings (dinners, lunches at local wineries and restaurants). Staff was very friendly and helpful. NEVER got any attitude from anyone on the property. Room itself was very nice -- like having our own little bungalow. Having said that, do I think it's worth $800+ a night? Eh, I dunno about that. But it was spacious, had a GREAT bed (seriously, the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in a on vacation - I was tempted to ask what brand bed it was!), nice bathroom amenities, and a nice little patio overlooking the golf course. Yeah, the TV is small...but who comes to Napa to watch TV in their room? If you do, I pity you. The in-room breakfast brought to us was good, but frankly I've had a similar breakfast at the San Francisco Marriott that was just as good at half the price. Staff was great though: they forgot my orange juice and brought us 2, one on the house. Nice. Only gripe: we left our room the second day in the morning. When we got back at 3:30 p.m. to take a break and freshen up before dinner, the staff was still cleaning our room, so we had to wait in the lobby/lounge area for about 45 minutes until they were done. This kinda thing shouldn't happen on a property like this. Like another reviewer said: if you have cash to burn, by all means, stay here. If you're like my wife and myself and prefer to throw down $$ on food and going out and seeing the sights instead of where you hang your head, you can probably find just as good a room for much less in Napa.", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNewly Renovated Suites are Beautiful\u201d", "Author": "Cinderella_Dearest", "ReviewID": "UR7472519", "Content": "This was my first experience at Meadowood, and it was quite nice.

There was an incredibly comfortable King-sized bed with lots of pouffy sleeping pillows and halogen reading lights... A large box of complimentary chocolates awaited me, and I have to admit I tasted each of them quite happily ! The big, airy bathroom was wonderful, with candles by the tub, heavenly smelling shower and soap and lotion amenities, a wonderful large shower with both an overhead rain head and a wall head, and thick towels to dry off with... A soft bathrobe awaited me in the closet, as did slippers... Evening turn down service was a welcome touch. Meadowood is evidently in the beginning stages of an 18 month planned renovation of the property, and the suite I stayed in was one of the newest re-do's...

But if you're looking for a Ritz-style deference to your every wish, it is not the place for you. For starters, the front staff is very unprofessional and way too casual for the price. We tried to use their concierge services and found their involvement to make planning activities only more chaotic and confusing, rather than less so. That kind of disorganization really is not forgivable for the rates they charge. Aside from that, I adored the simplicity of the room decor. Our room wasn't tired looking at all -- it's just not ornate, gilded, or frou frou. I also loved the working fireplaces and very comfy beds. As a sidenote, I would recommend hiking the property.
