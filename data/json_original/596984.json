The hotel is a 2 minute walk to the lido beach front, and an under 10 minute walk to the vaporetto pier that takes you into venice. The hotel itself is beautiful, the rooms are beautiful as well. They serve a breakfast from 7:30 - 10 and it's just so-so. no hot food. For the price, however, I highly, highly recommend this hotel. We had no problems. Just don't expect a ton of amenities and modern perfections.

We were not pleased as this hotel was charging the same price but had none of the facilities we had especially chosen in the original one. The room was small and with no air conditioning. The fridge was not switched on and would have had to share a plug socket with the light. Had to unplug the bedside light to charge a phone. The bathroom smelt musty and could have done with a really good scrub. The breakfast was the best part about it as it was plentiful. The staff were obliging enough and did put things right that were wrong...there was a small leak in the bathroom which did get sorted out immediately. There was no attractive area to sit if you wanted a break from sight seeing, there is a large hotel lounge but the hotel was very dark and dismal. The outside area was not very appealing either.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cCute hotel in a nice neighborhood on Lido island\u201d", "Author": "PDXTravelBoy", "ReviewID": "UR113887900", "Content": "A 15 minute walk to the Lido Island ferries to all points of Venice, Byron provides a pleasant base of operations in a nice neighborhood. Staff was helpful, and the simple, but generous, breakfast on the patio was nice in the mornings. We enjoyed the walk to the ferries, and you can even walk to the beach in 15 minutes in the other direction. With luggage, you might take the... C bus? which gets you 2/3 of the way to the hotel. Hop on, then buzz to jump off just 1 1/2 minutes later. If you overpacked, it helps. Then reorient with a map. (Take an online map print-out with you, the small island is confusing at first, then makes sense after 2 days.) If you aren't sure which bus to use, simply ask which buses continues in the direction in which they are pointed when you jump on at the port. Their ultimate destination and turns is irrelevant. Finally, take the time for an outstanding and well-priced dinner (after 7) near the beach at La Tavernetta, just across from the Excelsior hotel (also worth ducking into, as it is from the golden era and has that 30s charm.) From the street at the front door of the Excelsior, it is across and to the left, just next to a Tobacci store. A 20 minute walk from the Byron hotel, it is well worth it. Prices are high for all hotels in Venice during tourist season (May-Sept), so it's hard to rate this as a good value, at 120 euros or so, but was probably in the normal range for this quality.

It is basic but then a quick look around the internet before booking does hint at that. If the hotel is cheap, it rarely is a 5* luxury pad. The hotel is in a great location. Handy if you want the Beach on the Lido, and only a very short walk down the main street and you're at the Vaparetto stop. From there Venice as you know it is only a short boat ride away. The hotel is comfy and the staff proved most helpful throughout our visit. We stayed in a bog standard room but the bed and pillows were comfy, the shower was good, we were well stocked with toiletries, towles etc and the standard of cleaning was immaculate. We stayed 3 nights and each eve when we returned, the room had been cleaned thoroughly. Breakfast was basic but nice. There was plenty of food. It's exactly what was described in our holiday description... a cold buffet breakfast. Croissants, toast, yoghurt, bread, meat and cheese, cereal. The only drawback I found at this hotel was that the walls were quite thin so if you are a light sleeper, you may not be entirely happy. I enjoyed my stay at the Byron. If you go to Venice, most people don't spend hours in their room. You're there to explore, eat out and have fun. If you're there simply to eat breakfast and sleep, the Bryon is a reasonable place to do so.

We were taking a bit of a chance, considering this was our Honeymoon, and we were NOT pleased with this hotel. We checked in at 10:00 pm, and we called before hand to notify the hotel, and they said this was fine. When we arrived, the man at the desk never got off his mobile phone, did not speak English, made us walk around to his chair to get our print out and passports....it was not a warm welcome into italy. The room was small, and looked a bit dingy. Not at all like the photos on the website. Our booking said we had a garden view, however, we had a view of the parking lot and street dumpsters. Which were collected at 6 am every morning by loud garbage trucks with beeping noises when they reversed. The bed was actually 2 twin mattresses pushed together, but they were really comfy. The bed was soft, although the pillows were lumpy. We found spare pillows and blankets in the wardrobe though. The shower head was low, and the water was not very hot the first few days, then scorching the last day. There was a hairdryer, which was nice. The tv (a small 11 inch one) had 4 italian channels, so we didn't watch tv- which was fine, but if you like to enjoy night tv, stay somewhere with cable. The room had a fridge, but we couldn't get it to work until all of the sudden it was cold on the 3rd day. The hotel has a lift, but it doesn't go to the mezzanine levels, so we still had to walk up a flight a stairs (which is fine if you dont have tons of luggage). Just be aware that you may have to go up and down stairs a lot. The hotel advertised an American Bar- we went dowstairs to try this out, but there was nothing. Lights were off, no one was there, it was dead. there was NOTHING to do in the hotel. They had a few couches and played some music, so you could go sit there and talk to...well, no one really. it was dead. We went to a cafe down the street in the center of the island, they were great. But 2 beers and a diet coke was about 13 euros. yikes. Be prepared to spend! The day manager was really friendly and nice, and spoke great english. He was very helpful, as was the other day staff. I can see why the man working at nights is working at nights. You can get to the hotel from the waterbus stop very easily, and it's not a long walk. Maybe 10 minutes. It is close to the beach, and we LOVED staying on Lido island. Much quiter and nicer than Venice island. We would stay on Lido again, but not at this hotel. For the money, you are better off paying a bit more and staying somewhere nicer. The breakfast was pretty ok though, from 7:30-10:00 you can have coffee (espresso, capuccino, hot chocolate, americano) from a machine, croissants filled with apricot jam (the best) cream cheese pastry, apricot tart, cereals (chocolate crispies, corn flakes, meusli), yogurts, fruit, rolls (which were quite horrible- crusty and hard on the outside, barely edible, but you find them all over Italy! my husband is a baker, and he was horrified), and some plates of sliced ham, cheese, and salami- i think to make a breakfast sandwich with the rolls. they had orange juice and red grapefruit juice as well. It wasn't a bad breakfast and lasted us until lunch.", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoughton, MA", "Title": "\u201cAwful - Turned us away, and STILL charged us for 2 rooms\u201d", "Author": "DeekD", "ReviewID": "UR5650604", "Content": "Booked this through the terrible company (unfortunately in hindsight) .com- who still are not giving us our money back. Anyway, after two connecting flights, and two bus/shuttle rides AND a water taxi to the Hotel Byron (almost 20 hours or traveling), we arrived only to be told \"We have no reservations at all under your name\"- when I had printed confirmation papers in my hand. The desk clerk could have cared less, and we were forced to pay (almost DOUBLE our reserved online price) for one single room for one night's stay. The hotel had no openings for rooms beyond this, so we were forced to walk around the city the next day, dragging our luggage, in hopes of find a available and affordable hotel. To ad insult to injury, upon trying to get my money back from .com (the prebilled us), hotel byron has told them, \"oh no, we had their reservations, and they stayed those nights\", which is unbelievable. DISHONEST hotel- stay away. We ended up staying the last two nights at the ALBERGO GIARDINETTO VENEZIA which was GREAT! Not fancy, but not a dump, the staff was so good to us, and the continental breakfast was really decent too and had a decent variety.
