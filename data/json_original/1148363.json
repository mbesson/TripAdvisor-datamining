We chose this hotel since I was attending a conference at the Convention Centre which is attached to the hotel. The ride from the airport was about 30 minutes long on a weekday, mid-afternoon. Cost was about $25 USD. The staff were professional, hospitable and made you feel like you are a valued customer at all times. Check-in and Check-out was smooth and efficient. They gave us an \"older room with carpeting\" as the front desk clerk termed it. The room is still modern and clean albeit a little smaller than what we are used to by North American standards but was still acceptable. The bathroom amenities were good quality and the water pressure in the shower was fantastic! During conventions the elevators get really busy during peak hours 8-9am when everyone is comin/going to breakfast and getting to convention events. Wireless internet worked without a problem. I suggest signing up for a Marriot Rewards Card, we got free internet because we were members of their rewards program. We tried the lobby lounge for drinks and small bites to eat. The food was good and the price is comparable to other typical hotel dining options, in other words, a little bit on the high side. There is live entertainment in the evenings and the singer is quite good. The buffet breakfast was included in our room rate and the choices and variety are excellent. If you are paying for breakfast it is a little pricey, around $USD 35-40 I think. There are cheaper alternatives at the convention centre, a nice cafe and also a restaurant where you get chinese fare. The MRT and Ferry are easily accessed through covered walkways and about a 5 minute walk at a leisurely pace. The convention centre is about a 3 minute walk through air conditioned lobbies. HK's public transportation is superb and easy to navigate. We had no problem hopping over to the Kowloon side and depending on the time of day it cuts travel time down considerably as compared to taxi. Took about 15 minutes to get to Mong Kok area. I suggest if you are going to use the MRT for any amount of time to get the Octopus Card at the station. You can load up as much HK dollars as you want and can get any unused credit back when you leave. The card is also good at many convenience stores and restaurants, including some at the convention centre. The area directly around the hotel has numerous places to eat from McDonalds to more traditional fare. There are also numerous go-go bars sprinkled among the eateries with girls trying to entice you in for \"drinks\". Please don't let this deter you from walking around, it is quite safe even at night and no one will bother you if you are not interested. Shopping Mall is really not an option around the hotel, but a quick one-stop ride on the MRT to Causeway station will provide you with the shopping malls that you desire. There is a huge 3 storey electronics centre right by the walking way bridge to the MRT. Tonnes of everything electronic from laptops to cell phone accessories. I would recommend this hotel especially if you are in HK for any convention events. If you want a hotel with more to offer around it's immediate surrounding area than this may not be for you if you are hesitant to use the public transportation system.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIf its' in your budget, look no further\u201d", "Author": "Wajjin", "ReviewID": "UR139140914", "Content": "Stayed 5 days in room with harbour view.

However I have just stayed in one of their newly refurbished rooms (they have been renovating for ages, and are still renovating some areas) and their new design (while good in some things) has the worst designed bathroom I have ever seen (and I travel lots). I guess in an attempt to have a more spacious room, there is now no door between what is a combined entry hall/wardrobe and bathroom. Instead, there is a door separating this entry/bathroom from the bedroom. So you enter straight into a wide room which serves as entry hall, wardrobe, shelves, safe etc and bathroom. If there are two people in the room, this means that one can\u2019t enter, exit, or get to the wardrobe without walking in on a person in the shower on the toilet. If you are the sort who likes to lock the bathroom door (e.g. to keep small children out), you can\u2019t, I suppose because this would effectively lock them in the bedroom and so be a fire hazard. I stayed with my partner for a week, and we are fairly relaxed (ie I don\u2019t mind if he walks in on me in the shower, but not on the toilet and vice versa). But it was a real pain never being able to get in and out or get to clothes while giving them privacy e.g. if one of us was out, and you wanted to go the toilet, you have to latch them out of the room to stop them walking in on you. The door between the bathroom and bedroom also has large holes at the base, so there is little separation in the bathroom from the sounds and smells of the bathroom (which was not fun when I was sick all night and making repeated visits to the bathroom. This design might work for a sole occupant (or for what I imagine are the rare couples who don\u2019t mind their partner walking in on them on the toilet and in the shower). Even for singles, when my partner was out I found it off putting to have no door on the bathroom e.g. if you forget to latch the door and are in the shower, hotel staff could easily walk in on you, because you might not hear the bell. I can\u2019t believe that a hotel chain would have proceeded with such a stupid, stupid design, when they could easily have put a door between the entrance hall and the bathroom (as they used to have, and still have in the unrenovated rooms!). I suspect they will have to retrofit them when they realise that most couples will hate this design. Meanwhile, I would suggest couples avoid this hotel, or ask for an older style room with a door on the bathroom!

We got a harbor view room. Room was very small (I'd say less than half the size of the Venetian Macau which I also reviewed), but it was clean and modern. So if you have more than 2 kids, either get a larger room type, or stay elsewhere. The hotel is probably more catered for business people. From the hotel, upstairs, you can go thru the doors and head to the convention center tunnel, then just go towards the city center. You are now on the bridge and below you, there are many restaurants. There is a McDonald's right at the bridge on second floor. This is all within 5 minutes of walk from hotel. There are stairs or conveyors to do down to the streets, where all the restaurants and pubs are. I recall there were also girly bars on the same street. We took subway to Hong Kong Disney and Ocean Park. Subway is also very close. Take the same bridge towards city streets and go down from there (ask front desk). The subway to Disney was long. After several stops, you get out and walk for a while (inside a transit hall of some kind) then you get on the dedicated Disney subway. Its dedicated because the trains have Disney shaped windows and other things. I think it took about an hour. Ocean Park was much closer. After few stops, you get out and take the Ocean Park bus.

The hotel is in a handy position in Wan Chai with the Star Ferry wharf across the road, lots of cafes in the area and raised covered walkways between all the main roads and buildings, with the subway close by as well. We found the staff to be reasonably friendly and efficient, but not excessively so. Our harbourview room was on the 28th floor and was quite small with only a sideways view of the famous harbour, but with a nice modern d\u00e9cor and free WiFi to Marriott Rewards members . The room has a laminate wooden floor which is a little hard under foot after long days sightseeing. Also there was no bath for a decent soak \u2013 just a large, albeit very good shower. There is no bathroom door so to speak \u2013 you walk in from the outside corridor into a wardrobe area on one wall and the open bathroom on the opposite side, with a door between here and the bedroom. There is a glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom, but there are closable blinds. The bathroom is small but well fitted out, only negative being there isn\u2019t enough hanging space/rails. The room could actually do with more storage space and larger drawers. Another negative is the mattress - it was rock hard and by far the hardest mattress we\u2019ve ever slept on with no give at all. It did appear to have a mattress topper on it which made little difference. The windows were double glazed, but there was faint noise from outside, and the fridge in the room was quite noisy as well. We had room service breakfast one morning which was on time, but reasonably frugal with only teabags \u2013 no real tea. Another morning we had breakfast downstairs in Caf\u00e9 Renaissance and even though it has a reasonable choice of menu items, again there was no real tea \u2013 just teabags brought in a pot. The cafe has no windows and no atmosphere at all, whereas the lobby lounge is very nice. A third morning we had breakfast at a caf\u00e9 in the building opposite which was very enjoyable. The pool area of the hotel is very pleasant, with a decent size swimming pool and gardens around it. There is an outdoor restaurant and bar and it\u2019s a nice place to enjoy a cocktail. The hotel shares the grounds with the Grand Hyatt and they share facilities which are able to be charged back to your room.

I mentioned to him that I had just asked my fianc\u00e9 to marry me the night before and he wished us congratulations and gave us a free upgrade on our room. He took the time to ask about our plans in Hong Kong and provided excellent suggestions that we used. Probably the warmest welcome I have ever received at a hotel. Experiences with employees like this are what keep customers and encourage glowing reviews like this one. The women at the club level desk was also excellent! Friendly at all times, and helped us with several issues. She provided us with several power adapters for our laptops free of charge. She even worked the phones trying to hunt down a lost iphone for us. (Amazingly enough she was successful and found out it had been left on an airport shuttle bus!) I wish I had gotten her name so I could acknowledge her help but I missed it. The room! We were on the top floor (42nd) of the hotel, club level, and the view of the harbour was AMAZING. Huge full-length windows in both the bedroom and the adjoining suite. I highly recommend a harbour-view room, and if it is in your price range get a club level room. There are complimentary snacks, coffee, non alcoholic drinks as well as breakfast. The good: The hotel was at a good location next to the ferry dock. Easy to go across the harbour if you want. Also it is very close to the airport train. There is a free shuttle that services several hotels that runs all day (on the half hour I think but not sure exactly) It is a short shuttle ride. A cab from the hotel to the airport train cost us 20 HKD. The Not so good: Things were generally expensive here. This is a 5 star hotel (in Hong Kong no less) so cost may not be a concern for you, but 11$ (Canadian) for a fruit juice in the lobby bar is a little much..

The rooms were pretty small which I guess is typical for Hong Kong. We had two double beds and it was enough room for just the 2 of us. The room was done tastefully and in a more contemporary style. The one thing I did find odd was that a window overlooked the bedroom and the bathroom was not a separate room. Essentially, if you were taking a shower and someone came to the door the other person has to walk through the bathroom to get to the door, there is no wall separating the bathroom from the hallway. Your guest also has to walked through the bathroom to get through to the room. This layout is not practical or functional. The blinds also have to be closed on the window overlooking the bathroom. Otherwise, you have a lack of privacy. The way the bathroom was designed in my opinion does not offer much in the way of privacy. My other gripe about this hotel and the reason why I would not give it 5 stars is the hardness of the beds. For an US hotel chain, I expected the beds to be more soft and less firm especially when travelling overseas. This is part of the reason I booked this hotel knowing it is an American chain and typically the beds are much softer. I found that this was not the case for the Renaissance.

The check-in was efficient and luggage delivery to the room prompt. Room size was ok by Hong Kong standards and seemed to have been renovated recently. Incredible to see how well the room was designed to cramp in so much into a small space. The harbour view was so good, it induced me to order breakfast to the room rather than go down to the buffet spread; this is something I rarely do. I asked for a 2pm check out and this was taken care of without any fuss. The Wan Chai MTR is 7-8mins away by foot and can be accessed via a network of covered walkways. My only gripe was with the concierge service. They were noncomital when recomendations were asked and when we asked them to make reservations at Aqua and Ozone for the evening they reverted back saying both the places were full. A direct call to the both the bars exactly 2 mins later found us with a 10pm reservation at Aqua and a 11:30pm reservation at Ozone. When we asked for a cab later to head to the bars, we were informed of a min of 1hr waiting as they had a queue outside the hotel due to bad weather. They had no cabs on call and could not suggest a phone number to call either. The hotel limo was priced at 800HKD per hour and would also take an hour to come. We had to walk a short distance and hail our own cab; this wasn't a big issue but added to the issues we had with the concierge \"navigator, as they call it\" service.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cStunning views when the rain permitted!\u201d", "Author": "Himself_again", "ReviewID": "UR129437135", "Content": "Based on some of the previous reviews, we contacted the hotel in advance of our trip and requested a renovated room on a high floor, ideally with a harbour view.

The pool - on our one sunny day, we ventured to the pool and it was full! i.e. not a lot of available sunbeds. Couple of other observations If you get the chance, take a day trip to Macau - great fun!!! we saw an advert on the boat and on the back of this went to see a show at the Hyatt called the House of Dancing Water - most excellent! Went to see the Big Buddha on Lantau Island - fantastic experience made even better with the cable car ride to get there! make sure that its a clear day before you set out to enjoy the views Took a cab to Aberdeen Harbour and enjoyed a Sampan trip piloted by a gentleman who must have been at least 100 years old :-) from there to the Peak where on a clear day, we imagined that it would have been impressive (it wasn't). Cabs are excellent value for money as is the transportation in the city as a whole We ate at the Domani as it was well rated and were not disappointed, it really is worth a visit.

The room options were two single beds or one king sized bed. We were given a rollaway bed for one of the kids, but the other was in the bed with us. With the rollaway bed in the room, it was very cramped and not really enough room to walk around. The king bed was hard as a rock, very uncomfortable to sleep in. The breakfast buffet was really expensive and not really worth what we paid, at least not for the children. They were only a few US dollars off the price of an adult buffet, so I ended up paying a fortune for my four year old to eat two muffins and a glass of juice. Another problem with kids is there is not bathtub in the room, only a shower. My little ones refuse showers so they went dirty while we were there. One nice amenity for families, though, is a playground and a pretty decent swimming pool. We used the playground one morning and my kids loved it. The rooms have million dollar views, and I really enjoyed watching the activity in the harbour from our room.

I did like the new and modern design but i do have to agree that rooms seem to be on a smaller side: it is perfect for one, but might be an issue for two people sharing.

They did warn me that it might be noisy because of renovation, but i did not hear any noise or even noticed that renivation was ongoing somewhere in the hotel. I had my breakfast in the executive lounge and the food there was plentiful and delicious. It does get a bit crowdy there during the weekend, but o wordk days it is perfectly relaxed and quiet. I also went there for evening cocktails and both the food and drinks were perfect. My only complain is the gym and it is really the only reason I will not be staying at this hotel again. This hotel shares it with Hyatt hotel next door, so it is around 5minutes walk to get there which can be a pain if it rains. Also the gym is extremely tiny, has outdated equipment and unbearably hot (the air conditioning seems to be entirely misssing). It is simply too small for two such big hotels.

On the advise of a knowledgable colleague I always ask for a renovated room - the hotel is undergoing some refurbishing so they say it can be noisy during the day, but I don't know as i am out for business - and they are quite nice. Comparable to say a Westin or a Sheraton - standard, pleasing lighting, furniture, large flat TV, large shower area (no tub, but I don't care for those) etc. I do not do the buffet breakfast so no comments, and the room service menu is reasonably diverse. Room service is always quick and the service pleasant, also at the front desk. All in all it could be a great, standard business hotel. The two main drawbacks for me are: 1. Location - it is not so much the distance - most commercial buildings and areas are a 10-minute cab ride away - as that it being near the convention center, does not offer the usual HK possibilities of walking down a street full of eateries, bars, shops or even a convenient mall or a 7-eleven if you want to pick up something. You are really out in a little island within the island. 2. Gym - the hotel does not technically have one. You can walk over to an adjacent building in the complex by traversing the roof connecting the two - a 7-8 minute walk - to a private, members only club which lets hotel guests use its facilities. The issue is that this haughty club refused to let me in without my shoes. I do not pack shoes as i do not engage in activities that need them, and not only has this never stopped me, in some hotels I get shoes with fresh insoles. Of course this is a club and entitled to its snobbish rules, but the issue would not exist if the hotel had its own fitness center. #2 could potentially be solved and that would bump it up to a 4, but #1 is what it is, so I doubt I could ever review it higher than this.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aldeburgh, England", "Title": "\u201cStill efficient\u201d", "Author": "tommillerjones", "ReviewID": "UR124282926", "Content": "Last visit 12 months ago - little has changed, even refurbishment continues with some disturbance during the day - good situation, everything works, good shower - same noisy lobby.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cLocation, service, and best shrimp dim sum ever.\u201d", "Author": "ecrescia", "ReviewID": "UR124203821", "Content": "This hotel is everything you expect from a 5 star hotel and more.

The most wonderful aspect of the hotel is the staff. They are efficient, professional, gracious, warm and friendly, making you feel truly welcomed and truly sorry to leave. Also wonderful is the location. It\u2019s located directly adjacent to the Convention Center, with the Wan Chai MTR station about a 10-minute walk, using the system of footbridges that surround the area. There is also a large bus station across the street, as well as the Wan Chai Star Ferry. And the view is spectacular \u2013 if you can, spring for a high floor overlooking the harbor. We are lucky enough to currently have a high status within the Marriott Points system. Therefore, we have access to the Concierge Level. I must say that the Renaissance\u2019s facility is absolutely the best we\u2019ve ever experienced, including at some of the best Marriotts in Europe and Asia. The staff is friendly, well trained and exceptionally gracious. The breakfast buffet at the caf\u00e9 is exceptional (around $25 USD). It has a wide variety of both western and Chinese choices. Special kudos to the manager, Wilson, who makes you feel welcomed and well-served. The front desk, concierge, and bell desk is staffed with extremely nice and knowledgeable staff. One employee, Jeffery, constantly went the \u201cextra mile\u201d to be of service. Now for what\u2019s not so great about this exceptional hotel. First, is the health club. It is located in an adjacent hotel, an annoying distance from the Renaissance. I am not even a very good club \u2013 only adequate. The walk is pleasant, across a beautifully landscaped pool and recreation area that includes a large playground for the youngsters, as well as tennis courts. However, the Renaissance is primarily a business hotel, and many business professionals have high expectations regarding fitness centers. Another weak element - the rooms. Some of the rooms are redone, some not. The older rooms are very poorly organized and the beds like rocks (typical Chinese, by the way). The redone rooms are a bit better, but are small and still poorly organized with hard beds (but not as hard). They are happy to put inserts on mattresses, which helps. The rooms also provide very little privacy, with a glass wall separating the bedroom from the bathroom. The most serious problem \u2013 and one with no solution \u2013 is that the room walls are extremely thin. When a phone rings next door, it sounds like it\u2019s in your room. And even normal conversations carry right through the wall \u2013 try a few partying people next to you, especially around 1 AM or so \u2013 not pleasant. Except for this one major problem, the Renaissance was a fabulous experience.

We had only planned on staying 3 nights but loved it so much we stayed for 5 and would have stayed longer but we had flights onward. Our corner suite was spacious and there were two sparkling clean bathrooms. We couldn't wait to use the showers and thought we had died and gone to heaven. Hong Kong is everything Nepal was not and the attention to detail and customer service everywhere we went was soul soothing. There was a refrigerator, coffee machine and green tea for the making. it was great tea. The concierge lounge was as good as an all-inclusive restaurant. Breakfast and appetizers were served daily and they were the tastiest I have ever had. There was so much variety and the staff there were so gracious and accomodating. They all worked very closely as a team and tried very hard to become familiar with your likes and dislikes. This is by far the best concierge lounge I've encountered in my travels. As far as location, this was perfect for us. We were able to get our laundry done just a few blocks from the hotel. It was such a good deal and back to us in a few hours. The subway was within walking distance and we took advantage of it and went everywhere. Initially we took a taxi to the hotel from the airport but to be honest the airport express was so easy to use we kicked ourselves for not using it initially. Don't be initimidated as we were. The taxi cost 40 dollars and for us it was good value after a long night flight. We travelled from the airport during commuting hours and it didn't take us more than 50 minutes so it was a great option. I am trying to find a way to get back here. Loved Hong Kong and the people. I'm not a shopper but it was so fun walking through.

Nice wooden floors mean no more worn-out and dirty carpets. Spectacular views over Hongkong harbour but be aware not all rooms have a harbour view. The club facilities are rather good, very large selections of foods and the usual modest selection of drinkable wines. Lounge staff are wonderfully good humored and jovially helpful - just the way we like it. The woman who seems to run the show up there deserves special mention. The hotel is adjacent to the convention center and it very much feels like a huge, totally anonymous convention hotels. Location is very convenient if you plan to go to Kowloon often or use the efficient MRT system. The famous star ferry to Kowloon is just a three minute stroll away and the MRT is literally underneath the building complex.

When I was looking for a hotel in HK firstly I looked for the Tsim Sha Tsui area but, being that I was going to leave on December 30th, most of the hotels on rhe harbour in that area seemed to be already booked or too expensive. Once arrived there, I discovered that the New Remaissance has a very good position because is far from the crowd of Tsim Sha Tsui but very well connected with it through the ferry which is just beside the hotel (it takes 10 minutes to cross the harbour and it is a pleasant way to move); it is also very well connected with the rest of the town because the Wan Chai MTR station (the subway) is just a 5 minutes walking distance. You can choose to use the covered passages which pass over the roads or walk in the area, which is really not as bad as I thought! Everything considered, if you'd like to visit the town it is probably better to stay on this part of the harbour because many attractions are on this side and you can also take a ferry from central (just 2 MTR stops away from Wan chai) to go to Macao or to the other Hong Kong islands. The rooms of the hotels are very good (do not expect very large rooms because every room in HK is quite small, but that considered at the Renaissace you have quite space). I would recommend to spend a little more and ask for an harbour view room, it's great to see the harbour from the ceiling-to-floor window! The room style is essential but provides everything you need, and everything is new and clean.

If it is not booked as part of your deal, the buffet is quite expensive so make sure it is included, but then again, what is on offer is everything you can imagine. Various different buffets of different types of foods from all over the world. You can have Sushi, Dim sum, cooked and fried eggs as per your wishes, european breakfast with various meats and cheeses as well as a huge selection of cereals and fruits and yoghurts. Again, and unfortunately, there is a limit as to how much someone can eat in the morning!! Definitely not to be missed though! Location wise, the hotel is in Wan Chai and located conveniently right next to the Convention Centre. Also equal distance to Central (IFC) as well as Timesquare/Causeway bay in the other direction. Queues for taxis at the hotel can sometimes be long, especially around 7pm. The gym is situation a short stroll across the hotel outdoor area and has got everything you need. The outdoor pool is great also. I tried the restaurant only once, and it was as good as expected. Also room service is great, the only downside may be the hotel singer in the lobby in the evenings,... now I know what they mean if they say to someone that thinks is a good singer will only end up in a hotel bar... thats where they end up here!

We also took advantage of the executive level facilities and it is worth the extra to have this option. The breakfasts every morning were wonderful, and numerous choices of both hot and cold food,pastries and fruit. The evenings snacks were more like mini dinners, so much so, we rarely ate dinners out. This suited us because as mentioned, Hong Kong can be horribly expensive, and anything that is half way decent costs a lot. The location of the hotel was fantastic because you have the ferry to Kowloon directly opposite and it makes getting across so quick and easy. We took taxis to most other places, easy to get and the one thing that was quite inexpensive. Also took in tea and scones one afternoon at the famous Peninsula Hotel. I think it is bit of a tourist trap but worth a one time experience. In Kowloon you will be bombarded with tailors in the street offering you suits in a day.

The hotel in general is everything you would expect from the mid-high tier of Marriott.

The hotel shares a swimming pool and a garden (including a small playground for children) with the nearby Grand Hyatt. The club level rooms are located in the top floors (39-41) and the club lounge with its harbor panoramic view is located in floors 40-41. The club lounge provides all the expected services and dining options. The staff is professional and welcoming. Overall the hotel is a nice mid-high 5 star with good location and good service. The Club level Harbour View room (described in the hotels site as: Harbour View, Guest room, 1 Queen or 2 Twin/Single Bed(s), Harbour view, Harbor view 28sqm/301sqft) UPSIDE: seem to be a perfect choice for a single business traveler. My 1 queen room was well designed and newly refurbished, clean and well equipped (kettle, selection of teabags, electrical adapter, bathrobe, slippers etc.). The bed was comfortable and there was a nice working desk. The bathroom and the room share a glass wall. Harbor view is very nice.

There is a separate bedroom with a king bed and a spacious bathroom with both a walk-in shower and a bath. There is spectacular panoramic view from this half corner room. DOWNSIDE: Unlike most of the rooms in this hotel that were newly renovated, the suits are still with their original d\u00e9cor with old, somewhat worn out interior. It has an 80\u2019s internal design with very old living room set, old curtains and carpet and old green marble bathroom.

We were placed on the 31 floor during the first stay and the bed was very hard for us. The house keeping staff tried their best in making it comfortable for us by piling on mattress pad after mattress pad; I think we stopped at 3 extra mattress pads. :) Our house keeping person, CoCo (very nice lady), gave us a tip that rooms above 33rd floor have softer beds and got a manager to show us up there. They even noted our account and put us on the 36th floor during our 2nd stay. Fantastic follow through! We were upgraded to the harbour view room for both stays since I am a Marriott Gold and what a view! The staff at the club lounge are super attentive. One tip for folks with status -- you can request to have your breakfast at the Cafe (buffet) for free. Since we were there for 9 nights (10 breakfasts), while the lounge breakfast was good it got a little old, so the Cafe was definitely a welcome change. Just ask the lounge staff, they will hook you up! The location of the hotel is great. Not as good as if we were in Central in terms of shopping but you have easy access to buses, taxis and subway. My only complaint is the cost of laundry is a bit high since it was a leisure trip and on our own dime on this trip -- ~$3USD for a pair of underwear and/or socks. However, if you don't mind a 5 mins walk, there is a laundromat near the corner of Lockhart and Flemings that washed, dried and folded 11lbs of laundry for around $7.5USD.

Otherwise, I would rather choose Causeway Bay or Central. Even though it is located about 10 min from the Wanchai MTR (with sheltered connection directly from hotel to the station - via 2 buildings & an overhead bridge), the \"walking routes\" are always to jam packed with people, particularly when there are functions at the HK Convention Centre (which I presumed is All Year Long). So, I found the walks between the MTR station and hotel rather uncomfortable. As for the hotel itself, it was recently refurbished to a high standard and the room I was assigned to was very well re-furbished (i.e. practical, clean and beautiful). I had one of those \"middle corner\" rooms, which was quite small but due to its layout, almost 70% of the room was covered with floor to ceiling window, thus providing a spectacular harbour view. However, the room is designed for single traveller or couples: - my bed was supposed to be a king size bed but it looked way too small to be one - as the room was rather small, it would be difficult to fit in two mid-size luggages (I had only 1 luggage, so it wasn't a problem at all for me) - the shower room (sorry, NO BATHTUB) had glass window (i.e. no privacy). Service:- Impeccable. It was amazing how every housekeeping staff we met on our floor seem to know our names and which room we were from. I have not idea how they managed to accomplish this as this is a fairly large hotel. Food:- Good. We ate at the breakfast restaurant & the Chinese Restaurant. They were both very good. The reason I gave this a hotel a 3 star rating (even though it is difficult to find faults with this hotel) instead of a 4 or 5 because I was there for a shopping trip and I hated the long and crowded walks to the station. I would have preferred a hotel nearer to the MTR station.

First impression was that the room was smallish and a bit lacking in storage space albeit very modern bright and very well equipped. Could be a bit tight if you travel with a lot of luggage. This is the only minor criticism we would have and it would not prevent us from returning. Liked the pool and pool area, although changing facilities could be improved. Renovation in the Hotel was ongoing in the upper floors and we were warned about this but it did not disturb us as the work was limited to 0930 onwards. Would definately recommend this Hotel and would consider returning ourselves. For Trips and things to do, China Day trip just across the border was a highlight. Shopping was great but remember to haggle extra hard. Go toTemple street Market first to gauge prices and use that for a benchmark. China should be cheaper but the business is so good with so many customers some traders can afford to hold their prices.Try a less busy trader and you may have better luck. Also went to Lamma island by Ferry, with some good Seafood Restaurants and a pleasant walk across the island. As regards Markets, we went to Temple Street Night Market and the Ladies Market (daytime), latter was possibly better. Also visited the Flower market on the last day and picked up a bargain selection of cut Orchids for only HK$60 which we took back to the UK !", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat view and super location.\u201d", "Author": "TravelingAllCreation", "ReviewID": "UR115230979", "Content": "Plusses and minuses include the following: Positives: * Really fantastic views of the harbor, which is great during the day and even better in the evening. * Rooms are very comfortable and spacious. * Restaurant had very good food, and a good default option if you cannot get into the city one evening. * Staff was very helpful and professional. * Although expensive, was actually very good value based on location, quality and the superb views.

In Hong Kong, ensure you explore the following before leaving: * Take ferry across the harbor and have lunch on the other island. * Get to to the top of Victoria Peak. Great photo oppotunities. * Take the cable car to the Big Buddha. Go early so you can have the car to yourself, as it will allow you to have flexibility to take photos from all angles. The views are awesome, so you will want to take many photos going up and down. * Rent a car or a cab and go around the island (plan about 3-4 hours with stops) to take lots of great photos and get a sense for the entire island and not just the downtown district, which is great itself. Places to stop for photos around the island include Aberdeen, Deep Water Bay, Stanley Bay, and the Stanley market (good place for lunch).", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful find in Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "dkracerfl", "ReviewID": "UR114966718", "Content": "Stayed in a newly restored room.

Second, you can go to Central and Causway Bay by taxi with not substantially more than base rate (i.e. about 20 HKD).

I also like the mix of guests, the lobby are, the live music there, the OUTSTANDING dim sum restaurant in the hotel. Don't mis it! The rooms are average I would say, consistent quality but nothing special from the interior. Go for the more epensive Harbour View rooms, the view to the bay and fancy illuminated Kowloon side is BREATHTAKING. It is worth. Another recommendation is to ask for the rooms located in the corners of the building - those rooms have huge window facades with panoramic view and seem to be a little bit bigger. AFAIK the pool landscape (which is shared with the neighbour hotel) is the LARGEST in HK. As HK is a busy and exhausting place, this is a excellent refugium on the 11th floor to relief from stress. Whenever I am in HK, I plan time to relax there. The pool is great, lovely shaped, the deckchairs have cozy frottee covered matresses and the staff serves drinks and food. Try one of the fresh juices, e.g. with lime, ginger, mint... The hotel has no spa, therfore you need to go to the neighbour hotel, the staff will arrange for you.

What an outstanding hotel!! We had a renovated garden view room on the 15th floor overlooking the pool, playground, tennis courts and park. You can also see part of the harbour from the room. Although we did not have the harbour view, the view we had was very pleasant. The room itself was truly 5-star - brand new, posh, elegant, luxurious and very comfortable. Housekeeping informed us we got the largest room on the 15th floor. We put an extra bed in the room and there was still plenty of space to walk around in. The beds were the usual Marriott ones, which means they were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was all marble and had a huge shower cubicle with a rainfall shower. There was no tub, however. The LCD TV had a ton of English channels on it. Location wise, this place is hard to beat. Across the road is the pier for the Star Ferry for going over to Kowloon. The MTR station is 5 minutes walk by covered walkway and this will take you to most of the attractions in HK. Taxis will come right up to the hotel and this is also a cheap and quick way to get to nearby tourist spots. If you walk for a couple of minutes into the Wan Chai area, there are tons of restaurants there to choose from so no need to pay astronomical hotel prices for food. I found the Renaissance Harbour View to be a wonderful family hotel, good for taking care of kids when you're not going out. This is because of (i) the absolutely large free-form pool that the hotel has (must be one of the largest of any hotel in HK), the enormous playground with so many different kinds of play equipment and (iii) Cartoon Network Asia on TV to keep the kids occupied. My kids really loved the playground, the size of which I have never seen in any hotel that I've stayed in around the world. All three of the above mentioned features really helped to keep the kids busy and excited. Perhaps the only drawback, and this is certainly being very picky, is that the hotel is large (over 800 rooms) and therefore you cannot expect the staff to remember your name. Nevertheless, the staff are always happy to serve you when the need arises. The size of the hotel did not bother me at all and all the great facilities helped to make up for the lack of a personal touch. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who is going to HK.

It was on the 19th floor which sounded high enough but the convention center still obscured some of the harbor view although there was still lots to see. Next time I'd try for a higher floor. The Star Ferry dock is right across the street. To see the light show it's necessary to go across to Kowloon. I went over early one evening and had tea at the Peninsula which is a must do when in Hong Kong. Then I found a place on the prominade on the harbor to watch the show along with lots of other tourists. I actually wasn't wowed by the light show. I'd heard so much about it I expected more but it was fun and only lasted about 15 minutes or so. Just seeing that part of Kowloon and being part of the crowd made it worthwhile. The room was large and pleasant. It had floor to ceiling windows but had curtains that could be shut to completely darken the room. I usually left the curtains open so I could see the lights of the Kowloon buildings across the way. The bed was firm but comfortable, not rock hard as in many Chinese hotels. The office area had sufficient lighting and good work space. The bathroom was updated with lots of nice amenities. After three weeks of Chinese food I had a pizza in the lounge a couple times. It wasn't the best I've had but it was okay. The lounge singers were also not the best but okay. The lounge itself was attractive and the staff was efficient. The various concierges I worked with over three days were very helpful and gave me good information. As in many Chinese hotels they wrote my destination in Chinese characters on a hotel card so I could show it to the taxi driver. The card also had commonly visited tourist sites listed so if I was out I could still pick up a taxi and have the destination I wanted written in Chinese. More taxi drivers in Hong Kong spoke some English than anywhere else I'd been in China, including Beijing, but having the card was helpful to ensure I ended up in the right location. Unlike in Beijing, all the taxis I rode in used honest meters and the drivers were pleasant and welcoming. The hotel was connected to other parts of the downtown businesses, shops, subway and restaurants by a covered walkway. I followed the concierge's easy directions to find the nearby subway station. The subway is very clean, safe and efficient with lots of good signage. As a single traveler who doesn't use subways very often I found it easy to use.

The Star Ferry is across the street from the hotel. Taking the ferry to Kowloon is much cheaper than a taxi. There's also restaurants, bars, and stores that are connected via walkways to the hotel. Sometimes I just wanted to relax and get a bite close by and do a little shopping at the nearby shops. For big shopping, Kowloon is definitely the best. The hotel also has a desk in the lobby area that you can look-up daily tours to the various Hong Kong island, mainland China, and Macau, which I really liked. I like to sign up for tours as I go. The Hotel is also attached to the Hong Kong Convention Center, but unless you're part of the convention there was no reason to really go there. As far as rooms, they're a decent size, a bit smaller than Marriott rooms in the US, but still nice considering the limited space in Hong Kong. The gym is located in the Hyatt hotel next door, which is connected via walkways (a bit of a walk to get there). But the gym facilities were great. I didn't use the gym during my first stay at the hotel but I made a point to use it daily during my second stay to balance out the great food I was eating in Hong Kong.

This room is also bigger and looks newer. I've also stayed in a Garden View room (read: no view, only of the buildings facing the hotel) and Partial Harbour View rooms (you'll see part of the harbour but not much of the skyline). These rooms are smaller but still comfortable. There's enough space for your suitcase and to walk around in.

The rooms and bathrooms are clean but definitely showing their age. Beds are king size and comfy to sleep on, pillows are super soft but they do provide foam pillows on request. Location-wise, it's about an easy 5 minute walk to the Wan Chai MTR on an overpass. I found it pretty convenient and safe. The hotel is located between Causeway Bay and Central which met all my needs - all I did was eat and shop and there are plenty of places to do that in these areas. For convenience I would recommend visitors to HK buy an Octopus card which can be used on the trains, ferries, trams and buses. Saves you from queueing up to buy a single trip ticket every time! The Star Ferry terminal is across from the hotel and you can take a ferry across to Kowloon. I would also recommend a bus ride up to The Peak which is a relaxing and fun way to see some of the quieter parts of HK. Only costs HK$9.60. This hotel has a corporate feel and I would classify it as a business hotel. If you can find a cheap rate, it is a perfectly acceptable hotel to stay in for leisure.

This hotel also hosts crews from several European airlines. This hotels\u2019 single biggest asset is its\u2019 location... It\u2019s about a seven (7) minute walk or less to the Wan Chai Pier where you can board the famous Star Ferry. From the Wan Chai pier you can reach either the Tsim Sha Tsui pier or the Hung Hom pier- both on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong. Located just in from of the hotel, directly on the waterfront, is the Hong Kong Convention and Expo Center. For longer distances there is several private bus lines that operate from a nearby terminal. You can also access the city-wide subway system, MTR, from the nearby Wan Chai station on the Island Line. You can make connection from the Island line to either the Tsuen Wan or Tsuen Kawn O lines. The Airport Express train starts at the Hong Kong station, about a 10 minute or less taxi ride from the hotel. The Hong Kong station has airline check-in counters for most airlines. Passengers with confirmed airline tickets can check-in, deposit baggage and receive boarding passes from their respective carriers- all before boarding the airport express train. Lobby / Check-in: This is a busy hotel and you\u2019ll notice that upon entering. The check-in area is on the second floor- a short escalator ride up. There are multiple desks and a few desks reserved exclusively for Marriott (the parent company of Renaissance Hotels) Rewards elite members. The lobby itself is rather small and quite busy, but still very well designed and efficient. On the opposite side of the check-in level is a waiting lounge and bar. As normal, since our rooms are pre-paid and pre-assigned, our check-in consists only of room key card distribution. Room: My room was on the 25th floor and faced the water, which meant EXCELLENT views of the Harbor and Kowloon Island. The room itself looked a bit on the small side of average, but didn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d small. Everything was well laid out to maximize space. It was equipped with a small writing desk, with multi-power and phone line ports. Wi-fi is available with charge, hotel-wide. The TV was an older tube-style with local and international multi-language programming. My bed was an American-sized Queen and was of moderate firmness- a nice surprise as Asian beds tend to run substantially on the firm side of the spectrum. The bed was topped with a faux-feather duvet and multiple (foam) pillows. The room is quite bright as the windows are nearly floor to ceiling and given the absolutely stunning views- this is a *huge* plus. The drapes are not \u201cblack out\u201d so if you\u2019re sensitive to light when sleeping, you may have difficulties during post-sunrise hours. The windows are tinted and very well sound insulated. Additional room amenities included a stocked mini-bar (at typical high hotel rates) and a stocked complimentary coffee/tea/hot water serviette. In the closet was a mini-ironing board and attached iron. I found myself lying in bed relaxing and just watching the harbor traffic go floating by. Bathroom: Like the bedroom, the bathroom was noticeable smaller than other hotels in the same class, but very function in all aspects. It has a stand-up shower with very hot water and excellent water pressure. A decent selection of Marriott-branded pre and post bath toiletries are provided for daily use. There was a wall mounted hair dryer. Everything in my room was clean and in functional order. I didn\u2019t notice any obvious signs of excessive \u2018wear and tear\u2019. Hotel facilities and Amenities: The hotel has one lounge located on the lobby level that serves light food and drink. There are also three sit-down restaurants; one Chinese and one Italian venue- both open for lunch and dinner only. The caf\u00e9 which offers \u201cinternational\u201d cuisine is open for all three sittings. Of course, a full menu of in-room dining (room service) options is available 24 hrs- at typically high prices. While the hotel has a decent selection of dining alternatives, given the fact that Hong Kong is one of the best cities *in the world* for food aficionados , I\u2019d highly suggest that you explore the surrounding areas as there is a great many excellent and reasonably priced options nearby. The hotel has a nice outdoor seasonally heated pool, located on the top of the main lobby building. The pool area includes attached hot tubs and numerous sun chairs and sitting areas. You can order light food and drink poolside. The hotel also has a rather basic gym (not 24/7) with a fair selection of exercise equipment and free weights. Personal training is available at extra charge and with prior appointment. The business center offers most all services you would need like copy/fax/printing/translation/computer use and rental- at posted rates. They will also arrange for pick-up and acceptance of your UPS, DHL and FedEx packages upon request. The hotel can also arrange for things like non-emergency medical attention, child care and onward travel arrangements- upon request with the Front Desk staff. There is also a by-invitation-only lounge, with great views of the harbor and free light refreshments. It is for use by Marriott top tier members and guests staying in higher level rooms. SUMMARY: PROS: 1) Location- you\u2019re in the middle of it all and have excellent local transportation options- within walking or short taxi ride- to further explore the surrounding areas. 2) Views from guest rooms- you\u2019ll have some of the best views of Victoria Harbor.

Location next to the convention center makes this a primarily business hotel, but we chose this hotel for holiday/leisure travel because they had a promo rate and the location is ideal for shopping, with Causeway Bay just one MTR stop away and Tsim Sha Tsui just across the harbor via Star Ferry. Accommodation is very nice, and the views facing the harbor are really good. Our group occupied two rooms and one of the rooms had a slight tobacco smell, although we were supposed to be in nonsmoking rooms. The smell can only be detected when first entering the room, after which we either get used to it after a few seconds or the smell dissipates after one opens the door. This is a primarily business hotel, and the front desk act like they're businessmen! I got a promotional rate and it was really good value. I booked garden view rooms only though. However, while checking in, the hotel staff was trying to convince me to upgrade our rooms to a suite telling me they also have a promo and it's a really good deal with free breakfast and nice harbor views. But the rates of the suite she wants us to get was HK$1,000 (about US$130) more per room per night! I insisted on the original booking and they upgraded us to a renovated room with a harbor view. Perhaps the hotel probably overbooked the cheaper rooms, that's why there's this sales pitch! But the most unexpected experience I had with this hotel is when we checked out. When I got my credit card charge slip, the cashier told me \"we charge in Hong Kong dollars.\" And said briefly, \"this is the equivalent amount in your base currency.\" So I proceeded to sign the slip. After reviewing the slip again, I noticed the note in the slip that says I had been given a choice of currencies for payment (which in this case I wasn't) and that currency conversion is not provided by VISA. I inquired why this is so. It turns out that the first cashier charged me in US$ using the hotel exchange rate of US$1=HK$7.49, while it usually is around US$1=HK$7.7 in most places. Not only did the first cashier not notify me regarding the exchange rate but he gave me the wrong impression that they charged in HK$! Another cashier reversed the charge and gave me another slip with just the HK$ amount without the US$ note. Good thing I noticed this and this was taken care of. The hotel would've charged us around US$20.00 more due to the exchange rate. I just wasn't very happy with this incident that something like this could happen in a reputable chain like the Marriott. This is what is written in their credit card charge slip. It does create the impression that one is really paying in HK$ which is not the case. The USD amount is not that prominent and the rate is written in HK$1 = US$0.1335 instead of the more usual US$1 = HK$7.49.

It was definitely nice to have a familiar feeling hotel to come back to at the end of the day. The Renaissance Harbor View is on Hong Kong Island overlooking Victoria Harbor and Kowloon (the part of Hong Kong that's actually attached to mainland China). The staff there was wonderful, and gave us a great (upgraded) room with a view of the harbor. Even bigger surprise was the fact that the room was on the corner of the building on the 30th floor -- so not only did we get to see the Kowloon skyline across the harbor, we could see a portion of the skyline on Hong Kong Island as well. Each of the skyscrapers seemed to outdo the one before --- views were breathtaking day or night. I don't think we closed the drapes the entire time! Rooms Beds were decently comfy (although a little hard) and the temp was easy to control in the room. Room had 2 standard sized twin beds. Bottled water and fresh fruit were provided in the room. Bathrooms were really nice \u2013 marble \u2013 with separate tub and shower. The junior suite also had a separate \u00bd bath in the living area which made getting ready in the morning go a little quicker. Slippers, robes, safes, hair dryers and ironing boards were provided in the room. In room coffee was ok, although like much of Asia it was instant. 2-3 kinds of tea were also available. Concierge Lounge We were given access to the Executive Lounge on the 40th Floor. Staff service there was wonderful, regardless of time of day. There were coffee, tea, sodas and water available from 6am to midnight. Daily continental breakfast was available M-F from 6-10am and 6-11 on weekends and holidays. In addition to breads, cereals and fruits, there were a couple of hot options available each day including boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was really good! Afternoon tea was available from 3-5. Complementary cocktails and hors d\u2019oeuvres were served from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. In some hotels, the evening snacks could serve as a substitute for dinner --- this was not one of those places. Options were good, but fairly light. Each night carried a different theme, but generally, the hot items gave you the option to try fairly local dishes. Alcohol was available at other times, but was billed to the room, Free Wi-Fi, as well as a computer that you could use were also available in the lounge, The staff there was also able to take care of our checkout. The lounge was fairly quiet regardless of time of day and had great sunset views. Lobby Bar On our first night, we needed a light meal despite the fact that it was fairly late. We stopped in at the lobby bar. They had a selection of appetizers to choose from. Food was excellent, and reasonable considering the hotel / location. Each night, there is live music in the lounge. It\u2019s a great place to watch people and relax after a long day. Transportation From the hotel, you can access the Wan Chai MTR station by covered walkways which is really nice when traffic is heavy or when it\u2019s raining. It\u2019s also a short <5 min walk to the Wan Chai pier for the Star Ferry. What turned out to be the best tip I found on TA was using the Airport Express Tourist Card. There is a counter as you exit baggage claim in the airport where you can purchase the cards using cash or credit card. For $300HK / person, you get a roundtrip ticket on the Airport Express train, shuttle service from the main stations to several of the big hotels in Kowloon and on HK Island, ability to use in-town check-in (more on that later) and 3 days of unlimited MTR (subway) usage. The airport train is very clean, leaves frequently (every 12 min) and is accessed right from the terminal. The trip is about 25 minutes to HK station. If you take the Airport Express in from the Airport, the H1 Shuttle bus provided by airport express will take you directly to the Renaissance. The shuttle runs on a schedule about every 20 minutes and will get you back to the Airport Express Train when you leave as well. Note \u2013 you will need your Oyster card pass to enter and exit most stations. $50HK of the ticket is refundable if you return the card when you leave. http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/airport_express/aepass_index.html Area There are lots of little restaurants, pubs, 7-11, drugstores, bookstores, etc. within walking distance. You should be able to find what you want fairly easily without paying hotel prices. A walk around the convention center in front of the hotel offers some great views of the city / waterfront and felt safe \u2013 even at night. Service Overall, service was top notch. Everyone you saw spoke to you and was very friendly. We were always greeted with a smile. English was common in the hotel. Housekeeping was great, and kept us stocked with bottled water and fresh fruit. Room was serviced twice a day. We were walked to our room by someone at the front desk when we checked in. Pool There is a really nice pool area between the Renaissance and the Hyatt next door. However, might be a little noisy during the day due to some construction going on around the convention center. Hotel was a great choice. Marriott property was a little more in the financial district, but not on the waterfront. The new Courtyard property is a little closer to the waterfront --- but a little farther from things. The Renaissance was a great choice based on location, view and ease of getting around.

The tram fair is a 2HK dollar coin exact (about 20p) Two other great areas here are Lan Kwai Fong and SoHo great bars and restaurants just take time to enjoy the vibe. About two minutes from the hotel is the star ferry to Kowloon this costs 2.20HKD (22p) each way, the ferries are quick and frequent.

I would definitely recommend visiting Stanley market and there are some bargain to be had!

I booked the four night stay through Marriott\u2019s on line web site. Total price, with service charges, was 6,820.00 Hong Kong dollars for four nights. Service charges were 150HKD. The hotel is convenient to the Star Ferry terminal, (one of them), bus stops and about an hour\u2019s cab ride from the airport. (Airport to hotel transportation varies from as little as $6 US for a bus to $55-65 US for a cab and the \u201chotel shuttle\u201d service stops at this property and charges about $22 US. Another option is the airport train which costs about $15 US). Visitors should be aware that local cab drivers do not all speak or understand English and I found that many people in the city had never heard of this hotel. Bus drivers from the airport had no clue either. The easiest solution was to ask for the Hyatt or the Convention Center. On one occasion, I showed the mystified cabbie my room ketywhich has a photo of the hotel on it and that settled the problem. The facility is well kept and offers the expected Marriott levels of hospitality. Average per night cost for a single room was about $250 US with the weekdays being higher and weekend rates slightly lower. Room, bath and hotel facilities were as would be expected and there were no problems except that the hotel staff was unable to help me change another Marriott reservation at a San Francisco Airport Marriott that I had scheduled for my return to the states. The issue was finally resolved when a business center staff member used her personal cell phone to call the SFO Airport Marriott and cancel my reservation. This sort of extra attention was, I found, typical of the hotel. One small but important plus is the free bottled water in the room which was replaced every day. Marriott hotels often try to sell bottled water in the rooms at exorbitant prices, so it was good to have this available at no additional charge. I had not taken my laptop on this trip, but was pleased to find free internet service available in the Club Lounge and it worked well and was available up until 11PM. Although I do not usually use hotel restaurants, I had two dinners in the Scala Restaurant in the hotel and found the food expensive and not especially good. I would avoid this in the future, but timing and commitments more or less forced me to eat in the hotel. I would certainly use the property again. As charming and lavish many of the Hong Kong hotels may be, this property was a good deal for the price and well kept, despite heavy convention use.

The rooms require urgent renovation - here are a few good reasons: 1. The old -fashioned bulky TV set block the mirror - a ridiculous arrangement 2. The lighting system is awful: the central control switches on all the light at the slightest provocation, even when you try to change the air conditioning setting in the middle of the night. it is also impossible to switch the light in the corridor separately from room lights. To add insult to injury, the reading lights are spot lights in the ceiling, so one person has no chance of sleeping whilst the other is reading. On top of all that, there are no power sockets next to the bed, and no standard lamps. We had to borrow a lamp and an extension lead and plug it in at the opposite wall, creating a trip hazard. The hotel staff were unapologetic about this. 3. There was no tray for the kettle, no cups (just mugs) and no wine glasses. All that had to be requested. 4. There is only one armchair (the other is a desk chair) and no coffee table. 5. The colour scheme is dominated by dark greys - in combination with bad lighting makes the place feel gloomy. 6. The pillows smelt funny and had to be changed. 7. Linen was not changed daily, and room make up was idiosyncratic: one day they forgot to add tea, the other the bed turn down in the evening. 8 The bathroom is small, dark and inconvenient, and the toilet bowl uses a rather disgusting flushing system with a \"delay and display\" action. 9. Singing in the bar is painful to the ear (out of tune), but reverberates around the lobby, because the bar is \"open plan\" - so there is no escape. (The best option is to pop to Grand Hyatt across the 11-th floor swimming pool, where singing at the Champagna Bar is exquisite!) The HKCEC nearby is in the process of building an extension. Funnily enough, that does not create the principal disruption - it is the rest of the arrangements in the hotel that are woefully inadequate.

The room was very modern and immaculately kitted out and serviced (it was even 'refreshed' each evening - choccies and complimentary bottled water). The facilities were great, the pool area on the 11th floor was huge, full of trees, greenery walking/running paths, tennis courts and a massive swimming pool. We used the pool every morning (no one else did!), it was slightly chilly but, followed by a sauna, a really refreshing way to beat off the jet lag. We ate in the Renaissance restaurant a couple of times and had three (huge and varied) buffet breakfasts - quite pricey but top quality and exceptional service. The service at the hotel was incredible - we had a (small) problem with our shower head and within 5 minutes of reporting it, it had been fixed. There are plently of places to eat and drink nearby and the MTR station is a five minute walk along a covered walkway. The whole area (Wan Chai & indeed Hong Kong) is extremely safe so make sure you really explore. Buy an Octopus card (a really handy and cheap way to use all methods of public transport as well as various shops and tourist attractions etc). If you do one thing in Hong Kong make sure it's the trip to Victoria Peak - it's touristy but the views are incredible. A tip would be to avoid the viewing platform (fee) and go for a five minute walk on the Peak Trail to afford some spectacular views of the Hong Kong skyline and harbour...if you do two things, use your Octopus card on the Star ferries as much as you can...they are fantastic.

The room and bathroom was excellent, very clean. Breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails and free use of the internet was included with the upgrade (all of which we enjoyed). The location was excellent, it was a short walk to Wan Chai MTR, the Star Ferry, a bus service across the road and there was always a taxi available. I would never go again in June because of the humidity. If purchasing a made to measure suit try the tailors on Hong Kong Island, when we went over to Kowloon we were pestered continually with people trying to get us into their shops and giving out leaflets. We went into a couple of these shops (escorted by the man who had given us his leaflet) only to discover that some of the shirt material I could have purchased cheaper at Birmingham Rag Market, cheap and very poor quality. This harassment I found was a downside to Kowloon. We purchased an Octopus pass which enabled us to use all forms of transport including the tram to The Peak. Excellent value, the MTR is clean and efficient. If you go up to see the Buddha it is takes approximately 25 minutes by bus (not for the faint-hearted). This pass can also be used to buy food, drinks etc. in various venues and, if like us, you still have credit then some of the shops at the airport accept them. There is a free shuttle service from Hong Kong station to the hotel which we took, we bought a return pass on the Express Airport Shuttle, it was convenient, quick and easy. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel, we could not fault it. It was clean, ideal position, staff were excellent. They also have their own security staff who are visible at all times.

And since I prefer Hong Kong Island to Kowloon, I consider the Renaissance to be the very best place to stay. PROS: 1. My top priority when I travel in Asia is to be conveniently located next to subway entrance. If I'm only in town for a few days, I don't want to lose 2-3 hours a day from walking between the hotel and nearest station. The Renaissance is a fast (and covered) 5 minute walk to the Wan Chai station and just 60 seconds away from the Star Ferry terminal. Lots of hotels are located near a subway station, bu the Renaissance is the only one close to both a subway station AND the Star Ferry. 2. Right across the street via covered walkway is a 7-11, grocery store, coffee shop, and about a dozen restaurants, including the extremely popular (and cheap) Cafe de Coral. Acquainting yourself with this area will save you big bucks on dining. 3. Service is impeccable, but that is pretty typical for most of Hong Kong. 4. Next to the fitness center is a cleaner. Their prices are about 40% lower than the prices listed on the price sheets in the hotel closets. 5. If you in Hong Kong to attend a convention at the Convention Center, this is absolutely the most convenient hotel to stay at. 6. There is no such thing as a cheap Hong Kong hotel, but the Renaissance offers a great, great value for the price. It is way cheaper than most other well situated hotels on Hong Kong Island. 7. Fantastic and large pool that hardly gets used. CONS: 1. The fitness center, while nice and modern, is quite small for the size of the hotel. It was so crowded in the mornings that you had to put your name on a waiting list for a treadmill/stair climber or stationary bike. Tip: walk another 50 feet and sneak into the Hyatt fitness club. It is bigger and spectacularly equipped. 2. The buffet menu hardly varied the 5 days I was there. It is great quality, but I got tired of seeing the same thing over and over. See #2 above for alternatives. 3. The furnishing and rooms are ultra clean, but I would not call it luxurious. The entire hotel really needs a furnishing update, so if you're looking for super luxury, you will be disappointed.", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent experience\u201d", "Author": "vanessa_jm_gray", "ReviewID": "UR7703081", "Content": "My husband and I just had a two night stay at the Renaissance Harbour View in Hong Kong.

We received an inside corner room on the 28th floor overlooking the pools and gardens. Pluses: 1. The room was quite spacious, with standard amenities: lots of bath and hygiene items, robes and slippers, safe, mini bar, coffee maker, etc. A/C worked well. The room was also very quiet. 2. Service was generally very good. Housekeeping and room service was friendly and prompt. Room was kept very tidy. We received a plate of fresh fruit at the beginning of our stay. Turn-down service with a little puzzle toy was also provided every evening. 3. Location is terrific - right next to Star Ferry to Kowloon (we took the ride every day), very close to MTR Wan Chai station and other shopping. It's a short taxi ride to Central/Airport Express and the Peak tram. 4. Food service was excellent. The breakfast buffet in the coffee shop was quite good (we were disappointed not to have it available when we arrived a couple minutes late on one of the days). I was able to order food from Dynasty and have it delivered via room service (the sweet corn soup and barbecued items were sooo good!). 5. Two bottles of water are provided free of charge and are replenished daily. Minuses: 1. The hotel is older and lacks much in the way of style or attractiveness. However, everything is very serviceable, so this is a minor point (unless you like trendy hotels with a lot of character or super luxury). 2. The hotel caters to business people, as it is a central transportation hub and right next to the convention/exhibition center. I was trying to come out of the elevator and got rushed by about 30 businessmen with rolling suitcases who refused to stand out of my way to let me exit. 3. Elevators can be very slow and crowded, even though there were 6 available. We often had to wait for the second or third to arrive because there was no room. 4. Restaurant choices are fairly limited and quite expensive, although good. If you are used to American style Chinese food, Dynasty might be a bit of a rude awakening (although not nearly as much as any of the street stalls you'll see around HK). 5. Bed was too hard, although the linens and pillows were fine. 6. TV choices also very limited. Basically there's one channel to satisfy various regional interests (like the Australian channel), but most of it is news and Chinese language stations. The only watchable English channel was Discovery. By the end of the stay, I was anxious for news on anything but Iraq and Gaza. There are ppv movies at around $12USD. 7. Light in the closet would not turn off, even when the doors were closed. This was my first real visit to HK and I enjoyed it immensely, even though it rained for about 75% of the trip. Weather was warm and humid a couple of times but mostly very comfortable (although wet - make sure to bring good shoes and an umbrella). We did the usual tourist stuff, like the Peak, HK Disneyland, Temple Street night market, and the big Buddha on Lantau Island. The Star Ferry and MTR are cheap, clean and extremely user friendly, so it's very easy to get around. Lots of shopping, although prices for high-end goods are comparable to the US (no tax though). We ate at the teppanyaki place right next to the hotel on the exhibition centre side; beautiful restaurant but more traditional and expensive, so don't expect Benihana!

We can recommend the rooms on the 8th floor because they have balconies and are also good for pool access. The pool is huge and the area catches quite a lot of sun between the sky scrapers. There are sun loungers and a bar along with free towels for guests. Two things to note - firstly - this is an international hotel with piano playing in the lobby along with peanuts and cocktails. If you are looking for true Asian culture this is not the place to be. Secondly, this hotel is on HK island and therefore has less spectular views than those on Kowloon as you are already in the middle of the city.", "Date": "January 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland", "Title": "\u201cCan't fault the Renaissance\u201d", "Author": "oztraveller2-TRIP", "ReviewID": "UR6549987", "Content": "Our family of four - Husband, wife, son 19 & daughter 16 stayed at this hotel for 10 days 19 - 29 Dec, 2006.

When they asked for an alternative, they were told they could move to an inferior room and only pay a 50% increase. so they moved. while the front desk did apologise, the apology was inadequate. we will not stay there anymore, have told all of our friends, and are looking for alternative accomodation (which is why i am on this website). shame, renaissance, shame!!!", "Date": "April 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic views\u201d", "Author": "Jo5", "ReviewID": "UR4964723", "Content": "The Renaissance in Hong Kong is located close to Victoria Harbour and you can get some amazing views across the bay.

The rooms are quite small, although they are no smaller than London or NYC hotel rooms and they are cleaned to a high standard. They are quite masculine in design. The staff at the hotel were excellent and there were always enough staff at reception for there to never be a que. The bar serves great cocktails and some good bar snacks/lunch type food. We didn't sample any of the other hotel restaurants but if you do decide to there are some discount vouchers in the rooms. There is a swimming pool.

We could have looked at it all day and night. There was quite a bit of traffic noise as the hotel is on a busy main road, but we were so tired from sightseeing every night that this didn't bother us at all. The hotel staff were brilliantly helpful, friendly and informative. We loved the 11th floor swimming pool with its fantastic waterfall - it was just a shame that on the days we had a swim it wasn't really boiing hot so didn't get to appreciate the full colling effect! We also loved the house band who sang in the lobby every evening - the lead singer had a wonderful voice (almost Karen Carpenter-esque) and the drummer seemed to be able to mimic most well-known singers, including Mark Knopfler! We only ate breakfast in the hotel on our first day, as it was quite pricey (HK $168 each) but definitely worth it just the once. The hotel location couldn't have been better either - just a short walk across the bridge to the Star Ferry, and a 5-10 minute walk to Wan Chai MTR station. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay here again if we went back to Hong Kong.", "Date": "March 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "the midwest", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful view\u201d", "Author": "enjoytravel", "ReviewID": "UR4584621", "Content": "Stayed in January for 3 days on business w/husband.

In terms of location, these are the positives: it's right on the harbour next to the Star Ferry port (the trip from the island, where the hotel is, to the mainland is wonderful, but the trip back is justifiably decribed as \"one of the world's great ferry journeys\"). The RHV is also above the massive convention centre, if you happen to be visiting for business as I was. The downside: Wan Chai itself is slightly seedy - apparently the former red light district..! It's also difficult to reach because of the 8-10 minute walk to the MTR station, and the appalling road traffic around the hotel due to the hotel's proximity to the endlessly-congested cross-harbour tunnel. If you can live with this inconvenience, you'll love this place. The hotel itself can't be faulted. I'm in the Marriott Rewards scheme, and emailed in advance to say we'd like as nice a room as possible. They didn't disappoint! When we arrived, we were shown up to our room on the 35th floor, which had a breathtaking view of Victoria Harbour. Floor-to-ceiling windows made the most of the postcard scenery that greeted us through the curtains, and the endless activity on the waterway was fascinating. It compensated for a relatively limited TV channel selection, although they had an enormous selection of PPV movies on demand. The room service wasn't too expensive, and the food was generally good. The breakfast buffet especially was enormous and is highly recommended for those who don't have a cholesterol problem. Maybe burn it off in the secluded 11th floor external garden with outdoor swimming pool and tennis courts. It's a great spot to relax or work out, and we hardly saw anyone using it while we were there. Every day, pilots and cabin crew could be seen in the lobby checking in or out. Someone very wisely once told me to stay where the airline workers stay because they always know the best places, and it's certainly true here. Renaissance Harbour View is a really great base from which to explore HK, although perhaps the experience is different if you're in a Garden View Room without the wonderful harbour vistas.", "Date": "February 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wendover, England", "Title": "\u201cReally nice pool\u201d", "Author": "Dave_Ball2007", "ReviewID": "UR4412903", "Content": "Decent hotel, recommend paying extra for a harbour view room.

It was more for business, although I met up with several relatives and old friends there as well. It rained for most of my stay there, so it was not an enjoyable trip. Now, on the hotel itself. I have entertained and dined at the Renaissance HV before several times, in my on-off trips to HK. But this is the first time I am staying in it. I chose it for the convenience of going to the offices in Wan Chai. So for location, it is very good. It is also attached via a rather long, covered overhead walkway (over a building) to the Wan Chai station entrance. So it's convenient for a business traveller wishing to take the MTR as well. Finally, being at Wan Chai itself means the convenience of lots of eateries suited for the taste of an overseas Chinese like me, and some last-minute shopping too, especially for traditional Cantonese snacks. In terms of facilities, this hotel is nothing to shout about. The pool is nice, but as I said, it was raining when I was there, so didn't use it at all. I was at the gym, which was nice but feel a bit dated. The Chinese restaurant, Dynasty, has a nice view over Victoria Harbour, and the quality of food has been consistently good in the past few years I ate there (including this time round). The business centre was average, but pricey. Photocopying costs HKD 8 per page! Elsewhere, the lobby lounge plays some cheesy cover versions by a Filipino band at night, while the design of the check in counter being on the second floor (up an escalator from the taxi drop-off point) was not ideal. Service was so-so, not spectacular but adheres to the Marriot no-nonsense, business-like style. Because of my Marriot Rewards card, I was given a complimentary upgrade to a Harbour View room, which was nice. The room had ceiling to floor glass windows, but you you can't open them to let the breeze in. It overlooks the western part of Victoria Harbour, on the Hong Kong Islandf side. But the poor weather did not give a clear view. I reckon ona clear day, I would be able to see Causeway Bay, North Point and beyond, and also TST West and Kowloon Tong. The room, despite the upgrade, is stil small. But for HK standards, I was not hoping for much. The decor looks tired, while the bed was the soft type (not to my liking). The bathroom did not have a separate shower but overall cleanliness was very good. Just that I feel very 1980s staying in the room, except for the broadband internet connection. There was fax machine, which I did not use. I requested for an extra phone to be placed on the working desk, and the hotel staff readily obliged. Writing my reports and replying emails while overlooking the harbour was a good feeling, marred only by the incessant rains. Overall, I think this is a good place to stay, but only for business. The hotel lacks character and failed to excite. If I'm on holiday, I'd still stick to my upgraded room at the Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel, which I have also reviewed.", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel to start our Holiday\u201d", "Author": "Cornish", "ReviewID": "UR4162049", "Content": "Arrived in Hong Kong end of October for our 2 day stop over to Australia.
