{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Comfortable Stay! I was working in Beijing for two months and stayed in these apartments from the end May to the end of July. I had a one-bedroom apartment and it was spotless. It had a full kitchen, washer/dryer, nice sitting area with a large flat screen tv, and king size bed and another flat screen tv in the bedroom. Plenty of closet space. Maid service cleaned twice a week. The price was very reasonable, compared to a hotel. The apartment complex is in close proximity to some major attractions. It also offered a continental breakfast. There is also an assortment of restaurants and shops within the complex.", "Date": "Aug 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR427777450", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "travvlgyrl08"}, {"Content": "Great surroundings with first class service I live in Beijing, but when my father visited, my husband and I decided to have a holiday too and we all booked into a 2 bedroom apartment at the Oakwood. I've stayed in other serviced apartments in Beijing (like Lee Gardens and East Gate Plaza) but the service, furnishings and d\u8305cor at the Oakwood was far better than any other serviced apartment that I have stayed in. Usually, as the only Chinese speaker in my group, I have to cope with all the dealings with front desk, etc... but the standard of English at the Oakwood is very good and I could relax for a change! The apartment was wonderful - spacious, spotlessly clean and the kitchen was far far better equipped than my own at home! Usually in serviced apartments it's a drag to get them to provide everything needed, but the Oakwood even had nice wine glasses! Despite having our own apartment only 10 minutes away, we didn't need to go home to get anything - the Oakwood had it all!", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR858777298", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "fy123"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d817635-r18817083-Oakwood_Residence_Beijing-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "817635", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
