On tight budgets we opted for a three bed room - anticipating a slightly cramped room (hotel photo's are always misleading, no!?) & being out all day. It couldn't have been more different. Our room was spacious, light, airy and so clean (we are all a little OCD about this!) and looked onto a quiet courtyard despite the central location. Although I realise this is not true of all the rooms. The staff are also a delight. After the \"service\" offered by others in Berlin it was always lovely to come back to smiles, laughter & helpfulness. Busses to Museum Island are 2 minutes away & the tram is outside the door. (But be warned numbers on the left do not correlate so no 3 is opposite no 220 or something similar!) Although the selection is a small - breakfasts were very good too. We all had flu and spent a lot of time in our room and felt so at home and not cramped at all! Thats 3 sick women all together so that says something. You could not wish for better value for money. Oh and try the DELIGHTFUL Turkish place next door. The food was great and the service excellent) Note that the English menu hasn't included 2 pages from the German so get both - particularly the veggies as that section is missing. We stayed till nearly 1am - by now on a complimentary glass to thank us for our tip! They were so lovely we went back the next day for lunch too!", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cA good bargain and location\u201d", "Author": "sfoggy", "ReviewID": "UR87443289", "Content": "I had to make reservations at the last minute and found the Alex Hotel through bookings.com. Their rate was good and included a nice breakfast. One review said there were better deals out there, but I found their price to be competitive and I liked the location. It is a basic european style hotel with fully renovated modern bathrooms and additional perks like in room safes, blow dryers, and tv. The management was friendly and helpful and there is a computer available for guests to check email. The tram to Alexander Platz is just outside the hotel and the underground is about two blocks away. There is wonderful park around the corner for jogging or relaxing. Its location on the edge of Prenzluerburg near the Mitte and Frederichshain Districts is very convenient. There are nice restaurants and Cafes nearby, the big clubs in Frederichshain are within walking distance and Museum island is an easy trip. The only negative is that there were large student groups which tended to be a bit noisy. The rooms are very basic and small, but attractive and comfortable. The breakfast is a bit better than average and coffee and tea are available all day. The lobby/breakfast room has wi-fi, which I didn't utilize, but after breakfast it is a comfortable place to sit.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for the price.\u201d", "Author": "JamesD101", "ReviewID": "UR71500448", "Content": "A great budget hotel.

Alcoholics were forbidden in our room, but allowed in others. There was apparently no storage room for our luggage after checkout. Most of the staff couldn't understand english.

We were a little surprised at the layout of our small apartment; the room with two of the beds contained a very small kitchenette while the room with the remaining two beds was small indeed. Though surprised, we settled into the area comfortably though guests wanting spacious rooms may be disappointed. We were impressed with the renovated look and appreciated the spotless cleanliness. The area immediately around the hotel offers little though the park nearby made for a beautiful jogging retreat for my morning run. However, the Alexanderplatz is a mere ten-minute walk away and the #4 tram stops, literally, right outside the door of the hotel so getting to the heart of Berlin was a breeze. The complimentary breakfast was fresh which we enjoyed in the dining area near the entrance, a design which presented a pleasant \"coffee house\" ambiance. Finally, the friendliness of the state can't possibly be overstated. A final bonus was the free wifi available in our room.

Alternatively, hop on the tram outside. If you are expecting a traditional German hotel or the luxury of a Marriott, you will probably be disappointed.

The hotel itself is new, clean, and modern. Our room was small, minimal, but comfortable and clean. The staff was friendly, and the buffet breakfast was extensive. At the time of our stay, although wifi was advertised as being available throughout the hotel it only worked in the lobby area, which was not a problem for us since the staff explained that they were in the process of fixing the problem.
