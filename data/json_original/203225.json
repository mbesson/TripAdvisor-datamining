The staff we met at reception would good and helpful whislt in the bar/breakfast room quite different, (not been on the customer satisfaction course yet!). The room, at the front was noisy particularly with sirens from nearby hospital. They were adequate but would have been improved with the addition of tea/coffee making falicites.. The lift was difficult only allowing three people, a number of times someone had to get out. It offten also went in the opposite direction to the requested on. This lift would make this hotel useless for people using wheelchairs. You also need to reach the second floor before reaching the lift. I assume this a security feature as you had to go through reception to reach the lift for the higher floors. Breakfast was adequate but not amazing. They seemed to think tea could be made with cold water and there was littl eif any variation. There was refurbishment taking place but this did not intrude too much. The chocolate brown walls on the corridors were vile. The happy hour consisted of cold pizza slices from accross the road and no one was there. The hotel is in a good location with 20-25 mins to the Colosseum although few restaurantes in the area. The restaurante recomended by the hotel was emtpy so we gave it a miss. Getting around using the Metro and busses and walking was easy and cheap - not much else is in Rome.

We purchased the Roma Pass from reception, highly recommended, and they even made reservations for the Galleria Borghese for us. The room, on the 4th floor, was a good size and had been recently refurbished. As previously mentioned by other posters the hotel is on a busy main road and can be very noisy, particularly the sirens, however it quitened down considerably by 22:00. The breakfast is average but we always found enough to fill us up until a late lunch. We went up to the 8th floor with its stunning views of the city for the \"happy hour\" one night just to see what it was about. We had a drink and a few bits from the buffet, mainly focaccia breads, pizzas, a selection of nuts and crisps. My main gripe is upon checkout we were quoted \u20ac20 for city tax, something that was never mentioned to us beforehand.

Our first room was on floor 2, facing front. It was huge, although the bathroom was small in comparison. The furnishings were good, the bed really comfortable. We knew in advance a front room would be noisy but we dealt with that fine. However on the first morning we had no hot water and lost valuable time before being moved to a higher floor. Once again at the front, this room was smaller, but the shower was brilliant. Once they got the water sorted. The renovation seems to be nearly complete, as has been said before the brown artex walls are a bit yuck. The reception staff were excellent, really helpful and genuinely charming - shame the same couldn\u2019t be said about the surly ones who were on level 8. They try and avoid looking you in the eye, let alone acknowledging your presence. The breakfast itself was a disappointment, stale breads and a lack of desire to provide more bacon or scrambled eggs being just two examples. And how can a hotel with 55 rooms not have a proper bar, rather than some very limited choice cottage industry that only runs from Monday to Friday in its place? I thought previous reviews sounded a bit harsh about the lift situation: but they were spot on. Location wise, you\u2019re fairly well placed. 5 minutes or so walk from San Giovanni on Metro A \u2013 from there it\u2019s 3 stops to Termini or 6 to Spagna. If you don\u2019t want to walk to the Colosseum, then the 87 bus stops outside and takes you right there. So overall a mixed bag. Have to say though, Rome as a city is simply marvellous.

The receptionist started alarm bells ringing as soon as we arrived: to be greeted by someone who clearly thought himself far too important to bother being polite to customers was, to say the very least, irritating and unncessary. The miniscule lift, the only way to get between floors as access to fire escapes was not permitted, would only carry 3 people (I suspect two people of more generous proportions) opened to reveal a corridor decorated with the most revolting shade of brown paint I have ever seen outside a nappy. The room was small but had everything required other than tea making facilities. It even had an ash tray - which given the fuss I made about requiring a no smoking room was disappointing. However, the room did not smell and so, was acceptable. I do wish I had taken more notice of Trip Advisor room tips: the advice to ask for a room at the back was so right, the noise levels at the front of the hotel was unbelievable at all hours of the night. The Italians even use sirens at 04:30 in the morning!! As for their use of car horns: it hasn't been exagerrated, it is constant. Having read that breakfast was \"amazing\" I was disappointed by the offering. Saturday's breakfast was much better than Sunday's but on neither day could it be described as particularly good. The restaurant staff were a different matter, they were lovely. Almost made up for the arrogance of the young man on reception when we arrived! The view from the restaurant is definitely a bonus, its fabulous. It is open as a bar in the evening but we were the only people there and it really has no character as anything other than a breakfast room. There is, however, a nice bar cafe to the right of the hotel, which was better. The hotel is not particularly central, about a 20 minute walk to the Colisseum but is close to a Metro station so it isn't difficult to get around.

The hotel is situated relatively close to the San Giovanni metro stop on the Red Line and several buses stop in close proximity to the hotel as well which is a huge plus. The room was decent-sized for one person and also had a stocked mini bar if one wanted snacks or drinks. The hotel served breakfast each morning from 7-10 a.m. on their 8th floor which offered a fabulous view of the city. The breakfast was adequate and the same each day--pastries, rolls, meats, cheeses, cereal, fruits, eggs, bacon, yogurt, variety of juices, coffee, etc. I ate there each morning and was never unsatisfied nor did I walk away still hungry. The hotel also offered a happy hour from 7-10 p.m. Monday-Friday on the 8th floor as well. They offered a wide variety of drinks and a \"buffet\" which consisted of chips, peanuts and some flat bread type of thing. My thought on the happy hour . . . skip it. Head out someplace in Rome for their happy hours. All are reasonably priced and offer more of a drink variety. The staff was mostly helpful (except for the gentleman who worked at the happy hour--he seemed to really hate his job and life in general). On my second to last night there, the AC in my room developed a leak. I called the desk around 10 p.m. that evening and they sent someone up immediately. While they couldn't fix the issue that night, they did offer to move me to another room which I didn't find necessary and also provided a bucket to catch the dripping water. When I walked by the front desk the next morning, the woman at the desk assured me the AC would be fixed when I returned even though I didn't even inquire about it--she just knew it was my room that had the issue and wanted to make sure I knew how sorry they were and would resolve it quickly. When I got home, the AC was fixed and everything was fine. The neighborhood the hotel is in is safe as well with several dining opportunities right in the area. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

When we showed up in the \"new\" room and nothing looked like the pictures on the internet we called the front desk. Although it had only been a matter of minutes, they said they no longer had a renovated room and to call Monica in the morning and hung-up. We called in the morning and the concierge told us Monica got to work at 9 am and then hung-up on me. I went to the lobby at 9:45 am and Monica wasn't there. The same guy who hung up on me, Giorgio, questioned why I wanted to speak with Monica (am I taking crazy pills?). Giorgio proceeded to question my integrity, refuse to compromise and seemed utterly put off that we were requesting anything from him. My wife who is the sweetest woman in the world was royally pissed off by the treatment we received and the lack of hospitality for someone in the hospitality industry. Trying to not let the morning incident ruin the rest of our day, I spoke with the manager after a long day of sightseeing. The manager recognized the hotel's errors, switched our room and even bought us dinner at a restaurant around the corner. The owner of that restaurant was really nice and authentic and the manager was very professional. It is called Roberto and Loretta and it was tasty and moderately priced. The new renovated room was LOUD!!! With the windows closed, on the seventh floor, and the shades fully shut, it was ridiculously loud. Rush hour brought horns and people yelling. In the middle of the night, it was a scooter at full throttle on the empty street.

Four rooms, two people per room. Why I liked the hotel: All in all, we loved the staff - the hosts and hostesses were very friendly and spoke English flawlessly. The breakfast was adequate and the view from the dining room was breath-taking. Machine in lobby served free coffee drinks all day. Free WiFi access is available in the lobby ( I was not able to connect on the 5th floor ). For eating, the neighborhood was perfect - several restaurant choices within walking a two-block span. The best part about the neighborhood was that it was safe, was not in a touristy location (therefore, the prices in the restaurants were reasonable and the food was great), and many supermarkets, caf\u00e9s, and gelaterias were close by. The San-Giovanni metro stop was three blocks away, so it is very easy to get around the city if you are comfortable using the Metro. The Coliseum is within walking distance (perhaps a 20 minute walk), and a vibrant gay/lesbian night scene is also not far (in fact, it's in the shadow of the Coliseum). Rooms were clean and perfectly-sized from a \"European-size\" standpoint (and had more space than most hotel rooms in New York City); irons and ironing boards are available, English-language stations are on the TV. Bathrooms were impressive but all of the guests in my party commented that the toilets did not flush adequately. Why I'd likely not stay here again: I rated the rooms a \"2/5\" because they were unreasonably hot and uncomfortable at night. I learned on the last night of my stay that the hotel turns off the air conditioning from 7PM to 7AM. Additionally, there was no fan in the room or any way to circulate air to feel cool at night (even with the windows open). Further, the hotel is on a very busy and loud street; when the windows were closed, there was no real problem with the noise because the windows are double-paned and windows had external shutters; with the windows open, it was impossible to sleep without earplugs. The fact that the hotel intentionally inconvenienced guests (by turning off the AC from 7PM to 7AM) at a point when they would most like to feel comfortable and refreshed is unforgivable. If I had been made aware of the fact that the air conditioning would be turned off at night (when outside temps were very warm), I would have found alternative lodging. While I would very much love to rate this hotel favorably, I can not say that I would recommend this hotel to a friend because of the air-conditioning issue.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cHum...\u201d", "Author": "philippe_42", "ReviewID": "UR39699641", "Content": "The receptionist was very nice and helpful, and spoke good english.

I waited 10 minutes to go up to the top floor for breakfast one day. There is free dial up internet in the lobby which was great. The breakfast was fair but the view was good. There are alot of little resturants close to the hotel and the underground is pretty close. It is a little away from the major attractions but you can catch the train for 1 Euro.

The location - 5 minutes from San Giovanni metro station and the very busy Magna Grecia road. 20-25 minute walk (if you chose the right route) to the Colosseum. The room - functional. Nothing special but clean and all the amenities you would expect. Decent bathroom, towels provided, tv, mini bar. Air con is really an air cooling/heating system rather than proper air con. The windows are well double glazed which was the only thing allowing a night's sleep. Otherwise the Magna Grecia would be too noisy a road (even at night) thanks to the Italian love for their car horns and the need for ambulances to always have their sirens blaring. Breakfast - is in a smallish 8th floor dining room with a great view over the city. The Colosseum (just) and St Peters are visible. The buffet breakfast offers a good variety of options. Luggage - If you need to temporarily stow your luggage after checking out there is a free room available for the purpose. Internet - Apparently wireless access is available, but if you don't have your laptop with you there is a pc available and usage is free with a code given by the reception staff Staff - fantastic. All speak English, and one particular member of staff gave great recommendations for restaurants. The best being Il Corsari (Turn right from the main doors and the restaurant is on the other side of the road about 100 yards away). We ate there twice, and a slap-up 3 course meal for 2 inc a bottle of wine (house wine is very nice), water, coffee, liquers came to 60 euros (40 quid). We ate there the night before and had another great meal for 35 euros. The quality is excellent and the seafood mixed grill is exquisite. A restaurant frequented by the locals so the prices aren't a rip-off like in the touristy areas. All in all, if you are a city dweller used to traffice noise then it is a perfect base. If like me you live in the country, the traffic noise is the only consideration - ask for a room on the opposite side to the Magna Grecia. Otherwise thanks to the wonderful staff the Hotel Picadilly is a great place if you have a short time to see the ancient sites.", "Date": "December 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel - clean, convenient and cheap\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3733694", "Content": "We were in Rome for 3 days and wanted something clean, convenient and cheap.

He thought it was too far out. Also, when we got there we were put in smoking rooms. We complained and the next night we were moved - they did all the moving for us. I thought this fixed the problem, but he would rate them lower for not getting it right the first time. The staff is very helpful, expecially Richard !
