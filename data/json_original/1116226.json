{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very average I found the Melasti had a great location but the hotel is very old and in desperate need of an over haul. I found the staff at reception were not very helpful and the room service was very slow and normally cold by the time it reached the room.The egg station was the best thing about breakfast but anything else was very average.The pool is not covered by any shade and the pool bar is in direct sun all day, which also means the water in the pool gets very warm through out the day.Would not stay there again", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR674875836", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PennyPerth"}, {"Content": "Never again Have stayed in several locations and hotels in Bali, all have been terific. But when we stayed at Melasti Beach 3 weeks ago were very dissapointed. It is an over crowded out of date pile of cement. The service was average, but the whole place had no Balinese feel to it. It was like an Australian getto.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR943505339", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Battler7"}, {"Content": "Enjoyable stay again Another year another trip to Bali and stayed at Melasti Beach Resort for 14 nights. Things have changed at the Melasti in the last 12 months - the pool area has been cleaned up and the plants that were in the middle of the pool have now gone, the massages that used to be done around the pool have gone, happy hour in the pool has gone. Security has been introduced at the gate, cards were given to us on check in, we were supposed to show the guard these on the way in and out but we only had to show them once. We found the prices for food and drink in the hotel quite expensive, so it made us go outside for food and we found some great eating places. If you go left as you walk out the front of the hotel and walk to the corner bar they do a great fillet steak with mushroom sauce, veges and fries.The rooms are still comfortable and clean with kettles, coffee, tea and sugar. The staff are still great, friendly and always ready for a chat. Breakfast as others will tell you is so so depending on who is cooking that morning.The main pool seems to have a shortage of lounges, it looked like they had put some down near the restaurant, that i am sure no one ever sat on. I know it sounds like i am having a whinge but i am just saying it as it is. I will return to the Melasti because the position is perfect for us, for the price we really dont care as long as the bed is clean and comfortable.Next year we will try a suite and see how that goes.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR180084310", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sujak90"}, {"Content": "nice hotel Arrived 1.30am due to delayed flights. Staff very friendly and said we had upgrade as deluxe suites already booked out. Not a problem for us. A suite was even better. Even managed a good meal at 2am from the restraurant. Very clean and comfortable except pillows. Common problem when travelling. Some areas of the hotel need upgrading, but this didnt worry us at all. Staff kind and helpful. Breakfast ok, would like more choice but still nice. Sit and watch the waves with you meals.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR531388257", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jeanetteBrisbane"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d1116226-r21314314-Hotel_Melasti_Legian_Resort_Spa-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1116226", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
