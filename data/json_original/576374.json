Less than 2 months before my arrival date they call to tell me they are giving my room away to someone else. They have people willing to pay for more nights if they can get a room there....so they are kicking people out of their reservations to accomodate those who are willing to spend more....so it appears. Corporate was contacted who spoke with the local hotel.... which fed them bull about being booked solid all along. (yeah, right) Corporate requests no evidence of such and simply tells me to look elsewhere.

The staff were in a room right around the corner from the reception so must have known that customers were waiting.

A very, very poor reception and this set the scene for this hotel for our stay. The room itself was large and adequate - nothing special for the high rate we were charged though.

The hotel was not inexpensive - $139/night plus tax. If was a decent room - larger than most and relatively clean based on Memphis standards (we go to Memphis every Aug and have stayed in many Graceland area sub-par hotels over the years). The rate was ridiculously high for the caliber of hotel and the area of Memphis, but it is walking distance to Graceland so we opted to bear the expense. When we checked out, we asked for the 3rd time that week if we could please make reservations for Aug 2007 as it was a \"big\" year for Elvis fans (30th anniversary of Elvis' passing). Each time, we advised we'd be happy to provide a credit card deposit but were told in each case that reservations for Aug 2007 could not be made until 2/1/07. When we left, we asked for a business card from the hotel desk manager that would ensure we had a name of the person who last advised us we could not make a reservation. She provided a card, and advised us that it was a family owned hotel (family lives on site), and that we would not have any problems getting a room. Today is 1/31/07, and we tried to call to make reservations for August (a day earlier than they advised), only to be told that the hotel was already sold out. No matter how many times we communicated that we had been advised to wait until 2/1/07, we were told, \"Sorry - we have no rooms.\" When we located the business card they gave us last August, we realized there was no individual's name on the card. We were stuck. This is the equivilant of trying to get a room for a large convention 6 months after most of the desirable hotels are full. Now, we will be forced to stay in a hotel over the state line in Mississippi, as all of Memphis is sold out. I would not recommend staying at this hotel as they do not honor their word. I can't imagine they get more traffic than the Elvis fans that stay there in Aug and Jan and pay ridiculously high rates - and the fans are very loyal to a hotel that treats them right. There are hotels in Memphis that have gone out of business because the fans stopped staying there due to bad experiences. As an Elvis fan, I'd like other fans to know that if you think you have a reservation at the Scottish Inn and don't have a printed confirmation number on the hotel's letterhead, plan on bringing your sleeping bag to Memphis in August.
