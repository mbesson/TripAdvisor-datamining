I have to say I was positively surprised. The receptionist was very nice and gave us great recommendations on what to do and where to eat. When I mentioned that we were going on a cruise he remembered another couple staying at the hotel who was going on the same cruise and he arranged for us to meet and share a taxi to the port. We made cruise friends before even going on our cruise! Of course it's no 5* hotel but our room and bathroom were big, nicely furnished and clean, which is the most important thing for me. The location is great! You can easily go anywhere in Miami. The only thing that could have been better is the breakfast which consisted of do-it-yourself bagels, fruit loops and the like. But I didn't even expect there to be any breakfast so I wasn't really upset about that. The receptionist gave us great breakfast recommendations, so just ask them! - and please don't be rude and complain about them having a slight accent like the people checking in before us did! just because they grew up bilingual/with another mother tongue doesn't mean that they are bad at their jobs. The maid was so surprised when I first greeted her in the hallway and wished her a good morning, it really made me sad.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGood for one night\u201d", "Author": "TheChipperCupcake", "ReviewID": "UR125962414", "Content": "Got there and it was better than I expected.

We stopped feeling sorry for him as soon as we realized these people had a pre-paid reservation but not a room (actually 4 rooms for 14 people). We felt even less sorry for him when he informed us that we also had no room. Other properties owned by the same company were less than helpful about finding space for us. In fact, one man laughed and, when asked for his name, hung up on us. When the Miami PD walked in I was afraid we were in trouble for arguing with the clerk, but it turned out that this hotel has done this before and the police officers were there to help us. Thanks to Miami's finest, we finally got rooms at different hotels (seriously, the same places we called who had no rooms did find room when asked by uniformed officers. Go figure!).

Yes this place needs to be renovated big time but if they renovate the price will jump. For one night its fine. Yes they take a copy of the credit card, Yes they charge 2.$ for a safe even if u dont use it (we sure did) Yes its true there are no Kleenex boxes. I found the room noisy because i was on the street side- the back is quieter and has a great view of the little river where boats pass. The room was clean and the there was a second area with just a couch and sink plus a 2nd door and there were 2 tvs. The location is super and the hotel offers a shuttle to the port for 6$ per person but patience is needed.

The week of going to be in Miami, we were searching for hotels, and wanted to stay in downtown. Reading lots of the horror story reviews of this hotel, we both were apprehensive about booking a stay there. One of the reviews which still sticks with me is that housekeepers steal clothes from the rooms, and nothing was done about it. Check in was fine. Once we checked in the room, it had an odd musty odor. We quickly got ready to enjoy a night out on the town for NYE celebration. Upon returning to the room around 4:00 a.m., I noticed there was no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, and the door had no lock! No security chain, or dead bolt. Meaning, hotel staff members could come and go as they pleased in our room. I pulled back my sheets, and there was what I dubbed \"the mystery spot.\" It smelled like feces, and the bed was visably wet. We called the front desk, and they said there was nothing they could do about it. I ended up sleeping on the foot of the bed to avoid being on the wet spot. Around 3:00 p.m. I heard a noise. I thought it was my friend in the restroom, and my friend says to me loud \"Hey, trying to sleep off my hang over. Keep it down!\" I tell him \"...That isn't me making the noise.\" We both sit up in bed, and see the light on in the restroom, and the door ajar. A housekeeper comes out, and we look at each other. I told her \"No service please.\" She responded in spanish \"I don't speak English.\" Lucky my friend spoke fluent spanish, and told her we didn't need the restroom clean, and told her about the wet spot on my bed. She rolled her eyes, walked over to the spot, and she says \"Your friend probably vomited in his sleep. That's what this is.\" He told her that the bed was like that when we got back from the club. She insisted that it was my fault. She stepped on my white shirt I had worn out, and she said \"Sorry\" and picked it up. \"Oops\" she said in English, and my shirt was now that brown color of the mystery spot. She touched the carpet, and it was wet also. I hadn't noticed that when we checked in, because it was on the side of the bed. I walk over near the housekeeper, and the musty smell was overwhelming. It smelled like urine. We called the front desk and asked to be moved to another room, but according to the hotel, they had \"no rooms available,\" and the room we booked was only available on that floor. I was really upset about her getting my white shirt stained, and there was not even a \"Let me wash your shirt sir\" or anything. She made my bed, just put three matress pads, two towels, then the cover sheet over the wet spot. She said to my friend \"I put enough layers on it, so it shouldn't soak through.\" Needless to say I went to the front desk and raised hell about it. The only staff member Guillermo (goes by english version of his name \"Will\" or \"William) apologized. I said I was very upset the housekeeper was so blunt and implied it was my fault. I asked about the no locks on the door, and the female co-worker of his said only suites have the do not disturb sign and dead bolt/security chain. After going out to dinner and exploring Miami, we returned to the room to get ready for another fun night out. I had noticed my suitcase was partially unzipped, because a sleeve of one of my shirts was sticking out. I started to panic. I knew what was had happen. Perhaps out of spite, the housekeeper didn't like my comment to her from earlier in the day, and returned after we left and took two more pairs of my white shirts. I called the front desk, and demanded to talk to the manager, or someone of higher authority. Nothing was done!! I ended up going to a store to buy some more white shirts, and locks for my luggage. My friend did the same also. He was lucky and nothing was stolen from him. This hotel is just for sleeping only. Don't expect anything fancy. The ONLY nice person on staff was Guillermo. Other comments. I wrote post cards, and there was a outgoing mail bin at the front desk. I put my cards in there, and the woman took them out and gave it back to me. \"Sorry, for hotel staff only.\" What a b*itch! As I was leaving the hotel to head to the airport, Guillermo asked what happen, I told him. His face got red with angry. He apologized, and said he would gladly send my postcards off in the mail. He went back inside, and I could see him getting into an argument with the woman. He came back out, and apologized for her actions. When I had stayed there in January, only one of the elevators worked. They do have a very outdated computer near the elevator for guest to use. It was so slow, and outdated, it couldn't load sites like google maps, or mapquest. If you're looking for a cheap room, then stay here, but be cautioned! I only gave the service a \"Average\" rating, because of how nice Guillermo was in handling our needs. He booked us a tour of the Everglades, always greeted us and other guest in respectful manners. Anyone else, were rude. The pool was closed, even though it was in the 70's and humid on some days. The view we had from our room was nice. The AC didn't work either. TV stations came and went. Some days ESPN would work, other days it came in snowy. Hotel is in a \"okay\" location. Was hard to get a cab there. We didn't have a car, we stayed on foot.

However, we could check at about 12.00 whether a room is available. We asked whether we could leave our baggage. We were told that would be USD 2 per bag. We sat down in the lobby to connect the internet and plan our day. There was trouble getting connected, the hotel staff could not provide any help. We managed to get connected after a long persistent trial with different alternatives. The hotel lobby had a large number of discount coupons and travellogues nicely displayed. It was 11.30 by the time we figured out what we could do during the day. We enquired again about the availability of room and were told that the room would be available in about half an hour. We decided to wait. A person came and told us that the room was ready and we could check-in. The lady at the reception, however, said that the room was still not ready and that we will have to wait for a few minutes more. This 'wait for a few .more minutes' continued for acouple of hours and we could check-in only at about 2.30 P.M. In contrast to the sparkling lobby area, the elevators had a very worn out look. The room was also not very clean and had some broken tiles. There was no refrigerator in the room. Wi-Fi connectivity was available only in the lobby A free metromover is available in Miami downtown. The metromover station was right across the hotel giving easy access to all attractions in the downtown area. All the markets in the vicinity were closed, probably because it was a Monday. THe place had a deserted look by 9.00 P.M which we did not expect in a city like Miami. The hotel was a disappointment specially after receiving excellent hospitality earlier in a hotel on Miami Beach and on board a cruise liner.

We would have rather slept outside on the street than to have taken the risk of sleeping in that place. The evevator was broken and smelled bad. The management was horrible and did not care nor show any concerned when we complained. IF YOU VALUE YOU LIFE AND BELONGINGS DO NOT STAY AT THIS DUMP. They actually were charging $129.00 per night, I would not have given them 50 cents!. This place is so shady a hooker would not take her clients there.

First, I will say that it is inexpensive for its location. However, you get what you pay for. These are my gripes: 1. When I visited, which was in early November 2008, one of two elevators was out of order (management didn't bother to place an 'out of order' sign on it). The hotel was busy, and people ended up waiting quite some time for the elevator. 2. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, the wireless internet was not working. I was told by a person at registration that the hotel was switching providers. THEN KEEP THE OLD NETWORK OPERATIONAL WHILE THE NEW ONE IS INSTALLED!!!!!!! The term \"seamless transition\" is not in the management's vocabulary. 3. I would rate the hotel's breakfast 0/5. Mass-produced muffins and other pastries is what they provided. Luckily, there are some awesome Nicaraguan and Cuban restaurants nearby that you will be happy with. 4. The walls are not necessarily paper thin, but they're not sound proof. If cars are not honking their horns outside your room (which only happened in the early evening) and people in the room next door are having a loud conversation, you can make out every word. Same goes for the television program they are watching. 5. Little thing #1. Fire doors are supposed to automatically close so that, in case of fire, it does not spread. If failure to abide to the fire code is this obvious, I wonder if there are less overt things that need to be brought up to code, like, say, the sprinkler system. 6. Little thing #2. I wanted a particular kind of soft drink, so I found a machine, inserted a dollar, and selected that soft drink. A different brand was dispensed. I went to the registration desk to get a refund, because this is what a person does anywhere else, correct? I was told that I had to contact \"the company,\" referring to the company supplying the drink. I was very surprised by what I was told, so when I asked for \"the company's\" contact information I was told that that information is not available. This is not a good way to build a reputation for customer service. Overall, I would recommend others to avoid this hotel. As I mentioned, I am not picky at all (despite my ranting here). I just feel that this hotel warrants a review. If you do find yourself here, check out the bar next door - it's owned by an Azerbaijani woman who immigrated 30 years ago who will serve you a cold beer at a fraction of the cost at nearby restaurants/hotels (this River Park place doesn't have a working bar).

After booking on line on January 19, 2008 I phoned to confirm that the rate would be $79:00 per night and because of being allergic to cigarette smoke we would require an non-smoking room and also a room in a quieter area of the hotel. These special requests at this hotel were confirmed by the agent of the online booking company on January 22, 2008. My husband and I checked in at 3:30 P.M. but prior to signing the room agreement I noticed the invoice was for $89:00 per night. Despite seeing the print out of our confirmation from the booking agent,she refused to honour the $79:00 confirmed rate. I insisted that this rate had been posted online and also I had verbal confirmation from the booking agent Joanna, that this would be the rate we would be paying. The receptionist then went to contact the online booking agent's office. After waiting 30 minutes, she returned with a revised invoice with the $79:00 rate, but we did not realize that they had made a change and had moved us from the 6th floor to the 4th floor. When we entered room 410 there was a very strong smell of cigarette smoke. The front room and all the furniture was saturated with cigarette smoke. We quickly closed the connecting door and entered into the bed room. The smell of cigarette smoke was not as overpowering, so we opened the three windows to help air the smoke smell out of the room. After having encountered so much difficulty with the front desk, we decided to accept the room, rather than ask them to move us. In the evening we went to close the curtains, but there were no drapes to block out the bright light from the street and the two flood lights mounted on the lower roof of the hotel just below our windows. The room had only a sheer see through curtain and it was as bright as daylight in the room at 10:00 P.M. I phoned the Front Desk and they sent the maintenance man up. He looked at the sheer curtain and how bright and glaring the light was in the room. He attempted to pull the decorative side panel across to cover the sheer curtain covering the large center window but it was impossible. He agreed that this room needed a proper curtain. He would tell the Front Desk and they would move us to another room. Unfortunately there were no other rooms available. We could be moved the next day. In desperation I went down to the Front Desk and requested they lend us two large sheets and I pinned them onto the top of the header of the valance to block out the light. We noticed they did switch off one of the flood lights that was aimed towards our window. The next morning we decided not to request a transfer, because we were afraid we would be placed into another room that was not suitable. We had encountered other problems on the first day, the guest elevator was not working, we had to use the service elevator to get to our floor. The next day maintenance came to fix the guest elevator and then it stopped working again, also the second elevator available to guests also broke down. All the guests in this fully booked hotel had to share the service elevator with housekeeping and the cleaning staff. There was a lot of congestion as guests tried to maneuver their luggage between carts loaded with linen in very narrow passage ways. I am very concerned that the River Park Hotel and Suites does not honour special request of their guests to ensure their health, safety and comfort. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to any of my friends. The Front Desk staff's lack of respect for their guests does not make for an enjoyable stay at this hotel.

My Brother and his family flew into Ft.Lauderdale and got a private car service down to the hotel. My family flew into Miami and took a taxi. The cab driver found the hotel with no problem. (After reading some of the other reviews, maybe you might mention to the cab drivers that it's the old Clarion downtown, next to the Hyatt.) After reading some of the other reviews, my brother and I were suspicious of what was to come during our stay. My sister in law booked the hotel directly online with them and after seeing some of the pictures and reading the negative reviews, we were seriously planning on cancelling this out and paying big bucks to book another hotel. We decided to gamble and take our chances, as we were only staying for one night. I've been in the travel business (working for airlines and as a travel agent) for more than 20 years and I've stayed at dives before, so we figured what's one night going to do? We arrived around 6:30pm and found the lobby to be filled with a group of approximately 35-50 people. By the time, our luggage was unloaded from the cab, we made our way to the lobby to check in, the group was using the 2 elevators and it took several minutes to wait. The lobby seemed nice and clean, and the front desk staff was friendly to us. We got 2 rooms, one on floor 6 and the second one was direclty above My brother's room on floor 7. Our rooms faced the River and appeared to be clean. We could not find any problems with the room. Sure it was slightly old and worn, but for the price we paid compared to some of the other Miami hotel rates that was quoted to us, again we felt that it would be fine for 1 night. The bathroom appeared clean, and the only complaint was that there were 2 sets of towels, for 3 of us staying in the room. I called to the front desk who said they would send another set up. It took a second call and we received the extra set of towels about 2 hours after checking in. The beds to me were comfortable and I had a good night's sleep.

I went to the lounge for a cocktail and there was a boy about 12 sitting at the bar yelling for his poppy in the back of the bar. The pool area was dirty and nobody was there.

Not to be melodramatic, but at 3:00 a.m., I thought to myself I should have pitched a tent in the parking garage and slept in a sandpaper sleeping bag, it would have been more comfortable! Tried to watch TV, barely basic cable and most of the stations were in Spanish. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to leave.

The elevator went down a floor, stopped of course, opened the door for about 1 minute (60 seconds, no fooling) and then went back up past the floor I got on, stopped for about a minute and then went down, stopped at every floor for about a minute - a real test of my patience. Got to know my fellow guest on the trip down and they had similar experiences, especially with the bed. All this for about $250 a night! This place is poorly managed.

After we finally found the hotel we were made to pay cash for a $19 a night valet charge. Upon checking in, we were made to give a credit card, although paid in full which I was fine with. Except for the fact that without letting me know it was being done, they put a funds hold on my credit card. The rooms are very cold since they are not carpeted as well as not cleaned well. There was dirt all over the bathroom and in the corners of the bedroom. I can completely see why the rooms are so dirty since after our first night we were not even given maid service until 5pm the next day at which time we refused service since we were getting ready for dinner. When I noticed on the second day of my stay that I had a hold on my credit card the man at the desk, in his broken english, told me that I would have to speak to a manager, whom happens to always be conveniently not available. Upon check out of the hotel I was told that I could not see a manager and the hold on my card would be reversed in 2 to 3 hours. Two days later, since the hold was still on my credit card, I searched and searched for a phone number for the hotel, since if you call 411 the phone number is not listed under anything, called the hotel to again try to speak to a manager or get a corporate phone number. Come to find out the managers are only there Monday through Friday from 9-5 and they are independently owned so you can not call a corporate office for complaints or problems.

AND THEN, there was the matter of the valet parking, This is a $19 fee to receive parking and valet service. This part was okay, when ther was actually someone around to go get my car. If you are deparate enough to book this hotel, after reading my review, make sure you allow yourself one hour to retrieve your car from valet. Additionally, I got stuck in the elevtor for about 5 minutes one time. Which was no big deal. I was on the fourth floor and figured I would just take the stairs. In the bottom stairwell, There was discarded patio furniture (A LOT OF IT) and I am pretty sure that this is a fire hazard.

My husband and myself had brought along my best girlfriend for Ultra Music Festival at Bayfront park. We resereved a room with TWO beds because obviously we weren't all gonna share a bed! When my husband told me we were on the 4th floor and the room number I was praying that we were on the river side because I knew that 4th floor would probably have a view of the roof of the lobby. I was sad to find out that not only did we have a \"roof view\" room but that they actually had us in a room with ONE DOUBLE BED. Im suprised they could even call that a room! It was a closet with a bathroom. The Double Bed hardly fit in there! My husband got orbitz on the phone immediately and whatever orbitz told them made them change our room. The next room we were given had a river view and two double beds....but it smelled like a gerbil cage! We discovered the problem upon leaving. I checked under the bed for stray socks and discovered several stains that looked like someone had a puppy in there....that explained why there had been a large phone book proping open the room's window. Im almost positive that they gave us an off market room. How nice huh? I took one chance with the pool, my friend and I ran screaming out of the pool when we found a chicken wing bone and other random trash. Sick! There was also some kind of India convention there, and the room next door to us was banging on drums well after midnight. I broke up that party as the hotel staff couldn't be bothered to.

The Gnocci at the resturant was great and the drinks at the bar were reasonable. I'll never stay here again.

The beds were comfortable and big. Pillows were fluffy. There is no bedside clock for some reason so bring your watch or turn on the t.v. for the time. The room was pretty big!

The stay at this hotel started out HORRIBLY, but in the end it was okay. A friend and I had stayed in this hotel in early December for a trip that we had booked on an online booking site over three months in advance. After laughing at the bad reviews I had read on the hotel just days before the trip, we arrived to the hotel around 9:30am. The girl at the front desk was not very welcoming, and nonchalant about everything. The stay started going downhill when they told us to leave our stuff in the storage room and to come back later since check-in wasn't until 11:00am and our room wasn't ready yet. After going to the hotel restaurant to have some of the cold, disgusting \"complimentary\" breakfast (which in fact was not complimentary at all), we return to the hotel around noon to find a lobby full of different groups of people, which included angry customers at the desk complaining about the customer service. We asked if our room was ready, and the girl at the desk said that it was. About 5 minutes later, she returns to us and says that the hotel was \"overbooked\" and that they did not have a room for us; however, they were sending everyone that was expecting a room to another hotel in the area, free of charge. They gave us a choice to either wait for a room to become available after 3:00pm or go to the other hotel. When we opted to wait there for a room (since they had confirmed our reservation and room just the day before), the girl at the desk looked as if she were going to laugh in our face. After making several calls about the problem, we returned to the hotel a couple of hours later to see that the lobby was completely empty, and to find that all of a sudden, a room was available. The room wasn't bad at all. It was very clean and well-kept. The only problem was that we received one queen-sized bed when we had requested two double beds. We didn't deal with the staff too much after that, but by the looks of some customer's faces as we passed the front desk, they were also dealing with rude desk attendants and bad customer service. In fact, the only employee that practiced good customer service was the manager of the hotel.
