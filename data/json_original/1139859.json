The Concierge helped us to get some good ticket for the EuroDisney show.We stayed for 3 nights with 2 children. The junior suite we had was spacious, well decorated with full equipment (the kids loved the gaming console Wii ).The breakfast had a good choice and variety for the children ... it was even too much.To conclude we simply had an amazing family time in the hotel and in Paris.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR209670835", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "johnkibo"}, {"Content": "I just loved this hotel ! I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Paris for 3 nights when in Paris for business. I wanted to stay downtown (in the Golden Triangle) and was looking for a smallish hotel.The hotel location is perfect \u9225?in the middle of the business district, just off the Champs Elysees - and within walking distance of Avenue Montaigne fashion boutiques, Eiffel tower, etc.The Crowne Plaza did not disappoint and I just loved this hotel ! Everything was better than expected - from the ambiance and all the room extras, to the attentiveness of the staff (not too little or too much). The service was stunning with very helpfull friendly and warm concierge  front desk staff.The decor looks extremely stylish as you enter the property. The entire place exudes style as do the smart but fashionable staff at the reception area. I had a great room with an oversized bath tub, face accessories, Ipod dock, large TV screen \u9225?The bed was fabulously comfortable and the room was extremely clean. My window opened to the calm Parisian courtyard, and the Italian style ceiling in the room was a wonderful addition.The breakfasts were wonderful and served the best pancakes I have ever eaten. I had a wonderful stay in a very discreet comfortable location. Thank you Crowne Plaza staff I will be definitely coming back !!!", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR942916420", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "pdelavega"}, {"Content": "Excellent !   showReview(22747150, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR333980674", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "silviabianco"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1139859-r23101060-Crowne_Plaza_Hotel_Paris_Champs_Elysees-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "HotelID": "1139859", "Price": "$495"}}
