The waterpark was understaffed on a holiday weekend, meaning one of their two slides were closed. When I needed to report a drain problem in our tub I waited 27 minutes at the front desk while she took birthday party reservations. When I asked for management regarding some of these matters, there was not one available. Remember I stated they were very understaffed, which means like it or not managers should of filled in for this busy holiday weekend. We had three towels placed in our room for our family of six reservation with two full beds and bunkbeds, waited hours for those after contacting front desk. Management was available at time of checkout and stated that being understaffed was out of their control and rattled on about pool safety policies and how housekeeping is usually very quick, she stated that no report was made about drain issue when it was reported the first day. Very rude and argumentative responses from her, I asked for a number for the hotel manager/owner & she refused to give me the number. Instead she handed me the main card and number, I asked for the day of the week I may be able to reach them seeing how in three days I couldn't get a manager at all she also refused that request. She stated there was not a point in speaking to them as they would agree with her handling of the situation.

I would give it a 4/5. There were lots of life guards and fun areas for them to swim. I would recommend getting a day pass and staying somewhere else. The hotel was a 2/5. The room was clean, but had old fashioned linens and smelled musty and damp when we arrived. We used an air freshener from the car (placed in the a/c) to freshen it up a bit. We purchased a weekend package that included pizza and drinks (value $25). When we went to redeem the pizza, they restaurant told us that they were out of cheese until much later in the evening. We asked the front desk employee if we could use the voucher for another food item or get credit on our room, as it was 5:15 pm and we were leaving the next morning. She told us neither was possible. She told us there would be cheese availble for the pizza, but couldn't tell us when. My husband asked to speak with the manager. She said he was away. We left our voucher there as she said she would check on options and call us. With two hungry swimmers in tow, we opted to go out for dinner. We went back a few hours later. We hadn't received any communcation regarding the voucher. The same front desk employee seemed clueless and said, \"Here is your voucher. We have cheese now.\" It was 7:15. I gave the voucher to a family checking in with kids in hopes someone would get use from it. Of course, it isn't about the $25 meal as much as it is about the horrible service and lack of problem solving skills for THEIR mess up. Should a restaurant run out of cheese on Saturday evening? Probably not, but if they do, they should have other options available for something they have already sold. We have owned small businesses in the past and understand that hiccups are part of business, but as a service provider was their job to correct the problem and/or offer other options. They just seemed completely obtuse to the fact that we had hungry kids and were leaving the next morning and it was their mistake we couldn't use the voucher. That is so frustrating!

We have 5 and 3 year old boys and they loved it all. There were several good things and several not-so-good things I will list below. Good: -Our room (3333) was in the Tower and was a very nice room that was clean and spacious. It was a handicapped room so they might be why it was large, I am not certain. The bathroom was huge and we had a mini-fridge and a table. There was a sink in the bathroom and a vanity outside the bathroom with a large mirror, hair dryer, etc. The kids loved the bunk beds and we loved the king bed. I would not want to stay in the other building as it is quite a distance, especially in the winter. -They have a restaurant on-site with decent, reasonably priced food. This allowed us to not have to leave the park. It also has room service, though we did not use it. -The water park was lots of fun for my kids and we had fun, too. They have stuff inside and outside, and there were plenty of towels, life jackets, seats/tables. It was clean, too. There were three shallow kid pools and 2 deeper adult pools, a lazy river, and 2 slides. -They allow you to stay and play until close on the day you check out (10pm), and there is a shower in the restroom by the pools so you can clean up and head straight to your next destination (Dixie Stampede for us). -It's quite a bit cheaper than Great Wolf Lodge (but still expensive). -The A/C unit had a remote control. Very nice. Bad: -The wireless internet did not work in our room. -The lady at the desk was snippy with me when I told her the rate she was going to charge was not what was quoted to us on the phone just a few hours earlier (we booked the same day we stayed the night) but fixed it. -They charge you quite a bit of money for breakfast that is the same quality as the free ones at other places. Take doughnuts. -They were short on lifeguards so they could only have one slide open at a time on Saturday. This not only cut out on play time, but also made the other areas very crowded with people who would have been sliding. This also caused a shortage of tubes required for the one slide. -They were also short on help in the restaurant and it took a very very long time to get our food, even when we were the ONLY people in there. -It is really loud when they are cleaning the water park in the mornings when your room is right above it. -There was only one umbrella at one table outside. There were several tables but no umbrellas. -The palm tree \"rain shower\" was not working outside. I think we will go back. Overall we had a good time, especially for booking last minute. It would have been nice for others in our family to be able to get a day pass but they were over booked that weekend so they weren't able to. There is a spa I'd like to have tried but we didn't have the time. I can't say much about service because we didn't really require any.

This looked like it would fit the bill, as we would have the convenience of having our room close to our main source of entertainment. The first day we were there, one of the outdoor water items was not working and one of the indoor slides was shut down. Our room was called an Atrium room, why I do not know. It was basically an older hotel, possibly a bought out Best Western or Holiday Inn, which was painted the same color as the main Castlerock building. It had no atrium and was across two parking lots to the pool area. The building was old, the AC was loud, walls thin, toilet seat loose and toilet had to be flushed two or three times to empty bowl, had to pay extra for refridgerator and microwave combo (Microwave not big enough to accomodate bag of popcorn), television very old, furniture looked like it was original 1970 hotel and the sheets on the bed would not stay on the matress, oh and pillows very flat and old. The Lifeguards very young which would give them some excuse for their hospitality and attitude, however there was no excuse for the uncaring, rude and discourteous behavior of what they call Management. Apparently there is no skillset or training required to be a manager at this hotel. If you have a problem during your stay, trust that they could not care less. Way overpriced. Do yourself a HUGE favor and stay at a nicer, lower priced, reputable chain hotel and buy a pass to White water or another park. The kids will have a better time and you will not be as disappointed as we were with our vacation. I believe the only way this place is getting any good reviews, could be that it is getting them from owners, employees or someone paid to do so. The pool does not open until 10 or 10:15, whenever they feel like it, so don't think you will be able to swim the day of check out, not unless you want to change in a dirty public bathroom before your departure.Curtains do poor job of blocking out the light.

Wanted somewhere where the kids could swim, so we needed something with an indoor pool. Found this indoor water park at Castle Rock Resort in Branson and thought that would fit our family perfectly. I was referred to this location thru Branson Tourism which was able to find an opening at the last minute. To check in you must use the office in the Castle Rock Resort main building. The indoor water park is inside the Castle Rock Resort, but apparently they also own the two older hotel buildings to the north which is called, Atrium. This is actually where we got booked. Building 1 sits 100 feet away with a parking lot access road between and building 2 is another 300 feet north separated by a large parking lot. It wasn't too inconvenient since the weather turned out to be pretty nice for the end of December to run between the buildings, but if the weather was worse it would have been a pain. The Atrium Hotel is a much older facility. All rooms have outside doors. The beds where old and very bouncy. The lighting was dim and dated. The rooms smelled clean and were overall clean in appearance. The shower head is very low for any adult, but did have good water pressure and plenty of hot water. It had a soap dispenser in the shower that was empty. The rooms in the Atrium are definitely budget feeling, I would recommended staying in the main building if possible, I didn't view any of those rooms, but they are definitely newer so that should be a plus. I would stay again in the Atrium if I had to, but I would try everything possible to avoid it. The water park turned out to be a huge hit for my 2 girls ages 12 and 10. They have a couple large kiddy pool areas, 1 wading pool, 2 large twist and turn slides, and a lazy river that actually moves pretty quick. The kids loved the water park and my wife and I enjoyed it as well. The water park is very clean and the lifeguard staff was very professional in nature and constantly on their feet scanning the different areas they were assigned.

Then to end our stay I asked for the name of the GM, the woman who was working Friday and Sunday explain she was one of the owners. I told her about the problems over the weekend, she said she was sorry but there was nothing she could do but talk to Housekeeping. So I guess it was \"Sorry for your bad luck\".

It was a very clean room and the air conditioner was very cold, which was great because it was about 100 degrees! We did not, however, have a micro/fridge in our room, which was disappointing. I called the front desk and for $10/day they brought one right to our room within15-20 minutes. I was impressed by that because there was no elevator so the poor maintenance had to carry it up those stairs! The waterpark itself was GREAT for younger children.

I am not sure why other than we were not out of the room when they came by, but we told them we were leaving, but they never came back to clean...they did, however, leave clean towels. I was also impressed with the fact that the owner came by twice to ask us how we liked our stay while we were at the pool...very nice. I would suggest to Castle Rock that a continental breakfast should be offered at no additional charge. I missed that at this hotel and to be more competitive, I think it would be a great thing for them to offer! Overall, I was a little leary after reading all of the negative comments, but after experiencing Castle Rock myself...I feel that we would definitely stay there again and probably will considering I just called another resort that has an indoor park and they were so rude to me on the phone that I will never stay there!", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jenks, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cWorst \"Resort\" for the money, value and quality!\u201d", "Author": "annmarie318", "ReviewID": "UR72322083", "Content": "My kids and I spent a long weekend at Castle Rock Resort this past weekend. When I called for reservations, the first call told me there was nothing available even though as I sat online it showed rooms available. I decided to call and ask again. This time, I was told that there were rooms available overlooking the waterpark with a king bed and bunk beds. Since I had promised the kids we could stay there, I jumped on it. The room at first glance was nice. But the king bed was extraordinarily hard and the bunk beds just felt like an egg carton pad on a piece of plywood. My son slept there the first night. Started out on top and ended up on the bottom bunk. The next night, he chose the chair in the room. Top off the uncomfortable beds with no a/c. To even get the fan blowing on it, I had to lay down in the floor and stick my finger in a hole in order to get it turned on. Lucky I didn't electrocute myself. Housekeeping only straightened up the bed, not the bunks and did not replenish any of the supplies. If you forgot something, they sold it in their gift shop for ridiculous amounts ($3 for a sample size toothpaste). There was not a breakfast or anything else complimentary as there are in many other hotels in the Branson area. Parking was a nightmare. The lot was small and over flow was in a dark area around to the side. The water park was fairly enjoyable for the kids. They ran up and down going to the slides, but the open slide (you go down without a tube) was dangerous. I went down once and hurt my shoulder. My daughter (15 years old) went down it and bruised her ankle badly. She said that you had no control of yourself whatsoever and she just went flying up over the edges of the slide. The lazy river was fun, but would have been much better had there not been small kids running around without tubes. It was fast moving and hard to stop. You literally had to brace your feet on the bottom to avoid hitting little kids without a tube. This was about it other than some kiddie pools and a joke of a dumping bucket (similar to the ones at the Great Wolf Lodges, but it only filled with about a foot of water and dumped).

The rooms inside the renovated Tower building, with access to the indoor corridors/waterpark were $159, where as the Atrium building, were $109. We normally choose private balcony rooms, but since there were none, we chose a room on the extreme backside, farthest away from the waterpark and still was only about 30 seconds to walk through the parking area to access the outdoor park, which also led right to the inside park. ALL the lifeguards were very attentive, in which based on reviews, I wasn't expecting to see this. They were constantly moving around the vicinity of every slide, nook and cranny checking on every kid and thing going on. When we arrived, I went in, was greeted promptly and asked to see a room, they gave me a key card and I went on my way, when I saw the room was fine, we went and checked in. We chose the Atrium building, which were not as updated as the Tower building, but considering Branson and all the activities, as long as it was clean, we would only need it to sleep. The TV was fine, had plenty of channels and clear. The pools/park was very clean and the chlorine smell was not any different from any other water park I've ever been to, smelled CLEAN, in fact, I'm glad it did smell strong of chlorine, at least I know it was properly maintained for safety standards considering the amount of people visiting. If you want a basic room and don't mind a few second walk across their parking lot, the atrium building is fine for the money, considering what you get.

We had 3 rooms, one in the tower and two in the atrium. I will say that the atrium rooms were not as updated as our room in the tower seemed to be. When we arrived on Saturday afternoon, we checked in right away and had no issues. We were given wristbands for the water park. We put our bags in the room and were off to the waterpark. The kids were really excited since you could see it from the elevator lobby on the second floor (where our room was). The water park was good. We have stayed at several of these types of places in the last year and it was about average. My children (4 and 8) were able to use all of the slides and pools. I will say that the lifeguard at the bottom of the tube slide was slightly distracted which made me a bit nervous but I just made sure that I was there if my 4 year old needed assistance, which she didn't. We had to drag our kids out for dinner. I was disappointed that the waterpark closed at 5 on Sunday. We went to Silver Dollar City so we didn't get back until after then. So, we only got to use the waterpark once. One thing I have to say is that they did put the restrooms in a central location in case you need to hop out real quick. The room was decent. It looked remodeled (new carpeting, tile, lighting and fixtures). We had a fridge and a microwave. That was nice. The bunk bed did have extremely small mattresses on them. Kind of like an egg carton mattress covered with a sheet. But my kids were excited to have their \"master bedroom\" and did not complain. The bedspread on our bed had a stain on the underside of it so we didn't use it. I just put it on the floor and it was replaced with another the next day. They had extra blankets in the drawer which seemed new and were clean. The beds were horrible (hard and loud) like previous people said. There was a shortage of towels and the water was really hard but I do not expect perfection. They do not replenish the toiletries each day. We threw away the soap after using it for one day so we had to request another one. The shower head was low which was tough for anyone over 5 foot 10 inches. The iron and iron board were new. The breakfast buffet was cheap. However, the food was only mediocre. They did have several selections. Overall it was fine. I figured that it wasn't going to be 5 star since I only paid 130/night for the large tower room.

We had three small children, under the age of 3, with us that were so excited to be going to the water park. When we checked in, Lynn explained that the kiddie portion of the water park was closed but would be open the next day (Saturday). I explained that we each paid about $130 for our rooms so that our children could enjoy the water park. She was rude, wouldn\u2019t even look at me while speaking to me, and said that the kiddie pools would be open on Saturday. I explained that my youngest daughter and her family had to leave on Saturday she still did not offer a refund and kept her head down as if she was too busy to be bothered with us. I asked when the manager would be in and was told that he would be in on Saturday. Lynn stated that our kids could use the pool. I explained that our children were very little and were too small for the pool. And, that we specifically came to this hotel because of the kiddie pools. Once my youngest daughter and her family went to check out their room, they found that it had not been cleaned. The dirty linens were piled on the floor. We returned to the hotel lobby and they gave them another room. While going to their new room, they saw Lynn on her way (empty handed) to the first room they were sent to. They stopped to see what she was doing in there. After a couple of minutes, she came out (again, empty handed). They went and looked in the window, as she had left the curtains pulled back, and she had put the DIRTY linens back on the bed! YUCK! Our room was a king bed with Jacuzzi. We found rat droppings (Yes, rat turds) in our dresser and in the floor of the room. I would not recommend staying here for any reason!! Saturday morning I went back to the lobby to speak with the manager. Lynn stated that he was not going to be in until Monday. I asked if there was anyone else I could speak to. She went to the back and sent out Cathy who stated she was the \u201cowner\u201d. I explained everything to her and again, was told that there was nothing they could do about it. A few hours later, I received a phone call from Lynn who stated that she was going to give my daughter a 10% discount for their Friday night bill. Wow, $13 really made up for all of that. On Saturday morning we did spend a couple of hours at the water park and yes the kiddie pools were open. The water was freezing and the children could only stay in for a few minutes at a time. All of the doors were propped open because the lifeguards were hot and this made it even colder on the kids. While attempting to use one of the adult slides, I slipped and fell hurting my arm. The lifguard didn't even offer to help me up, or ask if I was OK. This was a nightmare and I'm so thankful it's over.

The kids bunks were not all that comfortable as they had approximately 2 inches of foam over a a hard base. The double beds where of average comfort. The shower was hot and had sufficient towels. The pool area is a water park with a lap/play pool up to 5 foot depth, 2 slides, a todler zero entry splash pool and a \"lazy river\". During our stay the lazy river appeared to have a significant algae problem that kept us out. The restaurant appeared to be of average to low quality but we didn't eat in it. For the money you should also consider the Grand Country Inn if you are looking for an indoor water park in Branson, MO. Castle Rock's has 3 advantages over this property. All of the rooms at Castle Rock's Main Building connect indoors to the water park (there are out side buildings as well). This is probably the main advantage depending on the time of year. The rooms in the main building are quite large. The Castle Rock has a dedicated kids sleeping area in its rooms. We have stayed at both properties a couple of times now, so have experience at both. In the end the hotel portion of Castle Rock is probably better then the alternative indoor water parks.

Dont go by old reviews... LOTS OF FUN!\u201d", "Author": "MissouriBusyMomOfTwo", "ReviewID": "UR38038412", "Content": "I nearly canceled my reservation after reading all the poor reviews from earlier in the year. I understand that some may have had bad experiences when the hotel first opened, but it seems that all that has been resolved. We arrived in mid-August, and we thought it was a blast. Sure, not a \"high end\" resort like some may think, but not a low end hotel either. Its somewhere in the middle for \"quality.\" Check in was fine, only 2 behind the desk at the time, and the line grew behind me....but we were pleased they let us check in two hours earlier than check in time. The water park was great, especially for little ones. Outside, a 3' pool, and a 1' wading pool with a couple of nice slides. Lots of area for parents to sit in chairs, chaise loungers, and tables with umbrellas. Inside, 2 other 3' pools, a 7\" wading area for itty bitty kids, and another large 1' wading area with three cool slides. Lots of water and sprinklers squirting everywhere. Upstairs was the lazy river, 2' 4\" deep. The only issue I had with that is that it went faster than expected for a \"lazy\" river. The current was fairly fast, and for a beginning swimmer, it may be too much for them without a flotation device or life jacket (of which they had tons for kids to use). My daughter is learning to swim, and at times I felt she might have gone under if she got caught with other people in their rafts, and she was pinched between. Once I saw her hand go up as she went under the water, and the lifeguard jumped up....but her head bobbed up a second later..... I told her to stay away from the rafts, b/c she could get pulled under. Lots of fun though, water everywhere for those who like to get wet! As for the room quality, the vanity was a nice marble, carpet was clean, bathroom was new and clean, beds were clean, the only thing I thought could have been improved was there was no refrigerator or microwave. PROS: lots of lifeguards at the pool, and they werent just sitting around either. Very alert, walking around the entire time, watching the pool. Towels provided, no need to take any. Felt very safe, and we didnt use a locker. Nothing was ever touched. Lots of tables around to sit. Kids loved the pool areas, and our older child liked the water slide. (the other one was not working). Nice and clean rooms, no bugs (like another post mentioned), clean linens, nice TV, cool area for the kids to sleep in the bunk beds..... Another plus for a fussy mom, the public bathroom outside the pool area was clean and nice. Lots of showers for those who stay across the lot in the other hotel. We will visit again. CONS: no continental breakfast... strange that a hotel this nice doesnt have an area for breakfast, but they told me I could get b'fast in the restaurant. We never did visit the restaurant, b/c we had places we wanted to eat off site. Laundry facilities were still not in order as they have on their hotel map. I went to check so I could do a load before leaving, and the hook ups are there, but no machines. I never did ask tho, if there were machines on another floor. I agree the beds are hard as rocks, and creak when you move. I am one tho that travels with ear plugs due to \"noises\" not heard at my house. So I plug up every time I travel. I couldnt sleep the first night very well due to the mattress, but I was so tired the 2nd nite, I did sleep. Kids will sleep anywhere, so they didnt complain. Another \"issue\" for me personally, that doesnt affect my family is \"noises.\" I noticed I could hear bratty kids upstairs jumping on the beds and running thru the halls....... didnt notice noise from neighbors on the same hall we were, but upstairs, yes. This could be at any hotel, however. Our only \"complaints\" were the laundry facility and we had to get our cards recharged the 2nd day. Ive been at other hotels where cards need recharged, so that's no biggie. Considering all the other complaints on this website, ours were very minor. If you're expecting a high end hotel, this is not the place. I put the quality as one you might have at a 2 or 3 star, but still very clean and nice (especially considering the water park connected). I think I would say this only due to the beds......at other hotel chains, they have NICE mattresses & linens. And, they have microwaves and refrigerators.

We stayed in the new main building with the waterpark. My two boys, 5 & 7 loved their bunk bed with their own TV. I was impressed that the rooms were newer and clean. We went to the waterpark which the boys loved. The lazy river looked dirty - kinda like river water - I got in and got splashed and it felt like my eyes were disenegrating - the chlorine was so strong!!!! I immediatley had to get out and find a towel. I don't know how my boys were able to stand it - they did the waterslides for a couple of hours. I just sat and watched with my eyes burning still. That night my poor 5yr olds eyes were all bloodshot and looked like he got punched in both eyes. They had dark circles underthem and were all puffy. Then we went back to our room and I seen these weird bugs crawling on the wall in the boys bunk den. I've never seen bugs like this before-freaked me out when I went to kill them and they moved REAL fast. I killed 3 of them - then in the morning when I was taking a shower I seen 3 more!! Also, other reviews stated there was free breakfast-fruit, bagels, yogurt, etc. The night before I had asked someone where that was, and they said the continental breakfast was in the restaurant. My husband got up early and went down to get something to eat. He asked someone again and they also told him it was in the restaurant. When he went to check it out, they were hateful with him and said they quit that a week ago - It would be nice if they would update the other workers so they are not telling guests there is breakfast. The workers attitude about it really pissed off my husband - in the meantime I was freaking out about the bugs because I seen MORE. We decided then, after seeing my 5 yr olds eyes still red that we would not be staying another night. When I went to tell the front desk I spoke to a manager and told her about the bug situation. She said they spray everyday because of the waterpark and it was probably just waterbugs. Acted like it was no big deal. She did immediatly send mainteneace up, and I showed him the bugs (I noticed even more hiding up in the corners and creases of the walls) He said he would be right back to spray - I told him to just wait until we were gone because we were leaving right away. Also, the waterpark does have a lot of lifeguards on duty -which are all teenagers. I wasn't impressed that they blew the wistle on my 5yr old for running (kids get excited), but then they can goof off and flirt with each other by throwing cups of water at each other and one even ran up to the girl he was changing shifts with and knocked her in the water!!! - don't blow the wistle on my kid, then do something that would have gotten anyone else in trouble!!!", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Smith, AR", "Title": "\u201cOverall, very good, we would stay again\u201d", "Author": "FtSmithDad", "ReviewID": "UR34133304", "Content": "I read some of the reviews on here and to be honest, I was a little skeptical about booking our stay at Castle Rock. But I got the impression the bad reviews were from people who stayed in the old Atrium building. So I thought what the heck, we will give it a try. We stayed July 3-5th in the new Tower building. The room was clean. It is your typical motel room so don't expect anyting too fancy. The kids bunkbed room was very handy and my kids enjoyed having their own TV. The only downside to the room was that I requested a fridge for the kids drinks but they did not have one available. Luckily I planned for that and brought a cooler and just kept filling it up with ice from the ice machine that was on our floor (3rd floor has the ice machine). The other issue we had was our room had no wash cloths, only large towels. I called the front desk around 9 pm to ask for some. At 10 pm I still did not have any, so I went down to the front desk and there was a young girl working and she said she still had it written down but she was the only one working so she could not leave the desk. She was waiting for the maintenence man to come back from the other building to run them up to me. So I just took them myself. No big deal but a little frustrating. They were understaffed for a holiday weekend. The water park was great. It is good for young kids. Older kids and adults won't get much out of it. My kids are 6 and 3 and they had a blast. There were a lot of lifeguards on duty, all teenagers of course. All the pools and rides were working and it was clean. They do have some strict rules, like no outside floateys or pool toys, etc that seemed a bit strange. But all and all, it was much better than I expected and we would go there again.

The lifeguards were great.....I love the fact that I didn't feel like I had to be right by my kid's side when they were playing. There were more than enough life guards and they were very attentive and very friendly. They also had a few little activities for the kids in the later part of the day, which was very nice. The rooms were ok. The kids loved the bunkbeds!!! The only negative on that is that we couldn't hear our TV over there TV and vice versa. The bunk beds had a very thin mattress, but the kids didn't complain. The beds for the adults however were terrible!!! They were very uncomfortable and very small. I thought I was getting a queen bed, but it was a full bed. The breakfast wasn't what I expected. They just had bagels, cereal, danishes, bananas and apples. I was hoping for a waffle maker or biscuts and gravy or something hot that we could eat. The restraunt in the hotel was not open yet, but when it is open it will be a nice touch. The staff was friendly.....not overly friendly, but ok. There was one staff member that was very rude to my daughters when they went to ask for towels. We went down to address the situation and she had stepped away from the front desk, but someone else behind the desk apologized to us and said she was just a \"grumpy\" person. In my opinion, a \"grumpy\" person should not be working in a place where customer service is important......and they especially shouldn't be working the late shift. I would stay at this resort again, just because the kids loved playing in the water park, but I still believe that the cost is a little pricey. One other thing....they definately need some type of steps going from the lower parking lot up to the hotel door.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Branson", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT STAY HERE\u201d", "Author": "rileezmom", "ReviewID": "UR28209539", "Content": "So I made my reservation back in March to stay at the Castle Rock Resort for my son's birthday.

One person was at the desk and had to keep answering phones. Several manager types sat at a nearby table as the line got longer oblivious to what was going on. When it was finally my turn the clerk disappeared for 2 minutes without saying \"excuse me\" or \"I'll be right back\" or anything. This got us off on the wrong foot. -Advertised restaurant was not open yet. -Arcade room was empty. -I didn't realize their was a breakfast until the last day. There are no signs or brochures about it. -The room did not have anything that told you about the hotel or a map or anything. -The stuff on the walls (I'm missing the word for this) comes off very easily. -The phone was not connected to the wall. The cord was still wrapped up like someone just took it out of the package and set it on the table. -We decided to take the stairs that were near our room down to the waterpark instead of the elevators which were far away. Big mistake. We assumed this being a hotel that the stairs were inside. Well they were surrounded by concrete walls, but as soon as the door closed I realized something was not right, but the door had already locked behind us. We went down the very cold stairs and at the bottom it was open. It appears the stairs will be to the outdoor waterpark (when it opens). But there were no signs anything. There was no way back into the hotel at the bottom. Only a locked door to the waterpark and the open parking lot. After shivering and banging on the door for awhile a lifeguard let us in. This was a nice embarrassing way to start our stay. -The entrance is a long way from the parking lot. It got really crowded around the front entrance during heavy checkout/in times. -The elevators were busy and slower than any I have ever been on. -There seemed to be a lot of managers milling around doing nothing important. -The mattress was very uncomfortable and sort of popped like the side of a plastic trash can when you push in on the side and then let go. -No one told us nor was it written anywhere that we were supposed to leave our wristbands on for the waterpark for our second day. When I asked the front desk clerk for wristbands she informed me that we were supposed to leave them on, but she did give us some more telling us like a third grade teacher that she would make an exception for us this time. -I don't want to sleep with a wristband on. -The space for washers and dryers had no washers and dryers on any floor. -No hot tubs!!! The Good: -The lifeguards were very aware and friendly (much friendlier than their older, bitter managers). -My 5 year old loved the lazy river and the slides were fun. -The flat screen televisions were nice. I realize there are always kinks to work out on any new adventure, but you need to have your hotel ready before you open it to people (unless you specify what parts are not yet ready before people arrive). Hopefully they get some of this worked out as time goes.

We did take a tower room since the price was a little better. The site for them leads you to believe that the rooms are just the same, but just not in the main building. We were hoping for a very good weekend for just our 10 year old son and us. When we checked in they gave us the keys and we proceeded to our room. What a nightmare those tower rooms are. Those tower rooms are a old hotel that they bought and never did anything with. We called the front desk and my husband spoke with one of the managers. We explained that their website was very misleading and we wanted a different room. He then told him that they were working on updating their website as we speak. My husband told him that we booked our room way before he started \"\"UPDATING\" his website. He told us more less there wasn't anything he could do. I went over to the desk and told them we would like to check out. She ended up giving us a room in the main building with two queens and bunk beds. Rooms were ok. Much better than the TOWER rooms. You do not get what you pay for at this hotel. This is not a resort. The resturaunt was closed. The breakfast they offered was extremely basic. The game room consisted of 4 video games. Most of the front office staff was very rude including the managers. The water park is in comparison to the other indoor water park in Branson. It is nice here that only hotel guests can go. It was not over crowded like the other one. The pool staff was very friendly. I would say do some price negotiations if you should stay here. Do not stay in the tower rooms unless you are wanting a motel instead of a hotel. I will give cudos on the water park and the main rooms are descent.

He is one of the rudest mangagers I think I have ever had to deal with. I checked into the hotel on Monday and checked out on Wed. I paid cash for my stay; but the hotel also charged my credit card not once but twice for my stay. A $323.60 stay ended up costing over $1200.00; when I contacted Michael to get the charges removed he was friendly at first and got 2 of the charges off. So after 48 hours 2 charges were still on my account; once again I contacted Michael; he told me once again he was working on this, after a few words he informed me if I was not nicer it would take a little longer than usual for the charges to get removed from my account, he was not concerned that I was calling the Better Business Bureau or my bank on the fraudulent charges. He also would not let me talk with his superior and hung up on me. Luckily the bank removed the chargers since I have my receipt showing I paid cash and I am contacting the Better Business Bureau.

The front desk was very busy when we checked in at 2 p.m. with only 3 clerks working with 3 to 5 people in each line so it took about 30 minutes to check in. The desk clerks would also be answering the phone to take new reservations and provide information while checking people in. The package included 2 nights in a room with 2 double beds and 2 bunkbeds, water park passes for 4, breakfast for 4 each day, $30 restaurant credit which was changed to a gift shop credit because the restaurant is not open yet, and a small tote bag with 4 20oz. soft drinks and 4 single serve bags of chips. The hotel rooms are large with a flat screen tv in the main room with the 2 double beds and one in the bunkbed alcove. There is no door on the alcove so it is not a true separate room in my opinion. There is a blanket and flat sheet folded on the end of each bunk bed. I was glad to find that they did use fitted sheets and a mattress protector on the double beds. Mattresses were firm. We had brought food for snacks and lunches to cut down on meal expenses but unfortunately the micro/fridge that was mentioned on the website was no where to be found. The front desk said they were backordered but would try to get us one from the hotel next door. It never arrived. Toliet paper holder in bathroom was already coming off the wall. Air conditioning was not calibrated to temperature programmed into unit. It seemed to run on its own schedule. Breakfast was offered in the banquet room with large tables so you had to share tablespace with others. Food available was several types of single serve cereal, apples, bananas one day and canned peaches one day, danishes, donuts, milk, orange juice, coffee, and water all of which appeared to have been purchased from a warehouse club type store. Not worth the room charge in my opinion. The water park is very nice and the room was warm. There is only one true swimming pool and it is medium in size and crowded at times. 2 little kids wading pools with small slides and play areas. A plunge pool for the slide. There are two slides but one isn't in operation yet. Upstairs, there is the lazy river which has a sand bottom and a choice of single or double float rings. There is also an outdoor pool play area that they are still building. There are no hot tubs. We talked with one of the lifeguards and he said this was the most common compliant. The area is well staffed with lifeguards and they were quick to respond with swimmers that demonstrated even the slightest difficulty in the water. They were also quick to clean up any standing water and quickly cleaned up when a child hit his mouth on the side of one of the pools and bled a small amount.

We could have set them by our wall unit to dry. There were lifeguards everywhere monitoring the pool areas, slides, lazy river and toddler areas - they really paid attention. I would like to suggest they put down slip resistant strips on the tile from the pool area to the elevators as it stayed wet with all the traffic.
