Since when is rust on all the shelves inside the fridge and old food from whoever stayed there a sanity thing? I brought food to put in the fridge and was so surprised to see the condition of it. A mini fridge is not that expensive to replace nor would new shelving be. I wish I had brought my own towels to this place because every towel I picked up had brown large stains or weird green stains. They looked very dirty. On top of that, Tammy the house keeper left a tip envelope with her name on it. A little suggestion to \"Tammy,\" if you want tips, do your job properly. I relied on reviews and saw a printed trip adviser top rating flyer framed at the front desk. I feel misled! I honestly want compensated after staying here!!

We had to call and ask for some towels. Also bring your own toiletries such as shampoo and a hairdryer. I spayed the entire room and looked for any unwanted tiny visitors, but everything was okay (thank God). I also looked at night, i am a little paranoid on finding bed bugs or anything else, but i have to say Nothing! The motel is a 30 second walk to the beach. It is a supper easy walk for children especially holding chairs, umbrella, sand toys, etc. It is definitely not the nicest hotel but i do have to say for the price compared to the other hotels in the strip it is the best price.

The ice machine really needs to be updated to accommodate the guests. I hope that the management will look into this issue as I am not the only one to complain.

The motel also has a temperature regulated pool, which was accessible through one gate, whose latch was high up -- perfect for keeping children out of the pool area, or in it. The pool was clean and pristine, as were the poolside chaises and tables. Once we checked out, we were still able to access both the pool and restrooms that featured showers -- quite handy once we were finished with our last jaunt to the beach!
