He told us about the airport bus located just one and a half blocks away which was perfect for airport transit and much cheaper than a cab ( 45 euros for 3 people one way) It was cheaper if you did round trip. Our room was tiny! (have a 12 year old who slept on a cot) but the bathroom was surprisingly large. The room was very clean and very quiet and the price was excellent for Paris. Also, location was superb, right off the Champs d'Elysees and the Arc de Triompe. ( well worth the trip to the top). Also a metro is very close and easy to get to other tourist attractions....AC was working in our room very well, and we said no to the 18 euro breakfast, but ate at a nearby cafe for 6 euros each. If you see the Indian housekeeper, he is super friendly, and in fact has worked there for 20 years. Maybe he needs to be at the front desk instead, that would really make guests feel at home. P.S. when I tried to print my boarding passes I could not from the hotel computer and the person behind the front desk was not helpful at all and sent me to a cyber cafe to print. I was upset with the manner in which she treated us.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat location & nice staff\u201d", "Author": "whirlwindkel", "ReviewID": "UR47089786", "Content": "I choose the Hotel Princesse Caroline because I couldn't get a decent rate on another hotel that was recommended in the area. This one was more reasonably priced and just steps away from the Arch de Triomphe. The location was fantastic and the staff was friendly and helpful. They were very patient with non-French speaking visitors. The room was delightful. I felt like I was in my own bedroom in a Victorian house. It was quite roomy for a European hotel room. I rated the room 4 instead of 5 though because it might be a little too feminine for male travelers. The hotel also loses a few points for service because it didn't provide an iron and the laundry service had limited hours, therefore I had to resort to trying to turn my bathroom into a steamroom to get wrinkles out of my clothes. I would definitely go back and recommend this hotel to friends. In fact, I had tried to book a room when I returned to Paris a few days later but the hotel was booked!

They are either very expensive or very small, noisy and sometimes dirty. The Princesse Caroline is a good compromise which I have stayed at 4 times now. The rooms I have had have varied from small to large, but have not been the tiny \"just fits a bed \" that many hotels provide in the area. The rooms are always clean. The antique furniture makes a nice change from the \"Holiday Inn\" style desk and chair. Bathrooms again are small, but not as small as many. Reception staff are always helpful and I have never yet had cause to complain about anything. Some of the rooms are certainly air conditioned, but I cannot remember if this applies to all. The breakfast is about average for a Paris hotel but is expensive, so I usually take breakfast in one of the many cafe's nearby. The Hotel is very close to the Charles de Gaulle Etoile RER/Metro station which allows me to get to anywhere in Paris very easily, this being one of the main reasons I stay there.

The first room was stuffy and smelt strongly of air freshener - I suspected an effort to disguise some illicit smokers. (One of the unforseen downsides of the smioking ban is that instead of being confined to smoking rooms smokers are now put everywhere and inevitably some break the rules - so perhaps non smokers also are actually worse off?) The second room was fine, but had twin beds,and as I was being joined by my girlfriend for the second night, I asked for a double bed. The request was granted the following morning without delay and we were put at the back of the hotel and avoided incidental street noise so was even better off. My only grouse was that the window frame in the bathroom was rotting and in need of replacement, However, unless you're in a hurry, I suggest you avoid the breakfast, which is overpriced at 18 Euros and a distinctly uninteresting buffet,.", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cour romantic week end in Paris\u201d", "Author": "the_crazy_traveller", "ReviewID": "UR11947953", "Content": "We left hotel Princess Caroline yesterday at noon.

Our room 347 (sorry for I took the key as a souvenir) was at the 4\u00c2\u00b0 floor,very clean, with a lovely king size bed, a sofa for two and a complete bathroom.
