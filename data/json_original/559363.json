I stayed in a room with the Bosphorus view which is phenomenal from a view perspective with a decent size balcony. The room itself was also very well decorated and spacious. Bathroom was also nice but the shower worked adequately. Could 't help but agreeing with some of the reviewers below about the service. There wasn't any untoward incident as such but 'service with a smile' was somewhat missing. The breakfast area is also well located next to sea - however we sat inside given the January weather - but the selection somewhat limited. Overall, a very pleasant hotel in a nice part of town - ideal for a romantic trip but do go for the sea view room.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cExcellent position, wonderful room, good facilities but poor management\u201d", "Author": "Utku67", "ReviewID": "UR116753122", "Content": "In my opinion price/quality ratio is not excellent because of the weak room services and management.

This is a 15 minute taxi ride from Sultanahmet past the Ciragan Palce Hotel. We stayed one night here August 1 and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in this peaceful suburb. The hotel, small but very well appointed,is right on the Bosphorus. We could lie in bed counting the ships going up and down the sparkling waterway. Our room was very large with a comfortable bed and linens, Moulton Brown products in the bathroom, and immaculate. Our lunch and breakfast here were excellent with fine service. This is an upscale suburb where many expats live so there are good restaurants and shops. Across the street are several: 2 excellent bookshops with numerous paperbacks and coffee table books in English about Turkey; a small produce shop with luscious ripe fruits; small shops selling clothing and bath products like Turkish towels, etc. A peaceful oasis that I would highly recommend.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best experiences ever\u201d", "Author": "world_traveller_golf", "ReviewID": "UR114612570", "Content": "I stayed 3 nights with my wife and 2 sons (19 and 17).

The reason she recommended this hotel for us was because it was close to her home and it did have an old world charm but if you are here for work, it's a little frustrating. The hotel itself is small elegant hotel in the village of Bebek which is supposedly comparable to the Hamptons...one would wonder why my colleague would recommend this hotel because I was pretty annoyed at the end of trip for her to recommend this hotel to us. Even though the check in was flawless, the rest of my trip was lost in translation. They barely spoke any English and it's was a lot of sign language and lots of pointing around. The room was pretty good with all dark wood fixture and a sitting area. The shower is a little small for anybody to maneuver around even though I am 5'5\" and 125 pounds and I kept pumping into the glass...amenities were a little outdated but usable. Wall is paper thin because two nights in a row, I heard a couple \"doing\" their thing and I was just too tired to even dial the phone to complain. My colleague said the same thing and we just laughed about it because we were good sleepers and went back to sleep. The breakfast was good being we are in Europe since most of the hotels just served continental breakfast but they are willing to served us hot eggs but the service is slow, too about 20 minutes...I also had lunch on the patio with a good view of the Bosphorous but the service again is very slow for a plate of pasta which took at least 25 minutes and I'm practically the only person on the patio having lunch while the rest of the people were just having drinks. The hotel is really far from everything because I took two days off and want to go sightseeing and everything is at least an hour away...I met up with a friend that I bumped into at the plane ride from NY to Istanbul and I went to her hotel which is called Ibrahim Pasha Hotel in Sultanahmet and it is night and day compare to mine. It's a trendy boutique hotel near EVERYTHING and the staff spoke really good English with all modern amenities and the rate is half of mine... One of the main reason that I gave this place a low score is because even though they were charging us by Turkish Lira per night, they had to charge us Euro with credit card and it depends on the exchange rate per day? I tried to argue to the reception but it was 5am in the morning and I had a plane to catch to go to Italy, we decided just pay for it since we will never come back to this hotel ever again and the company is paying for it.... Only if you speak Turkish and wanted a very romantic getaway with a good understanding of the area and hotel policy with no intention of sightseeing....otherwise, I would suggest to stay away from this hotel.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankara, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location,Poor service...\u201d", "Author": "anil_talasli", "ReviewID": "UR69872010", "Content": "I have been to Bebek Hotel several times but the last one was worth mentioning.

The service was at times good, such as when a porter added credit to my mobile phone for me, however they were quite stingy with the breakfasts. The hotel is relatively expensive, and yet when I arrived on a Friday morning (early) and wanted to have some tea and fruit by the Bosphorous, they insisted on changing me a whopping equivalent of about 35USD.

Overpriced and dreadful) The Bebek Hotel offered an excellent breakfast and service in all respects. We splurged on a water view room and trust me, it's worth it. The view from the balcony alone is fantastic. The only problem with this location (which is unfortunately a rather large one) is that there is no real public transport from here to the city. You can take the ferry from Bebek into town but it runs very infrequently, to say the least. Thus, we had to take a taxi quite a bit and its a long and $$ trip.
