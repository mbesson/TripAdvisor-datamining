{"Reviews": [{"Content": "corporate hotel for corporate visitors thats it This hotel is exactly what it is supposed to be. It is a corporate hotel for people visiting this corporate area. Why would you stay in outlying area of any city where there are corporate headquarter unless to visit them. so be a turist at the Intercon or other hotels near the tourist areas. The hotel has 2 types of rooms huge suites and regular rooms. The suite is about $50-100 more expensive. You stay here because you want to stay in a sheraton and you want no surprises. The gym area is good and the massages are only $60 an hour for a hotel a bargain. The breakfast has the handmade omelettes 5 types of fresh juice and cheeses. It is $15 or so. I hate people who rave about this hotel and if you check this is the only hotel they have written about so they are obviously a plant. This is a 10 years old hotel. There are 6 other hotels in 5 minutes. Look at them and decide.", "Date": "May 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR401836573", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jimnick"}, {"Content": "Hit and Miss I'm mixed on this hotel. Rooms are great for working or chilling out. Seperate living room, bar, bedroom and bathroom. Plasma TV in bedroom. Nice rooms to come home to after a day of work.On the other hand, my air conditioner did not work very well, and it was not particularly hot. This caused me to open the small slit window in the bedroom... which cooled the room, but made it very loud as the hotel is above a busy street.Breakfast buffet was average, maybe a bit above. Didn't get a newspaper.As mentioned, very safe location, not convenient for tourism. Mostly for people working in the offices in Santa Fe, or evening. Also relatively convenient to people flying into Toluca airport.", "Date": "Apr 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR634347996", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "djcn0te"}, {"Content": "Avoid We were dissappointed. Do not book this hotel on Expedia or on any other website except perhaps for Starwood's. You will experience problems if you ignore this advice and the hotel's wooden and unhelpful staff will dissuade you from ever staying in another Sheraton hotel anywhere. In our case, we booked one night here via Expedia, with breakfast included. Upon arrival, the hotel receptionists told us a) the rate was too low to include breakfast ($160 per night in a ghost town suburb!); b) we didn't book the room correctly; c) and Expedia's response was it's not their fault - we rely on information the hotel gives us (Expedia). We have lived in the Santa Fe neighborhood for 2 years and stayed in this hotol solely because we are moving, and the packing-out is disruptive. The neighborhood is dull. The only reason to stay in Santa Fe is to be near the headquarters of the major corporations based here and if that's the case, the nearby Fiesta Inn, Fiesta Americana, Camino Real, NK and Stadia's are as least as nice and certainly not less helpful.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR367927463", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "namremaz"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel I stayed a week on this Hotel and loved it. The rooms are suites and are very oversized. You have a big bedroom, large living room, nice bathroom with glass shower, and bar. The workout facility is second to none as it literally has all the equipment you would expect to find in a full-size health club. The location of the hotel is in a upscale, commercial area. I never felt unsafe walking day or night. There are plenty of nice restaurants in the area. I'd recommend the restaurant named Guadiana that is about 5 blocks from the hotel. It has a great, modern atmosphere with outstanding food. You can expect to pay about $40-50 per person but it\u9225\u6a9a worth it. Overall the staff at the hotel was extremely hospitable and I will be sure to stay here again.

I noticed that during my last stay a couple of things have been overlooked such as a bad electric receptacle with a wire hanging out and meldew spots on the shower. This is a great hotel with excellent service but it looks like they are missing the small details. I love this hotel because I can walk to the company that I visit with no worries.
