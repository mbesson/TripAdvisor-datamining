Everything else seemed to be clean, just worn out. My sister's stayed in another apartment that had been renovated and was much nicer. The night clubs in the area are very noisy and Oxford Street is full of \"alternative\" people, not a family area. There are lots of good restaurants nearby.

We would have been gone as soon as we got to the motel if we had another motel to go to, but as it was night time, we had nowhere else. As soon as we saw the carpark, we knew the rest of the motel (apartment) was not going to be good. Then we smelled curry from the people taking residence in the apartment. The walls were cracking and peeling and desperately needed paint. It smelled of dust and mould, we could not sit on the couches because, as my sister said, it looked like someone had died and decomposed on them. Out of curiousity, I looked in the drawers. There were bits of dirt in there. Anyone planning to use any of the cooking utensils would have to have been desperate. The toilet paper was cheap, Black and Gold. You would think they would have hidden the packaging, but no, it was left in the toilet for display! The towel rack was held on with masking tape, which was brown. The water in the bathroom would not turn off, and there was no hot water in the shower or toilet. On the bathroom sink, there was a hair. And it was not a head hair. Each bed only had one pillow, meaning that we had to put our clothes underneath and fold the pillow in half in order to have some comfort. The blankets were so dirty that we did not sit on the bed while they were there, to avoid the very likely case of getting fleas or some kind of disease, and we took them off before trying to go to sleep. It was a Saturday night, and the nightclub across the road was so noisy that we didn't get any sleep until 3:00 AM. They kept playing annoying music, too. Long music, like 'Stairway To Heaven' and 'What Goes Around Comes Around'. Whilst I attempted to go to sleep, I put my folded pillow on the bedside table to be more comfortable, which didn't work out. I even tried sleeping on the wrong end of the bed to try to get away from the noise and be more comfortable. Because we had no blankets, we were cold. In the morning, we left as early as we could... or we tried to. The gate wouldn't let us out, meaning we were trapped for possibly more than thirty minutes. The best, and most valuable part of the motel was, shamefully, the 'Sydney' book. I would not recommend this apartment to anyone with higher standards than feral people who let their houses get this way.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucestershire, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood value for a family short stay\u201d", "Author": "stillwaters11", "ReviewID": "UR16985225", "Content": "We stayed at the Parkridge for 3 nights, as we were meeting up with my new husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 young teenagers in Sydney and wanted somewhere to stay in Sydney with 2 bedrooms. The Parkridge more than did the job. The location is excellent and the apartment had 2 decent sized bedrooms (1 double, 1 twin) with a dining table and chairs, living area (with sofa, chair, coffee table, tv), kitchen, utility area (with washing machine and dryer) and 2 good-sized bathrooms with shower cubicles (1 also with bath) which was an unexpected surprise that came in useful with a 16 year old female about! I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment about the cleaning/servicing aspect of the apartments because we were there for such a short space of time compared to many people and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require this. The room was spotless when we arrived though, with plenty of towels/hairdryers etc. Likewise we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the pool area. We were on the 10th floor, and had a small balcony with a table and 2 chairs. We could just about see the top of the Opera House from there and were treated to the hundreds of bats flying over from the Botanic Gardens every evening at dusk! The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is a little dated/tatty and the TV aerial was in need of some attention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my husband managed to fix the socket back into the wall with 10mins of TLC, but the reception was patchy. Likewise, some of the kitchen cupboards had seen better days, but everything did at least work and, for the price and location, I think we got a good deal. The guy that runs the place was extremely helpful when we arrived with regards to providing us maps and giving us local info about where to go/when/how to get there etc. Security is also good with an electronic key tag to get in the building after 6pm, and the same tag needed to be inserted into the lifts at all times in order to get them to move. Buses stop virtually outside (there are stops all the way along Oxford St) and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 5-10min walk to the Museum train station, 15mins to the main Central station. We bought a weekly pass that gave us use of the trains, buses and ferries and found it invaluable.", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cParkridge review\u201d", "Author": "planearm", "ReviewID": "UR10768688", "Content": "Excellent location. Everything within walking distance. The main advantage of this place is the price. We stayed in Sydney for a month so we had to pick somewhere cheap. However it does come with drawbacks. Dated furnishings, a tumble dryer older than Moses that sounded like an aircraft taking off, tiny balcony with no room to swing a cat, small pool downstairs with only about 5 sunbeds and the sun vanishes by the afternoon behind the buildings. But our main concern was the cleaning (or lack of it). You are told the rooms are serviced twice a week but I'm afraid they are not.

The pool area is lovely and the apartments are very spacious with some good views (we were on the 12th floor) However we had some pretty bad service, our booking was for one week and despite being told that the apartment would be serviced twice a week, after 5 nights it still had not been done. At the same time one of the taps broke in the bathroom and so only after I had to call to ask for that to be fixed did they finally service our apartment, the day before we left. On check out we said that we were not very happy at not even getting clean towels until the penultimate day of our stay and were told (not in a polite way) that the room had been serviced mid week, implicating that we had lied and asked for it to be done when it had been done already. This in itself was bad enough but it was the manner in which we were spoken to which very aggresive, threatening and involved us being told to shut up that has left us feeling very upset and we certianly will not be staying there again. We did not receive a single apology for the delay in servicing, we just got shouted at for complaining. In addition to this, there was no hand towel in the room for the first 6 days, the toilet roll was not replenished even on servicing (we had to buy our own) and on checking under our bed on leaving we found a dead cockroach - the whole place needed a very good clean.
