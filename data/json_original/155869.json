The hotel is a great location - right across the street from Alameda Central Park where there are markets galore. The rooms themselves are clean, but security seems to be a little bit of a problem. The door on our room clearly showed that people had busted through at some point, and this was a bit worrying at first. However, we had no problems with theft etc, and by the 3 days staying at this hotel, it was like normal. As a precaution though, we used the hotel's safety security boxes for passports and extra cash etc. It is good, they have 1 key, you get the other and the box cannot be opened without both keys. Service from the front counter is quite poor - however if you meet Ruben, he was absolutely lovely and tried to help us with everything that we asked about. The restaurant food is good, and we had a few meals. They also have free wifi - you just need a password that they give you at checkin. Other downfalls of the hotel, is that it is quite dated and rooms do not have air conditioning or fans, and it can be quite noisy if you have a room facing the street. Our room faced onto the street, where the pub on the corner and the building across the road played extremely loud music for hours on end.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLocation amazing - hotel alright\u201d", "Author": "MistOll", "ReviewID": "UR74849782", "Content": "The first thing is location - it is simply perfect.

Literally 45 minutes after checking in! We got to the room, left our bags, went out to have a wander around the area and when we returned the lock had been broken and some of our stuff gone. The hotel management were somewhat helpful - they apologised and moved us to a much nicer room, but think it was pretty likely that someone in the hotel was responsible!

This was my third visit to Mexico City and I knew that I wanted to stay near Alameda Central because it is my favorite place. This hotel was the cheapest available with a location near to Alameda Central and so we decided to take our chances. We had a perfect stay! We travelled from the airport by metro stop Hildalgo. From there it was a short walk through the park to the hotel. The hotel is tall and labelled well so that we could find it very easily. The room was spotless clean and very simple. The television had one English station. The shower was amazing....BIG, clean, with nice tiles. The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. They helped us find and book day-tours. When I left my bag of souvenirs on one of the tour buses, they called the driver and tracked it down. They appreciated the little Spanish I tried to speak and sort of 'adopted us'...always looking out for our needs. I read reviews that mentioned the tour groups. We did see that, but the tour groups were handled very efficiently. We would look in the lobby and it would be packed with the tour group, but as soon as we walked up to the counter, we got big smiles and fast service. The hotel is just feet away from the park. Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. On Sunday it was fun to see all the bikes going by. I can't stress enough that location was perfect. .....and as cheap as it was...it's a steal!

The main reason to choose Hotel San Francisco is cost. You can get a room with two full-size beds for just $40, by taking advantage of discounts that are perpetually available through Otel, Expedia, CheapTickets, and other sites. You cannot get this rate by showing up without a reservation -- the normal rate is about $70. If you can't get a room at a discount rate, don't bother -- there are better hotels in Mexico City. The rooms seem to be in various states of remodeling -- I've had some nice rooms in this hotel, and some rooms where everything was stained and cracked. All of them were acceptable. The hotel is on a side street, a five-minute walk from the metro, the Palacio of Bellas Artes, and the edge of the Centro Historico shopping area. The safety of the neighborhood is acceptable, but there are plenty of safer places to stay in Mexico City. (Go just a few blocks north of the hotel, and you'll be in the rough Col. Guerrero/La Laguanilla district -- not a safe place to be at night at all.) The biggest problem with this hotel is all the construction in the neighborhood. The 1985 earthquake damaged or destroyed most of the buildings on the block where the hotel sits. The hotel was repaired and opened after about a year, but the building next door was razed and is only recently being reconstructed. Construction is loud, dusty, and begins early in the morning. At times, the street in front of the hotel is closed, and taxis must drop you a block away. Every once in a while, something happens to the sewer, and horrible-smelling sewer gas enters the rooms through the drains. The construction probably explains why this decent hotel in a safe neighborhood is so cheap. The rooms in this hotel are constructed in a more \"closed\", carpted, sterile modern style, rather than in the traditional \"open\", tiled, ventilated Mexican style. This helps cut down on the construction noise, but you can still loudly hear it in the morning. You might ask for a room not facing the construction. Beware that this hotel may have security and theft problems. The rooms do not have card-key locks like newer hotels have. On a recent stay, hundreds of dollars worth of silver was stolen from a friend's room. This wasn't enough to deter me from staying there again, because I carry nothing valuable, and every cheap hotel in Mexico City potentially has theft problems; however, be sure that you lock anything of value in the hotel safe. Interestingly enough, Hotel Del Angel and Suites Del Angel are owned by the same management company as this hotel.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "grand rapids, minnesota", "Title": "\u201cdecent hotel - TONS of construction in area though\u201d", "Author": "hejsan", "ReviewID": "UR3573327", "Content": "We just stayed at this hotel for 4 nights on a vacation.
