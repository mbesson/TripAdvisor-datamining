After visiting with Xenia we walked next door for dinner to a cute little market where they sold fresh hot food and groceries. In the morning we were served a filling Euro breakfast and Xenia was available to help us plan our days journey. We caught a bus in front of a pizzaria around the corner.

Travel to and from the center of Rome took my family 1.25 - 1.75 hours each way. You have to take a bus from the Castle to the second to last stop on the A subway line. There are at least 10 bus stops between the Castle and where the bus leaves from the subway and it is very difficult to identify the correct stop at night. There is only one restaurant within walking distance of the Castle (though it is good). The Castle's claim that it is \"minutes\" from the Vatican is extremely misleading unless \"75 minutes\" is what you had in mind. Thankfully (because I doubt many cab's could ever find the place) we had booked the hotel's \"limousine service\" (a compact car) to pick us up the train station - even by car it took 1.5 hours because of the great distance and traffic. 2. The service and rooms are at best 3 star. When I asked at check-in for information about making a reservation to visit the Galleria Borghese I was told I could do so myself via telephone (no offer of the number). When my follow-up question was whether the room had a telephone I was informed that the Castle was a B&B and did not offer \"hotel services.\" The breakfast part of the \"B&B\" was also lacking - beverages, cereal (though the milk was out and no staff could be located to replenish it) and pre-packaged pastries. But they were willing to set us up with their driver to take us to the airport (a 20 minute ride without traffic - we left early in the morning) for 59 Euros. 3. The room was much smaller than it appeared on the website. Only a small bar of hand soap was provided, and towels could only be changed every two days without charge. The shower was very small (and cheap) and there was nowhere to place your belongings in the bathroom. We had the further bad luck of our room being located near a machine that noisily turned on and off every couple of minutes. 4. The Castle itself was interesting and attractive enough, though only two rooms are open to the public and it isn't possible to spend much time in them as the lighting is inadequate after dark. There is a no garden area, only a tiled courtyard. Also, note that it would never have occurred to me to describe this remotely located B&B as a \"castle.\"", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stonewall, Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful family owned property!\u201d", "Author": "Chirop", "ReviewID": "UR8475048", "Content": "Although on the outskirts of Rome, we found this hidden \"gem\" to be a nice retreat and relief to return to from the crowds and noise of the city.

We stayed in the Madonne and Pelligrini suites - both very spacious, filled with antiques, tapestries, etc.. Breakfast included coffee, milk, juices, cold cereals, toast, pastries, and fruit. Quiet location - only things within walking distance were a restaurant across the road (good food, cheap prices) and a grocery market a few steps away. Friendly family owned. Only Xenia (hostess) was able to speak English. Overall very impressed with the property. We were glad we did not stay in a tiny, noisy hotel room in downtown Rome! On the other hand there are no nearby cafe's or bars to enjoy in the evening.

We stayed 6 days in Rome @ the Scandeluzza Castle. As you can tell by other reviews, it seems one either hates it or loves it - WE LOVED IT! Often, travelers from the West (espec. N. American Continent) are \"finicky\" or \"fussy\" about silly little things. We wanted to experience \"true life\" while traveling and we were able to gain that by staying at Scandeluzza Castle. Upon our arrival (via pre-arranged car/driver booked thru same agent that booked us for castle), we discovered that electricity service is not dependable in Rome! LOL I felt bad for Xenia as she seemed soooo embarrassed, but we laughed it off and the power was back on in 20 mins. We had originally booked the Xenia suite, but the Prince insisted that we instead choose from that or any of the other available rooms, so we instead chose the Pelligrini Suite, allowing for much more room for a family of 4 with two separate private areas. The suite was LARGE, by any standards, but especially so by European standards! No sooner were we assisted with our luggage up to the 3rd flr. (no lift here, but worked fine for us - just make a note of it if you have trouble with stairs), we were handed our key and reminded that beds were made daily, but towels and linens would be changed every 2 days (unless requested prior). We unpacked a bit and as it was 2PM, the wife and I thought we'd scoot into Rome and get some Euros from ATM as we were running low. The boys stayed behind and rested. Prince Fillipo had provided our 2 yr. old several small, antique cars/trucks, etc...to play with. The very toys he played with himself as a child, and his Mother, the Princess, had a tear in her eye watching our son play with them, as she said he reminded her so much of her own son years ago. It was a touching moment. We were supplied, free of charge, with tickets for bus into town/subway (yes, it is 4 miles!!! So plan on transportation time, if you know Rome, this can be a long time). We caught the bus to town, but on the wrong side of the street! So, instead of going into town, we went out of it and around it and thru it and any other way you can imagine......it was 2 hours well spent to see so much of the Lazio countryside and outskirts of Rome - and for free! Upon our return 4-5 hours later, we were all tired from travel from Paris earlier in day and hungry for dinner. At 7:30, we ventured over to the small restaurant across the side street from Scandeluzza, as highly recommended by Ms. Xenia. It's called \"Papi Pizza\" and is our new favorite restaurant in the world!! I fed a family of 4, each a 3 course dinner, including wine, 2 cocktails for me, AND deserts (not to mention including the most awesome anti-pasta bar ever!) - all for $50 U.S.!!! Unheard of anywhere in Europe! For the next 6 days while in Rome, we ate at Papi Pizza at least 1x per day, sometimes 2 if we happenned to be around for lunch AND dinner hours. To be honest, Scandeluzza Castle and Papi Pizza are reason enough to return to Rome in and of themselves! On our 3rd day in Rome, we foolishly divided up 2 of our credit cards, letting my older son of 17 keep one in his wallet which he kept in his front pocket guarded at all times with his hand on it. At all times that is, except for when being shoved aside in the subway during rush-hour, of course it was promptly stolen. After filing reports with police & credit card cos., we returned to Scandeluzza Castle feeling kind of \"down and out\". The day before, the Prince and Princess themselves had invited us to a private function for that evening - it was to be a knighting ceremony! We decided to dress appropriately and go as planned instead of moping about our earlier pick-pocket experience on Subway. Upon our arrival into the Great Hall (wife on my arm as we slowly descended the stairs), we felt (and were treated) like royalty! We were just a bit \"fashionably late\". There were well over 100 people seated. Gentlemen stood to greet my wife and the typical European \"shmoozing\" began, as though WE WERE THE ROYALS in the room! The Prince performed some toasts of some sort in Italian and we were seated by white gloved attendants. I couldn't believe what happenned next as his Mother, the Princess herself, came to my side with a FULL LEG OF LAMB! She explained in very limited English that she cooked it herself and then set it in front of me and said \"....eat, eat - for you....I do for you!\" I only thought of how gluttonous I must've looked! The food, the knighting ceremony of a wealthy businessman from town, the wine from Prince Fillipo's private vineyard, the music, etc... was all AWESOME and made for an unforgettable evening! My wife ended up dancing with Embassadors, Lords, Dignitaries, etc.. for most of the evening and we no doubt felt very \"Regal\" - hehe. It was a night to remember, one we'll treasure forever! The next night we had purchased food \"to go\" from Papi Pizza next door, for our sons, as we had made exclusive dinner plans ahead of time alone at the Scandeluzza Castle (they will provide private dinner for 2 at 100 Euro). It was veal with all the appropriate side dishes and presented to us by the Miss Xenia. Although it was well prepared, presented and delicious, I would've chosen Papi-Pizza instead, but didn't want to be rude and cancel reservation @ Scandeluzza Castle. We had the run of the castle that evening! Also, several times thru-out our stay, the Prince would \"entice\" us with a bit of his private stock of wine or other Italian \"beverages\", it made for a warm and welcoming atmosphere. His mother, the Princess Pelligrino, took my hand once as we were on our way to tour Rome one morning, and she guided me to her husbands private burial chapel on the grounds of Scandeluzza Castle. Although she spoke little to no English, and I the same of Italian, we \"spoke\" for over an hour and shared something special that day. Several mornings we were provided with a ride to the subway free of charge. On one morning in particular, the Prince and his mother took us, but stopped on the way at a large, local groceria and then took us out for capuccinos and mid-morning \"treats\". The Prince, his family and staff all took fondly to our sons and treated them with kindness and affection. We will DEFINITELY return to Scandeluzza Castle and Papi Pizza again - unfortunately, it just won't be soon enough!

The castle is actually a \"bed and breakfast\" and it certainly does not look like a castle. This place is in the suburbs and while there is a grocery store and a restaurant within a few blocks the nearest small town is at least 1 mile away, accessible only by walking directly in a narrow road while cars dash by (no sidewalks and good luck on catching the bus to the town).
