The landscape is very nice. Everything is clean and nice. The food was good enough. The only real complaint I have about that is the dining room is very tiny. You may have to wait for you and your family to eat. It is very crowded. You can go outside to eat under the gazebos which are very nice. But there are smokers. I would like to see the smokers have a designated place to smoke. There are two gazebos and there were smokers in both of them. I liked our room. It was very clean. We had a refrigerator, and a microwave. We were given microwave popcorn upon check in which I thought was a nice touch. The one thing I didn't like about our room was the rooms open up from the outside. So if I wanted the curtain open to let the light in people could walk by and look right in our room. I will complain about the sheets. The sheets on our bed was ready for the trash. The sheets were rough, like little balls on them. Every morning when we woke up the fitted sheet had worked itself off the mattress. I do like a higher count sheet that is smooth and cool to the touch. Also elastic in good enough shape so the sheet stays on the bed. If that is not a problem for you then the bed will not be a problem. Other then that it was a great stay.

Fantastic breakfast with eggs, biskets and gravy, waffles, 4 cold cereals, oatmeal packets, donuts, white or wheat toast, bagels etc. The staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. I lost my comb, no problem they will give you a free one at the desk, no need to buy one. Just a nice touch. A welcome kit and leaving packet. Are you kidding me! And all at a reasonable price. I would have to be picky to find flaws in the place. Like the shower head is about 6' up. If your taller you might have to duck down a little to wash your hair. See what I mean, picky. I have spent much more on hotels and havn't been nearly as happy. I booked this place because of all the great reviews on Trip Advisor. We are not wrong.

We literally had to stand at the door and wait on them to open it after watching a woman arrive at 6am. When we were finally let in..we were told we could at least get coffee ( nope..it wasnt done yet). I was told it had recently changed from 6:30 am. Sorry..no excuse ! They were worrying about doing things that could wait until last ( not prioritizing well)..and didnt turn on the gravy which clearly takes a long time to warm up when there is so much in the warmer. Its not sausage gravy ( no sausage)..its country gravy. My donut was stale...hard as a rock. By the time we left the room was full of people ALL waiting on something to eat!

The wifi was just horrible, we couldn't get it to connect at all, I even called the front desk and they couldn't help nor move us to another room. The room furnishings weren't good either aside from the bed, their was a loan old chair in the room that had to be 20 plus years old, there was a desk chair that would have been comfy I suppose had it not been so worn down, just not good. Now let's talk about the pool, it was horrible, very very dirty, it needed a major scrub down, somebody needed to get the net in it and get the dead bugs out and other things floating in the water out.

There's Krispy Kreme doughnuts, and then typical continental breakfast foods (generic bagels, english muffins, etc.) There were 2 staff members that prepared waffles for people. Again, this is really awesome for something of this price....however, it is typical motel continental breakfast fare.

Everything else is wonderful! It probably deserves a 4.5 stars. We stayed for 2 nights on 6/24 and 6/25 in a King suite. We were given a welcome package contains shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, popcorn, and mouthwash. It was a really pleasant gift. Our room has a microwafe, fridge, and sofa. It is a large room and comfy. One of our light bulbsburned out and we called front desk and the guy brought and replaced it right away. We didn't use the pool since our limited time at Branson. The breakfast was awesome. The girls, mother and daughter, who works there is very friendly. They offer to make fresh waffles for everyone. They have biscuits, gravy, eggs, fruit, bagels, toasts, muffin, juice, coffee, cereal, milk, etc. The room is clean, the surroundings are clean, including the trash can outside. My husband was surprised that the hotel is maintained well and clean. It is really pleasant place to stay here. The only caveat is the bed sheet. I don't know what it is, I think our bed is King but the sheet does not fit the bed. Maybe they use a queen size but it looked like a king size. I don't know because of the pillow top or that the sheet has shrunk or what. The sheet didn't fit the mattress. It kept coming off the mattress. I found that its was not comfortable. We came to our room late nightly and didn't feel like to ask and complain. The sheet is also not smooth and silky. I like my sheet taut and smooth. The next day, the maid didn't fit the sheet taut and adjust it either. She kind of just threw the bed cover over it without readjusting the sheets underneath it. Again, I came back late to the hotel and didn't want to make a fuss. It didn't bother my husband much but it bothered me.

The A/C unit kept up during the 100+ degree days too! Please accept my criticism as constructive not to detour anyone from staying in the hotel. We enjoyed our stay and would definately stay here again when visiting Branson for a couple of days but I must be honest. My cons: The door (Room 230) hangs up where you have to jerk to open and slam to close (wouldn't be good with a sleeping baby); The toilet handle had to be held down a long time to flush; the water temp in the shower never stayed constant, it fluctuated temp every 30 seconds or so; The maidservice did a good job cleaning every day but didn't make our beds...they pulled the sheet and comforter to the top and set the pillows. I found myself pulling back the bedding to stretch the fitted sheet every night. I even left a $4 tip every day; And last, at check in, we were told the pool closes at 10:00pm but we found that guests used the pool until 11:00. We only had one night where there was a noise problem and that was Saturday night. Again, I want to make clear that these inconveniences were minor where we didn't even complan to the front desk (plus I didn't want anyone working in our room). They were all items I can live with for sixty some bucks a night. If we were at the Hilton, this would not have been acceptable. This one is hard for me to rate.

We have visited Branson often and each time chose a different place to stay. Last year we stayed at a hotel that we all really liked, and intended to stay at again, but this year it was closed due to the tornado from March. So I checked reviews before booking the Yellow Rose. When we arrived for check-in, the hotel room was booked as a King suite instead of the Double Queen. I had my confirmation print out with me showing the booking as a Double. This was not the hotel's fault, but rather Priceline's. The hotel clerk told me that they used to have Booking.com handle online reservations, but now Priceline is handling Booking.com as well. I believe this is where the mix up occurred. Anyway, the clerk made a few adjustments, told me it wasn't the end of the world, and found us a Double Queen. (Keep in mind, the hotel was full of booked doubles.) He called housekeeping to make sure the room we were getting was ready and clean. We had to wait a few minutes, but the room was excellent. In fact, this was the cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in. Housekeeping does a fantastic job. There is breakfast every morning; eggs, donuts, bagels, biscuits and gravy, cereal, and they will cook a massive waffle if you would like. The breakfast room is smallish, but there are two gazebos outside furnished for taking your breakfast outside. We never had a problem finding a place to eat. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. There is free wifi, great for my kids' iPod touches and my iPad. There is a small pool outside, the only frown I could find. It isn't heated, so on cooler days/nights my kids wouldn't swim. We normally stay where there is both an indoor and outdoor pool. Yet, despite that, we would stay again. The hotel is away from the main strip, but very accessible to all the roads and main routes. We could quickly get to where we were going (both ends of town). Very quiet area and nice place to take a morning walk/run without a lot of traffic. The beds were comfortable, decor modern, flat screen tv, and one thing we noticed right away was the lack of noise!

We decided to go to Branson and do some shopping and just spend time together. We are on a tight budget, so in order to make our trip happen I needed to find an inexpensive hotel that would also be a pleasant place to stay after we were through exploring the town. I researched several hotels and read many many reviews over just about every hotel in Branson. I stumbled across The Yellow Rose Inn and Suites and started reading reviews about it. They were all very positive reviews and the price was amazing! I searched for the Yellow Rose on other review sites as well to see if all of the reviews matched up and 99% of the reviews I read were all positive. I looked at photos of the rooms and they looked very nice for the price as well. I was convinced that this was the place to try and I am glad we did! The hotel is located just far enough away from the strip that it is relaxing and quiet but still very convenient. The beds were super comfy and the TV was a good size. The rooms are not very big but they are plenty big enough to relax in. When we checked in the lady at the desk was very friendly and gave us popcorn for later. They have a complimentary breakfast like none other that I have ever seen at a one star hotel. Waffles, eggs, cereals, donuts etc. I was so tired the first morning that I did not feel like going to get breakfast so my husband went to grab a donut or something and they gave him a tray to bring food back to me in the room. When we checked out two days later we recieved a small box of chocolates to thank us for staying there. I know these things aren't a huge expense or big deal but it is the thought behind it that matters to me. We paid a very inexpensive price fo our King room therefore was not expecting the kind of service we got. It well exceeded my expectations and we are planning another trip to Branson in a month and this is definitely where I will book our rooms.

We\u2019ve stayed at better hotels in Branson for the price & this one was really average! The only thing we enjoyed was the breakfast lady who always smiled, made excellent waffles & kept the breakfast area clean. Otherwise, you are better off staying at another hotel. First, this hotel is hard to get to\u2026.lack of signs coming from the strip & we missed our right turn every time! It\u2019s in the back or in between some timeshares & hard to get to at night. Too far from the strip & shows! Second, the room was small- even though it had 2 queen beds. The \u201cup-dated\u201d room may have had new carpet & bedspreads but the mattress was uncomfortable. Bathroom is tiny! The shower was terrible & old. You had to lift up the spout & half the water wasn\u2019t coming out of the showerhead. The water kept switching from cold to hot every 2 seconds; you can hear the \u2018hissing\u2019 noise from the shower! Our \u201cmountain view\u201d room in the back of the hotel faced an open parking lot directly across from a maintenance shop. So much for keeping your windows open! The hotel itself was very quiet but you could still hear people from the other rooms. The frig & microwave was a plus although the 1-cup coffee maker really needs to be replaced! It only makes a \u00bd cup of coffee & only 2 packs per room. The breakfast was all prepackaged! No fresh juice or fresh fruit (only watered down & canned); no yogurt or any healthy choices available. The highlight was asking the front desk for a tube of toothpaste since we forgotten ours; they didn\u2019t have any!! No shower cap & a tiny bottle of shampoo. The amenities that you take for granted at any other hotel were not at this one! Cheap! Overall, the hotel was ok\u2026but our 4 days in Branson were fun despite the rain. I would not stay at this place again. For a family ( babies to teens) you are better off staying at the Grand Country water park (grandcountry.com). This one is even better than castle rock! You can walk to the buffets, play games & eat pizza at the Fun Spot and watch a pretty good show (grand jubilee) even if you don\u2019t like country music.

Everything was excellent & we will be staying here again.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maynard,Ar", "Title": "\u201cWe will return.\u201d", "Author": "bigdaddyMaynard_Ar", "ReviewID": "UR115484439", "Content": "I have been across our great country and this place was the best yet.The room was very nice and the service was second to none.Thanks for a weekend to remember.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Star City, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it and we'll be back!!!\u201d", "Author": "SnoopyMc", "ReviewID": "UR115292651", "Content": "We had a wonderful time!!
