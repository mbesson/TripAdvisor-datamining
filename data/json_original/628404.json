Arrived late, but host was welcoming and checked me in with no fuss. Hotel is simple, but smart and spotlessly clean. The room was large and comfortable and had a washhandbasin in the main room and a toilet and separate shower room. The bed was very comfortable. There is an all day and night buffet available which suits the independent traveller very well. The hotel is in an excellent quiet location with all the sights within easy reach and the bright lights of Rembrandplein about 10 mins walk away. Lots of lovely little dutch pubs nearby and safe at night. You have a pass which opens the door so you can come and go at any hour of the day and night. Would thoroughly recommend the hotel if you are looking for a clean simple and comfortablle hotel in a great location which provides flexible dining.

Our host Kees was very friendly, as was his cat. He showed us his private residence on the ground floor which was most interesting. We would be very happen to stay again.

The room was ok but the toilet and bath were tiny. Everything worked as expected but the furniture, bedlinen etc were very basic including the very small television. The reason for not rating the hotel average is that we had a bad experience with the receptionist. Admittedly we were guilty of taking our own champagne from the receptions refrigerator when we arrived back late. In addition we played music on our IPad which and left three cigaret butts in the garden. The following morning we got a very angry reception, were told to pick-up the cigaret butts, accused of ruining his weekend and so on.

I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Two members of our group were in room 10 on the third floor, and the remaining four of us were split between rooms 12 and 14, meaning that those of us upstairs had the whole fourth floor to ourselves, which was pretty cool. It was convenient to have the shower and toilet (on the fourth floor these are in a common area) in two separate rooms so that the four of us could all easily go about our business. If you've done even the smallest amount of research on Amsterdam, you know to anticipate steep stairways in most buildings. Adolesce is no exception. The stairways are also very narrow so you may want to take this into consideration if you're planning on bringing very bulky luggage. The 24-hour self-service snacks were a lovely touch. It was really nice to fill up on complimentary breakfast before going out and hemorrhaging money all day in the city. The manager seemed very nice and knowledgeable and always had some sweet oldies tunes playing during breakfast hours. On the day we left, one of my friends left his camera behind, and the manager was kind enough to call our taxi driver so that we could come back and get it. A warning to those with allergies and/or disdain for felines -- there are two friendly long haired cats who can frequently be found in the reception area. And another warning to those coming to Amsterdam to party nonstop -- there are \"no drugs\" signs posted all over the hotel, so don't plan on bringing any fun home with you from the coffeeshops. The hotel is in an excellent location and it is very easy to get around town by tram (Waterlooplein station is very nearby) or walking. I would certainly recommend Adolesce to other young travelers like us, who are looking for a home base that is a step or two above a hostel, but who don't require all the frills of a more upscale hotel. I can't wait for my next visit to Amsterdam and I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel in charming canal house\u201d", "Author": "susch", "ReviewID": "UR81546472", "Content": "Have been to Amsterdam several times but this was the first stay at the Hotel Adolesce and we will definitely stay there again. Our flight arrived from the states early in the morning and we were able to check into our room at 9:00am rather than wait until after 2:00pm like at other hotels. Such a nice treat to get right in, take a nap, then have the whole day to enjoy the city without feeling like a zombie! We had a triple room which was very clean and nice and even had two separate bathrooms. Lovely view of gardens from the window. As others have mentioned the stairways are definitely steep and narrow and would be quite a challenge if you had much luggage.

The front desk man while reasonably gruff was not unfriendly, but not helpful either.

As other reviews have mentioned, the stairs are EXTREMELY steep, so if you have mobilty problems, you will struggle... also pack light as carrying the suitcases up and down is extremely frightening. We slept well and it is in a quiet area, however my partner and I both woke up with Bed Bug bites all over us... about 20 each...

The hotel is quite nice and sits right overlooking one of the dams. The staff were extremely helpful and polite and it was amazing value for money considering the location. Everything was very clean and our room had a seperate area with two seperate rooms for toilet and shower. Room was very very big and spacious. The people on the reception were so helpful always ready to give advice. The guy even let me call my friend a couple of times who lives in Amsterdam for free! The only thing I would say is that when people say these stairs are steep - believe me they ARE! So it would not be suited for people with mobility issues or older or unwell people etc. But alot of the stairs in Amsterdam are in fact steep- it is how the alot of the houses were built as back in the days the wider your house was the more tax you paid - hence people tried making narrow yet taller houses to avoid tax (history lesson there hehe) Also alot of people like the fact that there is a 24hr food service available. There are all sorts of breads, cereals, biscuits, cheeses, jams, butters, drinks etc you can help yourself to. Me, I am a bit more old fashioned and didnt really like the idea of people being able to take bread etc with unwashed hands etc. I have majoy hygiene issues - but hey thats my problem! But most people like this and the fact they can have something to eat whenever they want.

The room was quite spacious (again, considering it is Amsterdam), and the all-day breakfast was always replenished and full of snacks, so no complaints there. I got a room in the back of the hotel, so the bathroom and shower were across the hallway from the room, and it was also the smallest shower I've ever seen! It was a bit hard to shower while keeping my clothes dry, so I stopped trying. The price was great for the service I got, the owner was quite friendly and even though it was July I had no problems in extending my reservation one more week. The hotel is right in front of the Hermitage Amsterdam, and by night the sight of the Skinny Bridge is breathtaking, so no complaints on the location. It is also close to the Stopera, and a subway station. So good price, good hotel, friendly service. The only thing that might take you by surprise would be the paintings hanging on the lobby, quite artistic male nudes!
