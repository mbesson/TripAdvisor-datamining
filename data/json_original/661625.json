(They were right!) We selected this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and the hotel's website. All were accurate and on-the-mark. Thanks to previous reviewers. The only negative was a front desk recommendation to have dinner at New Galata Restaurant. The meal was shockingly expensive when the waiter failed to report the price of the whole fish we had chosen. The New Galata manager, Mr. Yunes, later explained that it was a mistake that the waiter had not told us the price of the fish after it had been weighed in the back.

The Amisos hotel is centrally located, very close to the Aya Sophia and the Yerebatan cistern. Unfortunately it is situated just above a very busy tram stop, although the combination of double glazing and air-conditioning makes this bearable. More serious is the sound of pounding Europop from the Irish bar downstairs. We arrived with our baby, and had been promised a cot by the manager when we booked. We were shown to our first floor room, which was large with a good sized bathroom, although the dark decoration made it look a little dingy. Nevertheless, all seemed well until we tried to put the baby to sleep in the cot, which promptly collapsed (without the baby in it, luckily). The key part must have been broken when the hotel had put it up, but the person who had done this had just bodged it together in the vain hope that we would not notice. After some delay and several vociferous protests to reception, we were given a mattress for the baby to sleep on. However, she did not sleep for long because of the noise coming from downstairs. By two o'clock in the morning, the complaints from other residents about our baby's screaming persuaded the general manager to upgrade us to the Topkapi Suite on the top floor. This was spacious and quiet, and, inexplicably, had its own sauna. It seemed the kind of place where an \"international businessman\" might entertain a female friend he had met at the nearby ferry terminal. Moreover, there is no way that it was worth the rack rate of well over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300. The breakfast, I have to say, was truly excellent, and, bleary eyed, we enjoyed the lovely views of the Topkapi gardens.

There appear to be a number of faults, namely the bait and switch, whereby you book a hotel and upon arrival they advise you, the hotel is overbooked and they can put you up in an alternative sister hotel. Best way to avoid this is to arrive early or book a hotel that doesn't seem to do this, the Amisos is in such a bracket. We had two excellent rooms set aside for us as per our pre-booked and paid for arrangements. A second issue with hotels in istanbul is this terrace view, in this instance the terrace view is pretty average. No TV antennae but no view of mosques or aya sofia. you do have an uninteruppted view out the window though which is nice. Also quite cool are the plush chairs and tables made from old singer sewing machines. The location of the Amisos Hotel is superb. Its right next to the Topkapi Palace, very handy. There is a pub downstairs that shows all sorts of Football, F1, Rugby etc. Again very handy and the beer is reasonable. Don't be put off by this either, its hardly a rowdy pub. The opposite in fact. The rooms are fantastical. The website does do the rooms justice for once. Although I have to say the air condition leaves a little to be desired. Shame really as it is the major failing of the Hotel. If you could jam a card in the room key slot to keep the aircon going all day then it would be ok, otherwise its going to get very hot in the middle of summer.
