{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fab location We used the FGA (feel good apartments) as a base for a city break in Barcelona. The fact that we could stand out on the balcony and watch the world go by on La Ramblas says it all really. The location is excellent with a bakery directly opposite, small supermarket a couple of shops away and the local market within 5 minutes walk - perfect. A walk down the street away from la ramblas takes you to several small squares with lots of bars and restaurants. Be careful though (as in all cities!) as we had the 'can you please tell me the time?' trick attempted but just pointed out we were not wearing watches! Local taxi rank and info booth (bus tour tickets) 5 minutes away on La Ramblas.A phone call on arrival in Barcelona ensured that the rep was there to meet us and talk us through everything.The apartments are clean, comfy and compact. Hair dryer, dishwasher, tea towel, detergent, towels, bed linen including blankets all included. Just be aware that a lost key will cost 50 euros to replace.Yes, there is some noise as there always is in apartment blocks, i.e. flushing toilets etc but overall the quality and location made up for that. Will definately use these again as a base for return trip to Barcelona.", "Date": "Oct 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR868460990", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JaneHDerbyshire_UK"}, {"Content": "Good experience, but would recommend more for young adults than families. Overall, we had a nice experience at these apartments. They were very clean, secure, well furnished and the location was excellent. (A block away from bustling La Rambla and a short 3-5 min walk to central information tourist booths). Note, however, that they are in a noisy area, the shower is quite small, you only get one key to the apartment and there is a buzzer downstairs (similar to a regular apartment building) which led to a very annoying last night when someone who was locked out kept buzzing our apartment at 3 in the morning instead of his own. In general, I would not recommend these accomodations for older couples or families traveling with children. However, for young adults / students, they are a great, affordable option.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR234004924", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kris727"}, {"Content": "excellent hotel GREAT LOCATION !!! We were very impressed with this apartment/hotel. It was beautifuly decorated, very clean and spacious. It is a loft style apartment which is fully furnished with a kitchen and living area. The shower is very tiny but over all the the apratment is very comfortable and modern. The best part of the apartment is the LOCATION. It is located right of Las Ramblas, which is the place where you want to be in Barcelona. There are great shops, restaurants and sightseeing in this location. There is no housekeeping included with your stay but they do provide towles/sheets while you are there. We loved this apartment and will defenitly stay here again when we return to Barcelona.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR543124943", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "constantravel01"}, {"Content": "great location Arrived at the airport ,having been given the phone number to contact the office, no problems agent arranged to meet us at the apartment in 1 hour.
