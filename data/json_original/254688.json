The hotel itself did not inspire confidence as my companion and I approached it, since half of it is currently covered in scaffolding - once you get into the lobby, though, it looks a lot better! Our room was on the ground floor, but there is a lift to other floors - useful for families with pushchairs or people who may be less mobile for any reason. Staff were all friendly, from the smiley South African lady who checked us in to the people working in the breakfast room - during our entire stay we saw none of the squabbling mentioned by other reviewers. Breakfast was great, with an excellent selection for a 'continental' that outdoes anything else I have come across - and waitress service, too! The location was unbeatable - step outside and you're looking at Hyde Park, the tube was five minutes away on foot, and there are some great restaurants within easy walking distance. (if you like Italian, check out La Rosa) Now on to the niggles! There are no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms - admittedly, the hotel's website does not mention having them, but even the most basic B & B provides them these days. Sheets were superbly clean, not so the itchy blankets and slightly grubby bedcovers; duvets mean less work when changing beds, and are easier to launder too. The notice on the back of the door in our room referred to the bar being open between 6 and 11 p.m, which it wasn't; they also refer to the availability of a TV in the lounge, which there isn't - and I went in search of it when the snowy reception in our room was ruining \"Britain's Got Talent\" for my young travel companion! I would stay there again, despite these problems, because I use a hotel as a place to sleep when I'm in London and that's all; the room was cosy, the breakfast was fantastic and the staff went out of their way to be helpful...and if they made the Averard as good as it probably was once, they'd be able to charge twice as much and I wouldn't be able to afford to stay there any longer!", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno, CA", "Title": "\u201cFar better than I expected\u201d", "Author": "FresnoTravelers", "ReviewID": "UR28326050", "Content": "We stayed 8 nights at the Averard.

On departure the receptionist did not even ask if everything had been alright. There is no parking as stated and you get a leaflet for a carpark saying could be as low as 20p an hour, I never saw it less than 90p an hour which adds up. The TV's in the room are not very good as only a portable aerial and no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms.

The hotel is in a good area with several restaurants and a good pub and a pretty London mews behind it. The reception staff were friendly, but I agree with other reviewers that the breakfast staff need to be trained how to behave appropriately in front of guests. When we were there, the chef was having a loud slanging match with one of the waitresses who was shouting back about hours and days that she had to work etc. not conducive to a calm breakfast, which incidentally was otherwise fine and included in the price. Compared to other budget chain hotels in the area,the Averard is good value and if you ask for a room on the lower floors, I think the standard will be better.
