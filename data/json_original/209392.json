We asked to see the room first before the luggage was taken up and they were happy to accommodate. We were on the top floor overlooking the pool with a great view of the ocean. Although this was Spring Break, we were not really near or bothered by the activities. Town is about a 14 block walk. The pool and beach area are very well attended by Yanni and Ricardo. Each day we were set-up with towels and an umbrella. Treats during the day included: popsicles, fresh fruit, cool/frozen hand towels and cucumbers for your eyes. Nothing like being pampered while you watch the waves! Brian, front doorman, was always helpful with dining ideas and directions. Gary, the concierge was also helpful. Some suggestions: a mirror is needed somewhere else in the room besides the bathroom. Just having one in the bath area does not allow for another person to do hair, make-up, etc. while the other person is in the shower. The wire shower soap caddie will not hold the bar of soap...it falls through the slats and ends up on the floor of the shower. :( Someone needs to follow-up on room service trays as they are often left in the hallways and it reflects poorly on the cleaning staff.

The good: Staff was very friendly overall. Did not encounter anybody rude. The room service server who brought my breakfast tray on the first day was a little cool, but not rude. The property was gorgeous and very well-maintained. No issues with cleanliness or maintenance. The not-so-good: The one day I did room service, I thought it was a little slow (45 minutes is a little too long for a simple breakfast of eggs and toast in my opinion). Housekeeping came to room the first day and took the tip but did nothing. Going to the front desk rectified this immediately, but why did the maid take my money and not do anything? The aforementioned breakfast tray was STILL outside my room after 24 hours. Again, had to go to the front desk to get them to take it away. I had paid extra for a \"boutique suite\" that I thought would give me at least a view of the hotel courtyard. Instead, I got a view of the street next to the hotel, a view of the parking garage below, and some trees. I had no desire to sit on the balcony because what was I going to look at? Other things to be aware of: I think some reviewers mentioned that there are no tubs. This is correct - the boutique suite I was in (room 348) had only a stall shower. So if your mobility-impaired or have little kids, this may not be the place for you. The hotel restaurant (Strip House) has a lot of burlesque photos of women in it (early 20th century). Nothing gratuitous, but if you're offended by that sort of thing or don't want to have to explain them to your kids, then you may want to at least avoid the restaurant.

The main thing going for it is the location on the beach, which for Key West is rare, but the rest of the resort is lackluster. Our room was clean and we were upgraded to a courtyard view, but our inside corner location let people on both sides of our room see in if they were outside on their balcony. Just a little weird. Also, the opening for our sliding door was literally only 18 inches wide, we had to turn sideways to walk outside. I think that was just a flaw of our specific room, the others looked much bigger. The rooms also lack a dresser to put clothes in, which was weird since our room had plenty of room for it. Our bathroom was very small and the toilet was literally in front of the sink. No exaggeration, you had to sort of straddle the toilet to get to the sink. The cleaning service was hit or miss, depending on which person cleaned our room and the doors let a lot of hallway noises in. The beach by KW standards was nice, but ended up with a lot of seagrass washed up on it (not their fault). The pier has tons of birds nesting in it, so it was covered in bird droppings, which I never saw get cleaned the five days we were at the resort. The pool/beach service guy sort of gave us a hard time for wanting to sit on the beach one day when it was windy (the pool chairs were full). We were on the beach 2-3 hours and never were offered a popsicle, frozen towel, etc. I did see one of them bring pina colada samples, but he ran out a few chairs before getting to us and never brought more. The guys at the Casa Marina were much more attentive when we were on that beach. The Casa is also much better at night, the gas torch lights and palm trees give a much better vibe. Amenities wise, the Casa is much nicer and more luxurious, it's just further from everything and sometimes gets big conferences, like the one they had while we were there. The positives of The Reach is that you are closer to Duval and several restaurants. I highly recommend the Southernmost Cafe for breakfast and drinks later in the day. It's at the very end of Duval on the beach (about two blocks from The Reach). Good food and a good view (liked it even more than Blue Heaven). There is also a small convenience store and two small delis within a block of The Reach, which is great for cheaper drinks and lunch. Also be sure to check out the sunset decks on the 4th and 5th floors of The Reach, great view without the crowds, and you can also see when the cruise ships are in town, meaning crowds on Duval and tours (noticed no ships Wed and Thurs). Regarding the rest of the resort, I was disappointed by some of the rusty door frames when walking through the halls and some of the stairways. Also surprised at how sometimes the building paint changed from a margarine color to a bright mustard color at random, just lots of details they have overlooked. Doormen standing in the lobby chatting, overflowing trash cans by the elevators, food trays sitting outside in the hallways from the night before, etc, the service could use a little attention. And the resort fee is a joke, plain and simple. The wifi kept dropping off my phone, prompting me for the password I had already entered numerous times. Our stay was free and the place was clean, but I don't think I would pay to come back unless I got a great deal. I would probably walk the other few blocks to the Casa or look elsewhere.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWorse hotel stay and horrible service\u201d", "Author": "ziaic1", "ReviewID": "UR126094567", "Content": "I sent an email to Hilton customer support and to no avail I did not receive a response. Email Attached below: 1) Checking In - One person at the entire front desk and it took 30-40 minutes to check-in. When checking in, only one of the rooms was ready (I also purchased a room for my father and his was not ready until almost 5:30pm). I have a call log on my cell (picture included on attachment from when the hotel called to confirm this. 2) I entered the room to drop off all of our bags while the other room was being prepared. I noticed the temperature of the room was very warm, so I quickly check the thermostat to lower the temp. I noticed it was set to 70 degrees (which is more than cool enough in Florida), but the room was clearly around 85 degrees (if not more). I felt the vent to see what temperature the air was coming out and it was also very warm. I decided to open up the panel for the intake and noticed the filter has not been replaced in years and was probably one of the dirtiest filters i have seen. I took a picture which is attached below. I removed the filter and put it outside the room and it was disposed of at a later time. The air then quickly started to cool and that issue was rectified. 3) I noticed in the room (Room 428 (my room) and Room 431 (Fathers room) that there was some sort of insect infestation. I took video of this (I will try to attach it if its not too large) and you will clear see tons of bugs running on the wet bar and through out other areas of the room. In fact, I was woken up out of a dead sleep when I was bitten by a fire ant on my stomach (which I would like to note is not a comfortable experience. The room was also very dirty. The door to the bathroom looked like it has not been cleaned in months (pictures attached) and I would say the same about the carpet. JUST TRIED TO PUT THE VIDEO IN THE EMAIL AND IT WAS TOO LARGE. If needed I will post it on You Tube to share it to whom ever it may concern. 4). The next morning I woke up and I spoke to my father and he informed me check out was at 11am. I then thought that was interesting due to the fact that we were not even able to completely check-in by 5:30pm. Each room cost me a little over 500 bucks per night and I was charged a daily resort fee of $25 bucks. That resort fee allowed me to use wifi and a few of the beach services (I have no idea what those services were, but thats was I was told). At this point we were at a beach resort and were now forced to be checked out. Hmm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 That almost sounds like a scam to me. I called down to the front desk and was routed to the concierge and was informed I need to talk to the front desk (which is what I dialed, but was informed there was only one person working). I was put on hold and then spoke to a lady who extended my check out to 12:30pm. I informed her of the very late checkin and she said that was the best she could do. 5) Before checking out we decided (4 of us (Father, step mom, girlfriend and myself)) to grab breakfast. We sat down in the outdoor area (right by the beach) which was very beautiful. A waiter came by and informed us that there was a buffet. I politely asked him if the buffet had waffles or if I could just order them ale carte. He started laughing and said if you want waffles go to the waffle house. Everyone at the table looked at me in astonishment that he even said that and that I didn't say something back to him informing him he was an jerk. The four of us went to the buffet and grabbed our own drinks. We came back to the table and noticed there were only two sets of forks and knifes and I did not see any service staff. I then walked across the outdoor seating area to find an empty table that still had silverware out. I grabbed those and brought them back to the table. About 5 minutes later someone came by and asked us if we wanted coffee which my step mother said \"yes\". She asked if she could get some cream and was not delivered the cream until after we received the check. The check had auto gratuity on it for %18 (which these people did nothing except say I had to go to a waffle house and give us a bill). I also wanted to note that there were three pieces of fresh toast left that were all burnt and the scrambled eggs we received were cold. On the bill it had room for an extra tip which I gladly commented \"F@#$ No\" on it. I hit my breaking point and this stage. This was the most intolerable stay at a hotel I have ever experienced and I stayed at more hotels than anyone I know. I just got back from Medellin, Columbia the week before and had a thousand time better experience there than in Key West. I think thats an interesting point to be made. The receipt is attached. 6) The only good experience of the entire trip was one individual that worked at the H2O bar (he setup lounge chairs and setup our jet-ski tour around the island for us).

We were extremely excited to get away out of the cold Chicago windy weather. My boyfriend and I and another couple decided to book two rooms at The Reach for a wedding we were invited to attend for a long time friend of the guys who they served with overseas in Afghanistan. This was a very important trip to all of us! The wedding was held at both the Casa Marina(reception) and The Reach(ceremony). Before we arrived on Febuary 24th, we called to see if we could check in early because of a previous hotel complication within their network. When we called, the night manager stated that our rooms were available and we could check in once we arrived. We thought this was fantastic and were so happy that they were so accomadating! We arrived calmly and ready to start our short weekend vacation around 7:30AM. Once checked in, both us and the other couple were given our room keys for rooms both on the fourth floor. The other couple were given an upgraded hotel room upon booking, so they were super excited to see what room was in store for them. As my boyfriend and I walked over to our room and split from the other couple we inserted our key to open the door. After about 25 times of trying to open the door, and all the ruckus we were causing by turning the handle and trying to push the door open, a man(who was staying in the room) opened the door to grab his morning paper. He asked us why we were trying so desperately to get into his room. WE WERE GIVEN A ROOM WITH PEOPLE ALREADY STAYING IN IT! I grabbed the keys to bring down to the front desk only to find the other couple we were staying with were already down there too. They were also complaining to the manager that they walked into their upgraded room with a couple SLEEPING!!!!!!!! I'm guessing this hotel has NO CLUE if they have guests or no guests in certain rooms. I would say this a major travel/guest safety issue. The manager seemed completely confused at what keys were left the night before that had been attached to the so-called \"empty rooms\". Apparently, the rooms were NOT EMPTY. You could see her frustration, as much as ours from our long travel from Chicago, and overnight drive from Miami to Key West. The whole front desk seemed to be completely unorganized. She accommodated us with a double queen bed room, with a balcony facing the parking garage where we could shower and sleep for a few hours until they figured out what they were going to do with us because they were overbooked(which wasn't our problem, we booked this trip well over six months ago). The night manager was very nice to escort us to our room at room #436 to make sure we didn't run into another problem with other guests possibly sleeping in the room. We didn't get to that room until about 9AM. Unfortunately, us ladies couldn't unpack our dresses for the evening cocktail party we were supposed to attend for the wedding because we were going to be moving to another room in a matter of a few hours. The guys couldn't unpack their attire either because again, we were moving. I guess our wrinkled dresses were going to look great for the cocktail party. Exhausted, and sleep deprived, we all showered and slept in our crammed room for a little less than 3 1/2 hours only to be woken up to a loud phone call from the front desk. They called to tell us that we needed to be out of the room and they were going to move all four of us into another room with ONE king size bed until they had the second upgraded room available. We all re-packed what we took out to shower and sleep and scurried over to room #427(SAME FLOOR). One of us lucky couples got to keep this room for the night. This room was supposed to be an oceanfront room. The room balcony faced the courtyard and the large chess board and your door backed up the loud and obnoxious parking lot where at night you could hear the crazy car horns. The room I must say was very clean, but for a 5 star hotel, I expected a way better room. With all the frustration, we got ready to go to lunch in Downtown Key West to relax, because we were all too crammed in the little hotel room. I must say, the doorman(I don't recall his name) was very helpful with informing us where to go eat. He suggested Alonzo's for seafood, which was absolutely amazing. We received another phone call(interrupting our long lunch) saying that our other room was almost ready, but wasn't going to be complete until about 4:00PM. We arrived back to the hotel to pick up our new rooms keys after already going down to the front desk a million times that day to drop off and pick up new keys. The other couple decided to take the new room, packed up half of their stuff because we were so desperate for time to get ready for our wedding cocktail party at 5PM. The other couple were put in room #424 and they were supposed to be assigned an upgraded room. Their room was NO DIFFERENT than ours. RIDICULOUS!!!!!!! They paid for an upgraded room, only to get a standard and better yet, nothing was done about it. All the ruckus and frustration of moving and lack of time that THE REACH had taken away from us dealing with their lack of attentiveness, poor bookings, and a million and one other things. we were a half hour late to our wedding cocktail party at the Casa Marina. The next day we awoke to car sirens and horns in the parking garage right outside our room. We didn't even need a wake up call. Thank goodness we had to be up to attend the ceremony downstairs. The Reach hosted a beautiful ceremony for the couple, I must say. I wish they could've been just as professional in accommodating us as they did the wedding. After we left the ceremony, within 20mins of us getting to our room, the other couple received a phone call about credit cards issues. So ONCE AGAIN, we all had to take a break from the wedding and get THE REACH's problem solved. We were planning on going to take that break to go site seeing. Obviously we couldn't do that because we were constantly at the FRONT DESK! Come to find out, the resort was charging one of the cards with FOUR ROOMS when we only had TWO!!!!!! Better yet, they also were using the WRONG CARD, when they were given the current card when we first arrived!!!!!!!!!!! Once that situation was taken care of we had to hurry up to the room to change for the reception at the Casa Marina. Thank goodness were arrived in a timely manner. The Casa Marina took all of our frustration and stress and brought us joy by hosting a wonderful and professional reception. The Casa Marina was truly a joy to go and get away from THE REACH and all their issues. On Sunday, we checked out as soon as we could. WE COULD NOT WAIT TO TURN IN OUR KEYS! Unfortunately, we left Chicago Thursday night, in hopes of a great weekend wedding get away in Key West, for only us to count down the hours until we were going home. For this all being our first time in Key West, FL it was the worst first trip experience we've ever had. I truly will admit that because of the way this was all handled and how we were treated, I don't think we'll ever go to Key West, FL again and most importantly NEVER STAY AT THE REACH AGAIN.

I had done this same trip once, two years ago, and just walked into the Southernmost Hotel and even got a discount there, so I was dismayed when I started searching the Southernmost and other Victorian B & B's (I am an antique dealer), and could find no vacancies. I was afraid, then, to just drive down with no booking, so after several calls with \"no vacancy replies,\" we booked The Reach through Hotels.com. Even with Hotels.com, the cheapest room here was 336.50, and that did not include the parking, and the $25 resort fee, so this was quite expensive I thought, but as it was the Waldorf, I expected to be surrounded by luxury. It was nice enough; I can't really complain about anything except that I think some breakfast should have been included and it wasn't. There was a fancy expresso machine in the room, but I don't drink coffee and wanted tea, so I called the front desk, and I must say they brought a tea maker and tea right up. There was a fridge in the room, with only one $5 bottle of water which was clearly marked which we did not drink, and there were two complimentary bottles of water on a serving tray. I personally did not like the dark, ultra modern furniture, but that's the antique dealer in me. The concierge there was helpful and he booked us a very nice sunset sail boat trip. I was tired and came in from the long walk to and fro from the dock and went to bed, but my friend went down to the bar and she said it was lovely and the drinks were only $10, so that was a plus. We had a nice balcony with a partial view of the ocean which was very nice also, though we really were not there long enough to use it. One minor complaint is that there really wasn't enough room to hang the towels in the bathroom without hanging them in reach of the shower where they would get wet. I was never able to get my ipad online, though I was picking up the signal, but I'm sure they would have helped me with this if I had called. I wasn't there long enough to ask, and I didn't use the pool or the nice beach facilities, so I did not really get any use of the required resort fee, though that wasn't the fault of the hotel. I'm sure if one wanted to stay there, and wanted to spend that much money, the resort activities were nice. We made our trip the Thursday before President's day, and the island was booked. When I make this one or two night trip again, I'll try to go earlier in the month as I did before, and will try again for the Southernmost House which was so beautiful, historic, and which I preferred. Again, my biggest complaint is that no breakfast, not even a continental one, was included. I did view the breakfast buffet and it looked nice, but did not inquire as to the price because I figured it was more than I wanted to pay.

At Casa Marina, you have to sign for them when you get them, and when you bring them back. The Reach has an excellent concierge and check in/out went smoothly. The staff is professional and attentive. The rooms are comfortable, if a bit spartan. The carpets are in desperate need of shampooing - they are FILTHY. The bathrooms are not cleaned well, and you won't get fresh towels unless you ask. Come on - for what we paid? Now, let's talk about dining. The Reach needs to do some work in this area. The Strip House is a decent restaurant, and the breakfast buffets every morning were ok (not fantastic, but serviceable, and way overpriced for what's available). The only real sour note, for us, was dinner at The Strip House on New Year's Eve, which was a DISASTER.

As a hotel, it is very classy but we needed a lot during our stay. We stayed in an Ocean View suite. It was a little smaller than I thought when I booked it, but we had a beautiful view of the sea and the breathtaking gazebo. However, a couple of amenities were broken. I had to request a new iron. Our air conditioning broke, which was quite the debacle because I needed our suite for me and the bridesmaids/stylists before the ceremony/reception. Because it took them so long to fix it they provided me with another suite on the same floor. It was larger and actually worked better but it didn't have the same ocean view. As a result we had to go back and forth between the two rooms (we chose not to completely move because of the view but to temporarily use the second one until after the wedding). This was tedious and cumbersome since the second suite was at the other end of the floor. However, they provided two bottles of sparkling wine to compensate for the trouble, which worked out as a celebration of my wedding. They also permitted us use of both rooms through the next morning. I also had a frustrating experience with my room service breakfast. They completely forgot one meal and the milk they'd promised for our coffee. However, again, when I reported this, they quickly resolved the problem and gifted me the forgotten meal. Other than that, the bed, the rooms, they were beautiful, of high quality and it was a pleasant stay. We didn't try the pool because of the wedding but the crew managing the jet skis were very friendly. As for a wedding venue, the gazebo is absolutely priceless. The Reach probably knows this since it was very costly but we found it worth our dime. The reception was held on the terrace and partly in the Caribe dining room. Unfortunately the Caribe doesn't open up entirely onto the terrace so there was a separation of the two sections (we had tables on both parts). However, as a whole, also a beautiful venue for a reception. If you choose a reception here you must use their restaurant, The Strip House, to cater it. However, it was delicious and we got many complements on it. Again, it was pricey but worth it. As for alcohol, the options were many, the bartenders were friendly and great, BUT they do not offer a cash bar. They seem very opposed to allowing other options, like one extra hour with just bottles of wine for the tables, so it was very unfortunate that we were forced to limit our time for our reception because we could not offer one additional hour of cash bar to our guests. Also, the manager, Jason Gates, offered assistance as a coordinator for the day of the wedding. He did a beautiful job of directing the wedding party and guests to where they/we needed to be, however, he and his staff forgot a few things. Even though we discussed handing out wedding programs, Jason and his staff forgot to put them out (after we'd distributed them to him the previous day). However, his staff did a wonderful job of setting out our guest book and card box. The hardest part, however, was that they didn't have the courtesy to ask what we'd like to do with our remaining cake. My parents spent a lot of money on it and although I see that we should have asked, I still feel it's a common courtesy the venue should offer. They know how much wedding cakes are and they should understand how busy the wedding party/family are that night. They never once asked about the cake and when we finally inquired it was too late for family to transport it home. Therefore The Reach ended up with an entire layer of a very expensive cake. Overall, it's a beautiful location with very accommodating staff. It is expensive but priceless for a wedding, just try to avoid our mistakes. Also, Key West is a party town, so don't expect too much communication from staff until closer to the event.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tuckerton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cSuperb in Every Way\u201d", "Author": "dsul", "ReviewID": "UR122683188", "Content": "I was in Key West for a wedding and was fortunate enough to stay where the wedding took place.

I was laying quietly on my lounge chair with my dog (her name is Mandee) asleep by my side when 3 police officers along with the hotel manager and a hotel security guard confronted me on the beach. I was in shock as were many of the other hotel guests who were actually quite fond of our cute little pet. We were then rudely escorted by the police and the hotel manager to our room where we were subjected to very aggressive treatment by the police and management. They were actually trying to provoke me into doing or saying something that would give them cause to arrest me. Can you imagine the embarrassment and humiliation...and all because I had my dog on the beach sleeping in my lounge chair. We are not a trouble makers and would have complied with the hotel rules about having pets on a leash on the beach, but at no time did the hotel manager or security guard ever state a leash was required. If given the opportunity I would have gladly put Mandee on a leash. Rather, the hotel manager chose to wave a piece of paper in front of me on the beach in front of all the other hotel guests stating we were in violation of the hotel policy. Then after all this harassment and being evicted, I unfortunately left my purse behind. When I called the hotel, the said I could come to the hotel and pick it up, but that if I entered the hotel they were going to call the police...AGAIN!

There were a few annoyances which resulted in a four dot rating versus a five dot rating, but I would recommend the hotel to anyone who would like to have access to a nice beach, and a quiet stay. The rooms are a tad dated, which is to be expected for a hotel this old, the furniture and finishes were just worn down across the board, but our room was kept clean. The rooms (especially ours) can be quite far from any of the elevators or stairs. But we're from the city and walking is no big deal to us so I just mention that for the large number of travelers who feel that any walking is an impediment. No evidence of bed bugs. That is a HUGE plus. This is one of the few hotels with a private sandy beach. It is far superior to the Casa Marina beach, but you're allowed to use the facilities for both properties. The clientele when we went (October, BEFORE Fantasy Fest) seemed to be mostly couples, but there were a handful of kids in the pool every day. We're not averse to walking, so the distance from the restaurants wasn't a deal breaker for us - I think we could make it to Mallory Square in 15-20 minutes. The upside to being off Duval is it was much quieter around the hotel than elsewhere. If you don't like to walk, you may want to stay on Duval. We rented a car but didn't need it at all. We would have liked a hot tub (with a no kid policy if we're building a wish list here), updated facilities, and better pricing on the water activities. The jet skis were pretty expensive compared to what you could arrange through kiosks, and we felt like we were being upsold after we already decided to spend almost $300 on a jet ski trip. The resort fee concept needs to be eradicated. Charge me $25 on the room rate if you want more money, but breaking out a resort fee that is mandatory just comes across as greedy and is a pet peeve.

The pros is that it is quiet, and not bustling. The cons is that it can take 15 minutes to walk to the main square, but for us this was not an issue as Key West is such a small place in the first place, walking was not a problem for us. A very kind gentleman at the front desk upgraded our room which was bigger and had a sea view. The beach had a nice private pier which at night was very suggestive for a pre/post dinner walk. The restaurant offered a fantastic view of the distant thunderstorms in the Atlantic ocean, and the key lime pie was superb.

My husband has a gold vip memebership with Hilton, which usually means they treat us really well. Nothing at this hotel. The walkways to the rooms are painted cement instead of tile, it looks so tacky. We were put in a \"one bedroom suite\" that is so oddly configuired, you have no privacy in the bathroom. When using it, you have to ask your partner to stay in either the bedroom or living space but they have to pass through the bathroom to get between rooms or the closet, very awkward. The rug and couch were stained and there is only one phone (wierd). We sat at the beach twice and didn't get very good service, having to ask for bar service both days. One day, they were short on towels so we could only get one small one apiece, (tho I noticed when they did get more, others were being seated with two or three, but he never came back to us, even tho we tipped him $5) Little things, like entering the lobby, the deskclerks would be chatting, never even acknowledging us. Small thing but seemed to be the feeling from everyone. We did visit the Casa Marina, and loved the pool and beach facilities there and would consider staying there next visit. We have stayed at the Hyatt and Casa before. The few saving graces were, the beds, linens and pillows were great and it's a short walk to Duval. The espresso maker in the room was also nice.

The pool area is kind of small and gets full pretty quickly. So if you want a seat near the pool, come a bit early. The pool itself is very small and with kids playing in the pool, it gets a bit crowded. The only complaint I have is about their Spa. The Spa is located at their sister properly - Casa Marina. When the concierge was booking our appointment, she didn't inform us that its not an actual spa, but a setup in a suite. Also - we assumed we would get two female massage therapists, but were surprised to see a male and female therapist. Since there was no one else available, we had to make peace with that. When making a spa appointment, I strongly recommend specifying the gender of the therapist you want. Otherwise, you will dish out a good $150 for a therapist you don't feel comfortable with.

Their daily resort fee and costly pay for parking increases the rate significantly, but does nothing to increase the quality of service or amenities.

With a day and a half to \"fill\" I decided I'd take the drive and go to Key West for Halloween. A friend recommended The Reach, and I had a great time partying in Key West that night (I went as a pimp and my friend went as Jerry Garcia!). However, the next day I found out that the storm in the Northeast and the loss of power there had forced my CT friend to delay his arrival in Florida. Granted, there's worse spots to be \"stuck\" in than Key West, but I became worried about having to \"scramble\". I needn't had worried. The woman who helped me wasn't just interested in extending my stay, she was interested in making sure I got to see some of the best of Key West. So, I went on a Glassbottom Boat sunset cruise, a quirky, fun bike tour with a New Jerseyan who had arrived some 30 years earlier and never left, and she told me where to go to get the most amazing sushi and best Key Lime pie I ever had in my life. (Her name was Maria Bennett, and she was a delight to have on my side!) When I wanted to relax around the hotel I'd go out to The Reach's (private) beach area. My favorite part was the gazebo out at the end of the little pier they have there. Beautiful out there, and so peaceful. The room was fine, give me Wifi and I'm good.

We had woken up at 3:30am to catch an early flight then drove all the way down to Key West from Ft Lauderdale, so we were beyond exhaused and looking forward to a nap, only to be told our room would not be ready for at least 2 more hours. I was exceptionally polite hoping for a room and explained that we really needed a room now, asked for other options, even paying for an upgrade and were told no rooms were available but the clerk left for a minute and came back wth good news, a room was available and gave us a key. We opened the door and were shocked to find a half a room, diagonally cut in half, so small the bed was pushed up against the wall without a night stand and there was no walking space,no closet space - never saw anything like it - ever!! We should have been told that - perhaps they were tyring to accomodate us but they should have explained/offered it as a temporary accomodation. We decided to take that nap and deal with the issue when we awoke but 20 mins into the nap, phone rings and wakes us up - it is the quality assurance manager asking how our check in was and how our room is. I took the opportunity to be honest and politely explained our frustration still hoping they would do something - and was told to come to the front desk to get a key to 'preview a room that was not ready yet', strange I thought! Upon entering the room it was obvious that something had happened as the loveseat was soaking wet, there were fans pointed at it and a odor eliminator machine running. So now I understood why our original room was not ready! ...and why bit would be a few more hours! Not wlling to take a chance that the sofa would be dry in 2 hours (I would never be able to sit on it knowing) or that the odor would be gone, we went back down to the front desk to express our dissatisfaction and were given absolutely no options or appologies. Finally I took my smart phone and stazrted looking for other hotels when it occured to me their sister property The Reach was around the corner - so I suggested a possible transfer and was told initially told no (worst front desk expereince ever and this is the Waldorf!) until I insisted to be accomodated. We were told to go to Reach to preview their rooms. When we arrived it was an instant change in attitude and energy, the manager was welcoming and accomodating and gave us three room keys, we chose an oceanfront room on a high floor with a fantastic view!! We were sincerely welcomed everytime we walked into the hotel.

We just came back from our 3rd stay here and was very happy to see that the level of excellence for this Hotel remains the same. Cindy checked us in and when we requested a room upgrade from a traditional King, she easily put us in an Ocean view Suite then had champagne brought to us at the front desk. Thanks Cindy!! As usual, the room was very clean, the bed was fantastic(love the sheets) and the Staff is awesome. Ricardo makes a day at the pool stress free and comfortable. He works hard to keep his guests happy and spoiled. Great job Ricardo! The sister property, The Casa Marina, is a quick walk away and beautiful. You have everything you need at either location....use both if you stay here. The Resort is close to Duvall Street but this side of it is chill so you can relax or walk down to the busy side of Duvall or Mallory Square to see the Sunset.

Well the morning came and went,no call from the manager, so I sent my husband to the front desk after our jet ski tour with \"Barefoot Billy's\" which is on site! Awesome by the way! They gave him a key to a suite, which we viewed together, yes it was a lot bigger then the original room that was assigned to us!

I Think Not\u201d", "Author": "Todd W", "ReviewID": "UR117658401", "Content": "Where to begin? Well let's start with the good. The bell staff/valet are very friendly and professional. Probably some of the best I have seen. Whoever trained/manages these folks needs to take a look at the rest of the staff. Front desk staff were also very good, but as you go farther into the hotel, it get's worse. The lobster tail at the restaurant was fantastic...perfectly prepared and the staff there get's an above average rating. Now for the bad. To begin, I needed to change the date of travel 2 days prior to arrival (most hotels require 24 hour notice), I was denied as this property has a 3-day cancellation policy. We came anyway, because I didn't want to lose one night at almost $800, even though we were unsure of the brewing tropical storm just west of the island and the forecast for storms the entire time. I booked the \"Presidential Suite\" and when we checked in, the front desk gave us our room number. I asked, is this the Presidential Suite? They smiled and said yes, all rooms go by numbers but this is the only Presidential Suite. I didn't understand then what seemed to be so funny, but clearly it was an inside joke...this is not the only Presidential Suite and it certainly isn't Presidential...nothing about it was Presidential, nor even a Suite other than it had 2 rooms (living and bedroom). The sofa was something that you would expect to see in a low end motel, complete with stains. There was nothing in the room but a mini-refrigerator that was empty. There was not even a bottle opener!! The king bed, which was comfortable, was too big for the room, but they did manage to squeeze in one nightstand. The televisions play the normal introductions that you see in high-end properties, with the latest selections of movies, etc. But when we couldn't get a movie and called downstairs, we were informed that they had discontinued this service. Really??? Waldorf Astoria???? All in all this room was what I would expect to see at a Clarion Suites or equivalent...not a Waldorf Astoria!! The only nice thing about the room was the balcony, which did have a nice view, but certainly not worth twice the cost of a their next room grade down. Then came the very strange moments. When we arrived for our 2-day stay, half of the beach (which is less than 100 yards long) was closed for a wedding party. The next evening we felt very awkward as we sat on our balcony and the wedding reception was directly below us. Awkward in that everyone was looking right at us as if to say, why are you there? Several times they would speak to our dogs, which were also on the balcony. It was just strange and not what you would expect from a Presidential Suite, which is normally somewhat secluded. I also didn't understand why the hotel wouldn't put us in the \"Presidential Suite\" directly above us, which would have at least offered some level of privacy from the event they must have had scheduled for sometime. I chalk this experience up to learning my lesson. Just because they say this is a Waldorf Astoria Presidential Suite, it doesn't mean Waldorf Astoria as most of us think of it, or Presidential as most of us would think of it!! KIMPTON, where are you when I need you???!!!! Given the comparable rates at this and other high-end properties on Key West, I thnk a fare rate for this room would be about $350, no more than $400/night. Finally a few points if you have never travelled to Key West. First, there are no real beaches. If you want a beach, go somewhere else, like Miami. , as with the other beaches on the island, but that was ok for me, as I have been to the keys before and was not really here for the beach. Also, do not trust your mapping software on this one...the drive may only be about 160 miles from Miami, but it is every bit of 4 hours, because much of it is 2-lane, 45mph and patrolled heavily. It is a pretty drive though and if you are not in a hurry, enjoy!", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mandan, North Dakota", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great setup!

The pool area was clean and also well taken care of by the staff. There were only two problems. The beach was one. This was a nine day beach only vacation from the east side of Florida to the Keys and then to the Gulf. The beach had sea weed and roots washing up on the shore and you would have had to wade through it to get to the water. The water also seemed to be dirty. We did not get in the water. We also had to endure gas fumes. There was also exhaust from an ATV that was being used to move around wave runners going into the water. We moved up from the beach to the pool area. The other thing is this should have been a more adult atmosphere, but we had adults playing with a football and throwing it to kids across the pool so pretty much took over the pool. When the kids went to bed, the pool area at night was quiet and soothing to the mind. The pool temperature was perfect. I paid more than 300 to stay here. It was not worth that much. I selected it because in the Keys natural beaches are a premium. This hotel has a natural beach. There are better hotels and better beaches in the Gulf for a better price. When we travel, we travel for beaches. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be going back to the Keys for beaches. The Westin has a small island off the Keys with a nice fine dining restaurant and some cottages.

While we weren't unhappy, here is my summary of its good & bad points. Good: quiet, clean, relatively spacious room, nice bedding, pleasant staff, w/in walking distance of activities/restaurants (a rather LONG walk), away from the craziness of Duval Street, privileges @ their sister property Casa Marina. Bad: very small & crowded beach & pool area, no beach bar, minimal beach service, outside access to rooms, including no AC in the elevators (& when it's hot in Key West, it is boiling hot!), 4 pm check-in (doesn't seem to matter if you \"check in\" earlier, you can't get into your room until at least 4) & no easy way to change into cooler clothes and/or beach attire while you wait, no other restaurant besides Strip Club, which doesn't open till 8 AM (we had an early morning snorkel trip scheduled, and wanted just coffee/tea, juice, cereal...& could only get very limited items in the gift shop of all places!)...Their sister property Casa Marina feels much more spacious & has a far lovelier beachfront & bar.

This plan life extended another 25+ feet into the water which was a bit gross to trot through (obviously Photoshop was used for the internet pictures).

There was no beverage service when we were there and I had to go get drinks inside the bar. Kind of a hassle. I thought it was odd that no one was walking around the pool or beach taking orders. There was the H2O concierge booth which had water, cool towels and frozen treats for my daughter. That was about it.

We had just come from miami where we stayed at a beautiful hotel with amazing service and we were looking forward to key west. Unfortunately for us, this part of our honeymoon was something we would like to forget. When we pulled up to the hotel we were immediately underwhelmed, we were expecting more from Waldorf Astoria. Upon check in, the greeting was not what I would call friendly. The woman behind the desk seemed bored and was very rude. When we made it to our room we were surprised that our room had two double beds... This was our honeymoon. When I called down I kindly said that there must be a mistake because this was not the room we booked. I was told that I absolutely booked that room and even after explaining that this was my honeymoon I was given no sympathy. The man I talked to was awful, he was not apologetic at all and had a very bad attitude. I asked to speak to the manager, expecting to speak to a professional, I was wrong. The manager was worse, she offered no solution for that night and told me they would move us the next day. I am not a confrontational person at all and was very nice to these people even though they were ruining my honeymoon. When I hung up the phone I couldnt believe how I was just spoken to. We had to wait around the whole day the next day to be moved. They told us they would call our room when the next room was ready. When that time they had given us had elapsed by an hour we called to see if it was ready. There was that attitude again from the \"friendly\" staff. We sat in our room for two more hours until they finally called, we missed half the day sitting inside. Finally we were in our room, we unpacked and headed out. When we came back later we were taken back by how hot it was in the room. We looked at the thermostat.... 86 degrees! We called the front desk and told them the air must not be working, we were told someone would be there to fix it. When we came back from dinner there was no change, still extremely hot. The next day was no different, we dreaded going back to the hotel. It was 95 degrees outside, normally I'd be looking forward to getting back to the room to cool off and take a shower before dinner, but there was nothing refreshing about our 86 degree room. This time we went to the desk and talked to a guy who again acted like we were bothering him. With a could care less attitude, he told us they would look at it again. Sadly our air was never fixed, we couldn't wait to leave. On the last day when we were checking, while staring at the computer, the woman asked how our stay was. I responded by saying \" not great at all, our air conditioning was broken the whole time and it was 86 degrees in our room.\" she said \"oh.\" no apology, nothing. That was it for me, I couldn't get out of there fast enough. In my career I talk to a lot of people on a daily basis. So when I was asked about my honeymoon I talked about the dreadful second half. Everyone told me over and over how terrible that it was that we were treated like that on our honeymoon. It was terrible and i'll have that memory for the rest of my life. It makes me so angry to think of how we were treated and I want people to know this before spening your hard earned money at The Reach.

He or Cael, had our towels rolled out for us on our loungers, before we could sit, down, my wife loved the sunglass cleaning, the frozen cucumbers on her eyes, and the tan mist they would spray on her, the jolly rancher popsicles, and fresh local fruit were great touches also. The restaraunt was sophisticated, and had a steak house atmosphere, and the prices were a little steep. But I really recomend the sirloin burger, at pool side or the breakfast buffet for late risers is also awesome. Over all the local fun was good and the staff had good recomendations for night life and the ablility to recoupe and rest was excellent at the resort. Best of both worlds, for us as my wife got her relaxations, and I got my seedo adventure and parasailing right from our private beach.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mobile, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cWe had a Wonderful time....Excellent Service!\u201d", "Author": "Cathy1486", "ReviewID": "UR115009838", "Content": "We took a mini 6 day vacation in the month of June; the Hotel was great but the services was excellent!!

Very nice and extremely accommodating staff. Treated us as if we were the only guests that mattered at any particular moment. Nice pool right next to their own private sandy beach with pool and beach service. Nice touches such as complimentary champagne in the afternoons and virgin mojitos next to the elevator. Our boutique suite with a \"partial\" ocean view would have been called a full ocean view compared to other resorts. Had double sinks, tub/shower combo and separate shower. Our suite was the closest room to the elevator yet we never heard the elevator or people talking outside our room. We also had a view of the pool and beach yet still very quiet. When the gift shop was closed, a front desk employee opened the shop and allowed me to make a totally non-emergency purchase. Fabulously comfortable bed and pillows. We would return in a heartbeat! A few suggestions: Offer complimentary shuttle to sister property and drop offs to the other end of Duval Street. Gift shop needs to stay open at least until dark. Sell those cooling neck scarves that have the beads that you wet and stay cool for hours. Room Service menu should offer common \"American\" sandwiches like grilled cheese, BLT's, french dip, hot dogs, etc. Sometimes chefs get so caught up in their \"artistry\" that they forget food is to be eaten to satisfy hunger. Make a real french dip, and make it the best french dip possible. Add a grilled cheese and make it with 3 different cheeses on a fabulous bread. Make homemade potato chips. Every hotel's food service should be able to make a common sandwich at any time of the day or night even if it isn't on the menu. Pool/Beach Service needs to add snorkeling equipment. You can snorkel right from the beach and it would be wonderful to be able to do so without having to bring your own equipment. The only room suggestions would be to have softer towels and make the shelves in the bedroom \"pull outs\" so you can use them as drawers.

Instead, they said they would get housekeeping right on it. We had lunch at the Strip House (above average tasting lunch, not terrific) and our room was still not ready. Two hours after our arrival the room was ready. About 3 hours later they brought the champagne and strawberries -- not the same as walking in and having it waiting. Plus, there were 6 little strawberries and nothing else to make the presentation memorable AND the bill for this little celebration -- $68! We ate the strawberries (they were good) and ended up taking the champagne home with us. We didn't want it by the time it arrived and never found the right time to drink it. The room seemed dingy, couch and cushions on chairs worn and dirty looking, not crisp and clean as we had remembered. The 3rd day of our visit they had a 'ventilation problem' in The Strip House and we had to go next door to their sister hotel for lunch by the pool. That hotel had a convention and lunch was a limited menu, drab food. The day before at the other pool had been a terrific lunch with fun drink of the day specials. When we went for breakfast after the 'ventilation problem' the kitchen still wasn't up and running and we were referred to snacks at the hotel store. No offer of free coffee and a danish for our troubles as there was no offer of a free drink when our room wasn't ready. Not that a hotel has to do those things, but I was expecting it from this resort. We had great concierge service, especially from Mary and the plane ride from Fred Cabanas was an amazing experience.

Not only that, the thief went into a backpack on the floor and took the power cord for the computer and a bag of cashews the hotel had given us for our anniversary (they did give us a small bottle of champagne and two bags of nuts along with a 'happy anniversary' note). As far as we can tell the burglar only took the computer, the cord and the nuts! (Was he hungry?) Good thing he didn't take that expensive bottle of champagne.

Maybe I am a lil bit more critical with this resort, cause I had some fever and felt really bad. Check in was ok, the friendly receptionist told us the -slightly complicated- way to our room, upgrade due to HHonors status worked out very well, the bellman was also friendly and our luggage was really fast in our room. The size of the room (partial sea view suite) was stunning, it was very clean, made a very nice impression on first sight. It also had a huge modern bathroom with nice, high quality bath amenities. It had also a nice big balcony, with a charming view on the pool, palms and the ocean. After having a delicious coffee from the Nespresso coffee maker, we went out to Duval Strees (just 5 min walk) and had a nice dinner and shopping there. So the location of the resort is REALLY good, in about 3 minutes you walk to the \"90 miles to Havanna\" Point. GREAT! After coming back late - the next important point: Our bed was really good - simply full 5 stars for great sleeping comfort! Wireless Internet is available, with good connection - due to HHonors it was for free. Breakfast in the morning was ok, served in a - lets say interesting location - maybe not the best for families with small children, if you do not want to expain to them, why there are pictures of semi-naked ladies on the walls ;-) Breakfast buffet was just ok, compared to european 5-star-hotels it can not compare neither in size/amout of the buffet nor in the quality of the food. As I said - it was ok, fruits were really nice, but there been no tasty hams, cheeses or other stuff, which I would like to have for breakfast as I am paying a bunch of money for it. Slightly minus - check out was not really nice and even I am used to get it always and the hotel was for sure not booked out (checked it on the internet) they did not give us a late check-out. I got really angry because of this, the receptionist should not lie to a customer, cause Internet proof is really easy to get! Therefore - decrease in Service!! Pool area is really nice, the small sand-beach is really nice and the small pier is just THE extra, which make my four to five star feedback getting Five stars.

The hotel has an appealing location in Old Key West and a very good beach front location. You have to walk a few minutes to reach the start of Duval Street. I was very happy that I booked a junior suite with sea view. The room itself was clean, nice and with an attractive contemporary decor. I should been very concerned if I booked an standard without view and had to pay high rates. Some rooms have just awkward views over a parking deck and seems to be not as nice as our junior suite. I could expect more amenities and more attention to details, but I have to realize this is not a Four Seasons. However, this place has so much more features that just make it to a great place. The pool area was on our first day crowded with youngsters and children and I was a little bit disappointed because I had expected a more mature and silent place, however the following days it was more adults than children. Good pool service and you have the opportunity to have a sun chair by the beach. The pool servants make sure that it was only residents that used their facilities, but I can hardly believe this was the case our first day because we didn't saw the youngsters around the hotel (in fitness center, bar, restaurant, breakfast etc). It was nice to see how well maintained the beach was. Upon arrival the room wasn't ready. It was a friendly receptionist that promised us to give a call when the room was ready and they did - this is good service. One disappointment was that the hotel couldn't arrange massage or spa appointment at all during our three days, so if you want to visit this (located at the sister resort Casa Marina) make sure to arrange before arrival. We had a breakfast included rate and the breakfast was ok, but nothing special. For us who just stayed at the InterContinental in Washington with a great and to the point well composed breakfast experience the breakfast buffet felt like an average buffet. But to have the breakfast at the terrace with the sound of the sea and the Key West sun is nothing that you can pass. One of our lunches was at the Casa Marina Hotel and I recommend you to visit this place for lunch. It was good wraps and burgers and .

Note that pets are welcome for a non-refundable payment of $125, which one would assume would be used to clean up any evidence of doggie damage with this good bit of change. Obviously, not. After a call to the management to clean the floor during turndown service, the floor remained as dirty as when we entered the room when we returned from dinner. Another call for thorough cleaning that night for the following morning, and again before leaving the room the next day, we returned in the afternoon to...dirty floor with same floor covering as the day before. After a third complaint, we received free breakfast and were moved to a one-bedroom handicapped suite with a sofa sleeper. Unfortunately, as we were showing the very helpful bellman where to place our things, we noticed that apparently the maid had forgotten to make the bed after the last occupant left. Later, after the bed was changed, while taking a shower, the faucet handle fell off in my hand followed by the joining ring behind it. Then, I noticed that one of the screws that held the wall plate of the faucet to the wall was about to fall off, so I screwed it back in. The sofa sleeper was so lumpy that I felt like the princess and the pea, only there was a lump for every spot of my body. Needless to say, I got very little sleep. After two nights in the suite, not a mop or vacuum seemed to have traveled anywhere near our room. Coffee cups and glasses were not washed and no coffee supplies were refreshed.

My advice is to wait until news that the owners of The Reach (A Waldorf-Astoria Property) have figured out that they have to maintain the property to the same high levels as the rates they charge their guests.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful place for my little getaway!\u201d", "Author": "DroogieRN", "ReviewID": "UR103912014", "Content": "My husband gave me his Hilton Honors points to take a little five-day vacation to Key West with my friend.

It's around a 15-minute walk from the ferry terminal to the resort or you can pay a $12 flat fare by cab which would take 5 minutes. The walk is not bad though. If you plan it right - you can see the highlights of Key West, including the Southernmost point, the lighthouse, Hemingway's house, the Little White House and walk up Duval Street so you can get a sense of where things are when you go back there at night. The Reach Resort is very modern looking. The staff was friendly. Free newspapers are provided. At one point, we saw some glasses of champagne free for the taking in the lobby. We read reviews here and requested rooms away from the elevators. Our room had a terrace overlooking the courtyard, and pool and ocean in the distance to our left. Toiletries in the bathroom smelled wonderful. No complaints about the room except the coffee maker wasn't working but that wasn't a big deal for us. The room was very clean and in great shape. It's one of the few if not the only resort that has its own natural beach in Key West. The beach isn't huge but it's just right for the number of people who stay there. The sand is powdery and clean. The water is clean - you just have to avoid stepping and stubbing your toe on the scraggly rocks below. If you have a pair of waterproof beach shoes, bring those. After awhile, you'll know where the rocks are and learn to avoid them. The water is around 4 1/2 feet deep for at least 15 yards out. Free popsicles and drink samples are given by the pool every now and then. Note that this service didn't extend to the beach area. There are two small shower areas. At the beach, there's an attendant who sets you up with chairs and umbrellas depending on availability - the earlier you get there, the better your chances of getting them. They also give you towels that they lay down on the chairs. There's a big gazebo with two benches that you can visit. There is a small store before you get to the pool area that sells towels, beach toys, swimsuits, beachwear, Starbucks coffee and sun lotion. There is an area in the beach where you can rent out jetskis and kayaks. The price for jetskiing is $70 for half an hour per person, $110 for an hour per person OR you can take the 27-mile tour around the island for $130 for two people. We didn't try eating at The Strip House - it's an expensive steakhouse but it also offers less expensive fare for when you're at the beach. Drinks were on the expensive side but you can walk a block away to Ana's Deli, buy your beers there and bring them to the beach without being too obvious. We also bought sandwiches at the deli and ate them on the beach. A couple of blocks away is the Southernmost Beach Cafe where you can get a great breakfast (very reasonably priced) with an oceanview (you can call ahead and try to reserve an oceanview table which we did). At night, there's not really anything going on and the Strip House (which has a bar) is closed by 10 pm or so. Your best bet is to leave the resort around 5:30/6 pm to go to Mallory Square to watch the sunset and have dinner there then hang out at the various bars on Duval. At night, the streets are on the dark side so take a cab home for $12. The Reach Resort is related to the Casa Marina and you can supposedly try out the facilities there but we didn't have time.

Overall it was a great stay. the property was well maintained and the location just a block of Duval was an ideal location. If there was one drawback for our stay it was that there were some inconsistencies with the service of the front desk and bar/waitstaff. Check in was not as smooth as we would have liked, first, there was only one staff member to check in guests, this was around 4 pm which was the normal check in time and there was a decent line. Second, the room was not ready and they said they would call us in about 20 minutes. after no phone call and about 30 minutes, I went back to the front desk and the room still wasn't ready. they again told me that they would give me a call in about 20 minutes. finally at about the hour mark, I returned and there was a different staff member there and he was finally able to check us in. And as for the bar/waitstaff, the service outside was hit or miss depending on which server you had. An inconvenience was the bar & room service closing at 10 pm. Another was having to leave a resort property to do a happy hour. And it also seemed a disproportional amount of the daily activities were at the sister facility Casa Marina, ie happy hour, spa. I point out these inconveniences as constructive feedback for the resort. Being a Waldorf Astoria property, one would expert a higher, more consistent level of service. However, on a very positive note the pool and beach staff (particularly Ricardo and young blond guy, sorry I don't remember his name) were very attentive to our needs whether at the pool or the beach.

This was great because we often went to the pool and then returned to the room for showers before heading out to Duvall Street for the afternoon and again in the evening. The hotel is a short 2 block walk from the South end of Duvall Street and only 3 block from the Southernmost Point. With the island being only about 1-1/2 miles long up Duvall Street, we were able to walk everywhere. The fact that the hotel is a couple of blocks off Duvall and at one end of the strip we didn't hear the noise typically associated with the nightlife on Duvall Street. (We stayed out late, but not as late as much of the younger crowd - I used to be able to do that! LOL) The hotel had guests of all ages from families to Spring Breakers to middle-aged and older couples. The service at the pool was excellent and the entertainment by pool attendant Ricardo was a hoot! Drinks at the pool included gratuity and were competitively priced for a resort.

Although its sister property next door, the Casa Marina, has a much more sophisticated feel to it, I thought this resort was great, too. I've stayed at both and I think the one big difference is that there seem to be more rooms with balconies at the Reach versus the Casa Marina where, although I was a Diamond member, I still got stuck in a small room overlooking the parking lot at the Casa. At the Reach, I was given a very nice room with an oceanview. I think the Reach does a better job at upgrading and accomodating guests. The Reach only has one pool compared to two at the Casa, but I think the beach area at the Reach is more accessible than the Casa, where you have to walk down a pier and step down a few stairs into the water. Our friend got stung by a man-o-war jelly fish out there at the Casa which sort of put a damper on her trip unfortunately, but that is besides the point. All in all, the Reach is very nice and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Staff seemed friendlier here than at the Casa, although I was told they float between both resorts, so maybe I just caught some on a bad day (or bad week) at the Casa during my previous stay which warranted my less than positive review of the Casa. The only negative is the long walk down Duval Street to get to Mallory Square and where most of the action is. It's a nice walk, but it is a walk, so if you want to be in the middle of the action, but don't want to walk 20 minutes to get there - down Duval with shops and restaurants the entire way, then you might not want to stay at the Reach or Casa - or do what I did and grab a Margarita at one of the bars for the walk (they serve in to-go cups - you can drink out in public) to make the walk even more fun. But, if the long walk is not your thing, then you may want to stay somewhere like the Hyatt, which I have stayed at also and can't say enough good things about. I've stayed at the Hyatt, the Casa Marina and the Reach, and the Hyatt is hands down my favorite due to its location and also the warm staff. The staff at the Casa should take lessons from the staff at the Hyatt.

The view of the ocean was amazing, the room was not. Very cramped with virtually no room for anything and we pack economically. Bathroom extremely small and fan did not work. We were able to hear people hollering, yelling and trooping around the halls all night long. I realize it was spring break time, but we felt a hotel that is a Waldorf, would have been quieter. The pool area was small and the service was not what expected. A definite lack of seating and umbrellas and the grilling we were put through just to receive a towel was rude and uncalled for. Additionally, we had to wear paper bracelets on our arms. Really?!! There were occasional free popsicles, but at the rate we were paying, I expected more and better service. Not everyone there was a 'spring breaker'. The restaurant itself was extremely overpriced and looked like an old-fashioned bordello; dark and all red velvet. Breakfast service was atrocious on the porch. The waitress actually told me to wait while she cleaned all the tables then promptly forgot I was there.

I cannot believe we paid over $300 for this service. We stayed at the Reach last year and it was nice. So we decided to return. But this service was unacceptable. The agent said the hotel was having difficulty flipping the rooms over quickly because they were booked 100%.

IMHO that would be attentive and elegant service with a consistent attention to detail, beautiful accomodations, and an atmosphere where the little things are naturally and seamlessly taken care of. The Reach is an older resort (from my understanding recently updated and remodeled) in a beautiful location, but I feel it should not be branded Waldorf Astoria. It doesn't deliver what one would expect from such a high end brand. Example: When we arrived, with bags, there was no bell service available, so that meant we had to drag our bags to the front desk. We put our bags in storage, awaiting the room to be made up. When we returned to retrieve the bags, the bell person asked us \"Do you need anyone to take these bags to your room?\" At a resort of this caliber, the question should have been, \"may I take your bags to the room.\" This also would seem a better way to get a tip! We purchased one room type, which wasn't available, due to the resort changing room types the week we arrived, as well as some other details. We were surprised when the room we were given didn't resemble the one on the web site. In fairness, this was rectified by the personable front office manager, Jason, after a couple of visits. He lowered our room rate to what it should have been for a comparable room, at our request. We still would have preferred our desired accomodations, but this was a satisfactory resolution. There were other little things which I wuld have expected at a Waldorf...how about writing pads and pens in one's room? Headphones for use in the exercise room? There were other little things I could mention, but I'll leave it at that. I understand mgmt. wanting to outfit the hotel with the new energy efficient bulbs. Couldn't they have purchased the ones with frosted casing, rather than using the ones with the bare squiggly bulbs in the fixtures, including all recessed down lighting that I saw? To me, that's what I would expect in an economy to mid-range hotel, not a luxury resort.

Felt more like a Comfort Suites to me and definitely seems more like a 3 or 3.5 star property at best. First off the service sucks. Staff was not on top of their game and besides not being helpful some of them were just plain rude - in one instance instead of offering a hand a pool attendant literally yelled at a guest for moving a small side table (that was not being used) closer to where they were lounging poolside. I could tell from when we arrived in our room the bathroom floor was not properly cleaned as there was hair and dirt on the floor. Manager response to complaints was that staff was \"in training\" - no apologies. Other little attention to details include carpet stains and scuff marks throughout the room - a simple carpet cleaning and a few paint touch ups could have made all the difference. This hotel has exterior corridors which means that the stairwells can be grubby at times with traces of litter. I became very familiar with the stairs as the elevator was out of service the entire 4 day stay. The exterior stairways and corridors also means that you have to dodge a lot of puddles if it rains and you will definitely get wet walking to the lobby area. The saving grace of this hotel is undoubtedly its location on its own private beach on the quiet side of Key West but close enough to walk or bike to Duval Street. With the $25 daily resort fee and $15 daily self parking however, you might as well bite the bullet and head next door to the Casa Marina which is the seemingly higher quality sister resort also with its own beach. Otherwise keep looking, there are many many hotels and BB's offered on the island of Key West.

We traveled with another couple and the resort was good to put us in rooms next to one another, which was fantastic. My husband and I have been to Key West 6 times and always stayed at the La Concha on Duval, but we were looking for a little more upscale and relaxing for this trip. Location: The Reach Resort is located on a beautiful private beach near the Southernmost Point. Since coming to Key West, I've always loved it except for the lack of adequate beaches and having the beach at the Reach Resort has completely changed my mind. The sand is soft and plentiful and the atmosphere is beautiful. It would make a wonderful location for a wedding - with the gorgeous pier. It is about a mile walk to \"where the action is\", but it is a nice walk to and from to work off the calories of the margaritas! Rooms: We had a suite and it was quite roomy and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a stand-up shower and a tub/shower, which was a huge benefit to getting ready. There were two flat screen TVs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room and a nice wet bar area with a fridge. We did not have an issue but the couple we traveled with did find small ants in the wet bar area and the hotel accommodated them by moving and upgrading them to a new room. Pool / Beach: As indicated, the beach is wonderful. The staff will put out as many chairs as you need in any location on the beach of your choice. They had fun beach games to play and waiter/waitress service so all you had to worry about was sitting and relaxing. The pool is also nice, clean, and large enough to accommodate the guests. It was refreshing and is open at night. Restaurants: We never got the chance to eat at the Strip House, which is the restaurant on-site. We did order and split a sandwich while on the beach which was good. Prices are what you would expect for resort faire - be aware tha gratuity is always added to service by the pool and beach! Parking: There is ample parking if you have a car. They offer valet or self-parking with a difference in cost (I believe it is $20 for valet, $15 for self each day). The parking was a bit expensive, especially considering you pay a resort fee - but this is something I've seen in most hotels in Key West that have parking. Overall: I really enjoyed the relaxing feel of this hotel in Key West compared to our previous stays. The pool and beach atmosphere were perfect for a long weekend trip to ring in a new decade. The walk to and from Duval didn't bother us one bit and it even opened our horizons to different places such as the Rum Bar (a good place for a nightcap on the way home) and two great breakfast places.

I must say that after booking it as a \"Waldorf Astoria\" property, we were very disappointed. The only thing that made up for it was the extremely generous response of the supervisor on duty (Jeanette) when we expressed our concerns the morning after our first night. We booked an \"island view boutique suite\", not the top but not the cheapest room available. It was one large, poorly laid out space, the couch a mile from the tv and very little counter space, no desk or table. The small closet was in the bathroom, no tub, the water took forever to get hot, there was dust in the air vents, cracked caulking around the sink, scuff marks on the wall, a chip out of the headboard. I could go on! When we came to the front desk with our issues we were reffered to Jeanette who was more gracious than one could ever expect. She not only offered to change our room, but actually came with us to look at options. We ended up in a 2 room oceanview suite. She also waived the resort fee for our entire stay and comped us for 1 bkfst. I almost feel guilty not writing a good review because she was so nice! But other members deserve to get the facts. To be honest, the new room had some issues as well, but after that kind of upgrade, we weren't going to complain. At least we now knew that the !st room wasn't an unusual, exceptional unrenovated room. The rooms really need some updating. The room at the Hampton Inn in Key Largo, where we stayed on the way down, was far superior to the rooms we had here! The cleaning of the rooms could be much more thorough. We attempted to get help from the concierge with mixed results. She was often not at the desk. The first time we saw her, it felt like we were annoying her with our questions, although she did warm up a bit with time. The maintenance and bellman staff we encountered were excellent. We thought the location was great, with access to the ocean and at the quiet end of Duval St. It is a bit of a walk to get to Mallory Sqr. As for the restaurant: We never ate there after looking at the menu. Who needs to spend $40 for a steak that doesn't even include side dishes? The only meal we had there was our comped bkfst. I actually found the restaurant a bit odd. It was called the Strip House and had vintage pictures of naked women with fully exposed breasts on the walls. I'm not a prude, but is that appropriate for the only restaurant at a full service resort? I hope no one with children goes there! We found the bkfst. to be extremely mediocre, especially considering the usual $18 + tax&tip cost. We thought there was a spa but it's actually at the neighboring resort and there, only on the beach. Since it was about 60 degrees when we were there, that doesn't work too well.

Easy walk up the street to get to all the restuaurants, bars, etc. Deval is abouit a mile and a half long, so if you can walk this, it is a perfect hotel. Also tons of taxi's and bike taxi's everywhere. Do not like the hotel fees Florida resorts charge, but most do it, so I expect it.

The first day on the beach, we ordered a couple of drinks and a serving of chips and salsa, and I was a little surprised to pay $10 for a frozen margarita. After that, we did what most other people did - brought our own munchies and drinks. If you do order something on the beach, note that they add an 18% \"service charge\" - aka \"tip\". Other than munchies on the beach and coffee in the gift shop, we didn't eat at the resort, so can't comment on the restaurant.

Here goes: PROS: Great neighborhood. You are close enough to the action on Duval St and it is a 20 minute walk to Mallory Square to see boats, sunsets and tons of tourists. But you are still in a quiet area on the beach. Key West is not a beach town. There are only a couple of hotels on the beach and the beach area is tiny. We found it clean unlike some people who said it was littered with seaweed and smelled. The hotel is beautiful inside and the grounds are well kept. The pool is an average size and found it pretty quiet maybe because we were there in January when kids are at school. The service was decent but not great. Our room was clean and was a wheelchair accessible suite. At first they gave us the wrong room with one bed but after a phone call they accommodated us quickly to a bigger room with two beds. They even lowered the bed for me since it was too high for a wheelchair disabled user. The steak restaurant in the hotel was very good. I love the 1930s red speak easy decor. It reminded me of restaurants in NYC. It was a very pricey meal but quite good. The place was empty on a Sunday night. The restaurant has big windows that open out and you can smell, see, and hear the water. It is next door to Casa Marina which I think is its sister resort. It is more beautiful and has a bigger beach. I think we will stay there next time. You do not need a car in Key West. That was our biggest mistake. You can walk anywhere on foot. If you don't feel like walking they have cabs and trolleys. If you want to venture outside of Key West then rent a car. The airport has cabs to take you into Key West and the ride is quick. There are tons of water excursions you can do without having to rent a car to get to them. The restaurants are outstanding and it is a \"foodie's paradise.\" People are laid back and the vibe is warm and hospitable. I have never felt so relaxed. I laughed when I read a few people complain about \"homeless people.\" Get over yourself. Two homeless people are not a threat. Move to NY to experience true homelessness. CONS: We drove up to the valet and we asked where the disabled parking is. It was all the way in the back and after unloading and trying to find the lobby from that point was a nightmare. The signage was terrible. The place is quite big and circles and circles forever before you see a sign to the lobby. From that point to finally getting up to our room was exhausting. Hilton needs to have better wheelchair parking and have the valets follow people and help them. Next, the stupid parking fee and resort fees. I knew what they were up front but I hate them none the less. These costs should be factored in. I hate being nickel and dimed. We didn't even use the pool, gym or beach so why did I need to pay the resort fees? I should have contested them since I am disabled and couldn't use all the facilities. Overpriced. For $300 a night the service could have been better. People were nice but I expected a bit more. I did not find anyone rude like many people said. Conclusion: We like this hotel but we will stay at the Casa Marina or a few other local ones. I wanted a hotel on the beach and this one is lovely but for the same price I could stay next door and have a nicer hotel. I love the location of this hotel and you are near everything.

My family has lived in Key West for 25 years and my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family has resided here for several generations. I wanted to write a letter to express my unhappiness at The Waldorf Reach Resort and Striphouse from my event. This is not a short story but yet a long story of what I personally and my family went through. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this letter to have some closure with all the feelings I have. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this letter to the people with who The Waldorf Reach Resort & The Striphouse have to answer to. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing to those people, the ones that think everything is perfect and everyone is doing their job to the best of their ability at this resort and restaurant, because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not true and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fair to have worked so hard and planned and spent so much money and time to have these feelings. Being a Key West local, operator of a Key West restaurant and associated with more than 300 weddings per year I thought it imperative that I write this letter. My family & I started looking at location in January of 2009. We looked at everyplace in town and I was in love with The Reach. The Gazebo was perfect and I loved the idea of setting up a tent on the beach for a reception directly after the ceremony. You see we offer similar things here as far beach weddings and receptions. However, I was not thrilled to get married where I spend every waking moment. I wanted someplace special. I wanted a place that offered what I offer and could deliver what exactly I wanted. I started speaking with Luke Vossen, Sales and Operations Manager, January 12, 2009. I explained what I was looking for: ceremony in the gazebo, a tent on the beach for reception afterwards and a customized menu. We went back and forth through email for a few months while he discussed with his bosses. He came back April 3rd, 2009 and said it was a go if we could start set up at 8am the morning of the June 26th, 2010 and break down immediately after. I was ecstatic; my dream wedding was going to come true!! I signed a contract with The Waldorf Reach Resort & The Striphouse on April 16th, 2009. We are all in the same business here in Key West and I soon heard through the grapevine that Luke was leaving. The last time I spoke to Luke was July 24th, 2009 he gave me Cheryl Kahn-Brocco email address if I needed anything or had any question\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to contact her; she was based out of The Waldorf in New York City, which I have been to several occasions and actually had a phenomenal brunch with my family there one year. I did contact Cheryl a few times regarding alcohol packages and menus. She got back to me quickly and with the requested information. September 17th, 2009 Cheryl emailed me Heidi Greenburg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contact information and told me she was the new onsite contact that would replace Luke Vossen. My event was not until June 26th, 2010, I did not have the need to contact Heidi until I finished my menu. I secured other needed vendors, tent rental, photographer, flowers, specialty linens, DJ, etc. March 1st, 2010, I completed my menu and emailed it over to Heidi with a cc to Cheryl. It took 2 months to get something in writing from the Striphouse regarding my menu. Getting closer to my event my mother & I went by introduced ourselves to Heidi and walked around the venue, going over set up & looking at hotel rooms for our guests. May 18th, 2010 I met with Heidi and I brought the local tent rental owner with me. You see I am a wedding planner at my family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beach caf\u00c3\u00a9 and I understand there can be surprises. However, I wanted to make absolutely sure there would be no surprises because I could not be a bride and a wedding planner on the day of my event! So I put Heidi and the party rentals owner together. The three of us walked the site, talked it all through\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..so there would be no surprises when the party rental showed up at 8am with tent in hand. Ha! About two weeks prior to my event, my mother, me and a close friend whom is also a local business owner came over to The Reach and drew a layout on paper so all the vendors had a picture of the event I was trying to create in their hand. My mother gave Heidi a copy of the layout that day, I will attach a copy. In my mind everything was golden. I had a fabulous menu, great bar, beautiful tent with special lighting, beautiful tables! Everyone is local we are all friends we do business together all the time The Waldorf Reach Resort & The Striphouse have approved everything, we are all on the same page! Right?! No, Wrong!!! June 24th, 2010 * Day Rehearsal I had hired a close friend of my Julie Shreck-Fuhrman with Simply You Weddings to help me with day of coordination. On the day of the rehearsal Julie directed an entire run through of our event, Heidi was present at this rehearsal. Everything went fine. June 26th, 2010 *My Wedding Day! 8:00am With a preauthorized plan the tent rental company arrives. They are immediately held up by Heidi and told they have to set up on the opposite beach which at this time is underwater!!! Four hours later Kevin Speidel, General Manager for The Casa Marina & Reach Resort, totally unaware of our wedding and our plans that have been approved by The Reach and Striphouse. Kevin shows up at The Reach resort at 1:30pm and tells my vendors that they can absolutely NOT set up a tent on the beach. Not knowing what else to do, my friend, my wedding planner, totally distraught shows up at my mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house at 2:00pm. Please picture this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.You are the bride surrounded by your family and bridesmaids. You are drinking champagne, celebrating this joyous occasion. Everyone is getting their hair & make up done, taking pictures\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.CELEBRATING! Poor Julie knocks on my mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s door and takes her outside to talk and tell her they wonderful news! \"Kevin Speidel & The Reach cancelled your tent! Nothing is set up and your daughter's wedding starts in exactly four and a half hours with 90 people attending.\" Can you even imagine that scenario? I notice my mother outside talking to Julie and I walk out to there to hear what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on. I knew it had to be something big because Julie can handle almost anything. As Julie tells me the story of the day, I get nauseous! To the point I start drinking pepto bismal on my wedding day, thank you Kevin, Heidi & The Reach! What a fantastic memory. At this point, my mother has to get dressed and go down to The Reach and sort things out. Can you believe this? My mother in the middle of our celebrating with champagne, hair, makeup, her first daughter getting married she has to leave to go sort out this CLUSTER! My mother meets Kevin Speidel and begs him not to do this and he relents, thank goodness and my mother is back home forty-five minutes later. So now we have exactly four hours to set up a 30 x 50 tent and $10,000.00 worth of lounge furniture, specialty linens, specialty chairs, extravagant centerpieces, etc. What a nightmare. My vendors are scrambling all over the place trying to get this done. What really upsets me is nobody from the Reach is helping them. You have this huge resort, that has a huge staff, and THE REACH has caused my team to be delayed 6 hours! You would of thought they could have pulled people together to get this done. Why did they not help out? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand? If I did not have rent specialty linens they would have set up white linens\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6why could they not put linens on the tables? Or put the chairs around the tables, or help with furniture? Why why why? It absolutely makes my stomach turn to have such a plan turn to crap because a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153famous resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cannot get it together or communicate with each other. 6:00 pm On my invitations my guests were told to arrive promptly at 6:00pm for a 6:30pm ceremony. My guests arrived and 60% of my event was set up. At this point my guests were all waiting in The Striphouse bar, from what my Aunt has written to me. There was no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd point of contact. The bartender described by my guests, male, dark hair, was telling people who requested a glass of water \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that they were not serving water today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just out of curiousity, those of you that are reading my letter, have you ever heard of a Waldorf Resort \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not serving water today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I find that pretty unbelievable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve planned a $60,000 + wedding and the bar will not serve my guests a glass of water\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6WOW. Just a FYI, I was told by numerous guests how rude this bartender was to them. Why? Why was he so rude? I know my family was tipping him? Why? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it? 6:20pm Everyone was directed by my wedding planner to the Gazebo and seated. 6:30pm I pulled up with my parents and my wedding party in a limo and we all jumped out. Only to be told sadly that we were not ready. So we all got back in the limo and sat there for 20 minutes. Then my planner came and got us. We unloaded the limo and lined up on the side of the Striphouse and waited another 15 minutes. While we are waiting I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m watching my vendors\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6let me say that again\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6my vendors scramble with linens and equipment and centerpieces. Heidi was there and 1 guy from The Reach helping. So, the Reach & The Striphouse delayed my set up by 6 hours and then they only have 2 people helping. From what I was later told they did not do anything except set up the bar and put out some linen. I started my processional at 7:15pm, forty-five minutes late. I had planned (for a year and a half) to walk by the tent and see everything set up & ready. This is why I chose the Reach & The Striphouse, I felt confidant that Luke could make it happen. He saw the vision. Well let me tell you, my father and I walked up and stopped at the tent and looked at it. The chairs were still in a pile, the linen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the tables the centerpieces were in a pile, the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was laying in the bushes, but I have to say this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the bar was set up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I continued my processional to the gazebo where my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and my Pastor were waiting. Julie, my wedding planner, could not attend the ceremony she had to stay and set up everything that The Reach & Striphouse Staff could not. Because of this, the microphone that was rented for the ceremony, so my 90 guests could hear the beautiful ceremony that my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I worked on for months could not be found. (we later saw it in the corner, but who knew?) So, only the first two rows (30 people) could actually here the ceremony. Very sad. Ceremony was complete at 7:45pm. We took 30 minutes worth of family pictures. (a little rushed since we are 45 minutes late) then at 8:15pm my husband & I with our two photographers took off in the limo to Fort Zachary Taylor State Park to take some sunset photos. We did not return until 9:00pm. By this time everything looked beautiful. My husband and had 2 hours to greet all of our guests, have our first dance, cut cake, etc. Nobody in my entire wedding party got to eat dinner because it was so rushed. I never even got a chance to sit down. I did have a few appetizers when we were taking pictures and the food was excellent. Absolutely excellent! All of my guests raved about how wonderful the food was. It far exceeded my expectations. However, when we asked if we could get boxes to go, just for the wedding party we were denied. Which is unheard of, at our events we always set 3 bags aside for the bride and her family at the beginning of the event. As for my husband and I we went through thru at Miami Subs. I ate a philly cheese steak in my $5,000.00 dress on my wedding day. HA! My parents purchased a very special case of Moet Imperial Champagne that was supposed to be set up at my table for my wedding party. Instead Heidi used this champagne for my champagne toast and never even chilled it. This interesting because I tried to cancel the champagne toast for the event. I have found with our events people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even drink the champagne they usually toast with whatever they are drinking. Last year, I planned a surprise 50th Birthday Party for my mother at Atlantis in the Bahamas and paid extra for a champagne toast that nobody drank. So when I asked Heidi if I could cancel the toast 1 month prior to the event she said no. So in actuality I paid for champagne toast and provided a case of my own champagne! And it was warm! Lastly, promptly at 11:00pm we had to leave. Even though weeks earlier we tried to extend for an extra hour and I had it in writing from Luke Vossen that we could for a fee, we were denied. We all stood and watched as one male staff member, blonde with a pony tail started clearing tables. Let me explain to you how he cleared up the tables before my mother and my friend who owns the specialty linen store stopped him. He threw the centerpiece on the ground, took the 30 inch mosaic mirrors that were rented, through them on a table behind him and proceed to take the chocolate satin linen with the gold beaded overlay and all the plates and silverware in the middle!!! Do you understand he bunched the linen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up with plates and silverware still inside!!! When my mother tried to stop him, in front of my planner and numerous friends, he started to swear at her!! $60,000 Event and I have a staff member in my mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face swearing at her. Julie, my wedding planner immediately went and got Heidi. My friend and her boyfriend started breaking down my tables, so the linen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the equipment rentals wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get ruined. I do not know if this employee was reprimanded or not but as a small restaurant owner I am very embarrassed for the Striphouse. I cannot imagine one of my staff members cursing at the Mother of the Bride at one of our events. That incident is remarkable! Overall, because of and only because of my friends and my vendors my event was a success. However, it still breaks my heart to think about everything my family went through to make this event happen. Why could we not start at 8am like we were supposed to? Why did Heidi stop us? How could the GM Kevin Speidel pull the no tent card 4 \u00c2\u00bd hours before my wedding started? How could no one at The Waldorf Reach Resort know that there was a lunar high tide and try to move us to the beach that would be underwater? How come no one at The Striphouse communicated our event to the GM? Why was The Reach staff so incredibly rude to my guests? How can you not serve a glass of water at a restaurant? Why did the wedding party not get to take a meal home? After the time was taken away from us on such a memorable day, we should have been given meals to take home. We should have been granted more time even without music. The Reach Staff and Striphouse staff should off joined forces and made this event happen gracefully and they should have been overly nice. It was a wedding! I needed to write this letter to have closure, because all of this unfortunate stuff cannot be changed. I cannot go back in time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.this was my wedding day. My friends and family all describe this event as, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intimate affair, full of genuine love and natural beauty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I need to remember that and that June 26th, 2010 was happiest day of my life. However, in reality The Waldorf Reach Resort and The Striphouse caused a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety. The Waldorf and The Striphouse let me down and for the amount of money we paid it is absolutely ridiculous.

We all loved it. It was part of our Florida vacation that included 4 hotels in total (Cocoa Beach, Vero Beach, Miami and Key West), and so far this one was the best. We always look for an average price hotel between $100-$200. We found a special rate for $200 and the 4th night free. This hotel has a concept of a \"Boutique Hotel\", is like a compact resort. There was plenty to do and we loved the small beach. We even did some snorkeling in it before doing our open water snorkel trip. Even though at the entrance you have some rocky areas, it is easy enough to get in and start swimming to enjoy the marine life. Our 8 year old loved it. Staff was friendly and helpful. The room was big, and the style was all about simple lines, Ikea style. On the furniture I did not like the shelving system for the clothes, I rather have drawers, but it was ok. Nice bathroom. Very clean room. Great bed with an awesome duvet. Small little balcony. We booked a Boutique Suite with partial view, which meant that you could see a little of the street (in between tree foliage) and a little of the beach, but we did not care because we don't stay at a hotel to look out in the balcony. We used the balcony basically to dry out swimsuits and diving gear. We had few problems but they compensated in a fair way. Our internet connection never got to work except for few minutes, there was an error on the connection that we believed it has to do something with the firewall. After they tried to fix it and it did not work, they actually offered to move us to another room, but we were all set there and we really did not need to be hook to the internet, it was just a convenience. They removed the $25 hotel fee where the internet connection was included (and we did not ask to be compensated), which was fair to us. Another little problem was that we had a pillow that was ours and one day the pillow disappeared after room service. We told them and after few research, they realized that our pillow went with the rest of hotel laundry to Miami! it was kind of funny though, but we were not really upset about the whole deal, it is an honest mistake and it is just a pillow with a nice pillow case. But they said they were giving us $40 credit to our bill. That was a nice gesture. The last room service lacked a little bit just because they forgot to put 2 more glasses and the coffee cups but they brought it as soon as we requested them. The breakfast buffet was the best buffet so far from all breakfast buffet I tried out there. Pricey though, but good ingredients and selection, it was $17.50 but they include the tip which take it to $22. It has the regular items, eggs, bacon, good sausages, potatoes, biscuits and gravy, and then an array of some fancy cheese, pistachios, cold cuts (ham, turkey ham, cheddar, salami) smoked salmon with toppings (capers, fine chopped onions, red peppers, chives) bread selection, lettuce, tomatoes, a variety of some small and really good danishes, and of course butter, cream cheese, little spread jars (jelly, ketchup, mayo, dijon mustard), 3 different juices, and they will bring you milk and coffee if you wanted it. The pool was heated, I was worried at the beginning because is a small pool and a small amount of lounge chairs and I thought it would be crowded but for my surprise it never was that way even though there was plenty people at the hotel. It was nice that we had access to the Casa Marina, which we might try on another trip. Not sunset, but you can enjoy a beautiful sunrise. Nice covered pier with benches and hammocks. We did not eat at the restaurant so I cannot review anything, just the breakfast buffet but according to them they serve the best steak on the 2X4 island. It was a quiet area, a block away from Duval street, which was nice. We did not want to stay right by the hustle and bustle (and drunken sailors) that comes along with Duval. The concierge was very helpful when we wanted to book a snorkel trip and fishing trip and she did everything for us, we just needed to put a deposit and show up at the marina with our reservation and paid the rest before boarding the boat.

Like the previouse couple of reviewers have mentioned I was also a bit concerned after reading some of the recent negative reviews. We were pleasantly surprised. We booked a partial ocean view boutique suite and when we arrived we could not have been happier. Our room was spacious, clean and gasp...had an ocean view. We would definately book this room again due to the fact that the partial view (to us anyway) turned out to have a great, unobstructed view of the ocean. We spent most of our mornings and nights relaxing on our balcony and taking in the beautiful view. Houskeeping was great and did not disturb us by being loud as other reviewers have mentioned. Here is a tip: If you do not want housekeeping disturbing you at 8 am in the morning, insert the do not disturb card into the key slot of the door, then phone them later to let them know when you would like your room serviced. This worked great for us and our room was always cleaned when we were out for the day. We ordered room service for breakfast one morning and yes, it is pricey but it was good. I wouldn't necessarily order it again but we mainly did it for the experience and because we wanted to eat out on the balcony. The grounds are well maintained and the beach area is not huge but it is nice for what it is. We did not book this hotel because we wanted to lay on the beach- we really just wanted to be on the water so we can see, smell and hear the ocean and once again our needs were met. We booked a jet ski tour with Barefoot Billy's through the concierge. The tour left right from the hotels beach and we had a great time. I was scared to drive at first so my boyfriend ended up doing most of the work. Near the end of the tour I worked up the courage to drive and of course I tipped us over, but the tour guide came to our rescue and we were up and running again in no time. We also rented bikes through the hotel so that we could explore the island. The bikes were in good condition and served their purpose. Renting a bike is a great way to do some exploring. One inconvienience on our last night- the AC went out for the entire hotel. It was out for several hours (in reality it didn't really bother us to much because we decided to do some exploring while this problem was being fixed) I called guest services and inquired if there was any discount we could recieve and our resort fees were waived for our entire stay. The AC was fixed by the time we returned to our room later that afternoon and all was well. Sometimes, all you have to do is ask (firmly, but nicely) and you may be surprised. Your experience is what you make of it and if you have concerns but do not voice them, they will not be addresed. So speak up if there are any problems and they will be taken care of. The resort fee is another thing people have complained of and I'm not sure why. This type of fee is pretty much standard at a hotel that is not a Best Western or a Holiday Inn(and I am not a hotel snob- I've had excellent stays at wallet friendly hotels such as country inn and microtel). You know this going in so it does not pop up like some sort of surprise charge as some would have you think. When you book the hotel you are informed of this fee and the total you are shown before booking includes this fee. You are also informed of the parking fee beforehand. If this is not something you agree with you do not have to book the room. I don't know if you book through another party how it is but if you book directly with the hotel you can be assured that there are no surprises.

If I need it, I won't be shy about asking for it. These were very small bags that my wife and I could easily carry ourselves -- and prefer to carry ourselves. I understand they work for tips, but good grief. Let ME decide whether I need your assistance. I travel a lot, and it's one of the biggest pet peeves I have about the hospitality industry. Stop it. Good service starts with a simple question: \"How may I help you?\" Get inside to the reception desk and quickly learn that I did not get the complimentary upgrade to a junior suite that almost automatically comes with being a diamond-level Hilton Honors member. No worries, I thought. The hotel must be surprisingly sold out -- surprising because hotels in Key West struggle during the summer. It's the low season. Too hot. We get to our room, it's 76 degrees. No problem. I'll crank the AC down for a few hours and cool the place off. The wife goes for a swim and some sun for a few hours. I run out for some sandwiches for us both. We run out for a bite to eat. We come back to the room -- after the AC's been running SEVEN HOURS -- and the thermostat reads 75 degrees. Uncomfortable. I go downstairs to complain -- and to ask about whether they're able to switch us to another room. No way we can sleep with temps in the mid-70s. We're told they are not sold out. I then remind the receptionist that I was on the standby list for an upgrade and if any of the junior suites were available. Sure enough, there was one available. At the very back of the property. No view to speak of, but at least the AC worked. I will give the staff points for correcting this situation for us so quickly and without pushback, but that's the service I expect from the start as a loyal Hilton Honors member -- not seven hours later. My other complaints involve the almost-desperate attitude of the pool boys. One guy almost bragged about what good service he offers by offering to get my wife a towel. Really? Are they paying these young men so little that they all but beg for a tip -- FOR DOING THEIR JOB?! Further, every guest is charged $25 extra each day for a \"resort fee,\" for use of the pool and those towels and those lawn chairs and the big chess board and wireless interent and all the other amenities -- most of which are never used by individual guests. Here are my other issues with the property: The furniture is not as nice as it should for a Waldorf property. Laminate furniture?? That's Hampton Inn, not Waldorf. The stairwells near our room at the back of the property couldn't be more rundown (spilled paint, discarded furniture strewn about off to the side, dirty). This is supposed to be paradise. Not a public-housing project. If you go to the pool here -- which is way too small for the size of the property -- you might not find an open lounger, even though many of them will be unoccupied. Apparently, management allows the pool boys to \"take care\" of customers by reserving chairs. Nothing could be more infuriating to a guest who's paid $25 to use the pool, only to learn that someone who handed a tip to the pool boy got \"reserved\" towels placed over the chairs they want, while they go explore Key West for hours. Absolutely unacceptable. I could go on, but why. I didn't like the property, nor the fact that I squandered 100,000 hard-earned Hilton Honors points for the privilege. Despite my frustrations, I am happy to report my wife found a way to enjoy herself .. and nothing really matters more than that to me. We're looking forward to going back to Key West -- somewhere else.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cA bit disappointed, but would stay at The Reach again.\u201d", "Author": "kristylwood", "ReviewID": "UR68787662", "Content": "Overall we were pleased with the resort. The beach and location were great and the resort was quiet. It was a hot walk up Duval Street and to Mallory Square, but I prefer to stay on the quieter end of town so it was a good trade off. Ultimately, I would stay at the resort again mainly because of the location and the beach, but I do have several complaints. The first night we noticed a light fixture dangling over the bathtub. I tried 4 times to contact the front desk to get someone to repair the light and the front desk never picked up. I finally had to go down to the front desk and speak face to face with someone. Later that night we realized there were no linens and pillows for the sofa bed. Once again I tried to contact the front desk 4 times with no success. I had to change from my pajamas back into my clothes and go back downstairs to the front desk to speak with someone. Housekeeping was knocking on the door within 5 minutes, but it was annoying to have to go to the front desk twice in one day. The next day we had a voicemail on our phone. When I checked the message I found that it was from a prospective guest inquiring about having his wedding at the resort. Someone had put him through to guestroom voicemail rather than the front desk voicemail. Additionally, housekeeping came by twice a day even if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have your \u00e2\u20ac\u0153service please\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign out. They would knock repeatedly in the mornings and if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer they would just come in. Another crew would come by at night. They did a good job and I guess this is a minor complaint, but having to answer the door or having someone walk into your room can be annoying when you are trying to relax. My final complaint is with the misrepresentation of the guestrooms on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. We booked the ocean view one bedroom suite which is the most expensive room. After looking at the photographs I thought we were getting an airy room with a balcony running across the living area and bedroom. The photo shows a living room with a sofa and balcony. The room we were given had a sectional sofa with a small window in the living area. The balcony was off the bedroom only. The living area seemed very dark, small and closed off. It looked nothing like any of the photos and its hard for me to believe this was the most expensive room in the resort. Not to mention that the only way we had an oceanview was by standing at just the right position to see a tiny bit of ocean through the palm trees. I thought the palm trees could be trimmed or removed altogether to give guests a better view and more enjoyment of the balcony. I questioned the front desk and was told we were in the correct room, but I could look at another room in 2 days to see if we wanted to move. We decided it wasn't worth it. I felt very disappointed and let down upon check in, but we decided not to let it ruin our trip. That said, the room was nice and we slept soundly every night, but I feel we were either given the wrong room or the website's photographs are misleading.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cI would highly recommend the Reach Resort\u201d", "Author": "Brigid90", "ReviewID": "UR68700936", "Content": "My husband and I had a great experience staying at the Reach Resort.

Personally, I liked the fact that the hotel is located 1 mile from Mallory Square and a block from Duval Street. Some complained that it's far; it's not a long walk at all as you stroll pass the shops, restraurants and just sightsee with a delicious drink in your hand.

The beach staff is great, and a tip here and there goes a long way. CONS: -Onsite restaurant expensive and not worth it, as there are great places to eat on the island. -Front desk personnel not very knowledgeable and incompetent as they missed a requested wakeup call and put us in the wrong room.

Had a difficult time attracting attention of wait staff to order drinks at the pool. The staff is \"friendly\" but need to be tuned up on anticipating and meeting guest needs. At least, I'd expect that at a Waldorf Astoria. I booked online at the property website, and was offered an ungrade option based on availability, to be determined at time of check-in. Although I had committed to the upgrade if available, I found it odd that the clerk didn't mention that when we checked in.

For those of you who prefers to walk to shops and restaurants and don't minda bit of noise, I suggest Crown Plaza, it's right on Duval. We booked a 1 bedroom luxury suite ocean view that was originally on the 4th floor (hotel has only 4th floor) but in February it was so cold that with the A/C not willing to go on higher level (kept at 60F) we had to change room to 2nd floor (same line : we were at 430 and got 230). It was actually a better view (4th floor unless you are facing the Chess game panel, you only get to see top of the tropical trees...) on the 2nd floor you see the beach, the pool and the ocean, funny isn't it ?!). We had a good King bed, and our baby a crib (playpen type). Just be aware that like most hotel in the Keys, they don't have heaters. The room itself was average, needed new furniture (coach and carpet were old and stained), bathroom was large and well appointed (one shower and one bath tub, 2 sinks), however I would not recommend the 1 bedroom suite to new couple since there is no doors to the bathroom (toilet is there too), so you really need to be comfortable about that. Flatscreen TV and Ipod dock were a nice touch! The living room area had a kitchenette with Nespresso coffee maker (we loved it!) and a fridge. Having a baby with us we would have loved to see a microwave in there but there was none. Internet access is not free, but if you have an Iphone and stayed on line \"29 & 30\" (230,330,440 etc.) you can catch the free Wifi (for Att&T customer) of Starbucks , then plug your Iphone to your computer and share the connexion (it will go faster than 3G sharing). Staff was above courteous, they were so nice they gave a balloon to our little boy. Room was always cleaned up during our stay, and lunch at the pool staff very polite (they also will help you with your baby food if needed microwave). By the way We recommend the restaurant by the pool the view is fantastic and menu not expensive, fish fresh. Parking is not free, even if you park yourself ($15 dol/night), they make you pay a resort fee of ($22/day) unlucky us we could not even get to the beach or the pool it was so cold outside...All add up to one night worth of a hotel room, so be advised.

The wait staff around the pool would dissappear for long periods of time and then complain about how hard they were working. Having been in the service industries ourselves (bartender & waitress), my husband and I are usually very understanding BUT there was no excuse for the horrible service we received. Our meals and drinks in the restaurant and at the pool (even for just the two of us) were automatically charged an 18% gratuity fee, even for the breakfast buffet! My husband consistently tips over 20% but had the gratuity fee been up to us, I would've argued with him if he had tipped higher than 10%. The group with us all felt the same way. On Friday night after dinner we stopped by the bar for a drink, it was closed. They had kicked others in our group out at 10 p.m. as it was \"closing time\", can you believe a bar in a resort on Key West closing at 10p.m. when people are in the bar? The next day we complained and on Saturday night the bartender was overheard complaining to a friend that he had to stay since he had customers. I can't believe a resort would allow this to happen. I've been in Holiday Inns that stay open when they have customers. The front desk also had its issues. We had no air conditioning when we arrived which we told the desk before we left for dinner. We came back over 2 hours later and still no air conditioner, no message, nothing. We called the desk who had no clue what was going on and contacted the engineer.

The price for the hotel was very reasonable considering that the weather was extremely hot and summer vacation was over for local kids at that point, so many locals had just left the previous week.

The sink/mirror area was separate and I appreciated this while trying to get ready in the morning with my husband. This would be great for a family with young kids as there was also a large living room/eating area with a pull-out couch. The suite had a fridge with a small freezer, sink and counter area. I would have appreciated a microwave and coffee maker given that there was abundant counter space for both. There was a seating area for four and two large LCD televisions, one in the living area and one in the bedroom. The bedroom was around a corner but not closed off by a door. The beds in both rooms were king size and very comfortable. The air conditioning was perfect and there were also ceiling fans above the beds. The pool staff, especially Ricardo, were very helpful and engaging with their personalities. Getting food/drink service by the pool was impossible even during slow times from the restaurant, however. The restaurant was overpriced and the staff were not terribly friendly. There was a topless-permitted beach area to the right of the gazebo area according to the staff. I did not take advantage of this as this area was in perfect view of the bar/restaurant staff and some people at the resort had families with small children. This area has one of the only private sand beaches in Key West. That was a major draw for us. Swimming in the ocean from the resort was fantastic. There is a watersports business on site that rents jetskis for use around the resort area or tours in a group if you want to go around Key West in its entirety. The drinks were incredibly expensive at the restaurant/bar and we chose to walk two blocks to a bar that was also a liquor store and stock up there instead. I was not impressed with housekeeping as room service trays were left in the hallways for up to three days at a stretch. In this heat, that is really gross. We had a very brief walk to my husband's birthday dinner at Louie's Backyard. We had breakfast each day on Duval Street at a variety of intimate coffee houses and casual breakfast joints. The walk to the other end of Duval was long given the heat and we ended up using a taxi due to this. I would recommend this hotel for the location if you are looking for quiet with relative proximity to the action (maximum 20 minute walk) or if a sand beach is an important aspect of your trip. The hotel is also close to the off leash dog beach next to Louie's Backyard. We did not bring a pet but it is our understanding that dogs of a certain size are allowed for a fee. We bid $140/night plus taxes and fees on Priceline. The hotel adds a $22/day resort fee (they even tax this fee). The resort is adjacent to a sister property-the Casa Marina-and the resort fee includes use of the activities and amenities at this property, and you can charge meals and drinks there to your room. There is a daily list of activities and events, and most of these took place at the Casa Marina. Most resort amenities are ones that a tip is expected for providing, so I would not say this is a good value. If you can get the right price, it is worth staying here.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "southern Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!

On arrival the room didn't have a clock or the promised i-Pod docking station. The beach area was \"ok\" at best and the grounds looked nice. The location was ok as well.

Either that, or they have relatives on the staff. This hotel will not survive in this competitve market. We can only hope that the next owners will transform this to a nice place.

In fact, Carlos and housekeeping really tried to win us over. More so than the Casa which had no options and didn't seem too interested in making us happy.

The location was quiet but close enough to the Duval Street nightlife so that our kids and their friends could walk there at night. Lots of activities in Key West -- golf for my husband and son, I rented a bicycle and had fun exploring the island, my daughter and her friends went to the spa, did jetskis and parasailing, and I also went on a kayaking trip. And of course we all spent time enjoying the sun at the pool and/or the beach. Specific to The Reach ... Good points were: * Rooms were comfortable and well serviced. All have a small balcony. Beds comfortable. * Pool and beach area are nice albeit not large -- pool service attendents were cheerful and helpful. * Full access to the larger beach and pools at Casa Marina if you want -- and it's a less than 5 minute walk. * Concierge helpful with restaurant recommendations and reservations. All in all service was friendly and helpful. * Not alot of young kids -- which at our stage of life we really appreciate. We enjoyed the diversity of the guests -- quite a few Europeans and family groups with older kids. Some less favorable feedback: * The layout of the one bedroom suite was awkward in that the bathroom was open to the bedroom - no door. Even us old married types prefer more privacy. This would be worth fixing in a future renovation. * Restaurant service for breakfast and lunch was limited. Breakfast was an OK buffet. Lunch service limited. Lunch at Casa Marina was better. * And as always at this sort of resort -- prices for drinks and food at the pools and beach was very high. But that's to be expected.

On the whole it was a nice building and location, but the experience was let down by a few things. The hotel is well placed, modern, clean and on the whole beautifully equipped. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the southern end of Simonton street, about 100 metres from the southernmost USA marker. It is a fair distance from all the activity at the other end of Duval St, but that's arguably a good thing... It's a quiet location. Most noise seemed to come from the large air con on the roof. The rooms are pretty and our one (443) had a balcony overlooking the pool and the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small private beach and jetty. The aircon was effective and the bed very comfortable indeed. The room safe was in a second wardrobe, somewhat unusually placed beside the toilet. Our room had no coffee or tea maker or bathrobes, even though the room description said there was both. We rang reception and they delivered a coffee maker. But we never saw bathrobes. The bathroom had some issues. The handbasin when we arrived had a very obvious dripping leaning wobbling broken tap/faucet. We were amazed that something like this was not spotted by housekeeping during their between-guest cleanings. We reported it to reception and it was fixed promptly. The shower was form over function - it looked state of the art but water leaked all over the floor. We learned to set up towels to catch the leakage. Exterior signage was a mess. If we followed the signs from our room to reception then it seemed to take us on a 100 metre wild goose chase around the level. There was a lift 10 metres away; an arrow pointing at that would have been simpler. There were some issues with the staff. Reception were friendly and tried to be helpful but were mostly useless. They do need to work on their local knowledge. For example, I asked one guy at reception where was the nearest convenience store, as I wanted to buy some razors and things. The guy said that I should go to a place called (I kid you not) Denny's! He said it was more of a restaurant than anything else... I ignored that advice and went looking by myself and found a convenience store about 50 metres away, on the same street as the hotel. Later on we asked the concierge (a different guy) to recommend some restaurants; he gave us a list of two, and told us to give the restaurant a card with his name on it (presumably so he could get a kickback). He also had no idea how long it was take to walk to Mallory Square, saying that it would probably take 45 minutes to cycle. They weren't all bad; we did find one efficient woman working at reception, and their presentation (clothing) was impeccable. The Pool/beach staff deserve a special mention. I got the impression that they worked very long hours and weren't hugely motivated. Service was only sunrise-sunset and somewhat unenthused. They would snatch the deck chairs and towels away on the stroke of 18:00, even if the sun was shining and people were still there. If you went down at eg 18:15 then odds were that there would be neither chairs nor staff. One particular staff member used to prowl around the pool area doing this weird grumpy vaguely threatening passive-aggressive banter with the guests but not actually helping them i.e. forgetting to deliver promised towels. My girlfriend found his attitude invasive and unwelcome in a supposedly calm, relaxing environment. We sat down by the beach once and were forced to see quite an unpleasant shouting match between some of the jet-ski staff. I'm not sure if they are affiliated with the Reach resort, but they share the same private beach as the hotel and it doesn't make a good impression. In any case, it doesn't sound a nice place to work. There was a daily \"resort fee\" to cover tips etc, but the bills still came with a section for adding tips. We were vehemently against this resort fee and suggest the Reach Resort find better ways to top up their coffers. We didn't try the restaurant. If you are staying there for any length of time then I'd recommend getting bicycles for travelling around, as it is a good walk to any of the sights. Would we go there again? Yes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel itself, although expensive and needs polishing in some areas, is still a calm haven away from it all, but would resist paying the resort fee!!!", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft Lauderdale", "Title": "\u201cNice Place\u201d", "Author": "SMN-FLL", "ReviewID": "UR43735006", "Content": "This was a beautiful hotel right on a beach.

I could not decide between the Reach and the Casa Marina. I am glad we did both, but on a return trip, I would stay at the Reach the entire trip. The rooms were the same price, but at the Reach, we had an Ocean View Suite with a corner balcony and at the Casa marina, we had a partial ocean view small room. The grounds at the Casa marina are FAR superior to the Reaches grounds; however if you stay at the Reach you are welcome to use the facilities at the Casa Marina. The Reach has one pool and a small, but very clean beach. The Casa Marina has two pools and a very large rocky beach. There Casa Marin beach is lined with palm trees and Hammocks while the Reach beach is open. We attempted to snorkel under the pier at the Casa Marina, but the visibility was very poor. We ate Breakfast every morning at the Casa Marina as you can order ala carte at the Marina. Average breakfast is $10 per person + coffee or tea or $16.00 for the buffet. We played Bocce Ball at both locations. The Reach has a real court and it was actually the first time we ever played on a court and not just in the sand or grass. My only complaint is there was No coffee maker at either Hotel. The beds were comfortable at both locations and both places were quiet at night. There is much more activity at the Casa Marian then the Reach. They are both within easy walking distance of Duvall Street; however the Reach is a little closer, as we had a car it really did not matter to us. We paid $12 a night to Self Park at the Reach and at the Casa Marina we parked free on the street. This was easier then in the lot, at least this was true for us as we had a room at the end of the hall and there was an easy elevator to the pool area and the back entrance. Our first evening in Key West we ate dinner at Sloppy Joes. This was the worst meal, I had on the trip. I had Conch Fritters which tasted more like bread then Conch.

We chose this property due to the pool/beachfront and the summer escape package they were offering. We were told it was one of the nicest hotels on the island. I simply expected more from the Waldorf name and from the fact I was paying a resort charge. The front desk had minimal information upon check in - just gave key and room number. There are very few extra ammenities at the hotel, so I guess there's not much to say at check in. While it was mentioned in our room description, we didn't have a coffee maker or a wet bar in our room. The refrigerator was very useful to keep water cold. And you will need water as the temps. are hot in Key West. You have to pay for internet access from your room and to park in the garage. We saw room service trays being delivered, but never received information on how to order room service. There was no property information in the room. Just a little description on the card that your room key was housed in. I'm sure we just needed to call the front desk to find out the answer to any question we had, but it was odd to receive no information and have no information available in your room. I was there at the same time as the previous reviewer and agree that when it rains/pours the resort floods - as does most of Key West. You don't expect a pond of water when you exit the elevator into the lobby area. But you're already wet from your walk to the elevator. The loud music into the night was due to a wedding reception being held on the beach. I was thankful my room was on the other side of the hotel. The food is overpriced and the automatic gratuity added to your bill means they don't have to serve you quickly or attentively. But there are nice options down Simonston Street that are easily accessible. I also agree with another reviewer about the dirty a/c filters. Disgusting. Overall I'd expect a Waldorf Astoria property to have better upkeep - not to have mold on the shower curtain and something that looked like ketchup on the window curtain. The pool and beach area are nice, but anyone can access them. And they become crowded. Peaceful swims can be had early in the morning or late at night. You can't beat the full moon view through the palm trees on the beach. The location on the quiter side of the island is great, but be prepared to walk or rent some kind of transportation, it is a hike to the attractions.

The nearest \"coffee shop\" (where you can get a cup of coffee with pre-packaged creamers and day-old pastries from Publix) was located on the next block! The Reach should consider SOME kind of \"continental\" breakfast or coffee for a minimal fee -- the only breakfast choice is the $18 per person buffet. My husband ventured to the dining room to bring coffee and a pastry to the room for a quick, light bite...he ended up bringing back two small coffees and a small croissant and was $18 poorer! Shame on you, Reach!

The room we stayed in was very small and I was suprised not to see a coffee maker, hand lotion, and no second mirror in the room, these are all things that even the cheapest economy hotels offer. On the website it talks about wireless internet but makes no mention that it's 11.95 per day (per device!). The way it's worded on the web site it seems like it's included in the price, I had work to do and papers to complete for school so I had to suck it up and pay what I though was an insane price for a wireless connection, imagine the profit margin on that one! Also, every time we flushed the toilet it would take at least twice to clear the bowl (even without toilet paper) and the handle had to be held for this to happen, very annoying at an upscale resort. In the shower, the knob would fall off very easily, also very annoying. I've read other reviews on here talking about how rude and unfriendly the wait staff were around the pool and beach, I can personally vouch for that one! My suggestion is to take out the included gratuity from the checks and make them EARN their tips, maybe then they would have a reason to be pleasant with guests. On a bright note, DJ and Ricardo were great and were always ready to go out of their way to make us feel like guests, they need to train the rest of the staff, or maybe promote them to GM and assistant GM and turn the property around from a guest services standpoint. We also ran into the problem with the resort activities sheet, many of the activities were down the beach at the Casa Marina, but my real gripe is that there was an \"*\" by anything that charged an additional fee and things without the \"*\" we assumed to be free.....not the case. When I asked the front desk about this she said most of the activities were additional and not to pay attention to the \"*\" and they had had other people complain about the same thing, from then on we just avoided all of the hotel activities. To the credit of the resort, upon checkout I addressed all of these problems and the front desk person after consulting with the manager refunded our entire stays worth of resort fees, would have been nice if they came out and did it in person but I was happy with the money back.

We knew we wanted a destination wedding and when we narrowed it to down to Key West, we checked out all of the hotels and resorts to decide where to have it. We obviously chose the Reach, but I'd like to give the reasons why: First, the location is perfect. Whether you are planning a wedding or looking for a romantic getaway, or taking the family for a vacation, the Reach is situated perfect on Key West. It right next to the southern most point, and has a breathtaking view of the Gulf meeting the Atlantic. Looking out past the pool and the private beach, the water is the purest blue. For our wedding, the Reach's gazebo, located at the end of a pier, was an ideal locale that made our ceremony that much special. Also, situated at the end of Simonton Street and Duval, you are not on the \"seedy\" side of Duval, but not that far of a walk if you are looking to have fun. Second, the staff is unbelievable. Luke Vossen, our wedding coordinator, was unbelievable. Living in Tampa, FL we were understandably nervous not being able to oversee all the details that Luke handled until the actual day. Yet, everything went without a hitch. He accomodated all of our requests, directed all of our vendors, and made incredible recommendations that gave the experience just the right touch. When considering a wedding in KW, the coordinator is vital as he is your extention and your proxy to insure that everything goes right. Luke, and his staff, went above and beyond the call of duty in making sure our wedding was special. I cannot reccomend him enough. Third, the food at the Reach was unbelievably amazing. I can say this with complete objectivity--even though it was my wedding!--that the food Luke and his staff at the Striphouse served was the best food I ate a wedding ever. Like most resorts, the Reach has a restuarant on site, but unlike most resorts the Reach actually uses the restaurant to prepare the wedding dinner. Check it out. Most resorts rely on the cheap catering standby of preparing your dinners way in advance, hence the dried out taste you experience at most wedding dinners. At the Reach, all of our guest meals (filet or grouper) was made to order, just like a restaurant. This insured that the food was served at its freshest. We are almost 3 months past our wedding and I am still getting compliments from our guests about the food! Finally, even with an upgrade to a bridal suite, the rooms at the Reach were top notch. Clean with modern furniture, the rooms were a pure comfort, a perfect retreat during our honeymoon. (Yes, we remained in KW after the wedding.) Like I said, I cannot recommend the Reach and Luke Vossen and his staff enough. If you have any detailed questions about having a wedding at the reach, feel free to email me: [--].

The air did go out for a night (a truck in the parking garage took out a cooling line) but they refunded us for 1/2 a night and all 3 nights of the $20 per day resort fee.

Anthony our waiter was so wonderful. Even though they were so close to closing time he did not rush us and was very personable. My Steak Frites was the best steak I had all week. There was so many other places to dine that we did not make it back to the Strip House for another dinner, but I will say it was one of the best meals I had all eight days I was in Key West. Before returning to our room my husband stopped by the reception desk to see if we maybe could get an upgrade from the room we were in. I want to state that the original room was beautiful, you could see the water, it was just above the new chess board they installed on the lawn and the pool was just ahead of us towards the beach, the only issue i had with the location was the large air conditioner across from us that was very loud and didn't seem to shut down at all. Anyway, they said maybe the next day another room might be available. So on Wednesday we got up and went to breakfast then to the private beach at the resort. As in other reviews, I agree that DJ, Taylor, and DA (waiter at beach) are so accomadating. They work from dawn to dusk it seems and always with a big smile and making sure you have everything you need for the day. We spent every day relaxing for quite a few hours under our umbrella just enjoying the water and ocean breeze. When we got back to our room on Wednesday there was a message from AJ at the front desk that another room was available if we would like it. My husband went to check it out and came back to get me--we were offered room 543 which is right on the end overlooking the beach and pier--of course we took it! This room was perfect! You could hear the waves and the breeze was wonderful! Also the Reach Resort has a lot of weddings. We saw three while we stayed there. First wedding was very large ($$$$), second wedding was the opposite just the couple and about a dozen guests on the pier and the third was in between the others and a nasty rain storm blew in just after the ceremony so they had to run for cover--they say rain is good luck on your wedding day! Restaurants I would recommend: Louie's Backyard (on the water next to hotel), Abondanza! (best scampi I ever had!), Antonia's, La Te Da, Camille's, and Strip House. Tried to get to Seven Fish (too busy first night and closed Tuesday) will have to go next time. Also El Ciboney is a favorite, but didn't get there this time.

The room was very nice, clean and spacious. The balcony was an added bonus since I was with 2 smokers!! We quickly changed and went down to the pool area to have some drinks and lay in the sun. Well...........the pool was pretty busy, as we expected. We asked for assistance in getting some chairs and towels and he told us \"look around and see if you can find some chairs and if you do, I'll get you some towels\". Once we found the chairs the pool attendant mentioned that he only works on tips and that we aren't charged for the chairs and towels. He must not have known that we are charged a daily \"resort\" fee for the use of these amenities. To add further insult to injury, there was ONE person handling bar service to the pool AND beach area!! And, he only served ONE guest at a time. Needless to say, we never got a drink for the 2 hours we sat there (without going to the bar). My last complaint.........the conceirge..........she was not professionally dressed as you would expect to see at a \"high end\" resort. The dinner recommendations were awful - I think I knew more about Key West than she did! As we checked out, there was yet another unhappy guest arguing with the desk attendant....not a good sign to see this happen twice! With all of this being said, the hotel was nice and it's in a GREAT location if you want to be right on the beach. Just don't expect 4 -5 star hotel quality or service.

During the week, the lobby did not appear to be as fully staffed as on the weekend of our arrival. Our luggage was efficiently delivered to our room, and Stacy gave us many tips about activities in and around the hotel. Our room was clean with a very comfortable mattress, and we were fortunate to have an unobstructed ocean view. (We had overheard some hotel guests complaining about not having that, despite reserving ocean view). We greatly enjoyed the expresso machine in the mornings, and liked sipping the coffee out on the balcony. As Key West visitors should know, there are ocean waves only if the winds are strong...but we'd have been unlikely to be able to hear waves anyhow due to the loud air-conditioning unit across from our room. However, the warm breeze ruffling the palm trees seemed to counteract the noise. Taking advantage of the reciprocal arrangement with Casa Marina, we visited that hotel several times, and decided right away that it's our destination for our next Key West vacation. It has a \"classier\" feel in the lobby, and the grounds are more stately. There is also a lot more room on the beach, pier and pool area, plus the bar is more accessible than the one at the Reach. There is also a greater variety of water sports at the Casa. Whether staying at the Reach or Casa Marina, it's advisable to heed everyone's advice about wearing comfortable footwear. It's over a mile walk-(very enjoyable)-to Mallory Square via Duval Street, and blisters could ruin a vacation. There is a trolley stop near the Reach, plus there are many \"pedi-bikes\" (bicycle taxis) all over, especially on Duval. On the walk to Duval, be sure to stop at Ana's Cuban Cafe for cafe con leche, or a mango or watermelon smoothie. Sandwiches (such as \"ropa vieja\") are also delicious, and much more reasonably priced than at most restaurants...plus the outside seating area is great for people-watching! Also, from the pier at the Reach, dog-lovers can watch the canine regulars frolicking on the \"Dog Beach\", which is adjacent to the deck at Louie's Backyard, a great place for an evening drink. To sum up, our get-away at the Reach was enjoyable. It's much nicer than many other Key West hotels, and the sandy beach is a nice feature...(except for the seaweed problem that the staff reported as ongoing this season). Those who plan to stay at the Reach should compare similarly-priced hotels before making reservations.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burnham, Bucks", "Title": "\u201cWonderful romantic stay\u201d", "Author": "SatinderG", "ReviewID": "UR28968161", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights, for a romantic Easter getaway, and it lived up to all our expectations.

We have been to Key West roughly 7 times now and stayed all over the island. Used to stay right by Mallory Square but have gotten beyond wanting to be by the noise and crowds all the time. The Reach is close enough, that if you can walk a mile.....you can get to the crowds and noise anytime you want. Also, you can see lots of things along the way and make a \"find\" or two as you go. The Reach is located right down Simonton so you can go straight down that street or head over a block to Duval and head straight down. Check in went very smooth. We had booked an Island View Boutique suite, however, they moved us to an oceanview instead which was very nice. The boutique suites are great with a refrig and bar area, plus a balcony. Pretty good storage and bathroom size for two people, no problem. We had a car so headed to Publix for booze, beer, juices and breakfast foods, bread, cheeses to stock our refrig. It saves us money but also we don't always like to wander looking for breakfast and lunch options if we are sitting at the beach or pool. We are glad we did this too.....more on that later. Beach and pool are nice considering this is Key West and is not known for their great beaches. Walk over to sister property, Casa Marina is really easy if you go out to the pool and talk the picket fence gate right there. Takes a couple minutes. They have two pools and beaches and allow you to charge to your room there also. Very nice options. The Strip Restaurant at the Reach is pretty expensive from our perspective. There really isn't a \"big\" restaurant at the Casa Marina other than a breakfast area and pool cafe. We just had a couple glasses of wine at the Strip House for $16.00 each and it was barely drinkable. But, there are so many other options nearby that it doesn't matter at all. Next to The Reach is a nice restaurant/outdoor bar called Louie's Cafe which was great for drinks. We met several people there and enjoyed watching the water and talking with some of the locals. Other places we hit were LaTeDa, a bar on Duval which was not too far away. Restaurant looks great and bar is very nice for hanging out and meeting people also. Nearby is Nine One Five (Duval) and serves small plates. Camille's is another option not very far away on Simonton that has nice food options. We found it very easy to walk down to the other end of Key West. Taste of Key West was going on and we went to that and had a great time. They had loads of options for tasting food and wines/beers. Always is towards the end of April. Overall, if you don't want the busy cruise ship/noise of tourists around the Mallory Square area and can walk ok....stay at The Reach or Casa Marina for a very nice experience. There were only two complaints we had, one was that we had room service delivered one time and it stayed outside our room for two full days before they came and picked it up. Also, we found the $20.00 resort fee really pretty silly. You really don't get anything for it....free local calls (most everyone has a cell phone), popsicles are the pool, and a daily newspaper. Just add the $20.00 to the room rate and don't make people feel they are being charged extra for something they may not even want or use. Anyway, that being said, the value was still good and the resort service and amenities were great.

I might add too that it wasn't busy - there was 1 other car/couple at reception and it was 3:00pm. When a bellman finally arrived, my husband handed him the keys to park the car in the garage and he told him to go park it himself. When I checked in, I was \"greeted\" with all of the reasons why my room wasn't ready rather than a friendly, \"hello, welcome to our resort. how are you today?\" Honestly, I really didn't care that the room wasn't ready, just offer to store my bags and show me a place to relax and have a drink! Unfortunately, that didn't happen. While the concierge and 3 front desk associates acted \"busy\", we waited another 15 minutes for a bellman to show up and store our bags so we could \"go walk around\" as we were instructed. The room was \"ok\". The shower door was broken so water got all over the bathroom; however, there was a note left in the room telling us it was broken. The pillow on the chair had a huge tear in it exposing the stuffing. On a positive note, I did request a late check-out and my request was granted. I think the concierge summed it up perfectly....as I was waiting in the lobby for my husband to bring the car around so we could leave (once again, we were not offered assistance), I overheard a guest ask the concierge how to get to a particular restaurant. The concierge pointed her in the direction; however, the woman didn't seem to completely understand how to get through the gate. I am being completely serious, the concierge came out from behind her desk and started walking briskly out of the lobby and said to the woman, \"I am on a short fuse today so I'll have to just show you myself\"!!!

So why not go for the Waldorf-Astoria just a block from Duval Street and right at the south beach? First impressions are everything, and we had a meaningful hint at the level of management of The Reach when we approached the front desk. One of the staff had locked herself out of her computer terminal (one of two available at the check-in desk,) so we had an interminable wait behind a couple of other parties despite the off-rush time we arrived. We overheard enough to learn that there was apparently nobody on site capable of hacking into that formidable PC, so we...waited while people were funneled through the last functioning check-in station. The physical hotel itself was no disappointment. It's right at the end of a recent renovation and the place looks brand-new; there were none of the serious vermin problems that plague other facilities reviewed here, except for some tiny winged termite-like things crawling here and there in the room ('didn't get any bites though, so no real foul.) The first problem is that renovation itself - it's...not quite finished, and the management and staff don't seem to take seriously the idea that rooms should be fully equipped before they're booked to paying customers. Shower curtains are rather important, f'rinstance. Otherwise water tends to just fly all over the place, strange as that may sound. When we mentioned that the otherwise elegantly-appointed bathroom had only the metal hardware for a shower curtain rod (still crossed over with blue masking tape,) but no rod and no curtain, the front desk staff immediately did that thing where people talk and nothing is said. It's that familiar certainty you get from just the first couple words and before the sentence is even completed that you are dealing with disinterested staff who haven't the slightest interest in solving anything in particular, who wouldn't know where to begin solving it if they did, and have no interest in ever finding out. We walked back to the room resigned to a weekend of towels as flood-mitigation - we would \"deal with it.\" A couple hours later my partner asked a room attendant she'd bumped into in the hallway if he could get us a shower curtain; he retrieved one from a storage closet and had it installed within a half-hour. It was a simple spring-tension rod and curtain but it did the job. Kudos for the room staff (we tipped the guy a twenty,) but a big zero for the front desk bozos and another zero for simple staff communication. If a room attendant can readily locate a simple shower curtain on request, why are the front desk staff utterly oblivious to that information? Later I noticed that dreaded combination: the absence of a toilet plunger, and one of those environmentalist \"water saver\" toilets that you either have to flush eight times in carefully-planned steps during use, or it plugs. [Clearly the Japanese company Toto is the only bathroom fixture manufacturer left on Earth with a functional understanding of basic hydrodynamics.] Despite our most meticulous planning, plug it up we did. We searched the room for a plunger, but that's apparently as exotic an item as a shower curtain, so we...called the front desk. Ohhboy. Once again there was that unmistakable sound of evasion, then the incredible news that (get this:) there was nobody available with the expertise necessary to locate and deliver a toilet plunger, but that a \"technician\" would be called from \"another property.\" Allow me to recap: The front desk staff at a Waldorf-Astoria resort are incapable of producing a toilet plunger for a guest with an insistent GI tract and a plugged environmentally-trendly toilet, without calling a \"technician\" from a resort somewhere across town to do it for them. We waited, and waited, and waited, until I called again and asked if it might be better if I walked to a nearby grocery store, just bought my own and donated it to the cause. More hemming, hawing and practiced evasion in reply, so I hung up and used the public restrooms at the other end of the wing that I'd located a few hours earlier. Shortly after I'd got back a \"technnician\" arrived with the exotic, sought-after high-tech hydraulic impeller mechanism and performed the function that's now beyond the capability of our politically-hamstrung restroom fixtures. We, like others here have related, were also kicked in the crotch on checkout by the $20-per-night \"Resort Fee\" and the $12-per-night parking fee for the rental car. So another unadvertised $80 was tacked onto our expenses. Look, if you're running a hotel and you have some expenses that need to be covered, just include them in the room rate up front, rather than sneaking them in as a parting shot. It's incredibly sleazy to borderline unethical, and it's not a great way to instill in your customers a burning desire to return. In a PR sense it's flat-out stupid. On the plus side, the rooms are small but comfortable - though they lack a simple table & chair set. The bedding is luxurious and clean, the fridge is big enough to keep several days of consumables in, and doesn't charge you for anything unless you open the Evian bottles. The fitness room is surprisingly well stocked with good, solid weightlifting equipment including free weights and basic benches, some treadmills, ellipticals and bicycle machines, and a heavy-duty multi-exercise machine. The pool area is clean and nice, though we didn't have time to use it. We can cut The Reach some slack for getting sloppy with their post-renovation loose ends, but this high-quality property is currently managed and staffed by the equivalent of high school or college kids. We'd stay here again, but only after hearing of vast improvements.

It is a bit of a stretch to call this hotel a \"resort\". If you want true resort--then Casa Marina is probably more to be recommended.

We quite appreciated the opportunity to hang by the much larger pool and beach areas at Casa Marina and then retreat back down the street (about a two-block walk) to the quiet of the Reach. The one amenity that the Reach has definitely better than Casa Marina is the beach access for swimming. If you have any desire to go into the ocean, Casa Marina's beach is held together with poured concrete chunks and has large rocks. Reach is sandy and easy access. However, Casa's beach is preferable if all you want to do is lie under a palm tree (or have a massage there). In our experience, service was equivalent at both resorts as far as towel/chairs and pool bar/restaurant. The internet service at the reach was HORRIBLE and the idea that they charge a daily $20 \"resort fee\" is completely laughable. They should get rid of this nonsense immediately and save themselves considerable bad press. The self-parking fee was in my opinion reasonable for the area. The location of the Reach cannot be improved upon. Quiet and away from the craziness of Key West, but an easy walk to the craziness if you want it. I felt comfortable walking home at night from Duval street, despite a number of drunk people around. Remiinded me of New Orleans. We were, however, very cautious about carrying money or purses with valuables. Don't know how necessary that was.

Everyone from the front desk, housekeeping, valet, wait staff at the pool and sequirity were incredibly kind, friendly and very helpful picking restaurants, activities etc. all with a huge smile and incredible friendliness.

Housekeeping entered the room on multiple times and knocked on multiple times when the do not disturb sign was out. Also they called all the time to let us know they didn't clean the room because of the sign. What don't they understand about do not disturb? We extended our stay an extra night because my wife unfortunately became ill with food poisoning from a Bob Evans on the way down to the Keys so I wanted her to have some time to see the island once she felt better. However instead of just extending our stay we found out the hard way (room keys stopped working ) that we needed to go down the lobby, checkout and then check back in, pretty stupid. Then when we did get back the room housekeeping came by twice (with the sign up) to clean because they thought we had checked out. Where the communication with the front desk? I mean all in all this wasn't that bad but we were there on our honeymoon and the constant interruptions were getting old. In their defense though they did comp $100 on the last night when I told them about this. Overall just not worth the money and I wouldn't stay there again.

After insisting they finally gave us a room with 2 double beds. Each day that we were there we would see people checking in with that same frustrated look on their face. That said, our room was decently clean and the beds were very comfortable. We did not pay for a view and so our room looked out onto a residential alley and our door overlooked the parking below. But the room was quiet so I can't complain. The toiletries are very nice, the room was cleaned promptly each day, but as another reviewer noted, they failed to give us any spare toilet paper! Also, it would be nice if they put some towel bars in the bathroom, they chose decor over function. We also had the same problem with the tv that others mentioned, the sound would randomly go out, but would come back if you turn the tv off and back on again.

Unfortunately, as mentioned in a previous review, there were a number of small issues that really detracted from our stay. None of them alone are a big deal but these are the sort of things that we didn't expect, especially from a place affiliated with the Waldorf-Astoria group. First the good: Our room was very clean and quiet. The bed was very comfortable, the AC worked well as did all the fixtures, lamps, etc. The door to the balcony was very solid and blocked out any noise from the construction across the street (they worked only in the day hours and we were gone most of the time anyway). The staff was very friendly from the doorman to the front desk. The decor is attractive and the entire place seems well maintained and clean. The Reach is on the east end of town, the quiet end of Duval very near the \"southmost\" point in the US and it's an easy walk to a number of excellent cafe's, shops, and galleries. There is a small deli half a block away that was good for stocking up on some sodas, fruit, and munchies. The room included a small fridge (worked very well) and a much appreciated Netspreso coffee machine. Lots of towels and high quality shampoos, soaps, etc. Plenty of hot water too. We particularly liked the in room digital safe which was large enough to hold a laptop computer. Now, some of the \"misses;\" The in room info about the hotel was incomplete. Nothing about the facilities or the hotel's restaurant (The Strip House). Some of the information was wrong. It says there is an ice machine on each floor. Not true. We had to go up or down one floor for ice. The folder said there were bathrobes in each room -- not in ours. There was a small closet but really no other place to put our clothes; a few open shelves in the room, but no dresser space. As others noted, there were no towel bars in the bathroom. While the Netspresso machine was nice, there were no instructions on how to use it. The phone had the usual set of buttons to contact the desk, housekeeping, etc. but no button for a wake up call. I called the front desk and they told me to push the 'wake up call' button. When I told them there was no such button, they took my wake up info. Unfortunately we never got the wake up call. All the extra charges were disappointing; $12/day for self parking, $12/day for internet connection, and one of my personal peeves; they put a quart bottle of water in the room with a tag saying it costs $5, all this on top of a $20/day \"resort fee!\" (What does the resort fee cover anyway?) We had one breakfast at The Strip House and it was good; not outstanding, but good. There was the usual set of chafing dishes with bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, french toast, etc. The 'cold side' of the breakfast buffet was much better; fresh fruits, thin cut meats, and the lox/capers/egg/shallots on toast were excellent! Dinner at the Strip House was ok. The steak was good, well presented, and prepared as ordered. The prime rib sandwich was average. I find the decor of the Strip House rather sad. It strikes me as a throwback to the long-gone \"hip\" style of the rat-pack generation. Deep red patterned wallpaper, very low lighting, and back-lit photos of nude women (neither alluring nor artistic). Dean and Frank might have liked it but I found it dated and sad. Upon checkout I was asked how we enjoyed our stay and I said we had a good time but also had some concerns. To their credit, they knocked the \"resort fees\" off our bill so I do feel a bit better about it.

Most especially the guys at the pool/beach area were kind and attentive, particularly Ricardo, who was outstanding. These guys truly provided exceptional service.

The hotel's decor and landscaping were generally updated and attractive, and the fitness room was bright, clean, and modern. The beach is small but lovely and the resort provides chairs, towels, tables, and beverage delivery on the beach. A+ on the beach service! On the minus side: our reservations became a problem at check-in - I had received an e-mail confirmation of an upgraded room but the front desk didn't have record of the upgrade and I had to access my e-mail to prove that I should have the upgraded room, all of which took the better part of an hour late in the evening when I was already tired and traveling with kids. Other than the kind attentiveness of the pool/beach staff (plus a friendly bellman from Ohio), the hotel is really not kid friendly. There are no kids' channels on the tv. The restaurant is full of paintings of nudes - fine for adults, not so great for kids. Upgraded rooms are available with king beds and a sleeper sofa but not two beds. The rooms come with two bathrobes sized to fit large, tall men (I am a small woman and traveled with my two little girls). There was no place to put wet bathing suits. Balconies have two chairs, but if you travel with family, it would be nice to have enough seats for all. The pool was theoretically heated but the heaters weren't turned on until requested and then it took a couple of days to even begin to heat the pool, which also was full of bugs. Housekeeping was a little erratic in restocking rooms - we nearly ran out of (crummy quality) toilet paper every day and they didn't leave an extra roll, yet we had boxes of tissues. We had tons of shower gel but the hair conditioner didn't get restocked. Then again, when we called housekeeping to ask for what we needed, they were very prompt and pleasant in delivering it so they made up for the inconsistent restocking. There was not a hottub on either this property or the sister property next door, which was disappointing. The Internet wasn't working properly in our meeting room and the bathrooms for the meeting room had three stalls: one under construction and another that didn't lock, leaving only the handicapped stall perfectly maintained.

The restaurant serves breakfast & lunch & evening meal, which although is a little pricey it is convenient. The beach is small but given the lack of beaches on Key West we really liked it. The jet ski are a little noisy but they go out fairly infrequently & this didn't spoil our enjoyment. Parking is easy & works out at $12 a day plus tax (most places charge so reach is no different). My only criticism would be that people not staying in the hotel can easily access the pool & beach & so given that you are being charged a resort fee for such luxuries it was a little irritating. However, we would definitely stay here again as we really enjoyed our stay. It was worth paying that little bit extra.

The property had undergone a complete (and needed) renovation since we had last visited. It has also lost the Wyndam brand label in lieu of the Luxor Hotels label. We anticipated the stay to be similar to our previous one, but noticed that the environment certainly was more 'stuffy' this time around. Once checked in by the extremely nice, fake european accented front desk clerk, we headed up to our room. (Note - ask for a room close to the elevator or you'll be walking through a maze of left and right hand turns until you eventually get to your room). The room was very nice and well put together. The bed was fantastic and we ended up sleeping 10 hours non stop with no distraction. The view was also great. To our left was the Atlantic ocean and to our right was a view across the island. The only disruption was the sound of contstruction directly across the street, but hey... the sounds of progress can be everywhere. I've read other reviews of the 'nickel and dime' mentality of the Reach and I couldn't agree more. In fact, I'll save typing the same stuff everyone else stated, because IT'S SO TRUE!! The pool attendant making you sign for towels is hilarious, but not as funny as the ole' tactic of putting dollar bills on the clipboard to make you feel like you should tip. The pool and beach area were great, but they removed the Tiki Bar next to the beach that my wife and I had come to love during our prior stay. They instead offerred us drinks from the bar. Tasty, but worth $16 each, plus 15% tip and 8% service charge?? BUT, the classic story of our stay was when we decided to go to the pool early in the morning. No one was at the pool and we decided to sit on two chairs of our choosing. We were quickly yelled at by the pool attendant stating the chairs were taken! Then yelled at by the 'non-accupying' party from the balcony that they had those chairs saved. Ever have one of the momments where you didn't know whether to get ticked off or laugh?? Guess they feel for the clipboard trick... We do like the fact that this hotel (not resort) is on the quite side of the island. DO stay in this area if you like the night life, but can deal without the people yelling on the street all night. It's only an $8 cab ride to sunset square and all the night life. Other hotels in the area that are more economical and just as nice are the Best Western Hibiscus and Southernmost Hotel. Yeah, we've stayed at both of them also : )", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "tampa", "Title": "\u201cStaff was great\u201d", "Author": "TampaKen", "ReviewID": "UR21669907", "Content": "We origially had booked a room at one of Key West's more famous hotels close to Zero Duval but not being \"party people\", we couldn't handle the noise.

At check-in, they informed us of the $20 a day surcharge resort fee (we knew about it already) \"for our convenience.\" Since it was \"for our convenience,\" I said, I'll waive it. They chuckled and said it was worth it. It includes a turn-down every night and some other stuff I never saw. We didn't even get the turn-down every night. It's just a way to cheat on advertising the rates. The room we had was nice, our balcony was useable, and we could actually see the Atlantic if we leaned out over the rail. Our room was at the L of two buildings, so the balcony of our neighbor was right in our face. C'est la vie. The Strip restaurant is over-priced; breakfast for two from the steam table (and there's no other food offered) was $45, and it opened at 8:00 am. Lunch from the restaurant was served to us on the patio; it was pleasant but unmemorable. We didn't try dinner. We had drinks at the bar a few nights, and the service was good, but I didn't bother drinking my completely taste-free pina colada - rum and cokes were what I ordered the rest of the time, and they were fine. The cleaning staff stood out in the center court of our building and yelled to each other on all the floors every morning, waking us up. We couldn't get packets of coffee in our room one day, despite repeated requests (and being sent to the Strip to ask for coffee packets there - the bartender said he was busy and wouldn't even respond to the request). We had maybe a dozen little espresso plastic bubbles, but no espresso machine. Just a coffee maker and no coffee. The staff is very pleasant, but just not always competent. There is WiFi available in the rooms, but it's an extra charge billed to your credit card for your convenience by the service provider. (We didn't try it.) There is room service, but it's from a restaurant somewhere else that delivers. (We didn't try it.) I have no idea what resort features the motel offers; we saw nothing that other motels lacked. The motel ls located on the Atlantic side of the island, which means it is too far for a convenient walk to most of the hot spots on Duval Street. We rented bikes and had no problem riding all over the little island, but the Reach is definitely out of the way, which has its good points if you don't want to be in the thick of things when there's a festival.

There is no vending on the premises, both of these items force your hand and if you want a coke during your stay you have to go to the bar and pay 3 bucks for one.

The restaraunt is nice but extremely overly priced for such a remote location and in a hotel where people might just want to grab a bite instead of sitting down to drop a couple hundred for dinner. Needless to say the place was empty most nights. Overall a nice stay with nice people, but I would suggest the Santa Maria Suites Resort about a block away (sister hotel).

I contacted Joseph via phone and he tried his best to accommodate us, We were still somewhat saddened by the room we were left with, and I proceeded to the front desk to see of there was anything more that could be done. I knew what a long day Joseph had already endured, and with our reservation alone, he had to deal with me on three occasions. Joseph never seemed annoyed or frustrated. Joseph was friendly, kind and genuine from our very first encounter to our last. Joseph truly wanted me to be happy, and he was willing to go the extra mile when most people would not have done the same.

Instead of staying in Islamorada (where we had stayed for 7 nights), we thought we'd spend our last few days in a fabulous resort in Key West. We booked at The Reach (an Ocean View Boutique Suite - not cheap btw) and found upon arrival that our room was not an \"Ocean View Boutique Suite\", but a room overlooking the construction site which was opposite to the hotel!!! We called down to reception and explained that we had booked an \"Ocean View\" Boutique Suite, and could we possibly change rooms. We were met with a surly response stating that all rooms were completely booked and there was no chance of an \"upgrade\" (?!) Calmly, we explained that we had in fact PAID for an \"Ocean View Boutique Suite\" and had the receipt to prove it. We were then offered a room half the size of the original room on the 2nd floor of the hotel with an obstructed view of the pool. This was supposed to be a good substitute! We said \"no thanks\". So we stayed with the terrible view of the construction mess across the road for the first day. We were then moved to another room (i.e., the type we paid for) on the 2nd night. Not once were we offered a discount for staying in an inferior room for the 1st night (even though we'd paid ocean-view price). This is just the start of it. The resort has a dirty beach (junk and lots of seaweed everywhere with the water sports company right next to you - jetski's whizzing around as you swim). The pool is very small and crowded (don't let the pics fool you) - they also have a \"pool guy\" who spends all of his time trying to pick up women rather than help you get towels/drinks etc. On our last night we came back to the hotel at 9pm and thought we'd dine at the Strip House restaurant. The restaurant was mosty empty and we thought we'd have no problem getting a table. We were greeted by a horrid woman who said there are no tables available (despite the restaurant being almost empty). We were then told we would have to eat in the dingy bar area because they were understaffed in the main restaurant! We didn't fancy sitting by ourselves in the lonely bar, and again requested a seat in the main dining room. Afterall, we were only two extra people. The real reason came out eventually - they didn't want to seat us because they were closing in half an hour and didn't want us to hold them up! Furious, we complained to the hotel manager (the same guy who said we couldn't get an \"upgrade\"). He was (once again) very unhelpful and said there's nothing he could do about it. Don't stay here. The staff are rude, and it's a small and pokey little \"resort\".

However, the scuba diving is amazing which is the only reason we chose Key West. If you do dive, use South Point Divers.

We were not impressed. The hotel simply does not meet expectations. Granted, it TRIED really hard to be \"swanky\" but it just didn't succeed. Their basic rooms are the size of a postage stamp...very small and the most disfunctional room I've ever stayed in. Let me start with the shower because it was the most painful, annoying thing to me! The showerhead shot out the water so fast and hard, it was downright painful! And if you have a sunburn or bald head, you will be in agony. You can't adjust the water pressure at all. The knob only adjust the temperature, not the water pressure. Secondly, the shower only has about an 18\" glass partition, the rest of the shower is wide open to the bathroom. That means two things...one, the shower never \"warms up\" or steams up. It's cold as the air comes in freely. Secondly, as you can imagine, water gets all over the bathroom floor. It's the most ridiculous design I've ever seen. In an effort to have a \"fancy\" sink and faucet, you have little counterspace in the bathroom. As for the rest of the room, it was fine. The bed was comfy with nice linens. It has a little wet bar with great coffee. The pool is small and the water was cloudy. The \"beach\" isn't much at all and so covered with dead sea grass, it's not very pleasant either. It's definitly not a swimming beach. But, you really shouldn't be going to the Keys for beaches anyway...even their nicest beaches aren't very nice when you compare them with other Florida beaches. Don't let their claim of having a natural beach persuade you to stay there. Ricardo, the pool guy was there and he does a great job. Lastly, they charge you $12 a day for parking and $20 a day for \"resort fees.\" What the resort fee covers? They told me it was for the coffee in the room, internet, gym, etc.... That's some EXPENSIVE cups of coffee! We stayed at the Sheraton Suites -Key West for 2 nights prior...they didn't charge anything extra for in-room, Starbucks coffee, parking, etc... Reach management, if you are listening, your resort fee is the biggest rip-off ever! For your prices, you should be able to provide free internet , a gym and in-room coffee! I will never stay at another resort that charges a \"resort fee\" unless I get free parking, internet, in-room coffee and a resort with tennis, free kayaks and lots of other things. All in all, the resort is nice, it's clean, nicely landscaped. You won't be miserable there.

The resort's beach is extremely tiny..not for swimming at all, just to launch their overpriced jet ski rentals(we found many better deals on the island). It was not as clean & beautiful as the website photos make it. The enhanced pool photos etc. on the website are taken wide angle and don't accurately reflect their small size. The pool didn't have any of the serivces they charge you for in the resort fee...we received no towels....no drinks....no fruit. There was no amazing \"Ricardo\" as others have posted the days we were there.

The beach is very small however, we were well aware of this. The pool area is wonderful and Ricardo and Jonathan are by far the best things about this hotel. This is not a resort there is no extras, no turn down service, no free water items, no where to even get a cup of coffee, nothing that really makes your stay there \"stand out\". We were very disappointed as were other guests that there is no casual bar/food around the beach/pool area. We were not bothered by any construction although the fire alams went off on several occassions and the cable went out for hours at a time. The location is good however, it is a long walk to Mallory Square when the temp is 95+. The breakfast buffet is $17.00 per person so we ate at the Cuban grocery on the corner and had great ham/egg/cheese sandwiches for $5.00. We did hear that the Casa Marina had a more \"resort\" type atmosphere and we were welcome there however, their beach was much dirtier than the Reach. Skip Louie's Backyard and head to Southernmost on the Beach Cafe on Duval. (Turn left toward the water and it is on the beach only about a block away) Do not miss the Ft Jefferson trip. Well worth the money, We took the Yankee Freedom (BE SURE TO TAKE A COOLER WE WERE TOLD BY THE PLACE WE PURCHASED TICKETS THAT YOU COULD NOT BUT YOU CAN THEY WELCOME THEM AND PROVIDE AN AREA ON THE BOAT TO STORE THEM) Overall we had a very enjoyable trip however, the Reach is no more than an overpriced hampton Inn and at the Hampton you get free parking, breakfast and internet service. I'm just not sure why they charge the $20.00 per day resort fee. Also self park that is $12.00 vs $20.00 per day for valet.

This was our second visit to the hotel. Our first was when it was the Wyndom Reach Hotel. Now it is under the LXR umbrella after some renovations. They just opened and there are a few issues, but overall we were pleased with the improvements. First, the location is perfect for what we want in a trip to Key West. Location is good, still a walk to most restaurants and shopping, but for us that is ok. For some it will be an issue. Rooms are nice with all the expected features - robe, safe, coffee maker, and flat screen. However, the best reason to stay at The Reach is the beach. Water is warm and clear and the beach/pool staff excellent. A few drawbacks. The property next door is behind developed and the noise/trucks are constant. Most rooms are not going to pick up the noise, however. Maid service was inconsistent, but not a disappointment. Also, the hotel management has completely missed the opportunity to serve food/drinks at the pool and beach. The new restaurant (The Strip House) was staffed but they never ventured out to the pool to take orders. We made drinks in our room one afternoon and was approached by another guest about purchasing a cocktail! Other amenities are not operational, but not critical \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the business center and gift shop are yet to open so don't expect to be able to print your boarding pass or buy toothpaste for a little while. There's a small grocery store a block away for supplies. Also, parking is not free but valet is optional contrary to the sign out front. You don't need a car in Key West so the in-and-out valet service completely unnecessary and unwarranted. As for restaurants, we ended up not eating at The Reach. We found the best breakfast at Camiles Restaurant 2-blocks away on Simonton; world class sangrias at Santiago's Bodega on Petronia Street; satisfying appetizers at Nine One Five on Duval; great lunch at Salsa Loca Mexican Restaurant; the best dinner at Seven Fish on Olivia Street; the most expensive dinner next door at Louie's Backyard. Lastly, we found the best band performance in town - Kevin Gordon of Nashville - at Hog's Breath Saloon. We would not recommend The Reach for families with children. We have two daughters and I am not sure they would have enjoyed the sedate atmosphere of the pool or beach. Also, the Strip House restaurant may offer steaks but the atmosphere is closer to a bordello than a steak house with its tasteful display of nudes.

I was introduced through a promotion on Travelzoo but booked a promotion offered directly through the hotel's web site. I feel all the amenities offered were more than adequate contrary to some reviews. The beach area is small but maintained as I watched the crew grate the sand and remove the washed up weed in the morning hours with a tractor set up for such. The property around the pool and restaurant area has been landscaped beautifully. I think we were very fortunate in our room assignment. We booked a boutique room that wasn't supposed to have much of a view however we ended up in #434 which had a corner balcony and a \"view to kill for\". The view over the pool area from the 4th floor, watching boats, and listening to the ocean waves is so relaxing we found ourselves thinking twice about the room. This room has an expresso and complimentary use of robes. In our minds eye the room only had two negatives. First the refrigerator didn't work. It was replaced within the hour by management. The room didn't have a hair dryer which was brought to us once we asked. The rooms can be a walk to get to which can best be described by the resorts name. We found ourselves using the elevators going up but the stairs going down because of their convenient location. If you stay at this resort be aware of the 'SERVICE FEES'. The daily resort fee, which was the only one disclosed to my knowledge prior to booking, is just the start. The breakfast buffet, while very inviting, commands a 18 percent service fee prior to gratuity. The Reach Resort has mandatory valet parking which includes handling your baggage to your room which I admit was nice. We complimented the valet with a generous gratuity both checking in and checking out. However a twenty dollar a day valet fee is charged at check out. I questioned this fee but paid it just the same.

We previously stayed here in April 2006 and got married at their sister property, The Casa Marina in 2005. We were VERY disappointed in the changes they made to the hotel! We stayed in a boutique suite, the same room type we stayed in in 2006. If the hotel were in downtown Chicago the rooms would be appropriate. Unfortunately, they look nothing like a room you would expect in the Keys. We thought they were cold and uninviting. We may have felt differently if we had been given a view of anything other than the parking garage, though. Oh yes, the parking garage that we had to pay $20 per day in valet charges because we weren't allowed to self-park because they didn't have a permit allowing it. Since they only had one valet working at a time and they were also taking guests bags to and from their rooms we almost always had to leave our keys with the front desk. The parking spots on the street were so coveted that people would literally in them to save them for their cars. Pretty sad for a \"luxury\" hotel. They only had one working elevator and it wasn't anywhere close to our room. Apparently, they had no permits for all the elevators, either. We weren't bothered too much by this until we were checking out and the one working elevator was not working, either. The bellman tried his best to help us, but we still had to drag the majority of our bags, along with a one year old in a stroller down 3 flights of stairs. They also took out the hot tub that used to be by the pool as well as the \"Tiki Bar\" that was next to the pool. They stop serving their extremely overpriced food by the pool at 4pm, which we were rudely made aware of by the waiter on the day we checked in. At the time it was 3:55. The last time we stayed they had good food and GREAT frozen drinks. Those are gone :( We love Key West, so we put up with all the problems we had, but in the end we felt like they should have paid us to stay there. In all fairness, they did adjust our bill, but only enough to take the edge off our anger. I feel for the staff. They seem to have their hands tied by the hotel management and are unable to do much to rectify any bad situation. I know they paid millions of $$ to renivate this hotel, but they would have been much better off giving the $$ to Ricardo, the Pool Guy. He's the ONLY good thing that remains at this place!!!!

The room had a huge flat screen tv, fridge, espresso maker and iHome for our iPod. I had a queen sized bed with comfy duvet and my son slept on the sofa bed. The hotel has its own parking garage, which is rare in Key West, where parking is at a premium. The staff was incredibly helpful, young and international. They helped us book a great fishing trip and made great dinner recommendations. The steak restaurant and bar on site was open but we never ate there. The pool was wonderful and right next to their beautiful beach, where we rented a Jet Ski.

The pool was nice and was manned by Ricardo on most of the days we went. Ricardo was a fabulous host and we couldn't say enough good things about him. The beach was nice and due to the smaller size of the hotel, not too crowded. Part of it is taken up by a company that rents out jet skis, etc. We actually rented one on our last day and had a good time. They were not too loud or distracting to the beach goers as they can only be revved up past the swimming area which is quite large. The room was nice and had a great balcony.

We stayed three nights at the hotel from March 25 to 28. Honestly, this hotel should not be open to the public at this time. We were put in a room that had no working electrical outlets, no mini fridge, no clock, no wi-fi, the phone did not work, bathroom door did not close, no trash can. Additionally, the room was accross from a diesel generator or pump that kicked in every couple of hours throughout the night. It was evident that this room was not ready to be rented. The clerks were extremely nice and helpful but could not move us until the next day. We moved to a much better room, but then faced contruction of a new hotel across the street. Very loud from 7:30 AM until about 5 PM. The Reach needs another couple of months before it should be open to the public. Every staff member we mentioned this to agreed, but I'm sure they were happy to be working. We were disapointed by the game the hotel manager was playing. Every time we asked to speak with her, we were told she was next door at the sister hotel, Casa Marina. We left a phone mumber for her to call but did not receive a call back. We went to the Casa Marina, to be told she was at our hotel at the time. (Figured out her game quicky, can't blame her, she knew the hotel was not ready) Still waiting for a call...... A clerk gave us a $100 good will credit, but the damage was done. My advice is as follows; if you have reservations at the Reach, ask to be moved to the Casa Marina. It's renovation is complete and also has a beach and two pools. If you must stay at the Reach, and don't mind sharing your vacation with lots of construction workers, ask for a room that faces the pool, it will be much quieter and only about $50 a night more.

The construction at the resort is 99% complete and the hotel is beautiful, but there are some quirks that you should know before making the decision to stay here. Reservations - Avoid booking over the phone, and use the online system. I was repeatedly refused discount rates over the phone and also told only the more expensive rooms were available. Yet when I checked online, the discounts and lower priced rooms were available. When I called back and informed them of this, availability, the discounts and lower priced rooms were \"magically\" available over the phone. Private Beach - The hotel sits on a tiny private beach and has a beautiful pool area. The ocean views rooms mostly overlook this pool/beach area. However, we visited one ocean view that mostly looked at the construction going on next door, so be careful! Also, the beach is small and can get crowded so we often used the Casa Marina's large beach next door which had more amenities like towel and drink service, hammocks, and a prettier view. The rooms - We stayed on an ocean view junior suite which was clean, modernly decorated, and the King bed was very comfortable. Nice sheets, linens, amenities etc. We also used the suite's balcony fairly frequently which had a beautiful view. The room was one of the best parts of our stay. Noise - Although the construction is finished at this hotel, the property right next door is undergoing a major construction job. During the week day mornings, we woke up to the sound of jack hammers. Also, there were problems with the fire alarms which went off EVERY morning of our stay, for 20 minutes to an hour. I don't know why they could not fix the problem. Housekeeping - When we arrived at 6pm (check in at 3), we were able to go directly to our room. But many people were waiting in the lobby for their rooms to be prepared, nearly three hours after the check in time. Not good. Also, the hall ways were often lined with used dishes that were not picked up for days. However, we did not have any problems with housekeeping servicing our room. Incomplete Services - the ice machines are not yet installed on each of the floors, the restaurant is not open for dinner, and the fitness room is not yet equipped. Overall, I would be willing to stay here again for a really good price.

We also took advantage of Billy's Barefoot WaterSports rental, which is located right on the Reach Resort's private beach. Our only real disappointment was that neither hotel had a hot tub, and we were surprised that none of the suites had whirl pool tubs. The fact that the restaurant was not open was not an inconvenience, as there are so many wonderful restaurants in Key West, many within walking distance.

It was old and dirty and too expensive (over 300$ a night). When I saw the parking garage, I already knew it would be bad. The room was quite big, that was the only good part, but there was a mildew smell in the bathroom, the couch was dirty (it had brown spots), there was a long black hair hanging on the wardrobe door for the entire week we stayed there. The safe was full of dust, you almost don't want to put anything in it. The air conditioning was loud. We stayed at the pool most of the time, but there was always noise because of the constructions right next to the pool. When people ordered food to their room, the plates would not be removed from the room, so there were always dirty plates and cups on the floor outside the room. It was smelly because they were out in the heat for a couple of days before someone took them away. The gym was very disappointing. I had never seen such old and rusty free weights before.

From the very beginning, it was an unpleasant experience. I was told when I made my reservation no deposit was required and was even urged to reserve two rooms and decide later which room I preferred. Two days later when I checked my account, I saw two withdrawals, a deposit for each room. I called accounting for one week straight in order to have the Reach Resort credit my account the deposit for the room we no longer wanted. I only heard from someone after the matter had been taken care of. Hindsight tells me I should have cancelled my reservation completely and chosen to stay somewhere else. On the website, our room was described as \"luxurious comfort and incredible views of Old Town and Key West\". In reality, we had a room with a dirty balcony that overlooked a junkpile in someone's back yard, a bathroom with peeling wallpaper, a lamp with a missing switch, a mini-bar that we never received a key for, a non-existent sofa bed as promised in the description, a parking deck filled with dust and debris from the nearby construction, and a hotel with a staff that showed us no concern and was somewhat rude. And the grand finale was when I checked my bank account today and saw two charges on my account totaling $243 over the amount I signed the receipt for when I checked out. I have spent the day attempting to get someone on the phone to handle this matter and not surprising, I have not heard back from anyone. The nicest people working at this so called resort were the people working the pool and pool bar and one of the valet guys that offered to call us a cab.

The pool and beach attendants were very nice and were very quick to bring towels and umbrellas to us immediately. The staff at the outdoor grill were always pleasant too. The food at the resort restaurants was very good, but very overpriced. Do not do the breakfast buffet at Shula's...it was $40.00 for the two of us. Given the amount of food we ate, it shouldn't have been more than $15.00. The rooms were clean and cheerful. We were both pleased with the size of the room (we stayed in the boutique style room). The air conditioner is very loud, when you have it on high, but that didn't bother us too much. The location of the resort was probably the thing we liked most. It was nice to have a beach and a beautiful pool to enjoy and it's nice to get away from the loud, craziness of Duval St. Okay, I told you all of that to tell you this...they failed to mention they were doing construction at the resort on the website, or when we called to make reservations. We found out bright and early Monday morning at 9AM!!! when the jackhammer and saws started up. They didn't even tell us when we checked in on Sunday that this was going on...are you kidding me? We were originally going to stay at the Hyatt but didn't because they made us aware on their website that they were under construction. We had planned on relaxing and sleeping in on our vacation...think again!! And don't even consider an afternoon nap, because these guys go from 9-5!!

A few tips...there are lots of reasonable places to eat that are close to the hotel, for breakfast...Dennis Pharmacy (I think that's what it's called, straight down Simonton St.) they have a great breakfast at hometown prices, Duval Beach Club (a block or two down from the hotel) has great sandwiches and frozen drinks, for snacks during the day I suggest picking up chips and things from any drug store or convenience store, it'll save you time and money.

Everything about the Wyndham Reach Resort was bad. I mean, if you ve traveled a little in your life, you can tell right away that this hotel is a rip off. I m not holding any grudges against the hotel personnel (polite but not overtly nice either) but against the chain itself. Here is my list of complaints : -The so-called beach that you re longing for ? Forget it at the Wyndham Reach Resort. There is so much seaweed by the water you can t go for a swim....and the smell...granted, it s not the hotel s fault, but you don t charge $180 a night for a beach that is nonexistent. When we got there at 3pm in the afternoon, there was not a single person on the beach. They were all by the pool nearby. -Be aware that they re having massive construction work going on this summer. There are about 20 workers next door and while we were there, we HAD to wake up at 9 am, as the noise was so loud (huge drilling downstairs in the garage as well) -We had to insist to change rooms later that day. It only worked because we stopped by the reception several times -Upon arrival, we were not offered the option of self parking. The valet took care of our car right away. Now, coming from Miami Beach where there s no other option, we did not question that, until we realized there was indeed a self parking section. We asked for our car keys right away. -The first room we were staying in was full of small ants (on the telephone, in the kitchenette sink, on the floor...) -Inside of rooms is tacky, unless you like tropical colors, Jimmy Buffet style -When we checked out, we had a surcharge of 14 dollars a day for resort fees....now, when I asked, they said that s because 30mns of free local calls are included (we did not know anyone in Key West, too bad...) and complimentary transportation to and from Key West airport (we drove from Miami...). I was so disgusted at that point, I did not ask for the fee to be waived but I think you can do something if you really want to Honestly, I never write reviews online but I told my boyfriend during the trip I owed it to other tourists like us to do it and I wanted to keep my word. Also, I really think they discriminate against reservations made through Expedia, Travelocity, etc...as opposed to those made through their own website. You just need to know it when your room is assigned. In short (well, long now...), go somewhere else in Key west.

The Reach Resort was the only negative part of the week we spent there from the 12th to the 18th of August. I chose the Reach because it looked reasonably good, and I got a good discount through an internet package deal with airfare and a car. Had it not been for this, I wouldn't have stayed there. The place has a beach, but Key West itself doesn't have natural beaches and the one they have generally stinks of sulphur and is coated with seaweed. They try to clean it, but it is not a pleasant place to swim. The Pool is okay, although the hot tub jets were broke. Some of the staff is friendly and some is definitely less than friendly. As for the room, the loud air conditioner kept my fiancee from getting a good night's sleep, we had ants in the sink despite never bringing food into the room, and the biggest one of all is that our housekeeper threw out souvenier drink cups from bars that we had washed out and were going to reuse at home, and moved things around so we couldn't find them, including some of my fiancee's jewelry, which had her absolutely furious. At the end of the stay, I saw on my bill that I had been charged for a drink off the mini-bar, that I had never opened with the key provided, but did leave it in the room. It was charged for the same day as the other problems we had with the housekeeper. They took off the drink charge immediately, but were not remotely friendly about it. The elevators both smell precisely like a garage or auto body shop, and there was a massive amount of construction in the parking garage starting midway through our time there. I only used the rental car to drive up the keys a couple of days and to and from the airport, but came into the garage after 48 hours of not using it to find that my rental was behind caution tape and in the construction zone. They didn't bother to ask if I had a rental when I checked in, and I was so happy to be in Key West I didn't bother to tell them. This means that approximately anyone can just park in the garage for a week, because they won't check. This place has a resort fee of 14 dollars a day, which is ridiculous. It has nothing that a Holiday Inn couldn't provide. Many of the quaint B&Bs or small hotels in town would provide more comfort. Key West is fantastic, but this place is slowly corroding in the salt air and was responsible for nearly all the stress I experienced on my vacation.

The location is great; the staff was wonderful to me; and everything was idyllic until the approach of hurricane Dennis. I was booked from July 1 until July 12. On Thursday, July 7, I was scheduled for a sailing trip and at the other end of the island. I heard by word of mouth that tourists were being asked to leave. I rushed back and asked the desk what to do. They told me it was my problem and not theirs. I began calling airlines and busses and every other form of transportation. All said no way out and no possiblity of getting out. The hotel said I could stay the night while I found transportaiton. A letter came to me at 9:00 pm saying that I had until Friday noon to close my account, though I had 4 more nights paid in advance. But at 9:00 am the next morning my phone service and electricity was cut off, leaving me no way to get in touch with my tentative transporation (a limousine service had told me they would come and pick me up when they had enough passengers to make it worth their while). At 9:30 Friday morning, staff started to pound on my door demanding me to leave, even though weather conditions were not yet a problem. At 10:00 I checked out in the lobby; I was told that they could do nothing about the 4 nights left, prepaid. I was told that I should have not paid until checkout and then it would not be a problem; they just wouldn't charge me for the nights I lost. I told them I was waiting to hear from my transportation arrrangements. But at 10:30 I was escourted out to the street and told I could not wait under shelter or anywhere near the hotel property. Two of us with suitcases were homeless, with no access to bathrooms or phones. By that time I had tentative transportation at 1:30 in the afternoon, 3 hours later. I understand the hotel was concerned about legal liability, but indeed I was put in much more danger by being put onto the street before there was any immediate threat due to the weather. I had bought sandwiches and other items from a shop on the corner of South and Simonton, one block from the hotel, and the women who ran it told me I could stay there as long as they were open. But no bathrooms and no phones. I managed to find a pay phone to tell the limousine service that they could not pick me up at the Wyndham; I had been evicted. The main reason for this note is that the hotel refused to offer any assistance whatsoever. Management is not concerned other than they don't want anyone on the property. I was not treated in any way as a guest who was welcome. But, even more, why do I have to pay for 4 nights I did not receive when others who closed their bills on checkout were not charged for their bookings? Customer service of this hotel does not answer enquires of this nature. Even if you take this as an invalid review, I do suggest not going to Key West during hurricane season. It was 1 in a million that this would happen. And I thought I was safe. But there are no shelters in Key West and no public help in hurricanes. I was even told that I was violating the law and could be prosecuted for not getting out. How? I did not drive there; I flew there. And no forms of transportation were available. And when I called public service lines, I never got a responce.

The hotel does have the best beach in all of Key West so if staying at a hotel on the beach is your main objective then this hotel may be worth the price.

Warning: the beach has a bunch of washed up dirt/seaweed on the shore that they rake every night but you still must wade through it to get out to the pretty water. The beach/pool service was excellent though as they have guys who set up your chairs, give you towells, and take your drink/food orders. Our room was kept clean but the maid didn't come to clean until 5 pm. We did encounter a few problems with checking in though. The two parties in front of us had problems with their reservation, which the front desk employees did not know how to handle. We had booked an oceanview suite with a king bed; however, we were given a room with a queen bed and a nice view of the side of a building and some trees.

The Wyndham website is misleading as it allows you to specifically book a suite based on bed size. As we waited for the airport shuttle on our last day, at least 15 people checked in and then complained about their \"oceanview\" and bed size. Bottom Line: Do NOT upgrade to the Oceanview...it is soo not worth it! There are only a handful of rooms that could have a good view of the ocean.

Did I mention the big cracks on the outside of the hotel, makes a really pretty view as you think of how they should tear it down? The people there were friendly for the most part, especially the guys that put your chairs down for you on the beach, by giving them even $1 they will make sure they come back around and take care of you. We were always offered popcicles and ice cream. The pool was nice and a good size, it has a ledge around it which makes it nice for sitting in the water but not getting completely in. It was very clean too. The little poolside bar makes excellent drinks, a little pricy but worth it to some. The food was a little too pricey but you do get a lot for your money, good luck in eating the whole meal or appetizer. It is perfect to split with someone and split the cost. There are so many things that you can do around Key West, you definatly do not need a car, we walked or took taxi's everywhere, which were very reasonable. A few great places to eat..Awful Arthurs has great shrimp, the Sands Club next to the Wyndham has excellent prime rib and Crabby Dicks was excellent seafood. There is a lot to be desired at the hotel but your vacation is exactly what you make it, my best advice is to stay busy outside your hotel room. It is a hard toss up on whether the price of the room is worth it or not, you do get the best oceanfront of all of Key West and I had many locals tell us that but your room is going to be less then desirable and should cost about $100 less a night. Also watch out if you buy a package, they really get you on the 14% room fee they tack on each day that ended up being $78 for 5 nights, puts a damper in spending money if your not expecting it! I would go back to Key West in a heartbeat and I would definatly use the Wyndam's facilities, I just don't know if I would stay there again. The Hilton has comparable rates and there hotel was beautiful and nearly new.

I am in complete agreement with a recent poster who spoke of the bathroom- peeling wallpaper that was fraught with mold- no kidding. We stayed for the same reason as others- we had prepaid. Also, the pool and beach were very very nice- but beware, no seats at the pool midday and they shoo you to the beach to find a place to sit.

They should give everyone a floor plan when they check in. 2.) There are no vending machines anywhere on the property, so stock up before you go. One other thing to note, there's an additional $12 daily fee on top of taxes. They say it's for the pool and parking garage, but it's just a hidden fee.

We could not have asked for better service. We mentioned that it was our 20th anniversary at check-in and we were surprised by a bottle of champagne and a hand written note of congratulations from the management. That was an incredibly nice touch. More importantly, the property was delightful. The beach was steps from the pool, and both were just wonderful places to relax and enjoy yourself. The Reach had more than enough chairs and umbrellas to comfortably seat all of its guests (and the hotel was full when we were there) where ever they wanted to sit. No need to worry about getting out early to make sure you had a lounge chair in the shade. Those people who wrote negative things about the Reach either should not go to Key West because it simply does not have great beaches, or they should not go to expensive resorts because they resent spending the customary resort charges (which are always alot) for food and other items. We did not think the Reach's prices for food were that expensive and the resort fee it charged was similar to what other resorts charged. We had no complaints whatsoever about the Reach. One suggestion, though, spring for the oceanview room and don't expect much of a view of the ocean even with that. The city view you might have is not what you would visualize when you think of Old Key West.

The room (341) was clean and very large. The room had a separate sink area, while the bath room itself had a bath and separate large shower, which was plenty big for two. The view was great of the pool and beach area. The location of the Reach was a bit of a walk to the party end of Duval, but that was fine with us. We enjoyed the walk and found that when we wanted to get away from the bustle of Duval the Reach provided a quiet alternative. Ricardo at the pool was very friendly and helpful by setting up chairs and bringing us frozen towels to help cool us off. The beach was raked everyday to clear it of washed up seaweed, which one has to expect with all of the hurricanes lately. The beach side bar and grill was good, a bit on the expensive side, but so was all of Key West.

One of the reasons we went with this is because my travel agent talked about the white sand beach and that if we stayed 3 nights the 4th would be free. I was very excited about going on the trip I had booked 2 months in advance, until I had read the reviews here, and much to my disappointment they were all true. Our room was small, but what can one expect for $150 a night. We couldn't get over the overwhelming smell of mildew in the room- everytime the ac kicked on that was all you could smell. But don't open the balcony door- you will be hit in the face with the smell of rotting seaweed that is abundant on those white sand beaches. Don't even bother trying to get to the ocean, unless you want to tred through 5 feet of seaweed. We could always tell that we were nearing our resort as we were walking along because of the grotesque smell of the seaweed. Besides the smelly ac, there was the mildew stricken \"what use to be yellow but now turned green\" wallpaper in the bathroom- if you have allergies- forget it- I was sneezing my head off. Plus don't slip on the leaking pipes under the sink that nearly soaked our floor. We never received our complimentary welcome gift of 2 drinks and food, even after calling the front desk twice, and once going down there. The room service was bad- besides them taking away the rubber mat for the tub, taking away one of our pillows, and taking one of our personal hangers- we stopped using them because we did a better job then them- I don't think these people know what a vacuum cleaner or broom is. Let alone knowing how to bend down and pick up the plate of food sitting outside of our neighbors door for over 2 days. As one reviewer said before- It does look like they are waiting for a hurricane to come along so they can collect the insurance money- and if they are lucky maybe Ivan will do the trick. I will never stay at this hotel again- oh, and the 3 nights, get the 4th for free- do you think that was taken off of my bill??? Of course not- I had to go to the lobby and have the office people look at me like I had 3 heads because I wanted the 4th night free, as promised in the agreement with the travel agent.
