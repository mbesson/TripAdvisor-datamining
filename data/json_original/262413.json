It has easy access to the oxford and Bond street. It is close to the Bond Street Tube Station. The rooms are in 3 differend houses. We were at an other house than the Lobby was, so you had to exit the hotel to go to the Lobby or for breakfast. You have to use your roomkey to enter the house, only one roomkey was provided, so that was very unpractical for 2 people staying in a double room and coming home for different times. You could hear the door everytime someone entered or exited the building. Breakfast was ok, it wasn't plenty or much choise but ok. It was only served for 1 and a half hours, so we missed it most of the time. If you want to check out before 7 am you have to inform the Lobby one day in advance. Staff was not friendly and not very helpfull. We wanted to check in early at about noon, but that was not possible. So we stored our luggage at the lobby ( avery small lobby) that was o the fisrt floor with no elevator. Later when we could check in, we had a room in an other house at the fisrt first floor, so wee had to carry our luggage again up the stairs on the other side of the street. The staircase was very steep and narrow, so it was complicated to get it up or down with the suitcase. The room and bathroom was clean and nice. The TV was very small, and only had 4 different channels. The shower was very small and water did run very slow, but still it would not go down the drain very well. So the person showering after you, was still standing with his feet in your showerwater. The windows in the room didn't close properly.

The location is indeed perfect, just round the corner from Oxford Street. But the standard of the my room was very very poor. I am usually not so picky - it's fine if there's no shower mat or no shampoo, it was just one night I was going to spend there anyway. However, the furniture was incredibly old and dusty, the feeling was of a place which is hardly ever cleaned. It felt like the whole room had gone stale, it just did not smell fresh. More than a hotel it reminds me of those cheap bed&breakfast for young students. Unfortunately I am past that stage and if I spend \u00c2\u00a3 98 per night I do not expect luxury but at least hygene. This place should have one, maximum two stars, certainly not three! Needless to say: no internet connection, no room service, nothing you would expect for that price in a modern hotel. Again, fine with me for one night, but if you are on a business trip and need these facilities just stay clear. If you pay with card 5% will be charged. Also quite infrquent in modern world. You may end up in a different building than the reception, you may want to know if you are pregnant/elderly/frail as you will have a flight of stairs in front of you any time you need the reception, and another one if you are staying in a room opposite to reception. I was on top floor, that is three flights of stair every time. I did not try the breakfast, but the restaurant looked fine from the outside.

Oh, how wrong we were!!! Firstly we were both 6 months pregnant. Once we found the \"hotel\" (located next to a restaurant and there is no proper hotel entrance, its just a door and you really won't know if you are walking into someones flat), the first thing that we saw was a huge flight of stairs!!! We struggled the bags up the stairs and then we saw a \"reception\" desk. We had to ask if this place was a hotel, because we were so unsure about it. After handing over a \u00c2\u00a310 deposit in order to receive our room key, we had to carry our bags yet another flight of stairs, and nobody offered to help. The room was SO dirty and horrible. The smell was something you would expect in a morgue, mixed with faint smell of gas. Stained beds, ripped sofa, mouldy bathroom, dirty curtains and only two lights were working in the room. We were given two large HANDTOWELS and nothing else. No shampoo etc, just some dove soap. Cheap toiletpaper and only one roll was left at a time!!! The beds were so uncomfortable, they must be several decades old, because we just kept sinking into them. Our backs were killing. We asked the man behind the receiption desk where our Cooked English Breakfast would be served, and he stated with very broken English that there only was continental breakfast available and that it would be served at 8am in the restaurant outside the \"hotel\". We had paid for Full English Breakfast when we booked the \"hotel\". When we told this to the man he said that we should complain to the airline company and that he would not do anything about it. Just one look at the restaurant made us decide that it was safer to go to some cafe for a breakfast than eat in that place. First night we could not even sleep, as someone was banging the doors so loudly. The doors are suppose to have door closers on them, but all of them are clearly broken, as the doors just keep slamming!!! When we checked out, again nobody would help us with the suitcases, even though we were clearly struggling. This place is an absolute disgrace and way overpriced.
