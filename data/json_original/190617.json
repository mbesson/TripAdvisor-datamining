The hotel interiors are very grand and ornate yet have a very 'new' and fresh feel. Our room, on the 5th floor was very quiet, clean and well decorated. The bathroom was beautiful, a small bath, seperate shower cubicle with rainfall shower and hand held attachment (ideal if you do not wish to get your hair wet every time you shower) and a WC with its own door. The bed was very comfortable although it was 2 beds pushed together to form a super king - a pet hate of mine. Rooms do not come with an iron or ironing board. There is an ironing service offered at a (high) charge but we phoned down to reception and they brought both within 5 minutes of our call. Room keys are of the old style with an enormous tassle on. This is presumably to encourage you to hand in the key to the concierge before leaving the hotel. This was no problem for us and we never had to wait for our key even when arriving back to the hotel after midnight. The concierge was very helpful for us, booking restaurants and giving recommendations, they also helped us get FC Barcelona tickets before we arrived. We did not eat in the hotel and there really was no need. The Palace is situated near a plethora of cafes, tapas bars and restaurants. We were a 10 minute stroll from the nearest metro or Placa de la Catyluna and the start of Las Ramblas. We could not have picked a better location. We had a fab stay in Barcelona and a lot of that was down to our choice of hotel. After a hectic day walking the streets of the gothic quarter and las ramblas it was lovely to come back to a calm, quiet hotel for some rest and relaxation.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Billericay, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "EssexSyd", "ReviewID": "UR128281783", "Content": "The hotel has clearly had a lot of TLC on it. They have kept the traditional feel but at the sametime our room was modern and very up to date. We stayed in a Junior Suite (423). Having travelled with hand luggage only the toliteries are very welcome, including a wet razor. We were shown to our room which had a welcome plate of fruit and a bottle of water. Only observation here, is that the water was not replaced and the fruit plate was removed before everything was eaten. The hotel is ideally located for exploring Barcelona but I receommend a room at the rear, although we had air conditioning it was nice to open the windows. I did think the description of overlooking a traditional courtyard was a bit of a stretch but it depends on what you consider a traditional courtyard. Staff could not do enough for you and the Cocktail bar is like stepping back in time to a 1930's era. Cocktails range from \u20ac12 - \u20ac18. We did not eat at the hotel as we like to find somewhere where the locals eat. As any City the tourist areas rip you off in charges. The fitness room is free but there are charges for the Spa. Cannot comment on these as we did not use them. Also I do think that in this day and age Wi-Fi should be free.

It is however let down by 3 flaws. Firstly there is no in room wifi, which means that if you have an iPad you have to go down to the foyer and get a pass code to access the web for just 1 hour whilst sitting in the entrance hall. This is annoying and becomes tedious after a couple of days. Secondly the Metro trains clearly run under the hotel and their noise is significant and the fact that they start up at 5am means getting a good night's sleep is difficult. This is compounded by the third issue which is that the room doors almost slam shut meaning that once the first person exits their room in the morning, everyone on that floor is woken.

The large opulent lobby area impresses with old-style luxury hotel atmosphere and plenty of comfy sofas, while the rooms are nice but not particularly special as compared to other five-star hotel rooms. The room seemed smaller than indicated which probably reflects including in the advertised size, the \"dead\" space hallway leading into the room and the large bath area, which included both a shower and a regular bathtub. The shower only had a tiny plastic soap dish to hold the soap, shampoo, conditioner - not to mention my face wash, razor, shaving lotion - so some things had to be put on the shower floor and other things kept falling off the tiny dish. I guess this is a typical design with no function issue. The smallish working desk didn't have a desk lamp; the only lighting being ceiling downlights that could only all be turned on at once, making it difficult for one person to work at the desk while the other went to bed earlier or got up later. After I requested a desk lamp, the hotel did put one in. Ask for one when you check-in to avoid loss of sleep and irritation!. More irritating is that this pricey hotel charges for in-room wifi (15 Euro per day) while offering a cable-internet connection in the room. When paying over 400 Euro a day for a smallish room, I expect to get the wifi free. I also disliked the bedding, this must be the first 5-star hotel I have stayed in that does not have high-quality sheets and duvets. The sheets felt and looked basic, no choice of pillows, and worst of all, there was only a thin brown blanket(doesn't feel \"fresh\" or comfy) stretched across the king-size bed. Perhaps I am spoiled (I spend about 75 hotel nights a year in 4 or 5 star hotels), but I like a down or feather duvet - one for each side of the bed but big enough to share. Surprisingly there were only 2 bath towels and 2 hand towels in the room - no wash cloth and no extra bath towel for drying hair (we were two in the room). The towels were standard size and rather worn: thin and even fraying on the edges. The closet and clothing storage area is located in the bath area, which some may find less convenient. The armchair in our room was soiled from use (brownish discoloration on the arm rests and the front of the seat area), making it unattractive to sit on. The breakfast cost 28 Euro per person, and was pretty standard fare. I would have liked more fruits - I was disappointed there were no berries (all over Europe there are Spanish strawberries sold cheaply now). The breakfast room is a canvas covered outdoor garden and a bit cold. One morning we were put by the door to the patio where smokers go and it was very cold with the door frequently opening (and often being left open). I was surprised that when we sat in the lobby, no one ever came up and asked if we would like to order some coffee or a drink (a couple of times we sat for 20 - 30 minutes and staff would merely walk by, even though the lobby was nearly empty). But when I tracked down the bartender and ordered tea, it was very nicely served. The location of the hotel is good. Barcelona boasts many high-end and other hotels may offer more real luxury for the price. If you want heavy drapes, lots of gold and gild, embossed wall-paper, and \"old-world luxury\", this hotel may suit you. If so, ask for a high-floor room (only 6 floors) to avoid traffic noise, (you can still hear the subway rumble if the room is quiet and you're not distracted. This did not bother us but might a light sleeper.)", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, TX", "Title": "\u201cEl Palace....a Wonderful Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Randyk47", "ReviewID": "UR127819696", "Content": "We stayed at the El Palace Hotel in March 2012.

The break was to be a surprise for my partner, but the cat was let out of the bag, when Thomas Cook sent through marked envelopes in the post with their name on the outside. Our destination was the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona flying with Easyjet with a private taxi transfer to our hotel. We got caught up in the bag fiasco at Gatwick airport (power outage on the conveyor belt), but luckily our baggage was transferred without any delay to our destination. We found the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona a very luxurious hotel with the following excellent points: - 1. Excellent customer service 2. Excellent accommodation 3. Excellent food 4. Excellent location 5. Friendly and helpful staff The only downside we had a very slow draining bathroom sink after a few days which was not rectified on our first mention of it. It was rectified on the second mention. The prices for hotel extras we found to be a little on the expensive side, but for a five star hotel I suppose this is to be expected. Overall prices for most items in Barcelona were expensive in comparison to the UK. If a quiet stay is required, then this is not the right hotel, as it is located on one the main roads into Barcelona. We found our room to be well insulated from the traffic noise though, and we slept soundly on very comfortable beds. The hotel staff assisted us with excellent service in re-arranging our pick up time on our return journey back to the UK, as this was booked for 5:45am in the morning for a 10:55 flight back to the UK.

The decor is opulent and grand throughout the lobby, with many places to sit and start conversation. Despite the large, open space, it gives off an intimate feel.

On arrival we were upgraded to a 1st floor suite with an aspect looking out directly to rooms on the opposit site of former courtyard. To enable privacy, the windows were at least 80% opaque glass and with 3 sets of window dressings, natural light was seriously impeded. However as the weather was brilliant sunshine every day which meant we were out all day we were not too bothered. The room was well appointed with everything as it should be. The suite consisted of a bedroom, lounge, large bathroom with separate shower room and a luggage storage space. The decent sized bedroom had built in wardrobes, a wall-mounted flat screen TV and bedside tables. The bed was exceptionally comfortable with a daily linen change. Lighting was excellent with a nightlight for in-bed reading in addition to lamps. The lounge contained a desk & chair, a sofa, armchairs and a 2nd wall-mounted TV. A mini-bar with limited stock is provided but no courtesy tray for hot drinks but this arrangement is fairly standard in Europe. I cannot function without tea as soon as my eyes are open so took my own travel kettle etc and this did not attract any comment (this has been known in other places but I like tea hot not tepid after a 10 minute journey from a kitchen!).Housekeeping and replenishment services were excellent given it was a holiday period for the local people as well. The bathroom offered a double wash basin unit with plenty of space for two sets of toiletries etc, a jacuzzi which worked and was spotless, a large walk-in shower with the option of overhead or hand held waterflow. Only slight issue was the decor was very dark in the shower area but lighting and mirrors in the grooming area were excellent. We took breakfast in a large room with central buffet tables. This area is either a conservatory or is actually outside but cleverly disguised as an indoor room for winter months. It is heated by two types of heating -high wall-mounted electric bar heaters and moveable outdoor patio heaters. Despite their best efforts, these heaters are not adequate. As our visit progressed I was wearing more layers each morning and I observed other guests resorting to outdoor clothing at breakfast. The food was fine but my other half felt that there should have been a cook to order menu for a hotel of this calibre. There was certainly no evidence of this being available. We had dinner in the AE restaurant on Christmas night which was absolutely fine but not exceptional. We also dined at their Michelin star restaurant Caelis and that's another story! Please see separate review. Suffice to say it was a week ago and we are still awestruck!!! The location of El Palace is very central with excellent access to good shopping streets, a short distance to the Barrio Gotic, a healthy walk to beach and nearby the Gaudi hotspots. This was our 2nd visit to Barca and we still have not used a bus or underground train. Lots of people comment about noise from the underground. I noticed it but it was not obstrusive. This is a city centre after all. We tend to use 5 star hotels in cities and although El Palace does not equate to other places we have stayed in recent times it was very good value. We would probably give it another chance.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cGood but not great\u201d", "Author": "IrishKaren", "ReviewID": "UR122515189", "Content": "I'm going to go against the grain here and say that I don't think El Palace compares with some of the more famous five star hotels that I've stayed in (George V, The Hassler).

We had lunch and it was fantastic but there was just no atmosphere, the place felt dead and we were the only people in it making it hard to sit back and relax. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was nice but just nice nothing amazing, the colours of the room were muted and the room felt dark and gloomy, the seating area only had one small sofa and two upright chairs so it wasn't a great place to lounge in. As it was our wedding anniversary my husband had (as a surprise) requested flowers, bubbly & cake in the room on arrival(he booked this two months in advance).

Other things such as a leaking radiator which had obviously been like it for some time as the carpet was discloured, not being able to get through to room service, a breakfast delivered without butter, salt, jam and milk and you can understand why I wasn't blown away.

We knew from the moment we arrived at the entrance, we couldn't have made a better choice. Well-located on a lovely boulevard and close to the Ramblas, this long-time Barcelona Ritz hotel has been beautifully up-dated on at least two occasions since it dropped the Ritz label in 1988. While the up-dating has incorporated all the modern conveniences, the decor is classic in style. The lobby, which incorporates a bar and a dining area at its far end, is huge and very elegant, with lovely sofas and magnificent chandeliers. The dining room for breakfast is reminiscent of a English garden room. There is a Michelin-starred dining room which unfortunately we felt obliged to avoid, still suffering the effects of excessive eating during a just-completed Mediterranean cruise. We did, however, sample (and were happy with) the food and drink in both the less-formal dining area and the breakfast room. In summary, the public areas of the hotel are as good as they come. Our room, on the top floor of the hotel, was of a good size and equally attractive and functional, with quality furnishings and a great bathroom including both a bath and separate shower. It's obvious that a lot of thought had gone into the planning as all one's needs seemed to be taken into account. The flat-screen television, for example, was incorporated into a mirror, so that one was unaware of a television in the room until it was activated with the remote control. A very comfortable bed and quiet heating and airconditioning systems made sleeping very easy. Of course, it is important also to have good staff. From the doorman to the front desk to the chambermaid, every one we encountered was very professional, congenial and proficient in English. We used to great advantage the very strong concierge desk in making arrangements for evening musical events and shopping recommendations. Yes, there were some minor concerns - if you didn't have (but require) an adapter for North American plugs, you have to ask for one; the standard bar of soap is hand-sized and not bath-sized, but the latter is available on request.

The hotel is located in a great area close to but not really in any specific area (about a 10 minute walk from the bus you can take from the airport and about 5 minutes from the closest Metro). This was our first '5-star' hotel and it did not disappoint. The rooms were large for European standards complete with a foyer, bathroom with separate tub and shower (with the rain-shower head), a large bedroom area and a walk-in closet bigger than the bathroom (you could easily sleep 2 kids or small adults in the closet). The entire place just smelled nice -- if you ever wondered what angel's tears smelled like it would probably be the scent in the halls (but less in the bedrooms) of the El Palace. We had accidentally left our guidebook on the plane and so went directly to the concierge and asked what there was to do around town. Every person we spoke to at the concierge desk (there were a few that rotated depending on time of day) spoke perfect English and were extremely helpful and patient with us. We had the buffet breakfast every day in the hotel which was situated in an outdoorish (part was actually open air and part had a semi-permanent canopy over top. The brunch was great and had alot of diversity with Spanish staples like sausages as well as an interesting Asian dim sum area. There was a club downstairs that we unfortunately never made it to as well as a spa in the hotel that we also never made it to. The Michelin Starred restaurant in the building looked great but had a lot of fois gras dishes which due to a strange twist in fate is the only food I'm actually allergic to so we did not try that either. Most people there were older than us (we're late 20s) and there were some kids ranging from around 5 up to teenage years. I got the impression we were there outside of tourist season (early October) and so the hotel wasn't packed. The entire time we wore Tshirts and jeans and not once did we get a disapproving look from the staff -- everyone was super friendly and most spoke at least English and Catalan if not Spanish and other languages as well (we heard German, French, and Mandarin from the guests in addition to English and Spanish). If you're looking for a beautiful hotel that clearly says 'old world charm' with a fantastic staff and a laid back but clearly 'expensive' vibe this is a great place. If you're looking for a trendy hotel right in the middle of the 'beautiful people' this is probably not the place for you.

You must request a login from the front desk and it's good for only 1 hour per day. I've read that the hotel offers shuttle service to the airport and cruise terminal, but neither of these proved true. Still, the hotel was great and in a great location. We were two blocks from Las Ramblas and did lots of walking! There are also two metro stops within walking distance of the hotel, making it easy to navigate the city. An added bonus is that we arrived in Barcelona at 8:30am and were relieved to find that our room was ready and available for a nap after a long international flight. However this spoiled us because after our cruise returned to Barcelona we were expecting the same grace but found that the hotel was completely booked (9 cruises were coming and going that day) and had to wait from 8am until 2pm to get our room).", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cNice\u201d", "Author": "AnaBt", "ReviewID": "UR117145856", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel at the beggining of the year and it was very good.

The initial reception was a bit cool, as there was discrepancy over the date we were to check out.

No big deal, but certainly not an embrace of \"the customer is always right\" philosophy. After that shaky start all was wonderful. Javier showed us to our lovely room on the fourth floor and explained the workings of the room and its features with wit and grace, and he had a cheery greeting whenever we saw him during our stay. Room furnishings and the bath were not \"showy\" but definitely of a 5 star calibre. Can't imagine that the minor rumbling of the metro beneath the hotel could annoy anyone but the most finicky traveller. For us it was a non-issue. Hallways are wide and bright. The lobby is magnificent as is the breakfast terrace (although breakfast prices seem unreasonably high.) There is a bar at the rear of the lobby, but it is very quiet, and there is actually only table seating.....no bar stools. The place to go for more action is the scotch bar, down a staircase from the lobby. This relatively small room features a proper bar, 2 attentive and amusing bartenders, and live entertainment in the evenings until 2 a.m. Even the size of the pours seems more generous than the usually stingy European style. HIghly recommend a visit or two downstairs. The hotel is in a lovely residential neighborhood that's an easy morning stroll to several breakfast options, as well as restaurants for lunch and dinner. The major sites and shopping are also walkable or an easy cab ride. (Concierge service is great. There seemed always to be at least 3 or 4 on duty, and they arranged for a perfect private walking tour our first day in town.)

This hotel did not disappoint!!! We had an early flight into Barcelona and as soon as we arrived at the hotel, the staff advised that they had held a room for us so we could get comfortable right away. Both of us I were blown away by the staff and attention to detail at this hotel. Nothing was overlooked. When I inquired at 10 p.m., before leaving for dinner, if we could possibly get additional pillows for our room the next day, the gentlemen immediately informed me that the pillows would be in our room upon our return that evening. His response was \"we are a 24 hour hotel, just let us know what and when you need something and we'll take care of it\". Impressive! The room was a very nice size, not huge but definitely big enough for two. The bed was super comfortable and the room was extremely clean. Our room was cleaned every day and turned down even if we left twice in one evening. They didn't miss a detail! Our room at the front of the hotel on the third floor overlooked the lovely boulevard and statue. The bath was beyond huge and was separated by a hallway with another door for extreme privacy. We could practically swim in the mosaic tub. We felt as if we had checked into a beautiful spa when going into the bath. The huge glassed in shower is separate from the tub and has a waterfall shower head directly from the ceiling. Felt so great, we never wanted to leave the bath!! From the third floor I have to admit you can hear and feel the rumble of the subway. It never bothered my boyfriend but it took me a day to get used to it. If you are bothered by noise and some light shaking, this aspect will annoy you. Also, the breakfast is very expensive. We had a continental breakfast included with our room. I ordered cereal and fresh fruit once and it was $22 Ouch! But there are option! One morning I walked across the street to the market picked up some fresh fruit and yogurt for about 3 Euro. There are many little restaurants close to the hotel so that is also a great option. I definitely would not let this aspect deter you as there are tons of options for breakfast and the hotel is just too fantastic to let those little issue scare you away. Also, buy bottles of water from the market across the street. To exchange money, there is also a bank directly across the street. Bring your passport! I did want to eat in their beautiful restaurant downstairs but couldn't justify the prices of an additional $20 per person or $40 per day. Perhaps if we stayed a week, we would have experienced it but there was just so much to do and see! Barcelona is a vibrant, exciting city with so much to do during the day and a place where the city really gets going around 9 or 10 p.m. for dinner. We loved this aspect of the city. You don't have to eat late but it is definitely part of the fun and part of the overall experience of Barcelona. We never had a bad experience. The architecture, art, food and people were everything that we had hoped for and more! We would leave for dinner at 10 p.m. and stroll through the streets. We would finish up around Midnight or 1 a.m. and would walk back to the El Palace. We never felt any fear. Of course, it is always good to be aware of your surroundings and not pull wads of cash out in public. Tthere are pickpockets, as everywhere, but if you exercise good judgement and keep your valuables in front pockets and purses in front of you and walk with confidence there won't be any problems. Also, ladies, don't hang your purse on the back of your chair especially in outdoor cafes. The hotel is in a fantastic location with easy walking access to everything. Places not to miss! Sagrada Fam\u00edlia - Make sure you go inside ... Incredible!!! Casa Mil\u00e0 (don't miss the roof terrace). You might want to take the elevator as it is about 12 flights and pretty exhausting. Anything and everything Gaudi. Las Ramblas - Experience it both day and night - Completely difference experiences.. During the day a must see is Mercat de Boqueria, this is the most amazing marketplace ever! Sights, sounds, colors & smells - Beautiful!! Walk all the way to the end of Las Ramblas, you won't be disappointed. Eat tapas late at night, one recommendation is Divinus which is about 4 to 5 long blocks from the hotel. Yummy! We also ate at 4 Cats which we also loved. I believe it is located in the Gothic district another area of Barcelona which is terrific to explore! Narrow alleys filled with shops, tapa bars, cava bars and apartments. You'll have to ask the hotel for the location of 4 Cats, it is pretty tough to find located in a narrow little alleyway but well worth the experience to find it! Too much to see in just three and a half days! Day Three, we took a day trip to Montserrat for Cava tasting and a vist to the Basilica. It was above and beyond and worth the hour trip each way The Benedictine Monk retreat and Basilica is spectacular with amazing views of Catalunya. After visiting the Basilica take the cable car to the top of the mountain to experience magnificent views of the very unusual rock formations and breathtaking views from every direction. You will be blown away by the views. Wear good walking shoes and take time to explore!! We can't wait to return to Barcelona and we will definitely be back to El Palace Hotel where we received a warm, warm welcome every time we walked in the door! We belong to Leading Hotels of the World and received some very nice perks such as free Continental breakfast, early check-in and free in-room Internet.

Boy, were we disappointed. The check-in process was the poorest service we received after staying at several wonderful and welcoming hotels in Spain (including the Westin Palace in Madrid, the AlmaSevilla and the Hotel Alhambra Palace). The male receptionist was downright obnoxious and impolite. Also, when I asked for a room on a higher floor to avoid the rumble of the subway, he sneered at me and said that he was not aware of any noise or vibration and that the 2nd floor would be fine for our Junior Suite (this conversation took place while several trains shook the reception area). Well, he was of course very very wrong, the vibration at this hotel is quite intense throughout the property and we were moved to the 5th floor later that evening, but it was still about the same. We also had to wait over an hour for our bags to be brought up to our room after check-in. The bellhop seemed very out of sorts when he finally arrived and told us he was too busy. (understaffed property??) Also, none of the check-in staff told us about ANY of the amenities of the hotel. I had to make a point of stopping by the concierge desk and asked them directly, something all our other hotels always make a point of doing (isn't that part of good service??). In addition, when I called housekeeping and the front desk for service in our room, the phone just rang and rang. No one picked up at housekeeping and the front desk didn't answer until after about 15 rings. Deeply frustrated with paying more than $600 a night for terrible service, I went down to the front desk and complained. They listened while I spoke, but were still generally unhelpful and unwelcoming. While the room was clean, the size was no where near what we expect from a Junior Suite, just the size of a regular guest room. Also, the sheets were not of good quality and so filled with pilled areas that it rubbed against my legs and disturbed my sleep (that is when I finally did fall asleep from the metro noise and vibration). The best part of the room was the bathroom which was spacious. They have a \"pillow menu\" which is a joke since they don't really provide any special pillows at all. One other point worth mentioning, the key they provide is a regular key with very large key fob tassle which you much drop off everytime you leave the hotel. So, when you return, you have to stop by the concierge to pick it up. This presents two problems: 1) If they are helping someone, you will have to wait quite a long time while until they are finished, 2) they never ask for any identification which made me feel uneasy and questioned their security since at times it was a new concierge who had not seen us before. There were other issues with the restaurant and concierge service too (ex. no reservation as promised when we showed up at a restaurant) but I don't want to make this review any longer than it already is! We would never stay at the property again. It was a complete dissapointment and overpriced. Be forewarned if you choose it, you will not have a restful satisfying stay.

Since we had arranged to stay in a \"hip\" hotel in Madrid, we opted for a traditional, old-school hotel in Barcelona. There is something to be said for traditional and old-school service that you just do not get in any of these younger, hip hotels! The hotel was renovated about a year or two ago, and it is very elegant, opulent and beautiful. The service is, in one word: impeccable. The staff was definitely formal and ready to serve at a moment's notice, but there was always an underlying friendliness and warmth - in other words, I never felt them to be \"snooty\". We are part of the leaders club, so we were given an upgrade to a junior suite. We stayed in room 329. There was no view, but the room was located in a corner of the hotel (not sure if it was side or rear of hotel) and was very, very quiet. It was quite generous in size, and the bathroom was separated into two separate rooms. One room held the commode, with a large and spacious vanity area; the other room was another large vanity area with two sinks, and a large shower with wonderful hot-hot-hot water and terrific water pressure. The towels were fluffy, and they provided slippers and robes. To give an example of the impeccable service, I requested an iron and ironing board to touch up some clothing. I was told it would arrive in \"one minute\". In what seemed like 45 seconds, they were knocking at the door. I didn't stand there with a timer or anything, and cannot promise you it was less than one minute, but for sure I can tell you that the iron and ironing board arrived in less than 2 minutes! The same thing happened when I asked for a bucket of ice. Unfortunately, my husband and I were both taken ill on our last day in Barcelona. A few hours later, when we were not feeling better, we asked the concierge to send a doctor. Again, with impeccable service, the doctor was knocking on our door in less than 15 minutes. He prescribed medication, and within a few hours were on our way to recovery and were able to travel to London the next day as scheduled. The staff couldn't have been nicer - they didn't bother us while we were sick, and upon checkout inquired if we were feeling better, and expressed how sorry they were that we missed our last day of site seeing in Barcelona. The hotel is in a great location. It's walking distance, but away from the noise and craziness of Las Ramblas and the Boqueria. It is also walking distance from Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera. It is a cab ride away from Park Guell, which I highly recommend. I thought it would be \"just a park\", but it is so special and amazing! Park Guell is located on a hilltop, and even though I am a person that likes to walk, I opted for a cab as it was a warm day out. It is a long walk to get to the beach, but if you are a walker and if you are out and about exploring, then you will not find it to be that far. If you don't like to walk that much, then it is probably a quick cab ride to the beach.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel with great service and location\u201d", "Author": "yakinamac", "ReviewID": "UR112284645", "Content": "We stayed in a deluxe double room at El Palace for four nights, and had a wonderful time.

The building, location and interior are fantastic. This was the former Ritz but apparently lost its Ritz status about 8 years ago, according to hotel staff. We had requested an upper floor. Upon check-in they upgraded us to a junior suite. The room was newly rennovated and fanstastic. Style, service and the rest was great. It is near the Passeig de Gracia street and metro stop so it is very convenient but out of the circus of La Rambla, etc. The issues we had are that the hotel is still trying to be the Ritz with its drink prices, etc. Mini bar items were between 5 and 15 euros. A chocolate bar was 15 euros. A beer in the bar was 8 euros. Just a bit out of touch for what it was. Second, the lights flickered on an off the first day we were there but stopped doing that for the rest of the stay. The shower pressure and temparture were horrible. It would go from normal to almost off then hot to cold every few seconds. Not in keeping with the beautiful rennovation on this bathroom. The biggest issue, and likely the cause of the loss of the Ritz name, is that the metro runs under the building. Many said it is not a big deal. We were on the top floor and could still hear/feel it. It felt like a mini earthquake every 15 minutes. I asked the reception about it and at first he said he didn't know what I was talking about then said it was the metro but it stopped at midnight. It does NOT stop at midnight. We heard/felt it all night long. Reception said it affects every room. Finally, watch the pickpockets, purse thieves and the (dishonest) cab drivers in Barcelona. They are everywhere. We saw a nicely dressed guy in a nice restaurant try to snatch a girls purse. When we were checking in one of the guest had been pickpockted on La Rambla. Two and perhaps 3 cab drivers tried to rip us off. One took us for a long ride and then dumped us at what he said was our stop. I got out and told him I would pay him once I verified. When he realized I had got him he sped away without us paying but leaving us stranded in a strange neighborhood.

Enormous tub, separate walk in shower, large enough for four people with two overhead showerheads and two hand held shower nozzles, L'Occitane bath products, loofah sponges, thick towels, bathrobes, slippers - the works. And a good size toilet area within the bathroom but containing a heavy high quality door for privacy. Could not have asked for anything else. Reading lights everywhere and accessible. Motion detector light that went on and off in case you had to use the bathroom at night. Large screen tv with a swivel. We had a back room so it was also very quiet.

The price was reasonable and the location looked great so it wasn't a hard decision. So with great expectations, we walked from the train to the hotel. (Easy to find, short walk) Would this be a hotel like the Grand Plaza in Rome ? (In that hotel we recieved fantastic service simply by smiling and being polite to all of the staff - I know a lot of people has another experience) But this was even better. Smaller, but in every other way better. We did anyway smile to everyone and got lots in return. We almost felt like a part of a big family after a few days. Well, some facts now. A room of proper size, not big, but big enough. French balcony and a big luxurious bath. No noise from the street outside. The location was, as expected perfect. We used our legs almost all the time. Almost everything was within walking distance, from La Rambla to La Sagrada Familia. So why just almost perfect ? Well....I have a back which due to a small injury needs a medium to soft matress, and when it is as hard as they were at El Palace I can't sleep more than a couple of hours before it hurts. Knowing how to deal with my back I asked for an extra thin matress on the top. The concierge said that this was no problem, but when the maid came (Probably the head-maid, she was the archtype of a spanish grandmother :) she said that it was not possible to do this. I tried to tell her that it was just to.......but got just No-No-No in return. Hard luck... I didn't want this to ruin an in every other way perfect week, so I tried to ignore it, and after three more nights I probably got used to it, and managed to sleep all night. Do we want to go back ?

Perhaps because January is not the busy tourist season for Barcelona, the rates were very reasonable for such a luxurious hotel. We paid 205 euros a night for a \"Classic Deluxe\" with a king bed. I just looked at the hotel's web site and it seems to be showing even cheaper rates for February. The room we stayed in was absolutely gorgeous, having been recently renovated. It had beautiful fabrics, carpet, and wall-coverings, and very good sound proofing. The hotel is on a corner, the intersection of two busy streets. We were on the fifth floor overlooking Carrer Roger de Lluria. All we had to do was close the window and the traffic noise was gone. The vintage building has been outfitted with steel framed, double-glazed windows that seal tightly and very effectively block the street noise. However, the best part of the room was the beautiful, spacious, completely redone bathroom. It had a tub, a separate walk-in shower, and a large countertop with two sinks. The toilet was in a separate compartment with a sliding frosted glass door. Compared to the usual cramped and inconvenient European bathrooms that I'm used to encountering, this place was superb. They even included a beautiful, live (not plastic!) orchid sitting on the countertop in the bathroom. The room was really more like what I usually find in a high-end American resort than in an urban hotel in Europe. I have stayed in rooms in Europe comparable to this one, but they typically cost two to three times as much as this. The staff of the hotel could not have been more gracious or accommodating. The reception desk personnel, concierge, and door man were all very welcoming and helpful. Guests have to deal with concierge frequently because your room key needs to be turned in to the concierge every time you leave the hotel. The rooms keys here are attached to a large fabric tassel that you don't want to carry in your pocket. I haven't encountered this for years in a big city in Europe, but here you leave your key with the desk when you step out of the hotel. The locks on the rooms seem to be some kind of fancy electronic system, but there aren't any of the usual plastic key cards. it all worked fine though and there was always someone at the concierge desk when you needed your key. The staff at breakfast in the Garden were also very pleasant and accommodating. Breakfast was pricey -- 28 euros -- but the elaborate buffet was great. There were hot scrambled eggs, lavish Spanish hams and cheeses, fresh-squeezed fruit juices, and a huge array of fresh pastries. The \"Garden\" is sort of a large tented space that is heated with propane heaters when it's chilly. It's a beautiful space with a glass wall at the end of it overlooking a small outdoor area with a fountain. We enjoyed the breakfast so much that we went every day during our stay, despite the cost. I noticed another posting that mentioned problems with the elevators. Both guest elevators were out of service at one point during our stay. The staff did a very good job of seeing that everyone was promptly escorted to a service elevator in a staff area of the hotel to go upstairs. It wasn't too much of problem for us, but for a traveler with mobility challenges, it could be a big problem. The service elevators are a long walk from the lobby and it's up a half flight of stairs and down a another half-flight to get there. It did appear that you could access the service elevators from a street entrance without having to negotiate any stairs, although we never did that. Interestingly, free WiFi was available in the lobby and using an ethernet connection in the room was also free. The front desk will provide you with an ethernet cord if you need one. However, WiFi in the room was only available at a stiff price. I was traveling with an iPad that can only use a WiFi connection, so I just succumbed and paid a ridiculous 40 euros for every 72 hours of WiFi service in the room. Unfortunately, this hotel's website, like most hotel websites, provides no useful details about internet service. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay and would absolutely stay here again.

The service was generally as one would expect, but if you've stayed at other top hotels in the world, especially in Asia, you'll notice it's very much of the European variety, i.e. efficient and courteous but without a sense of genuine warmth.

Prices are as you would expect in a five star European hotel, and we ate breakfast elsewhere most mornings. We found the location to be excellent. It's close to the centre of things and in an upmarket area of town, far enough away from the tourist hotspots. Comments by other reviewers are worth noting. The rumble from the metro line directly below is quite noticeable but didn't bother us too much. Yes, our shower also ran hot and cold, and we found that the bath water wasn't especially hot (this improved after we mentioned it to them). Pillows are strange, as the standard issue appears to be a kind of lumpy bolster - not what you'd expect in a five star. There is a 'pillow menu', which we asked for and managed to obtain soft down and feather ones. But this menu was nowhere apparent in our room - odd if you make a point of having such a thing.

The second night, the concierge recommended a restaurant called Windsor, which was a taxi ride (we could have walked, but it's a longer walk). The food was excellent - and they were very helpful about modifying the items for kids' palates (our kids eat fairly adventurously, but things like ensuring fries as the side went over very well!). We ate lunch in the hotel restaurant one day - I wouldn't recommend this. The food was good, but it was rather expensive and I think we would have done just as well to explore on our own.

I had read that the hotel had just completed a renovation, which is what I always look for in hotels (new always trumps worn). What I didn't realize is that El Palace used to be the Ritz, so the renovation went all out luxury. Before I describe the room, etc., I should say that this hotel is extremely well situated, just a few blocks from the Gaudi buildings and the Passeig de Gracia. You can easily walk to everything from here. For no reason at all, we were upgraded to a junior suite, which was one of the most spectacular rooms we have stayed in. The king-sized bed had the requisite fine crisp sheets, ample pillows, and super comfortable mattress. The room was large enough to have a love seat, coffee table, and two chairs for relaxing in. Blackout silk drapes assured total darkness over large soundproof windows (that opened!), but the most sophisticated lighting system I have seen in a hotel room assured plenty of light at night. The suite had a huge closet/cloakroom with a full length mirror and tons of storage. The limestone clad bathroom was so spacious and perfectly clean and new, I could have lived in it. Two sinks, a jacuzzi tub, toilet in its own stall, and a huge shower, with double rain-head showers, a long bench and two handheld showers created all this comfort. What luxury! In the morning, the breakfast was delicious (as it was all over Spain). However, I have to give special kudos to the pastry chef. I am a food writer specializing in bread, and had some of the best chocolate croissants I have ever eaten. Also, the bread in Spain tends toward mediocrity (why?), so I was delighted to finally get some delicious crispy, very fresh, whole wheat rolls. The buffet was served in the garden room, with a full array of juices, cured meats and fish, fruit, hot beverages, English breakfast items like baked beans, eggs, and sausages, and of course that incredible bakery. Completing this experience was of course a very professional and competent staff. Did I say that our room was under 250 euro?

We stayed in a number of 5-star hotels on our trip, and Barcelona\u2019s El Palace was undoubtedly the best. We were traveling with a child, and we were driving so we had a a car which can be quite a problem in Barcelona. From the moment we pulled in front of El Palace, the hotel staff took care of us every step of the way! Instead of having us deal with messy narrow underground parking in Barcelona, they parked the car for us every time, and took it out on moments notice. The moment they noticed we\u2019re with a small child (4 year old) they upgraded us to a junior suite. Room was wonderful \u2013 quiet and spacious, clean and modern, with jet bath and rain shower, and with an extra bed set up for our boy. Waiting for us was complimentary Cava (Spanish bubbly), and each day on our return to the room we found chocolates which only made every day even better! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful on every step, including making friends with our kid. And lastly, restaurant and scotch bar are hard to beat. You may have heard that in Barcelona you should stay on La Rambla. Take my advice \u2013 do NOT stay there! It is one huge tourist trap, with bad and overprices restaurants, and really nothing you should see... ever. You should explore Barri Gotic and Born areas (which BTW, has some of the best restaurants), and Ports, but stay away from La Rambla. El Palace is located on large street, so easy to find, but a few blocks detached from over-touristy and over-crowded La Rambla. You\u2019re only two blocks (5 mins on foot) away from Plaza Catalunia and from entrance into Passeig de Gracia, which has both attractions (Gaudi\u2019s houses), great restaurants, and great shopping. Metro station is very close to hotel, so you\u2019re also close to wherever else you want to get to. Even better, taxis in Barcelona are dirt cheap and getting from and to El Palace is trivial, and you won\u2019t have to suffer and pay for stop\u2019n\u2019go crawling through La Rambla.

I took him up on his offer and I was not disappointed. My room, a standard one, was far superior to many an executive room or junior suite that I have had in other hotels. The Plasma TV was cleverly concealed in an elegant Gilt edged mirror and the oversized bathroom had a superb sunken bath, in keeping with the style of the original hotel (The Palace started life as the Ritz, one of only 4 worldwide opened by Cesar Ritz). Breakfast was in a beautiful garden room and the choice of hot and cold buffet was excellent. Staff were both extremely friendly and professional, without being pretentious. The Hotel is in it's \"soft opening\" phase, so renovations are still being carried out. By year end there will be a new Spa (guests currently are offered use of a nearby health club at reduced rates) and there are plans to install a large indoor pool in the basement ballroom, along the lines of that of the Ritz, Paris (considered to be the largest and best indoor Hotel pool in the world). Once renovations are complete, I can honestly say that El Palace will undoubtedly become the Number 1 hotel in Barcelona.

We choose this hotel based from its 5 star rating and its location which is very near to Plaza Catalunya. Although there are other 5 star hotels which is in that area ie Le Meridian & Hotel Majestic - we didn't like both the hotel's room deco (based from hotel pics) and it is slightly more expensive that this Palace Hotel and so we decided to book this hotel. We got a good rate from the hotel's website [-] at the rate of euro190 & euro170 for 2 nite Compared with both hotels (we did check out both of them) we love Palace Hotel much better. The deco of the hotel's lobby & restaurant are so exquisite. Here's the details:- ROOM The room is really huge for a standard room - about 38m2. Which far bigger than the other 5 star hotels. As soon as you enter, there are a hallway that leads to the bathroom on the right and the bedroom straight ahead. Very comfortable King bed with 2 comfortable wide pillows and 2 square pillows. 2 sofa and a coffee table in front of the main windows. Flat tv and a walking closet!! we certainly didn't expect that at all - although the deco is a bit simple, it should have more of flowers and some more furniture since the room is huge. The furniture in the bedroom are sheer exquisite antiques, which you rarely find in other modern hotels these days. However, lack of sound proof actually lets us down - we can actually hear footsteps from the room upstairs. Luckily, they (guest on the room upstairs) check outs after the 1st nite so we were lucky. I think because of the age of the buiding (which is built in 1919) they needs to improve the sound proofing and the reception did explain to us that they are planning to do the renovation to improve the problem - starting nxt July 07. Yes, the carpeting and the bathroom is a bit outdated but it did nothing to prevent us from having a good time. Contrast from previous review -- we did not have any problem with the shower. It was overall good. LOCATION The hotel is sitiuated in the corner lot, in front of the main road Gran Via which can be bit noisy with lack of sound proof Main attractions - Plaza Catalunya and La Ramblas is just 10 minutes walk , about 2 blocks away. We always had a nice walk from and to the hotel, as the area is very well cared for with lots of shops. It was great to stay away from the hotel in La ramblas area as it can be quite busy sometime and more area to walk and explore. Take the Touristic bus which has stop at the Plaza catalunya - it is essential in Barcelona as the city is really huge. Passage De Gracia - main street for shopping is just 10 mins walk STAFF & SERVICE I would give 10/10 to the service given by their staff. They are absolutely fantastic. When we arrived at the hotel, the bell boy - Louis showed us tour of the hotel - the restaurants and everything you need to know about the guest room BREAKFAST I would say the Diana restaurant which is the breakfast room is an absolute stunner - it felt like having a breakfast in a park! The rate didn't include breakfast but we decided to check out the breakfast - it was a bit pricey at 21 euro per person but worth it. There are lots of choices to choose from - 2 types 0f spanish omelletes, scrambled eggs, baked beans, sausages, choices of breads, fruits, cereals and even a special breakfast area especially for diabetic Although we had a great time but I think we would't stay again at this hotel, just simply because lack of the sound proof but we might check it out after they had finished their renovation.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Unfriendly, Inhospitable Front Desk\u201d", "Author": "cubsfan73", "ReviewID": "UR6534598", "Content": "My wife and I travelled to Barcelona to stay at the Ritz at the end of November.

The rooms have a lot of great character that one would expect from a grand old hotel. The bad: While the doorman and bellhops were friendly, the front desk was not as hospitable. They were unfriendly and rude during check in. And at check out, after having spend 5 nights, they insisted that someone made a call from our room and we would have to pay for it. We proved to the mean lady at the front that we were at the Palau Nacional (beautiful venue) at the time of the call and clearly one of the maids/hotel workers had made the call from our room during turn-down service. After having spend 5 nights, she was insistent on the 3 euro charge and was very rude. One experience like this can lend a bad taste to an entire vacation.

The building is a typical turn of the century hotel in a style you would await in a palace. the ground floor rooms are magnificent in a vaguely french style as in all ritz hotels and well maintained.

We had booked the standard deluxe room and it was spotlessly clean, full of antique furniture, a huge huge bed (very very comfortable), robes, slippers etc. The blackout linings at the window were excellent and we heard very little noise - it certainly did not disturb our sleep. Breakfast was excellent - every choice you could think of and omelettes and eggs made to order. The Hall Bar service was excellent. I would certainly return - because of the wonderfully central location and the facilities offered. The room service was the quickest room service I have experienced.

We contacted the hotel directly and were informed that renovation would be starting the month after we would be here. I saw on Trip Advisor that some of the rooms had been renovated, but not all of them. We were assured that we would be well taken care of and decided to stick with our reservation. Upon our arrival at the hotel, we were informed that we had been upgraded to a mini suite and it was beautiful and spacious. The bed was larger than king size and was entered through double doors off the living room. There was a walk-in closet with separate hanging areas for my husband and myself - all paneled in a beautiful cognac colored wood stain. The bathroom was extremely large with double sinks - a separate glassed in area for the toilet and bidet, and then a large tub and separate shower at the end of the room. The shower had several different spray heads aimed at various areas of one's anatomy which was great. We thought the staff was cordial, courteous and personable. Our only regret was the fact that they were having a wedding reception the night of our arrival and so the main public room was closed off to the hotel guests - but was open the next morning. We believe it's always a good idea to communicate with your hotels before arrival and have had excellent service and attention when we have done this. We did hear from other guests that their rooms were not renovated yet, but were large and spacious. I would add that my husband and I both had massages while we were there and they were two of the best we've ever had! The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate and we were delighted with the choices as well as the service. The setting was elegant and beautiful.

I E-mailed them in November with my concerns about the renovation and the complaints registered here. I received a prompt E-Mail back, stating that the renovation would not start until later in '06 and we would be assured of a room in fine condition. We paid 190 Euros/nt for the identical room we had on the sixth floor two years ago. It was great; good bedding, high-quality linens, bathrobes and slippers, nice toiletries, a gift of chocolates and Spanish wine in the room. Everything was exceptionally clean. Yes, there were some \"dings\" on the chair by the desk, and a couple of very minor spots on the carpeting. Planning to write a review here upon our return, I specifically looked for the issues that were noted in previous reviews. But for the most part, there is very little to criticize. The service remains exemplary. The doorman, David (from Pennsylvania) is a gem... very helpful with directions, recommendations, and a taxi when we needed one. Both he and the concierege staff remembered us and gave us a warm welcome. The concierge staff are great... they provided wonderful restaurant recommendations. The location, for us, is ideal... several great tapas places within a few blocks, 4 blocks from Plaza Catalunya and the top of Las Ramblas. With the windows closed, no street noise to be heard at all. The only thing you have to be careful about is that the taxi drivers still know the hotel as \"the Ritz\", not \"the Palace\". There are several hotels in BCN with \"palace\" as part of the name, and we were taken to several of them by mistake. You have to give the driver the name AND street address.... get the hotel's card when you arrive, and provide it to any taxi driver you use. Is it the Four Seasons in Istanbul, the Grand Bretagne in Athens, or the Grand Hotel in Stockholm? No, it is showing a bit of wear. It needs some TLC to restore its former luster.
