So in July of 2012 I decided to stay there for 2 nights with my 3 daughters and my Grandson. To sum up my weekend getaway.. the room was very dirty I mean VERY DIRTY.. food under the bed, hairs left on the bathroom floor and spots and stains everywhere, including the sheets and towels!! The AC worked 50% of the time we were there. I only complained once about the AC and supposedly someone came up and fixed it. Like I said, it worked 50% of the time. The staff was extremely rude so my daughters and I decided not to complain about anything to them (other than the AC not working). I noticed on the 2nd day we were ther my poor 2 yr old g-son broke out in a rash?? I wouldnt be surprised if there were BED bugs in the room. The pool was very very small for such a big Hotel! As I mentioned this is a place Ive always wanted to stay and was EXTREMELY disappointed with my overall experience!! The restaurant was over priced and the food sucked. Oh, Did I mention I paid almost $600 for 2 nights for this dump??? If you are all wondering why I didnt complain is because I would rather get on every site there is to give this hotel a BAD reveiw and thats how I will get my satisfaction! If they gave me a free room for a week I WOULD TURN IT DOWN!! DIRY FILTHY DUMP IS ALL THE DUNES MAOR IS!! Beware folks, the pics are deceiving!

We stayed for 3 nights at the Dunes Manor Hotel and were, for the most part, pleased with our stay. We arrived at 3:30pm and our room was ready. However, we did not feel welcomed by the rather curt woman behind the desk. She is in hospitality but it did not feel like it. Our room was plenty large for our family, including a pack n play for the baby. The TV could use some updating, the fridge was ice cold (literally, it froze our fruit), the coverlets were typical cheesy hotel type, and the lighting was adequate. The bathroom was clean, the towels fairly soft, and the vanity area was a bit on the small side. It was outside the bathroom across from a fridge, microwave and small coffee maker. The balcony was nice with white resin chairs and table. Some of the staff was very nice and accommodating. My husband was very miffed when given an attitude by a staff person that he asked about where to buy milk for the baby. Overall, the hotel was fine. It was located just at the end of the boardwalk. It was a healthy walk to the other end. We liked that it was quiet. It is across the street from Jolly Roger Amusement park/mini golf. Around the corner from the Fractured Prune for the most delicious donuts ever. 2 Blocks from Happy Jack for yummy pancake breakfast. Pool was kind of small and was indoor/outdoor. They closed it at first rumble of thunder so we didn't get too much time in--water was freezing. Great beachside bar with nice bartenders. We were there during a big thunderstorm and were stuck in the room with my sleeping baby. Housekeeping called to see if we needed anything and said they'd be there at 4:30 to make up the room. The housekeeper was very nice and indeed, came back to make up the room. We would probably stay there again--just will probably wait until kids get a little older to go back to Ocean City.

Unfortunately, things have changed since the original owner has passed on. She was a lovely woman who wanted every detail tended to. She would even greet guests during the daily Tea Time. Well, now she must be rolling over in her grave. Our last stay there was summer 2011 and was a huge disappointment. Room was not clean and in desperate need of repairs in the shower and bathroom. Room looked dingey as did other areas of the hotel. Furiture looked old and dingey. People who are giving it good reviews probably did not stay there in it's hay day. It used to be so much nicer and the staff used to be wonderful. The staff last summer was either rude or appeared uninterested in their jobs. I had a friend who also stayed there last summer and she agreed that the hotel is definitely in need of a good cleaning and new management. She had also stayed there when the owner was alive and agreed that things have really been let go. What a shame! I used to really love going there. Won't go back since I like a clean room. The location is great, the back porch is wonderful, but the rest is deteriorating. Managment, wake up! Bring this wonderful hotel back to it's original grandeur! Shame on you for ruining the original owner's dream. She wanted that hotel to represent the finest of everything. She wanted guests to be treated like guests. We had to leave our visit early due to an impending hurricane. We were not even notified that the hotel was asking people to vacate because of the storm. We found out this information quite by accident from another guest. The front desk insisted that they left us a voicemail, and treated me very rudely when I politely told them that there was no voicemail on my phone. They were not the least bit helpful and made me feel as though I was bothering them. I won't stay there again.

Sure, there are plenty of vending machines that claim they sell water, but they were all sold out, several ate my money, and when I went to the front desk to complain, she refunded my money (after I completed a form) and suggested I either enjoy the tiny cups of ice water available in the lobby OR walk to the 7-11 several blocks away and buy my own. It's summer and I'm pregnant, which means I drink about 80+ ounces of water EACH DAY, and refilling my 6 ounce cup in the lobby was not going to cut it.

Most acceptable hotels or motels are fully booked therefore getting a room a day before arrival is such a gift. There was nothing that surprised me @Dunes.

It felt like going to grandma's home. OLD edifice that would surely benefit updating. But, it was definitely clean. Walls have been repainted and our room and other public areas were well sanitized. With that said, I really think the management should think about renovating the building, updating in-room amenities (not that we cared for it since we were at the beach most of the time). Our likes: 1. It's situated 2 blocks off the starting point of the boardwalk. If you want peace & quiet, this would be a plus. 2. Their main dining room \"The Victorian Room by the Sea\" serves good breakfasts (lump crabmeat omelet, yum!) and reminds me of \"Somewhere in Time\" for those of you old enough to remember Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymore :) 3. The deck is a good place to hang out if you don't want to be on the sand. Our dislikes: 1. Again, although it was clean, it really needs a major renovation. 2. DH, noted that since it wasn't on the boardwalk beachcombers didn't pass through everyday. The sand would have benefitted from it. 3. The least expensive food outlets for a quick bite i.e. fish tacos, coffee outlets, etc. where located mid-boardwalk so you either had to walk or take the tram ($3/each way) to get to those.

My one complaint was that we showed up at noon and were told that check-in was at 3pm. The woman at the front desk knew that we had an infant with us and said that they would try to get us into the room early, and would call us when the room was ready. We sat out on the balcony overlooking the ocean and had some lunch. We received no call from the desk, so we went in and sat in a sitting area across from the check-in (around 2pm). Knowing that we had a restless baby you would think that they would do something to expedite the room for us. Nope. They called us over AFTER 3pm and told us that the room was finally ready.

I haven't stayed there in about 7 years, but I remembered the wonderful view of the ocean and a nice afternoon tea. The view and the tea were my main reasons for visiting the beach in winter. An old friend went with me and we got the connecting rooms we'd requested. I'd done the reserving on line for both rooms, but forgot to bring the credit card I'd used for this. It meant front desk had to cancel out both room reservations and start over with a new card. The attendant at the front desk could not have been nicer about the extra work. I found almost everyone we dealt with to be extremely friendly and helpful. I must say the furniture, tv and bedding were a little dated, but matress wasn't bad and everything was clean (except the elevator tracts!....why is this always overlooked in 90% of the hotels I've stayed in ?- a pet peeve from my days as a facilities manager) . We had drinks at the little lounge along with delicious steamed shrimp that were $5.99 in the bar during happy hour. The same shrimp were on dinner menu for over $9 so it was a good deal. (Only get about 6 or 7 shrimp but they were big, cooked perfectly with old bay, and already devained ). My friend doesn't travel much and on two occasions had the deadbolt lock on her front door, came into my room throught the connecting doors, closing hers behind her and it lock from inside her room. This meant maintenance had to come 2x to work on getting her back into her room. Both times they were really nice and friendly.Food was the problem. Menu was typical hotel fare and overpriced. Afternoon Tea was a big disappointment. The tea itself is served from an urn. No choice in flavors and only lukewarm. The only non friendly person I ran into was standing by a tray of very stale cookies with a pair of tongs and a frown on her face, placing the cookies you chose on your plate. They were unedible. There was a small dish with cold crumpets that were cut into quarters and a bowl of cold margarine as well as a bowl of decent orange marmalade. It was kind of pitiful and embarrassing.

Overall, I believe this is a hotel well past its prime, and the decor, staff, and majority of the guests reflect that. Obviously this is the off season for Ocean City, so keep that in mind. Common areas: The hotel has a lounge area with a piano. Some nights a woman does play piano there - and at least during the holidays, expect the sofas and chairs to be full of older folks singing Christmas carols. There is \"Zippy's Lounge,\" which is a small bar on the beach side of the lounge. The bartenders are friendly enough and have a very \"heavy hand.\" The prices are also outstanding, especially during happy hour. Zippy's was the only high point of the visit for me. The hotel restaraunt is old, and the menu selections are standard hotel fare. None of the meals were particularly appetizing, although the bacon is a highlight at breakfast. The service is the killer, however. We ate three meals during our stay; during two of them, wait staff spilled food on us. The staff appeared dirty and smelled like cigarettes as well. Not appetizing. Rooms: Outdated, in desperate need of renovation. The mattresses were old and creaky, and the TVs are old LCD types. The paint is faded and peeling, and the bathrooms look like they haven't been renovated in 20 years. The towels and sheets also appear to be very old. They were clean, but worn and dingy looking. The high points: Bacon at breakfast. Stiff, cheap drinks at the bar. Free, ample parking. The location is right on the boardwalk and beach. Low points: Staff in restaraunt. Outdated rooms and common areas. Linens and towels.

For the best 8 years we take a long weekend just to enjoy each other mainly in the Fall and Winter. We stay on the top floor so I can watch the stars move across the sky. Actually, we try to go for the full moon. There is nothing like watching the full moon rise out of the ocean. It starts way out over the horizon as a flicker of gold. As you watch it slowly rise it makes a golden path right to the surf. The Dunes is the perfect place to watch the moon rise because every room is oceanfront. Sunrise is equally fantastic. You can watch it right from your bed! The staff are very helpful and accommodating from the reservationist to Kimberly at the front desk. Tea and crumpets are served daily at 3:00 and Thursday through Sunday there is a sing-a-long in the lobby. Enjoy the restaurant or Zippy's lounge. There is a pool and a nice jewelry shop as well. And of course if you want to take your family during the summer, the Dunes enjoys the best location. The boardwalk is steps away from the hotel and you can either take a tram or walk the 2.5 miles to the Inlet and enjoy Thrasher's French fries, Fisher's pop-corn, Love's lemonade, arcade games, shopping, and rides .

The beds are comfortable, and the air conditioning works great. The balcony is spacious and all of the balconies are ocean front which is great for viewing dolphins and the sunrise. The location is great, its only 1 block off of the boardwalk and is easily accessible through a parking lot or sand path. The tram car stop is at the end of the boardwalk too so you can either choose to walk or take the tram car. The Victorian Room restaurant has the best breakfast, the Manor Benedict and the Neptune Benedict are family favorites. We had dinner at the Victorian room one night and it was very good. Zippy's Bar and Lounge has a fabulous happy hour and do not forget to get free tea and crumpets in the afternoon. It is a great snack after the beach and before dinner and happy hour! Also right across the street is the Fractured Prune-- highly recommended donuts, they are wonderful. They have a few locations in MD and DE but we always stop when we are in town.

All the reviews on the Dunes were excellent, but of course we were skeptical as we had never stayed here. The main reasons we would recommend this hotel: 1. LOCATION: Beachfront with an oceanfront view from every room. And, the hotel is just one block North of the Boardwalk, meaning that it's close enough to get to the boardwalk, but not right on it. We traveled with a one-year-old, so we took the trolley down to the busy part of the boardwalk and walked it all the way back. 2. BEACHFRONT: balcony overlooking the beach was great 3. PARKING: on-site and plenty of it. We had a rooftop cargo carrier on our minivan, and had no problem parking under the covered-portion of the parking. There's also an outdoor lot right in front. 4. ROOMS: we traveled with a large pack-n-play for our one-year-old to sleep in and had no problem fitting it in a standard, double bed room. We wanted a suite/efficiency, but our last-minute booking made that impossible. Hopefully next year! Rooms were clean, beds were ok, and cleaning service very responsive. 5. Restaurant, Morning Coffee, and Music: We didn't really stay in the hotel and use their amenities, but the Dunes has a great ambience and family-friendly atmosphere. Something you won't find in the large, chain hotels. In summary, we were pleasantly surprised by the Dunes Hotel. I would pick this over the Motel, which is right next door.

While the hotel is not brand new, the room was clean and I had no complaints about that. It could, however, use some updating. The bed was fine for me, but I did notice when we left that the fitted sheet didn't quite fit the bed (as mentioned in another review).

There's also a restaurant (we had lunch there out on the porch, and it was really good) and several bars. The room was cleaned every day while we were out for breakfast...this was a very nice surprise, as we've stayed places where the room wasn't cleaned until after lunch or even later. The location is probably the best thing about this hotel. You are right off the end of the boardwalk, and lots of restaurants and other entertainment is close by.

My only other complaint would be the midnight fire alarm that went off and again at 9 in the morning. We all quickly evacuated down in our pjs but there was no direction from the staff. I didn't see anyone guiding guests or receive any explanation the next day as to what happened. Luckily it seemed to be a false alarm as the fire department let us back in after about 15 minuted out in the cold but the elevators were not turned back on so the 11 flight trek upstairs at 12:30am was not good.

I'm big on reading reviews & feel that you can get a good sense of where your staying or product your buying off others opinions. Keeping that in mind & remembering while reading them that they are just that...opinions! I look for the facts in the reviews or try to anyway. I found the reviews on the Dunes to be confusing. Where one person said it was the best sleep ever at a hotel, there was a conflicting review stating just the opposite. One person said the staff was super nice & another said they were rude. I'm not sure if all the rooms at the Dunes are identical or if they have a lot of staff changing but I can tell you what our room was like & what we experienced and I'll try to stick to the facts. We stayed on the 6th floor. It was small but decent. It was clean and there were no cracked floor tile or rocking toilets. A plus for me was their water was filtered so you could actually drink it :) A fidge, microwave & coffee maker were a plus too. You have to remember that most of these hotels in O.C. are extremely old & way over used so unless remodeled you should have too high of expectations. The bed for me may have been close to the worst ever though. The sheets were rough (about 175 TC) and didn't fit the bed. The blanket atop the sheets was about 100 years old & nasty. All I could think about as I tried to become comfortable in a strange bed was re-adjusting these slipping, used sheets in the middle of the night and what I would if I awoke to a matress under me. The mattress was average, not too hard or soft so I guess thats good and I didn't awake with any numb areas so that was good too. I found no holes in my sheets like another reviewer wrote about and trust me I looked...right away.. but my pillowcase was stained a bit (I flip it & tried to forget about it). The staff of the Dunes I didn't find over happy or rude, just average. The best part I guess was the pool. My boys thought that was the neatest thing for part of it was outside in the 20 degree temps & wind and the other half inside. Because of that it wasn't very warm and that could explain why the adults weren't getting in. I will say the older man that watches over the pool was very disturbing. He yelled at my younger son for splashing...yes splashing and getting a drop of water on his leg! The inside pool area is small and the area around the pool where you sit is small too so everyone is right up close to the pool. The man never smiled or seemed too thrilled to converse with anyone either which made you feel like an intruder so we didn't stay long. Unfortunately we never ate at the restaurant so I have no input...sorry. We did walk by as they had the afternoon tea & crimpets but we didn't join in. It seemed to be mostly older folks and with two small boys we just weren't comfortable. All in all not bad but didn't do enough for me to return. Met a couple there that said they've been going back for three years in a row during Christmas & love it there...I just don't see it or I missed something :) I would recommend this in the winter for $49 a night is awesome but the summer I would go elsewhere I think so for that I'm clicking on that I would recommend it.

To start, the Dunes Manor has a lot of good things going for it such as Milton's Outdoor dining, balconies with a view of the ocean, pool (even small), afternoon tea and cookies,and a great location two blocks from the boardwalk. However, the hotel needs a MAJOR facelift. The rooms need a lot of help. The room size is great, but the rooms are starting to get dumpy. Our bathroom had floor tiles that were cracked and looked dirty. The toilet moved from side to side when you sat on it and I found hairs all over the bathroom when we first checked in. Two of the pillowcases on our bed were stained and the bottom sheet on one of the beds had a giant hole. It took several calls to the front desk to get these problems resolved. We have loved this hotel in the past, but are thinking twice about ever returning. The hotel needs to update it's rooms before we return. I would definitely look around before booking this one.

We had trouble with our TV for two days, and the microwave oven didn't work. However, repairs were made on the third day, and the staff was courteous and attentive. The biggest appeal was that all rooms have ocean-front balconies overlooking the beach, which is kept in pristine condition by the city. It was a pleasure sitting on the balcony, just watching the waves come in, and the kites bouncing in the breeze. The biggest downside to the hotel is not enough elevators. There are two, and often, the doors opened to reveal that the elevator was packed with people. Getting an elevator sometimes took 5 to 10 minutes. If we were to return, we would request a room on the 3rd floor, so that we could use the stairs.

Quiet and relaxing hotel in a city full of hits and misses.\u201d", "Author": "snupdoug", "ReviewID": "UR74869297", "Content": "In my mind Ocean City has always had a bit of a reputation as a party beach, but The Dunes Manor Hotel is a quiet and relaxing retreat that keeps the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk and nightlife at bay, but still easily accessible. I stayed here with my family a couple times back in the late 90s/early 2000s. When we decided to return to Ocean City last year after almost a decade, we decided to try it out again based on our great experiences in the past. I'm happy to report that little has changed. Yes, the rooms are small and could use an update, but they are clean, comfortable, and more than adequate. All rooms are oceanfront with a nice private balcony. Look straight out and see people playing on the beach, boats going by, and occasionaly maybe even a few dolphins playing near the shore. Look to your right and you can check out what's going on down at the boardwalk which is just a block away. For you boardwalk fans, here's a tip: walk the one block to the beginning of the board walk and take a cheap tram ride all the way down to the other end (the busy end). Then take a nice long walk back, stopping at all the great shops and snack places along the way. By the time you've walked all the way back and are exhausted, you're right back at your room where you can pass out for the evening. Perfection. What really sets this hotel apart are the public areas. I don't know of another hotel in OC that offers anything quite like it. A beautiful lobby with comfy seating and panoramic windows with an amazing view of the beach and ocean where they serve complimentary morning coffee and afternoon tea, cookies and crumpets. A terrific litte bar/louge and a casual restaurant flank either side of the lobby, both with the same magnificent view. Just off the lobby is a massive oceanfront deck with rocking chairs and potted plants. The bar and restaurant also have seating that spills out onto the deck if you'd like to sit outdoors. There is also a beach level bar that serves drinks and light lunch items. If you get back to the hotel after a night of fun but aren't quite ready to pack it in, you can grab a night cap at the bar and there are nightly piano players in the lobby you can have a sing-a-long with. My parents really enjoyed this. As far as people on here saying the staff was rude...I really can't say I've noticed. Maybe they just caught someone having a bad day. I mean, they aren't in your face bending over backwards to help you, but they are certainly there when you need it. They are pleasant, friendly and willing to fix any problems that might arrise. Last year the soap dish fell off the wall while my dad was in the shower. We told the front desk on our way out to dinner and it was fixed by the time we came back at night. There is also ample free parking. I didn't use the wireless interent the last time I was there and haven't seen anything about its quality on here yet, but we are going to be staying here again in a few weeks and I plan on trying it out with my laptop. I'll report back on my experience. Bottom line: this is an amazing hotel. It's not incredibly fancy or modern, but can certainly provide a peaceful and relaxing getaway.

We have also watched the hotel deteriorate over time. Specifically, the hotel management is cheap. Just ask any of the hotel employees and they will tell you how the management refuses to improve hotel accommodations. Specifically, I refer to bed linens and bath towels. The Dunes Manor has been using the same bed and bath linens for as far back as I can remember. The same thin, worn out yellow blanket on the beds which does not keep you warm in winter. You are lucky to have a contour sheet. If so, the seam edges will be torn, ragged and will not stay on the mattress. The pillows are as hard and flat as man-hole covers. The bath towels are small and worn thin. They are a disgrace and will not absorb water after bathing. The same towels have been used at The Dunes Manor for well over a decade. The towels at the swimming pool are thin and small as a handkerchief. One hotel guest referred to them as \"prison towels.\" That speaks volumes. My advice is that if you are staying at The Dunes Manor Hotel, bring your own bed and bath linens. Another way the hotel management is cheap is that the furniture in the guest rooms has not changed for many years. The furniture is outdated and worn down. The two dining table chairs are very uncomfortable. There is no other furniture in which to sit down. If there are more than two people in a room, bring some extra chairs. Other than that, the hotel rooms are satisfactory and clean. Hotel management -- are you listening??

BEAUTIFUL views from every room, and particularly the large porch deck with many rocking chairs. The Happy Hour at Zippy Lewis Lounge was a great deal...domestic beers under $2, and rail liquors under $3. Nice shrimp cocktail (huge shrimp) for only $4.95, and same for great wings.

Everything is always clean and fresh, flowers in the vases, brightly lit, and the personel are always friendly and accomodating. Once you get your key and make your way to your room, the first thing you see is the ocean out your windows. All of the rooms in this hotel are ocean front, so there are no bad views. We didn't get a huge room, just two double beds, but there was a kitchenette and table and comfy chairs and a sofa in the room All were clean and fresh. And of course, there's a balcony right outside your in room door with chairs for relaxing. During each afternoon the lobby comes alive with piano music and they serve tea and crumpets (like a biscuit) and cookies, all complimentary. Take your tea and cookies out onto the white rockers on the beachfront deck and watch the waves. It's only a very short walk across the dune to the beach where you can stick your toes in the Atlantic. In the early evening, the grand piano in the lobby gets used for a sing along for all the guests to join in and enjoy. That's a lot of fun and it doesn't matter if you can't really sing a note. The hotel is very convenient to the boardwalk, only one block north of the end of the boards and the boardwalk tram station where you can hop on (for a nominal fee) and ride the length of the boards to the other end where all of the amusements and rides and arcades are.

After the 125 mile trip through heavy traffic to Delaware, then another 50 mile drive to Ocean City, MD, we arrived at 2:30PM at the Dunes Manor Hotel for a 3PM Thanksgiving dinner reservation in the dining room. The men in my family were dressed nicely in jackets and ties, and the ladies wore dinner dresses. We had to wait about 20 minutes before the hotel staff was ready to begin seating the guests for the 3PM service. We were led through the bright dining room lined with windows overlooking the ocean to an adjoining seating area and told our table would be one located behind a solid barrier that blocked all view of the ocean and next to an exit and service area. I immediately objected to the host, but was told that the hotel assigns seating for Thanksgiving based on first-come, first-served (meaning those who call early apparently get the best seats in the dining room). The host explained that moving my family would mean others who hadn't arrived yet would get less desirable seating. At that time, nearly all of the tables in the oceanside part of the dining room were available. This seating system would have been perfectly fine we me had I been told of this \"policy\" when making the reservation. No doubt, we would have selected another place to enjoy Thanksgiving. I went to the front desk and asked to speak with the hotel manager. After waiting about 10 minutes, the manager arrived and was pleasant, but totally unsympathetic and reiterated the hotel seating \"policy.\" I told her that we had visited the Dunes Manor twice before for Thanksgiving dinner and had a pleasant time while seated near the oceanside windows. I also told her that we would never return again due to the terrible seating location we had to endure. I explained to her that I could have selected any restaurant with a secluded seating, but had chosed the Dunes Manor because it offers a view of the ocean. She seemed totally unmoved. Since we felt captured at that point because finding an alternative restaurant at that late time would have been very difficult, we went ahead and ordered dinner. I spent the entire dinner fuming over the hotel staffs' lack of interest in ensuring their customers really enjoyed the holiday dinner. Instead, it seemed that the Dunes Manor has a system and sticks with it despite customer complaints. The food was average and and the waitress seemed pleasant, but was assigned too many tables as empty drink glasses went unfilled for quite some time. My mother and wife complained little until we departed the hotel, then told me that a salmon main dish one had was not completely cooked (raw in the middle) and the other was disappointed with the average taste of the meal. This experience totally ruined my enjoyment of the Thanksgiving holiday meal. Will I ever reserve a room at the Dunes Manor Hotel? ABSOLUTELY NOT!! Will I ever take my family to the Dunes Manor Hotel again for Thanksgiving dinner? Again, ABSOLUTELY NOT!!

We always seem to gravitate to The Dunes Manor when staying in Ocean City, MD. The current management is, well, cheap. They cut corners at the expense of the guests. The hotel rooms have not been renovated for many years. Same ole, same ole. I'm sick of looking at the same light yellow blanket on the beds. These blankets provide very little warmth. They are very worn-out and have become thin over the years. I filled out a comment card to this regard, but no change. The mattresses are hard and uncomfortable. You are lucky if you have fitted sheets. Most of the time the mattress is covered with a flat sheet which slides right off when sleeping. You end up sleeping on the mattress. The towels are so-so, thin and somewhat worn. Interestingly enough, a few years ago new windows were installed in the hotel rooms. However, these windows are cheap and very inferior. When you slide the window up, is drops right back down. This can be injurious to a person's hand or fingers. There are no brackets in which to hold the window up. What a waste of money. If the management were not so cheap, better and functional windows could have been installed. The carpeting itself is old and becoming worn-out. The regular hotel rooms are relatively small, comprising two beds, one small night stand, two small reading lights, one TV cabinet with three drawers, a table and two chairs and one floor lamp. That's it! The television is the old-fashioned type (not flat-screen). The walls are thin, so hope for quiet neighbors on both sides and above the hotel room. The sink is located in a small area with a tiny fridge, microwave and coffee pot. The complimentary in-room packs of coffee tastes like battery acid. I can't stomach the stuff. Same is true for the complimentary coffee in the hotel lobby. The room-service menu is extremely limited and expensive. Don't go there. The bathroom is small and generally the toilets have plumbing problems. The room is so small, you can't stand to look out the windows because the bed is almost adjacent to the wall/HVAC unit. You have to look out the glass door with built-in venation blinds or go out on the deteriorating deck to see the ocean. The ocean view is magnificent at The Dunes Manor. Internet service in the hotel room leaves a great deal to be desired. I have never had much luck with connectivity. There is an indoor/outdoor swimming pool and tiny little hot tub which holds no more than four people (two is more like it) and with scorching, steaming hot water! There are only two elevators for this large hotel, so expect long waits especially during the busy season. Good luck getting a bell-cart for your luggage during busy periods. The Victorian lobby is the finest feature of the hotel. Hot tea and stale, store-bought cookies are available at 4:00pm each day. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with the daily \"Tea,\" as it's no prize. The restaurant is so-so, but has a beautiful view of the ocean. That's the main draw card for us -- the ocean view from all parts of the hotel and the wooden porch (veranda) facing the ocean. The rates for these tiny hotel rooms in the summer are ridiculous. That's when we head south for much better, larger oceanfront hotel rooms for two-thirds the price of The Dunes Manor Hotel such as we did at Myrtle Beach, SC, this summer. Winter is the best time to stay at The Dunes Manor to reap the lower rates. They get you on holiday weekends with a 2 or 3 night minimum. Plus, if there are any events in Ocean City the weekend of your stay the rate will be higher and the AAA discount will not apply. I have found the hotel rooms to basically be clean. However, the cleanliness is overshadowed by the old furniture and worn-out bed/bath linens.

We went to OC to be with family. I don't really like OC, and I would not recommend OC to a friend as a vacation destination, but if someone were going to OC anyway, this hotel is a reasonable choice. The location is great -- it's right on the beach, just two properties north of the northern end of the boardwalk (the quiet end). So, you can access the boardwalk without having to find a parking space, but you don't have to deal with all the boardwalk-related noise and congestion at your hotel. For swimming, it is a nice stretch of beach. My problem with just about everything in OC is that the prices are extremely high and the facilities are rather crude for what you're paying. The room at the Dunes Manor was very 1980s, with a worn, tired feel. With taxes, we paid about $400 a night for a small suite -- two double beds (not queens) and an old pullout couch in the other room, with one bath and an unappealing little kitchenette. They only have about three months a year of good business in OC, and it shows in the limited investment in the facilities. For that kind of money, you could have a far nicer room in a major NY, LA or DC hotel. At $400 a night, when you're staying in one of the nicest places in town, and the hotel doesn't even provide beach towels, and everything feels worn and sort of cheap, I am not thrilled.

The huge porch off the lobby with rows of rocking chairs and tables is one of the best features. You can get a drink at the bar or coffee from the lobby and sit out right over the surprisingly quiet beach. The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant has good food, and the lobby is nicely decorated (if that matters to you at he beach). That said, the rooms could use a little updating: our bathroom door was broken and hard to shut. Some slightly nicer furniture on the balcony (even resin or sturdier plastic) would be in keeping with the $280/night price tag. The first day we were there, we had no cleaning service -- they came at 2 p.m., but we were back in the room for lunch. The front desk asked if it would be okay to clean after 4 p/m. when the night staff came on, and we agreed, but when we came back at 9 p.m., they hadn't been there. We finally asked them just to take out the trash and bring clean towels, which a nice young man did. After that, the room was cleaned on time. I agree with a previous reviewer about the pool - it is small and it is not two, but one pool, where half is inside and half outside, but who really needs a big pool when you are right on the ocean? The hot tub is small -- wish they'd enforce a rule about young children monopolizing it. :) The hotel just needs a little spit and polish -- new carpet in the rooms, a little new paint. There is a small refrigerator in the room and a microwave, but table /counter space is limited. And above the 6th floor, the internet is too hard to get due to a different service up there. I ended up going to the lobby, though a nice man named Fred tried his hardest to make the wi fi in the room work. That said, the Dunes Manor is still one of the best places to stay in Ocean City.

We felt that as guests we should have been able to enjoy the hotel that we paid for. We felt that as the wedding had a buffett/bar/snack area set up on the end of the porch, the guests should have been ushered into that area. Obviously the hotel was enjoying the extra$$$ they were making on the tons of drinks that the guests were buying at the bar.

We initially picked the Dunes, after much internet research, because we wanted to splurge and get an oceanfront room for our first stay in Ocean City Md. and the Dunes has all oceanfront rooms. The view is spectacular day and night. It cannot be beat! The rooms are a good size. My family of four fit just fine. Loved the convenience of the coffee maker/microwave/ mini fridge. The room was clean upon arrival and cleaned excellently every day. The pool is on the small side, but it is heated, which was nice. The pool towels are on the small side, but we just used our own beach towels, so this was really not a problem for us. The access to the beach on the ground floor leads through the hosing down area straight to the elevators, which was convenient. There is plenty of parking. It was never a problem, no matter what time we came back. Other reviewers have mentioned the slow elevators. We didn't have any problems at all until we were checking out, but I put this down to so many wanting to use it at the same time because of checking out. The Dunes is convenient to the boardwalk and the tram, only a block away. However, our family found the bus service to be more convenient ,cheaper, and quicker than the tram.The closest bus stop is only two short blocks away. $2.00 for the whole day . It also runs 24/7 every 10 minutes or so, and the tram doesn't run 24/7. The staff was excellent, especially the second shift doorman, who was very sweet to my kids. Our maid service was outstanding. A day or so into our stay, our housekeeper caught on that we were using more coffee and sugar than the one packet she was leaving us(we brought a little of our own from home) and starting leaving us two every morning, without us having to ask. We only ate at the Barefoot Bar, which had good food,quick service and was accessible from the beach. The veranda is a great place to relax and chitchat with other guests. The outside bar was a nice place to get a drink and enjoy the nighttime sea breezes. Other people have mentioned the coffee in the morning and tea in the afternnon. The Dunes also provides ice water with a little lemon all day also. No place is 100% and there is always room for improvement. I wish there was some type of shelving by the microwave/minifridge/ coffemaker area for things like utensils, paper plates, napkins, etc. There is only three drawers in the armoire and two small ones in the nightstand, not enough for a family of four for a week stay. The bathroom is very small, though it does help the sink area is outside of the bathroom. There is only two chairs on the balcony, so we couldn't all sit outside together.

The main dining room is the Victorian Room where we ate dinner, lunch, and breakfasts. The one night we ate dinner at the hotel we were forced to wait 15 minutes for drinks after the order was given. Other than that the food was good. The last day for breakfast we waited a full 15 minutes before being greeted by our server. Our drinks took another 10 minutes and our meal another 20 minutes.

The lady at the desk said she would take our cell #s and call us when the room was ready, and she did 30 minutes later! Very thoughtful. The rooms are a bit small, two doubles, with a small table w/2 chairs. The fridge/microwave are on a shelf in the alcove outside the bath/shower area.

The rooms are older, this is not the Hilton. But they were exceptionally clean. The maid service was very nice and prompt. Our kids love the ability to go right out the back door of the hotel, through the dunes, and onto the beach. There is a beach chair/umbrella rental stand right next to the walking path, so that is very convenient. At lunch time, just walk right back up the path and onto the hotel deck. Lunch food is typical (burgers, hotdogs, chicken fingers, fries, mozzerela sticks), and a few salad/wraps. We always take this lunch time to get out of the sun for awhile and enjoy the shade at the deck tables. The boardwalk tram station is about 1.5 blocks away. This is very convenient as you can park the car and leave it for the time you are at the hotel. Yes, the tram is 2.75, but buy a card with 10 trips and save a few bucks. Buy it on Friday, as on Saturday the price goes up to 2.75 from 2.50. This is a lovely family-friendly hotel.

The lobby is very nice and spacious with a pleasant old fashioned Victorian parlor theme. You can walk out to the adjacent big porch facing the ocean and sit in one of the many rocking chairs and relax. There is a friendly woman piano player who plays all the old favorites on the old grand piano on some evenings in the summer just like it must have been in the \"good old days.\" There is also, at least in the summer, a daily afternoon tea and cookies which is very popular with the guests. The hotel restaurant is also just off the lobby overlooking the ocean with fairly decent food and service. I did get one of the order by 5:00 pm dinner specials and it was pretty bad though. I made the receptionist take it off the bill when I checked out but only after alot of arm twisting. The breakfasts were fine and a couple other \"non special\" priced lunches were adequate. The hotel is just one block north of the end of the boardwalk for easy access to the boardwalk tram and attractions. Overall, I was quite disappointed with the room at the Dunes Manor Hotel. The mid-week rate in July 2005 was $239 a night which with tax brought the bill to well over $700 for the 3 nights I was there. The room was tolerable, average size and not awful. However it was very very plain with cheap furnishings and two double beds which were acceptable but not very comfortable. After the nice lobby, the room is a let down. The bathroom was small and also plain. ( My rooms at the Crystal Beach Hotel and the Holiday Inn Express where I stayed in 2006, while nothing special, were both superior to this room. ) You do get a private balcony off your room directly overlooking the ocean which is a plus when staying here. I was up on a higher floor so the view was very pleasant. The room was kept fairly clean and had daily maid service so I have to be fair about mentioning that. Unfortunately my room smelled strongly of urine in a corner of the carpeting as if the people before me had brought a pet dog. The front desk said they could not change the room when I went to complain right after checking in so I went out and bought a can of Lysol which helped as long as I kept spraying regularly. I need to share with readers that the elevators in this hotel are ridiculously slow. They are so outdated for a place charging the rates the Dunes does. After the first couple of times it got very very annoying to wait for them because it seemed to take forever. To the owners of this hotel; get off your butts and replace these elevators. Your customers don't deserve this cheap mediocrity. If you are not going to replace them and update the rooms a little, you have no business charging the rates you do. Overall, one needs to keep in mind, including me, that this is Ocean City, and the overall standard is not like staying at a decent hotel in Baltimore or Washington, D.C. Still, things are changing and there is some competition out there now in O.C. I can say without any hesitation you can definately do better than staying at the Dunes Manor when planning your next trip to Ocean City. The rooms in this place get a B-. They do not get an A - or a B+. Without the direct ocean view balcony they would get a C, regardless if this hotel is located in O.C.

They have afternoon tea and cookies and that is very popular also. On the down side, their beach stand where you can buy lunch is chaotic with a capital C. We ate breakfast in the Victorian Room and it is affordable. We ate outside and watched the dolphins swim by . All in all, the Dunes was in a great location. I looked around and if I HAD to visit Ocean City again, I would stay at the Dunes again.

The rooms were small, but not dirty, and all had great ocean views. The food was typical beach fare, though with waiting times that were spectacularly long. The pool was located far away from the beach, and was nothing special.

It's hard to imagine a better motel- service,price, and accomodations. The hotel looks majestic, and the doorman open the front door for you. Parking is either outside or under the lobby, as ample spaces abound. Courtesy permeates throughout the staff at the hotel(the doorman, front desk, maids, waitresses, and pool assistant). The lobby has a victorian style that is well maintained. Wnen we first entered the room the telltale sign of cleanilness is the bathroom. That's what I checked, and when you can safely place your food on the bathroom floor and eat, you know you have a classy hotel. The room was a decent size, and overlooks the ocean(as do all of their rooms). The only complaint, and it's minor, was the dresser having only 3 drawers for 4 people, but this was overwhelmed by the service and accomodations. The hotel encourages socializing with these nice touches. Happy hour starts at 2(beer is $1.35, mixed drinks $3(virgins) and $4( spiked). Around 3 pm tea and cookies are served for guests. In the evening Shirley Jones plays the piano for sing-a-longs. The pool is moderate size up to 4 1/2 ft depth & is a combo indoor /outdoor, which was perfect for the heat wave, for those avoiding the sun. They have an early riser breakfast special at $2.99(pancake, eggs, etc) , and and early bird dinner special. We tried each and were satisfied. The hotel is owned by a woman, who obviously trains her staff to be courteous and attentive. The view from our room was fabulous. We only wish the humidity wasn't so high, so we could sleep with the windows open and hear the waves crashing on the beach. You'll pay more here than best western or howard johnson's, but your stay will be more enjoyable and without accomodation incident.

We booked via the Internet and asked for cribs or pack n plays for our young twins. Rooms were booked on Thursday for Friday arrival. Apparently, on Friday morning, the hotel attempted to call us to let us know that they do not offer cribs or pack and plays. Unfortunately, we did not get the message prior to leaving for Ocean City. I had never stayed at a hotel that did not offer cribs, so I had no idea that would even be an issue. We found out upon arrival, and at first we were quite annoyed. However, Armondo, the front desk manager was lovely and very accomodating. He attempted to find us a room at another hotel. In the end, he offered to upgrade our room to a larger suite free of charge and to provide extra pillows and blankets to let the babies sleep on the floor. We wound up doing this. So if you have young children, bring your own pack and plays. Also, if you have children in strollers, be aware that the lobby and the restaurants are one floor up from street level. This is slightly annoying because you constantly have to take the elevator up and down one floor. Because it wasn't that crowded Easter weekend, this was not a big deal, but I would imagine that during peak season, it could be rather time consuming, given that there are only two elevators. I would have to agree with the other poster that the suite is not large and the kitchen is not as well stocked as some other efficiency hotels that we have stayed at. The room was not luxurious but is pleasant. But with that said, there was much to like about the Dunes Manor Hotel. The staff, from Armondo at the front desk, to the wait staff, to the pool attendant, were friendly and gracious. The location is amazing -right on the beach with beautiful beach front views from every room. The balconies were private, so I could sit out, nurse the babies, and watch the ocean. Plus, the hotel is one block from the boardwalk so it was easy to walk with our babies in the stroller. The pool isn't the greatest, but for our purposes, it was fine. We ate almost all of our meals in the hotel, and found the food to be good and reasonable. In addition, there were nice activities, such as the piano player at night and a performer for the kids.

This is just after peak season ends, and so I was able to get a corner oceanfront room, with two queen size beds, for $159/night... pretty inexpensive for Ocean City. Note that the Dunes Manor Hotel is constructed such that ALL rooms are oceanfront, and the views are pretty spectacular, particularly from the higher floors. We booked the room online at the Dunes Manor reservations site, and arrived approx 11:00 am on the day of our arrival. Check-in was at 3:00, and, despite our hopes of getting an earlier check-in, 3:00 is about when our room was ready. I do not fault the hotel for this, as 3:00 pm check-in is clearly stated when reservations are made. Now, I have stayed in two other Ocean City hotels in the past, both of them being Quality Inns (or, as I like to call them, Low-Quality Inns). The Dunes Manor hotel is a refreshing change, as we found the hotel to be spotless! Different people look for different things in a hotel, but as for our top-ten list of requirements, cleanliness takes numbers 1, 2, and 3! The Dunes Manor met our requirements for cleanliness; I even joked that I could eat off the bathroom tile, as it was so immaculate! In fact, the room decor is almost entirely white/light colored, in which case it is all the more important to keep things clean, and the hotel appears to keep on top of this. Unlike the Low-Quality Inns I stayed at in the past, I was entirely comfortable walking around barefoot in the room, and sleeping on the hotel sheets (although I ALWAYS remove the Bedspread in every hotel for well known reasons!) Number 4 on my requirements list at a Beachrfront hotel is the pool. I like big, clean, heated pools, preferably on the beach side of the hotel. In this case, the Dunes Manor comes up rather short. They have a combo indoor/outdoor pool on the Lobby level, on the street side of the hotel. The pool is not large, nor is it tiny. The portion of the pool on the \"Indoor\" side is a little dark and dank. The outdoor portion is definitely more sunny and \"cheery\". Unfortunately, this pool only goes to 4-1/2 feet in depth, so you can forget about diving. On the plus side, the pool is heated, and it was a pleasant 80 degrees during our stay. I think I would have been a great deal more satisfied with the pool if it had been on the beach side of the hotel instead of the street side. The hotel offers clean towels at the poolside, but they are tiny, like washcloths, so you may wish to bring your own towels, or take the large ones down from your room. There are 11 floors in this hotel, and only 2 elevators. The hotel was not all that busy during our stay, so there weren't too many long waits for the elevator, but I would imagine that during peak season you might wish to call for the elevator several minutes in advance of leaving your room! There is a nice-looking restaurant in the hotel, but we did not end up dining there, so I cannot provide my opinion. Some friends we were travelling with did dine there one night, and they gave it a thumbs-up, for the most part. A bit pricey, though, if you don't make the \"Sunset Special\" before 5:30 pm; meat entrees after that time will run you $22+ The 3:00 pm afternoon tea was a nice touch.. you can have hot or iced tea, and they serve crumpets and cookies as well, all complimentary. I'm an American, and personally, I'd take coffee and donuts any day over tea and crumpets, but what can you do..! Several nights a week they have a lady named Shirley Toms come to the Lobby to play some old-time piano tunes. My kids enjoyed this, and Shirley was very nice and included them in many of the songs. The hotel staff were very friendly, and for the most part, helpful. However, I should describe the situation we experienced; On two separate occasions we made calls down to the front desk with a request. The first time, we requested a small folding table for our room, if one was available. On a later day, we called down to the front desk to ask that a bottle opener be brought to our room. In both cases, we made repeated requests, and neither of our requests were met. It is not so much that the items we requested were not available; it is perfectly understandable if a hotel doesn't have specific items that might be requested such as those we requested. However, it is unacceptable that our requests were never answered definitively; nobody ever called to say that they didn't have available what we asked for.. there was simply no response at all. I was not impressed with that kind of service. The hotel is located right in the thick of things in Ocean City; there are many restaurants and activities within walking distance. Additionally, the Dunes Manor is right next to the start of the Ocean City Boardwalk. It was nice to be not quote ON the Boardwalk, but within walking distance of it. Unlike the uptown Hotels, you don't need to drive or take a bus to get to the boardwalk. All in All, the Dunes Manor Hotel was clean and friendly, and a great value for the money. I would most certainly consider staying there again; although I would probably do some further research of hotels in the area, to find one of comparable price and quality, but with a better pool / beachside pool area. However, if the Hotel pool is not of significant concern to you, the Dunes Manor is a Best Bet in Ocean City MD.
