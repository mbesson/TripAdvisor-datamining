I made my decision online, reviewing the photos provided but they must have been at least 10 years old as the place has certainly AGED since they were taken. Granted, the room was not overly expensive and they do have an indoor pool, hot tub, exercise room, and business center but they each have problems. Couldn't tell that the pool was chlorinated or not - not a good sign for it or the hot tub either one. There are not towels there either so you have to recycle the ones from your room. In the tiny exercise room, over 50% of the few pieces of equipment there, do not work. The same is true for the \"business center\". One PC that is broken doesn't make for a business center. There are no microwaves in any of the rooms that I saw, so forget popcorn, and there are distinct signs of damage where it appears the doors between the rooms have been kicked open and only partially fixed. The patch isn't very cosmetically appealing, even though it may be functional. The bathroom commode was nasty too, as though it hadn't been flushed in a very long time. Although they offer free wireless, the connection will automically adjust (for no real reason I could see) and my connection would run from 56MB to 1MB (yes, that is a single \"1\")! On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the non-smoking room didn't even vaguely smell like smoke as I frequently find is the case. The staff was also courteous and friendly. The overall experience was like stepping back in time and seeing how the facility has aged from it's once \"glory\" days..", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cthis is worst ive ever experienced\u201d", "Author": "amy p", "ReviewID": "UR125060561", "Content": "Please dont stay here.

While trying to look past the fact that the hotel looked abandoned we attempted to settle into our room. I was completely disgusted by a toilet that seemed to have fecal matter stuck to it. I, of course, did not attempt to prove whether it was or was not. We were also very worried about the cargo bag we had on the top of our car as the parking lot was not lit very well at all. We went to get dinner and decided on the way we didn't want to stay at the Clarion. We checked in at the La Quinta and then went back to the Clarion. Because we didn't immediately tell the front desk that we didn't want to stay there they would not give us a refund. Changing rooms was not an option for us as the hotel's lack of being clean was unbearable. The manager and receptionist were not understanding at all of the situation. I used to work at a hotel and I can tell you that people got their room refunded by something as little as when the elevator bothered them all night... so that just shows you how much this hotel needs the money.

Free parking, and prime location for our business needs. The Bad: old building which had been renovated - poorly. Visible wear in public hallways and rooms. Poor workmanship on the renovations - it appeared to have been haphazardly done with no supervision monitoring quality workmanship. No functioning iron in the room, one bar of soap for use at sink & shower, a single bottle of shampoo, no conditioner or lotion provided for guest use. The Ugly: the first room they put us in inexplicably there was a puddle of water in the carpet between the first bed and the wall. They quickly moved us to a new room following a phone call to the front desk. In the second room the desk provided for guest use wobbled so precariously we refused to place any of our belongings on it for fear it would result in the demise of the desk. The air conditioning was feeble at best, it was not that warm, but rather just \"stuffy\" in the room and we were using it to cool the room only a couple of degrees which by morning it was blowing warm humid air. There were no wash cloths provided in the room; when we asked the front desk for wash cloths we were told that housekeeping was behind and were given hand towels for washing in the shower. Speaking of the shower, they had renovated the bathrooms in granite, including the shower surround. The problem is that housekeeping did not clean well (in either room) and I could see places on the granite that looked like it needed a good scrubbing with a granite friendly solution. Additionally, in the bathroom where the tile met the wallpaper there was no border/transition and the wall paper was beginning to peel and turn black in places that you could see while in a sitting position in the bathroom.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Union City, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cTHE HEATED POOL MADE THE STAY A DREAM!!!\u201d", "Author": "TAMTAM11", "ReviewID": "UR100310899", "Content": "My husband took me out for my birthday and I got this room on line.

We got back in the car to find an entrance closer to our room and drove around the back of the bulding. HOLY COW!! It looked like it was an abandoned building on the back end. There were significant weeds growing up through the cracks in the asphalt and our opinion started to nose dive. We ended up right back in front because none of the other entrances looked like they were usable. My wife suggested we only take a bag or two 'cause she wasn't sure about this place. We came to the entrance door and it said that it was locked 24x7 and that you needed your room key to access the door: it opened right up with no key. First red flag! When we got to our room in this non-smoking facility, it had clearly been smoked in recently and not cleaned very well. There were stains on the linens and the caulk in the bathroom was disgusting.

It seemed OK, but there was nothing that stood out as particularly good to me, and some parts felt as though they still needed to be renovated. We stayed here overnight while traveling through Memphis. We arrived very late (after midnight). We were given a room number and ended up on the wrong wing (which did not look to be in great shape) seeing as there were no clear signs identifying room locations, and had to return to the front desk to get directions. When we finally found the right area and made it to our room, the handle to the door was broken and we couldn't get in. Another trip all the way back to the front desk and we were given another room (adjacent to the previous) for which the handle worked - sort of (it would open, but needed to be lifted up, not down like every other door handle). Honestly, it was a pretty minor thing overall, but when arriving after midnight with two tired young kids, it was all pretty annoying. The room was fine, though nothing special. We didn't get to try the breakfast. The pool looked nice, but we also didn't get to try it. Checkout was smooth. I worried a bit about car safety in Memphis, but when I was unloading my car, I noticed a police car patrolling, so it seemed to be secure enough. The atrium area (not near the front desk) was large, and it looked like the kind of place that could host decent-size meetings, so I would expect that sometimes the hotel will be filled with meeting-goers. At night, though, having to walk through that deserted atrium while going to our room felt pretty weird. Altogether it was an average place with a minor annoyance. I'm borderline on whether I'd stay there again, but given that it was OK, and it wasn't a bad price, I'll lean toward the positive end.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Clarion Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55197-d122504-Reviews-Clarion_Hotel-Memphis_Tennessee.html", "Price": "$57 - $90*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">6101 Shelby Oaks Drive</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">6101 Shelby Oaks Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Memphis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">38134</span></span> (Formerly Memphis Plaza)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "122504", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/77/e9/77e97fbb242d366f07fad210a24ca1956large.jpg"}}
