Rooms were a little cold, although we had extra blankets. Food was wonderful, as was the wine - we would recommend the Frescobaldi Rufina. Views stunning, the owner/manager could not have been more accomodating. Would definitely recommend excellent value.", "Date": "Oct 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR743140259", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ce2-batson"}, {"Content": "Heaven !

Everyday you can choose a different location to visit or spend your time in the swimming pool, tennis court or sauna.For ladies (I've seen my wife..) it's perfect because it's in the middle of outlet area (Prada, DG, The Mall).Giada and Graziano are very helpful and it's seems to be in a family.Very Very good!Michele", "Date": "Jun 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR786007628", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kalboni"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d546567-r22108116-Podere_Castellare-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "546567", "Price": "$248"}}
