It doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside: wow! The hotel is really in the middle of Prenzlauer Berg, a cool and hip place with tons of clubs, bars, and restaurants. Convient public transportation links the hotel with the rest of the city quickly and convienently. Since the hotel is in an old building, the room we have is a little oddly shaped and proportioned, but elegant, clean, and well proportioned. Breakfsts is a treat and the rich buffett begged us to stay for seconds. The staff even let us take a snack for later. We will definitely stay here again, but think about the sound of the tram ouotside 24/7 and that there is noone in the hotel with any kind of responsibility at night time.

This hotel is cozy, nice, and slightly at odds with its trendy neighbourhood, as time does not really seem to have passed since the 50s at Kastanienhof. Large, quiet, clean and comfortable room, excellent breakfast buffet, and great central location - only drawback is that the hotel is slightly pricey compared to other hotels of similar standard in Berlin, and there is no wireless internet. (Which, assumably, is due to that most visitors seem to be 50+ and not business travelers.)

The location is central, without being in the noisy part of town. The staff are helpful and accommodating to an extent. One mistake we made was to not confirm a non-smoking room prior to arrival, and by the time we checked in, a smoking room was all they had available. Luckily our room smelled ok, and it was not too cold to keep the windows open a crack and allow air flow to flow in at night. But, traveler be warned! We wont make that mistake again. The rooms are spacious, simple and clean, and we even had a table with two chairs in our room. Although the hotel only offers hard wire Internet ( a little archaic to not offer wireless in this day and age?), there is a laptop available for use in the office, for a small fee. Our stay overall was satisfactory, although we were disappointed at the end when as we were bringing down our suitcases to depart, my partner was growled at by the lady at reception that he must not leave without returning our room keys. This, without so much as a greeting of good morning from her, and also when it was quite obvious he was not making an attempt to walk put of the hotel just yet.
