We needed a central location, good value, helpful English speaking staff and clean rooms. We got all this and a lot more. The views from the breakast terrace are stunning. If you get up early you see the sunrise colouring the Bospherus behind minarets while \u00c4\u00b1n the foreground a clear and close view of the Blue Mosque set in the park. MEALS: We discovered that th\u00c4\u00b1s street, Divan Yolu, is the heart of the old city, and within two mins walk you get about 100 fantastic restaurants, each with their own special dishes as well as all the expected kebab options. Our favourites include steak with pistachio sauce, 'Sultan' chicken, a saffron mushroom and rice veggy dish served at Han restaurant (very attractive decor - where you see the women making trad pies) and a dessert called 'ch\u00c4\u00b1cken breast' made from baked cream w\u00c4\u00b1th a caramelised skin wh\u00c4\u00b1ch tastes of toffee. SIGHTS: More to the point we found ourselves plonk in the middle of all the most gorgeous and historic places and right by a tram stop. We could walk to most and get the tram (2 TL) to the others. MANAGER: The staff were friendly, English speak\u00c4\u00b1ng and helpful. The manager, Altin Diko, (as other reviewers have said) really puts himself out to meet your needs. Our needs were many. We wanted a varied evening programme for our group that was not touristic. Altin helped arrange a series of experiences that left every sense sated, with pick-ups taking us from the hotel to each venue and back. If you're curious about us and our friendly group see www.worldance.org (look at diary dates for coming trips). The experience surpassed our expectations in every way.

One of our friend cancelled and we stayed a day less than a day expected. Even though it was start of high season, Mr Altin helped us accomodate our stay. He took a hit to cancel our room without any charge. When our last day was cut short ..he managed it leave that out as well. We are very thankful to him. The location of hotel is very conveinient being near to all tourist locations. One can find snacks from 1 EUR to the nicest hotel for the evening. Tram station is just across the street and sights are just 2-4 stops away. More than the hotel..Altin and his team made the place more memorable.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Samborondon", "Title": "\u201c\"The Star Holiday, a wise choice\"\u201d", "Author": "AlxBdrn", "ReviewID": "UR70147507", "Content": "My brother and I stayed at the Star Holiday for 15 days, we had a very pleasant time, The hotel manager, was always there to assist us and tried to solve each one of our problems and special requests, treating us in a friendly way.

Its close to a lot of wonderful \u00e2\u20ac\u0153musts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Istanbul.

The only unexpected thing, was the adjustment on the fare for Chrstmas. Our room was a bit small but was always clean , the sheets and towels were changed daily , the heater, tv , hot water, internet in the room and lobby worked properly, personnel is kind and helpful , always keeping a smile . You start your day with a nutritious breakfast at the cafeteria while enjoying a breathtaking view of the Blue Mosque, The Hagga Sophia the Marmara Sea and others.

The manager of the hotel along with his staff were very friendly and polite, ready to assist you at any time. The hotel is having a facelift, so ofcourse it would look like the carpets needed hoovering, but in all truthfullness this is not a fault. The location of the hotel is A+,, the amazing view of the blue mosque and its surrounds whilst having breakfast is fantastic ,the only downside was that the breakfast area was abit small. This is a central city hotel with everything at its feet, anyone wanting luxury,redcarpet or a doorsman should be looking for a 5 star hotel.

The view from the breakfast room is amazing and the same from the lounge which is on a lower floor. There is no lift so not suitable if you have mobility problems as 4 floors to walk up. The rooms are very small as is the bathroom and the towels could definately do with replacing. However the beds are clean and comfortable and made up each day. The TV has no English channels so not worth watching. There is also a fridge although we didn't use it and adequate hanging and drawer space. The breakfast is rather basic - bread rolls - cheese - meat - jam - boiled eggs - tea and coffee but for the price is sufficient for the day. The hotel is quiet at night except for the call to prayer at 5am but this must be the same for every hotel in this area and it only lasts for 5 minutes. All in all if you get the hotel for a good price you will find its location very good and if you are not expecting too much it is fine for a short stay.
