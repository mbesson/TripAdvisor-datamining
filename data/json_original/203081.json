Finally, we got somewhere that was good looking online, had good reviews, was reasonably priced and in a handy location. We could not have done better. Starhotels Metropole not only has a nice facade but the lobby is also beautiful. We normally stay in budget hotels, but my beautiful (WIFE TO BE) could not be walking out of a dungeon or cellar door on out big day so we plumped for this hotel. The staff were helpful, attentive to our needs and very friendly. They could not have been any nicer. The room was spacious, clean, recently refurbished, modern and comfortable. This place is a bit of a gem in comparison to what some of our friends, family and guests stayed in for a similar price. GREAT breakfast with a wide choice of breads, cereals, fruit, yogurt, drinks and hot foods. This basically set us up until dinner time, except of course for a daily gelato around 3 o'clock!!!!

Close to Termini and easily walkable to all the sights (sights are about 15-20 minutes walk) Road signs can be a bit difficult so we found it a little difficult to locate the hotel but we asked a few people and they helped us. The map that is given in hotels.com is not very helpful so i suggest you get a more in dept map! Rooms are a good size and beds comfortable. Toilets are a little small but not too bad! No shower only bathtub. Breakfast was included in the price we paid and it was excellent with aot of choice. Breakfast is buffet style and included sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, selection of ham and cheese, yogurt and fruit and a bread selection . If you want toast you can ask for it at no additional charge. The price we paid for the hotel was worth. Surrounding area had lots of eating places. Very lively area! The gym at the hotel is 24hrs but very small (4 machines) so better use it when it is not very crowded. Free Wi Fi only available at the lobby.

The breakfast buffet choices were good and I must mention the excellent waiter, Renato, who has to be the best waiter we have ever come across, he went out of his way to be helpful and is an excellent ambassador for the hotel. We would definitely stay here again and will recommend. We didn't find it easy to get around Rome even with a map and would recommend that you take a good map with an A-Z street directory. I don't know how many times we saw the colosseum when looking for other venues! But we weren't alone in getting lost,at every junction when you looked around we saw other tourists looking at maps and looking just as confused as we were! One thing I must warn you about is crossing the roads, I don't know which I'm more scared of, spiders or Rome roads! The drivers take no notice of the green man on crossings or any other crossings either. They use the roads like a race track! We found that if there is a nun about to cross then take advantage that the drivers are unlikely to want to run over a nun! Seriously,it's like trying to cross at Hyde Park Corner. Be brave and bold and walk purposely. Don't dither and accept that scooters and motor bikes will zipp around you.

It is in a very good location close to the Stazione Termini, so easily accessible when coming from the airport. It is close to a large shopping street and many sights such as the Colosseum and Roman Forum are in walking distance as well. My room was very big and comfortable with a large bathroom. It had two single beds that made up a large double, there is a wide choice of pillows available and the room was very quiet, so I slept very well in the hotel. Small remarks regarding cleanliness of the room: when I arrived there were hairs on one of the beds and in the bathtub, probably from the housekeeping staff - apart from that it was spotless. I liked the fact that the room has tea and coffee making facilities (tea and coffee is refilled everyday, so are toiletries in the bathroom). Breakfast is included in the room rate and consist of a large breakfast buffet. Even though it is a big hotel that seems to cater for tour groups as well, the breakfast restaurant was never overly crowded, food was there in good supply and I never had to queue. Waiters in the breakfast room are very friendly and make sure you have everything you need. I tried room service one morning and evening and again, food was of very good quality and plentiful and the staff was extremely friendly. Unfortunately, I can't say the same of the staff at the reception. My check-in experience was quite unpleasant. I arrived late in the evening after a long day at work, followed by my flight to Rome. The staff checked me in, handed me my key card and some flyers without further comment. I had to ask them for standard information such as breakfast times and location as well as Internet connection. Wifi is free of charge for 30 mins in the lobby, but not in the rooms. I had to ask twice how to connect to the Wifi in the room and how much it is before they bothered to explain it to me. When I asked for directions to the conference center I had to go to the next morning, they just looked at the address I gave them, told me it was 15 mins away (not true, just 2 mins across the road) and didn't bother to make the effort to show it to me o the map they had just handed out to me. I was very annoyed by this experienced and didn't feel welcome at all. Given the fact that check-in is the first experience of guests in the hotel and can make or break the impression you get of the hotel. At a later stage I needed to print something and was direction to the business center (more a corner in the lobby with two computers and a printer). Usage is not free, even though wifi is for 30 mins, if you have your own laptop.... you pay 2 EUR for 15 mins of usage. When I asked, if they could print something for me they agreed to do so, but wouldn't have offered it themselves. What was also missing was general information regarding the hotel and its facilities in the rooms. I am a bit torn with regards to my stay in the Starhotels Metropole: on the one hand, I was very comfortable in my room, Wifi worked well (which you'd hope when paying 11 EUR per day for it), breakfast was good and restaurant and housekeeping staff are very friendly. I was put off by the reception staff, the general paid Internet policy (in 4 star hotels that see themselves as business hotels it should be included in the room rate or at least less expensive) and the lack of information on the hotel in the room.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheyenne, Wyoming", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay in Rome!\u201d", "Author": "Earle F", "ReviewID": "UR126466017", "Content": "I actually found this hotel to be fantastic for the few days we spend in Rome.

The hotel also offers a small gym for free, parking (35 euro a day? not sure), and a business center with computers (not sure about the price).

I arrived at the central train station and had just a short walk from there to the hotel itself. The check-in staff were very helpful and friendly which was a relief after a 7 hour flight delay. My luggage was also delayed so during my stay I had to check with reception periodically to check if it had arrived and they were always pleasant. When it finally arrived through the night they had it sent to my room first thing in the morning (the day before my departure). When I was shown to my room I found I had been upgraded (I booked with Citalia) to a very spacious corner room with an inward view. The view wasn't much, but it was very quiet even with the window wide open all night long. The only negative comment I have about my stay was that the air conditioning wasn't on in my room which made it very hot for sleeping. I was advised that this was due to a heat wave (it was 20 degrees celsius in December!) and that they do not operate the air condiitioning at this time of year. Breakfast was typical european buffet style and the dining staff were also friendly. The location of this hotel really is it's best feature. On my first day I walked to the Forum and Colosseum which was about 20 min.

We took a 8 Euro train and then changed onto the Metro (I think at Piramide station? which is only 4 stops away from Termini) instead which was fine, just a little more hassle.

HInt: I HIGHLY recommend getting the ROMA pass at the airport (buy online before you go, pick it up there). For 25 Euros you get free entry into 2 sights (Colosseum, Galleries, etc), discounts, get to jump queues and is a metro / bus pass in Rome. I'd say it is a must and will save you tonnes of money and time. We arrived an hour or so before before check in but were given our standard room immediately.

We had an hour beak for an icecream and coffee and then repeated the tour again. This gave us a clear idea of where everything was and then we set out to visit all the sites on foot over the next few days. We did book a tour for the Vatican Museums, Sistine Chapel and the Bascilica which was worth every cent. The highlight of the trip was our visit to the Pope's Summer residence were we were present at his recitation of the Angelus and received a papal blessing. Again this tour was worth every cent.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reisterstown, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in the city\u201d", "Author": "Robear1954", "ReviewID": "UR115325295", "Content": "Clean, well appointed rooms. friendly helpful staff, great location for public transportation.

The room service menu is a bit pricey as is the mini bar but there are plenty of kiosks, gelaterias, snack shops and pastry shops within reach (less than 300m as you step out of the hotel, turn right and walk along the pavement). An excellent restaurant with good value for money, prompt service and fantastic food can be found on the same road as you come out of your hotel, turn right and walk two blocks up. The restaurant has large white umbrellas and we visited this restaurant three times during our stay. All in all, it was a great stay, nice rooms, comfortable beds, excellent air-con throughout the hotel and in your room (adjustable) and lovely knock-out blinds in the bedrooms (work electronically) which ensures your stay is a comfortable one. Complimentary slippers and bath robes in all rooms as well as a pressure shower and bath system which offers a great winding down session after a long day walking in the heat.

But there should always be an expectation and here it is: On the 17th Dec I was one of those unfortunate BA clients which end up to be stuck somewhere in Europe unable to return to London due to the severe weather in most of the UK. I was forced to spend 3 days in long lines facing the BA ticketing office in order to be registered on another flight that later on will be cancelled and start all over again. Out of desperation together with hundred of other travellers I was forced to commute everyday to and from Termini station and the airport. So my accommodation at the Starhotel Metropole, which was planned to be for only 2 nights, was then extended each day to a total of 5 nights. The frustration and drama of been forced to spend a full day at an airport terminal could turn anyone to despair, but luckily each time I returned to the hotel front desk staff made sure that my original room was re-assigned to me and kept it in case another flight cancelled, at one stage the hotel even provided me with clean clothes (without me requesting it, probably they realised I had a 2 days bag lasting on to 5!). The attention to details was to what you would normally expect from a 5 star hotel anywhere else in Europe, polite service followed by honest concern of your safety and well-being. To conclude, if you ever will be in Rome for business or pleasure and want to be located near the Termini station, don\u2019t hesitate to consider the Starhotel Metropole as you main base during your stay, they certainly know how to make everyone feel welcomed and well looked after. Well done to Starhotel Chain in Italy, to keep up with the investment even in such challenging times for the hospitality industry! Well done to all the staff at the Starhotel Metropole Rome, for keeping such a consistency on their standards and service level! And if you ever end up in Rome (with or without snow falling in UK!), and you need a personal touch, dont hesitate to ask at the concierge for their GM Mr Mauro Polmonari, he will never shine away or hesitate to come to the rescue for making your stay a memorable one whatever are your needs or requirements.

Starhotels Metropole is located about 3 blocks from Termini Station which sounds really nice at first but it's actually kind of out of the way. Also, train stations tend to draw some less attractive segments of society and I saw a lot more people begging and lying on the sidewalk on the streets close to our hotel than I saw in the rest of Rome. As can be expected, the pictures that are on the hotel's website look much better than the hotel itself. It was a bit shabby and the furniture was all pretty saggy in the lobby. In our room, the bed was anything but saggy. It was VERY hard! I fell back on it when we first got to our room and it actually hurt a little bit. We were upgraded to a jr. suite since it was our anniversary, and it was nice to have the extra room provided by the sitting area. The view was nonexistent -- looking out onto the windows of other rooms. The decor was modern and simple and suited us perfectly. The bathroom was nice and pretty big, but the shower setup was a bit odd. There was not a curtain or a door, just a piece of glass that extended out to half the length of the tub which meant that every time you took a shower, the water ended splattering all over half of the bathroom. The drains in the shower and the sink were VERY slow and we ended up standing in our gross, dirty shower water. So, we were not bowled over by the room, but the breakfast was another story. For an included breakfast, they did a GREAT job! We walked in and found that they had eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, cereals, yogurt, and a selection of cold cuts and cheeses. In addition, they had three kinds of juice, coffee, tea, etc. It was fantastic! I probably wouldn't stay at Starhotels Metropole again primarily because it was kind of far away from Rome's center (I would say at least 10 minutes of hard walking, 15 if you walk at a normal pace) and that extra distance really added a lot of strain after we had walked all over Rome during the day. For the value and comfort, you could probably find something a lot closer to good restaurants or to the sights that would be just as good.

ROOM: I upgraded my room to a delux, which, apparently is the same size as standard as we've bene told when checking in but had more facilities so we didnt mind paying a little extra. What can I say! Clean bed sheet, clean room, even the kettle was clean (no limescale). With plenty of teabags/coffee etc. Room was big enough for the two of us. The bathroom was very clean, there wasnt anything broken, or cracked. Not even cracks/stains on the walls, it was immaculate (and I am a clean freak!). Plenty of towels. Bed were so comfty, it was like sleeping on a cloud! We even had slippers, a bathroom robe and a small TV on our bathroom as we had a delux room! what a nice touch. Very quiet, couldnt hear the other guests next door so was able to sleep and relax whilst in the room. Though we didnt get much of a view (facing the other side of the hotel) but we didnt mind this.. LOCATION The location is good too, 3 mins walk to terminal train station (just turn left out the station down the main road, turn on on of the road on the right) Though I couldnt find this hotel when I was walking to it, there was no clear sign posted on the street and I literally had to to a double take to go back! When we entered, the reception was well decorated, chandeliers handing, very posh looking. Reception staff were very friendly. One day, we mentioned that a homeless looking man trying to open my bag on the bus from the vatican, the guy at reception was very annoyed and was ready to call the police! but we assured him that nothing was taken as I caught him red handed! Just proves how helpful the reception staff are if one did need the police. But do be careful when in crowded buses/tubes, its the perfect opportunity for pickpockets to steal. You can see most of Rome within walking distance form this hotel but on some days we were too tired so got the bus on the way back, which runs right outside on the main street. We took the bus to the vatican on day as its a little far from the hotel. If you want to visit the vatican, best to avoid sundays as it is busy, we went on monday and was very quiet and didnt wait too long in the queue for the museum, maybe 25 mins or so. There are a few restaurants within the area, some right next door, on the left of the hotel but we found one of them to be expensive and the food wasnt very good, brocolli was overcooked (wasnt green anymore as it should be) and over cooked chicken (was dry) . If you walk towards the collesium you can find better priced restaurants which we did one day and the food was probably a little better. Though one of them along here charged us 1 euro each on top of our bill, which already had the service charge. We asked why theres 2 euros extra, they said because we sat at the table so its 1 euro each!! there wasnt any other place to sit except inside! I couldnt believe this! But most restaurants in Rome are expensive anyway so I guess we just beared with it. BREAKFAST Breakfast was good, nothing fantastic but the usual things: pastires, bread rolls, tea/coffee, cereal, fresh fruit such as oranges, apple etc. Scrambled eggs were a little too wet/watery so I gave that a miss but everything else was fine. Enough to be satisfied. We didnt eat in the restaurant for dinner so I cant comment. I saw the prices and seemed quite expesnive so we ate outside, as there were plenty of places to eat.

After we settled in, we also discovered that the Metropole is conveniently located close to Rome's public-bus transportation hub. This meant that we could board the No. 40 \"express\" bus at the start of its route and be assured of getting seats (in short supply on Rome's buses). We were also only a couple of Metro stops away from the Colosseum and the Forum.

Our room was big and the king bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. And our room was quiet. We not only never heard a sound from the rooms on either side of us, we never heard any noise from the hallway through the thick door.

The desk clerk gave us an upgrade when we checked in. The waiters at breakfast were all very friendly and one of them practically adopted us. From an American's standpoint, the hotel's breakfast, included with the room, was excellent -- several cereal choices, an assortment of fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and pastries. A large hotel that caters primarily to business people and tour groups, the Metropole is not in the trendiest (or even half-way trendy) part of Rome. But the neighborhood around the hotel is lively and full of decent, affordable restaurants. As we were mostly too pooped at the end of the day to go \"out\" for dinner, this proved to be a godsend.

The hotel is nearby (5 minutes walk) the main trainstation (with metro and busstation), so you can reach every main attraction within a short time. The use of the metro is cheap and efficient. A one way ticket to every metrostation within the centre of Rome is 1 Euro and a dayticket (also to use in the bus or tram) cost 4 Euro pp. The check in at the front desk was quick and sufficient. We told the hotel by email that we would arrive with an early flight, so one room was held available for us after check in. We had 2 double (Superior) rooms (room no. 101 and 102), opposite of each other and with a private entrance that we looked at night for privacy. The view from room 101 was not so nice. The rooms were clean, spacious and they looked renovated. The bathroom didn't have a separate shower, but that was okay for us. Our beds were wonderful. The sheets were pearly white and were changed every day. Furthermore we could pick out our choice of pillows, but unfortunately after calling the front desk and asking 2 times for the pillows, they didn't seemed available anymore. (a bit strange since it was low season, and, to my opinion, a hotel should not offer this service if they can't meet the demands!). Breakfast was okay, but not wonderful. The quality was very good, but not much variety. The cappucino and coffee were great!!! There are a lot of great restaurants nearby (reasonably priced and good quality food). There were 2 persons at the front desk who I really liked. They were helpful and very friendly. Unfortanutely the other persons looked bored and moody. Here's a tip. Watch out for restaurants nearby the main attractions. They offer you special low priced menu's, but the portions are like kids portions and the choice of food is very limited!! Some restaurants also charge you for the bread the give you as a starter. They don't ask you if you want to have it, they just put it on your bill. The prices are ridiculous, we were charged an extra 8 euro for old bread!!! That was more than they ask for pasta or pizza!!! Also mind the service fee some restaurants put on you bill!! Some restaurants add more than 20 %. Rome is wonderful city to explore.

Deserving special mention is the Japanese waiter (Inaki?) who is definitely the star of the show - nothing was too much trouble and his friendly manner with everyone meant a great start to the day. The hotel should make sure they hold on to him - he would be an asset to any good standard hotel! We even had a celebrity presence at the hotel - two of the Osmonds with their families were there for a few days! Location of the hotel was okay - slightly out of the way of the main sights, although transport was nearby. Normally wouldn't have minded the 15/20 minute walk to the main historic centre, but Rome was suffering from a heatwave at the time which made too much physical activity exhausting. We found the buses more pleasant to use than the Metro, and normally caught them from Via Nazionale, just five minutes away. Only slight complaint (and it was a small one) is that the deluxe room we had didn't have an iron & ironing board, which would have been very useful and the front desk couldn't supply one when we asked. Area was okay in terms of personal safety, with enough restaurants if you didn't feel like going far at night. Specially good was Alessio's, just around the corner in Via del Quirinale, which was several levels up from the other slightly mediocre but adequate places in P. Amadeo.

Breakfast each day was tasty - a good selection of pastries, cereals, fruit, yoghurts and cheeses were available (continental), alongside bacon, eggs and small sausages. (I made the most of the continental options, what with it being continental Europe and all - croissants were yummy!) One of the breakfast waiters in particular,was a really welcoming, accomodating and good fun. Even in the cases where staff members are not as 'enthusiastic', they are efficient and courteous. All spoke English; a good job since, I'm ashamed to say, my Italian is minimal. In addition, we ate in the restaurant on our first night, and, although perhaps the price of the meal was above average, I found the food to be tasty and the waiters were kind, and what a laugh we had with them too! Yes, the price for wi-fi is expensive, however, there are two internet cafes nearby. The price of TV films is also quite dear, and no, milk is not provided for teas and coffees, however, cappuccino and hot chocolate sachets are available which do not require milk...or fresh milk can be stored in the minibar fridge. Also, this hotel is part of a chain, with conference facilities, so if you want 'rustic ambiance' or 'a quaint Italian hotel', this is probably not for you...there is nothing that makes it obviously 'Italian', it could be situated in any city, anywhere. Some have claimed that the area is run down, and, in truth, it isn't perhaps as clean and maintained as further into the city centre, however, this has advantages because the street is quiet. In addition, the station is nearby for the metro and sightseeing buses, and there are loads of restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel.

The room was on a high floor so it was quiet, and we had a view over the rooftops. We found it to be an excellent base for exploring Rome. Breakfast was good, and there was a selection of restaurants and bars very close by. The Colosseum was about 10 minutes walk away. The city tour bus stop was just around the corner and we found this invaluable. We bought a 24 hour ticket and we were able to hop on and off the bus to visit all the sights we wanted to see without having to walk up and down the seven hills of Rome! Before we left the UK we had arranged a couple of walking tours online and this enabled us to see the Vatican museums and the Forum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, etc. with a guide.

Having paid for 2 superior rooms, I was expecting newly refurbished rooms however the rooms we were given were small, and much in need of redecoration. I had requested rooms close together as were a family of four. One of the rooms was so small, and I had to double check with reception that it was a superior. There was no air con or fan in the bathroom and it was like a sauna and if you had a hot shower then it was unbearable. The walls were dirty and cracked, in need of a good paint job and the bathroom had the ugly gold mesh ceilings with wires and pipes visible. There were no toiletries in the bathroom and no air con/fan. There was no tv in the bathroom as it states on the Expedia website....and the hairdryer was a relic from the 80's! The towels had seen much better days. In the other room, the air conditioning was noisy and ineffective. When I called reception to complain, they seemed uninterested and were learly not bothered. Even when asking for directions or recommended restaurants, it all seemed too much trouble for the reception staff and this was very off putting. We planned to go to the Vtaican and the Sisitine Chapel on Saturday 15th and when I checked with the staff on reception I was told yes it was all open, however when we arrived at the Vtaican on Saturday, I found that all the museums were closed due to it being a national holiday, and I was very upset that the guy on reception didn't tell us this. Especially as we had spent over 90 euros to get there and back. We ended up going twice as we wanted to see the Sistine chapel even though the first trip had been a waste of time and money. The check in took so long and seemed rather inefficient, and I agree with another reviwer that the staff are rude and rarely smile. We requested extra pillows one night and I was told that we had four pillows in our room so why did we want more....not the answer I was expecting. All in all not the greatest of experiences.

Location: Very close to the station, and convenient for the departing city bus tours and/or the metro/subway or normal buses. Check-in and Check-out: I was underwhelmed by both the check-in and check-out process, which I personally found was impersonal and unfriendly compared to other hotels. Room: The room was a good size, finished to a good quality and was undoubtedly well maintained, however my standard room overlooked a non-picturesque inner courtyard - which, with a small window, resulted in the room being rather dark. Unfortunately, the hotel's single room consists of two single beds (pushed together and made-up separately) and not a double, queen or king size. This, coupled with the hardwood floor, resulted in the bed moving across the room at the slightest movement. The room has the usual facilities you'd expect (tea/coffee, safe, mini-bar, etc), however it didn't include an in-room iron. Housekeeping: I was underwhelmed by the speed of housekeeping service, having placed the \"please make-up my room\" card on the door before 9am I was surprised on my return at 3pm to find my room had still not been serviced. Communal areas: Finished to a high standard, and well maintained. Apart from a lobby bar, and small restaurant, there are no other facilities however. Admittedly, with the large number of fine restaurants in Rome, I suspect your first choice won't be to dine in. However, for convenience, on one evening I chose to - the food was of a good standard and the service provided by the waiter and maitre d' were exceptional.

During the selection process, we had our reservations against the location near the railway station as railway stations are usually rough untidy areas. However our fellow travellers on this site gave to the hotel excellent references so we took the risk. We booked the double room for 100 euros per night, but on arrival the receptionist upgraded the room to the kingsize. This was nice touch indeed. The room size was adequate with comfortable bed and chairs. Bathroom had marble surface around sink, powershower with three different settings was a treat. The room was very clean and tidy. I would make two remarks to the hotel management and travellers. First, we could not do online checking in the hotel as internet in the lobby was quite pricey, 35 cents per minute and in addition vauchers for its use were not available. There are few internet caffes nearby. We used one on di Napoli street just 5 minutes walk from the hotel. They charge 1.5 euros per half an hour. Second, unlike in other italian hotels, morning coffee was plentiful, which would be a good thing if that drink could be called coffee. Here for those who is used to start day with a cup of good coffee, especially in Italy, we suggest to order a cap of cappuccino instead of the coffee pot. The option is not advertised, but good coffee will be delivered without extracharge. There are a lot of restaurants next to the hotel. Most of them are inexpensive with limited choice. In the adjacent street, we found good place di Napoli offering authentical neapolitan pizza. Pizza is baked in the open stove. They also have good selection of salads and sea food. Transportationwise, for those who like taking sightseeng bus we suggest using bus No40 instead which starts from Termini to Vatican through the Rome historical centre. As an illustration, we attached four pictures taken in the hotel room we stayed and showing the view from its window. Overall it is a good hotel.

For all the hotel/motel/b&b options we had, we looked up reviews on this site and were discouraged about the level of service we would find for our budget. Luckily, I came across the name of this hotel, and booked for 3 nights for double bed, breakfast included. Our flight arrived around 10 AM, and the check-in was at 2:00 pm. I tried to call them to ask about early check-in, but couldn't get through their weird phone number. Nevertheless, we were let into our rooms early!! I guess it's all about availibility. Upon arrival, our rooms were 'upgraded' to a deluxe double, but I didn't see the difference- if at all, the room was smaller than I saw on their official website. Although seeing from other reviews, our rooms were big considering the location. Breakfast- They have hot/cold breakfast buffet, with scrambled eggs, coffee, 3 options of juice, many pastries, fresh fruits, sausage links and bacon, etc. We took full advantage of our breakfast there. Service- It was more than I expected. The hotel staff were friendly, and at one point I asked for a corkscrew for a wine we bought outside, and the waitperson from the bar came in person to open up our wine! The breakfast staff were courteous, and the main desk people were very friendly. After a full day of encountering many rude people in the service industry in the city, we fully appreciated coming back to our hotel. Location- Two streets away from the Termini Station. What more can I add? =) Facilities- Hot shower, clean rooms, comfortable beds- sheesh, I can go on and on. Anyways, I would go there in a heartbeat if I go to rome again, but not sure about the other Starhotels.

(You get a very useful map from reception on arrival) We went on a day trip to pompeii through keith prowse which was well worth the 3 hour coach ride to get there, highly recomended. Now for the hotel it was posh, clean and friendly service. Breakfast had a great assortment, we never ate in hotel on evenings went out and the rough amount for a meal is about 40 euros. Hotel room was a decent size, clean bathrooms, comfy beds, sizeable storage space, minibar not cheap. The only problem we had was the tv the only english speaking channels were CNN and sky news with the occasional footie match on skysports in english, oh and a pay per view film is about 15 euros!!

The location is excellent, 2-3 min walk from via nazionale, republica or station termini. Contrary to some opinions the area was fine, quiet, and there were no undesirables hanging around in the area around hotel. Instead lots of tourists til late in night were either dining , walking or arriving at their hotels. The area is completely safe. I believe the problem area is further down south of termini station, but if you are a tourist you will have nothing to do with that area or ppl. All in all for Euros 125. per night it was excellent value. I could not recommend this hotel enough.

I have now stayed at this hotel twice. Last year, late arrival, nice room, and good experience. My partner and I arrived from Barcelona mid day at Termini, which is close, but when coming in from the airport, you are not let out very close. We walked quite a while, then, even as a returning customer (who, by the way had sent them 3 clients during the year) was given this mediocre on a floor undergoing construction. So much for gratitude and loyalty. For a four star hotel, this was a two star experience. The room had a nice bed \u2013 two doubles pushed up against each other. The lighting buttons next to the bed are convenient, but the bathroom was cramped, and it took 6 hours for the room to cool off. Amidst this arrival, we heard banging, hammering on our floor. This is, of course, contextualized by my experience the year before when I had a rather grandiose bathroom. The drapes had a few holes in them, and one of our lamps did not work. The bathtub fell apart twice, but they fixed it only once. This room was done with yellows and greens, which could have been nice if it didn\u2019t feel so cramped. The lampshades seemed old. While this hotel is ideally located next to Termini and the subway, the rooms obviously vary in quality. The front desk staff usually has 4-5 people scrambling, but generally attentive. We noticed a rather large Asian population staying here both years which was nice. The breakfast is nightmare on a plate. They must use powdered prepared eggs, and I would suggest NOT including breakfast as it seems very unhealthy. Occasionally, we could grab some fruit or a roll, but my partner and I would look around the room at people\u2019s faces as they began to eat, and we would have to leave from laughing. This seems to be the standard for Starhotels as I have now stayed in 5 of them in Italy. It would be unfair to report this isolated incident as a typification since our experience that followed in Milan was quite different, except for the wretched breakfast. It is, however, easy to get around from this location, and the blessing is the Murano glass place right next door, where the people who work there are very descriptive, helpful, and courteous to travelers.

When we opened the door to our room, we began to worry about what the other hotels on this tour would be like. The Room: We were given a room on the eighth floor that faced away from the street. I had heard that the rooms in Rome were very small, but this room was the smallest and worst room that we stayed in during our entire Italian vacation (both on the tour and independently). The bathroom, however, was a good size and had wonderful toiletries. Our room had the green carpet halfway up the wall, peeling wallpaper border and very large cracks in the ceiling and along one wall. It sounded very much like the room described by another reviewer here. Judging by the pictures on the hotel's website, we were not given a refurbished room. Our room was crammed with furniture. It contained two twin beds pushed together, two night tables, a small round table and two chairs, a bar fridge with a television on top of it and a desk with a desk chair. On top of the desk there was a tray with a kettle so that you could make tea or coffee. With all this furntiure, we could barely walk around the bed! It was also difficult to find a place to put our luggage. The room was very dark and had a standard eight foot ceiling. The size of the room and the height of the ceiling made me feel like I was trapped in a box. To top it all off, the air conditioning wasn't working and the temperature in our room hovered around 29C according to our travel clock. Opening the window did not help as it was a hot and humid July night with no breeze whatsoever. The front desk staff kept insisting that the air conditioning was indeed working. The next morning we asked other people on our tour group about their rooms. People on other floors seemed to have larger rooms with fully functioning air conditioning. Breakfast: There was quite a choice for breakfast. My husband had the eggs and bacon while I stuck with the pastries and yoghurt. The freshly squeezed juices were self-serve. Coffee or tea had to be ordered from the waiter/waitress. The morning we were there there were two other tour groups having breakfast at the same time. Although the breakfast room is big, it could not accomodate all the people. The serving staff could not cope with all the people either. All in all, I was very happy to leave this hotel.

To put my review in context my husband and I stayed at the Victoria Park Plaza in London which was amazing, the Radisson SAS Champs Elysses in Paris which was fantastic, and the Capo D'Africa near the Coliseum in Rome which was top notch...then for our last night in Rome, the Starhotels Metropole. OH THE HORROR. I'm not being dramatic, this place literally made me itch. There is so much to complain about I'll just bullet point it to save us all a bit of time: 1. No one helped us to our room. No greeting, no bellhop, no one to help us with our bag, no one to explain the amenities...nothing. 2. I guess they couldn't decide between keeping the wallpaper border up, or taking it down, so they just left it in an in-between stage of partially coming off of the wall in our room. They also removed some of the wallpaper border, yet the painted faded on the part of the wall that wasn't bordered, so you can see the difference in color. Which is just plain tacky. 3. And speaking of walls, they were stained, dirty and cracked. I'm not talking little cracks, I'm talking BIG, very noticeable 8 foot long cracks on several of the walls. 4. The ceiling (if that's what you want to call it) is actually the interior, unfinished, inside of the building, yet \"covered\" with this metal, faux gold painted grid of which you can look through and see the interior. A huge chuck of the ceiling fell off, through the grid and onto our bathroom floor while we were there. It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. 5. Don't look up in the shower.

Honestly, if you're going to carpet they walls, at least steam clean them!!!!! OH I'M ITCHING JUST THINKING ABOUT IT!

The break fast is fantastic, the best i had in an hotel, lot of choice (eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, cereals, fruits, croissants, everything you can imagine in a very large buffet). So big breakfast that we never eated at noon, breakfast was suffisent for all day long ! Staff is kind, no problem. And the best, the hotel is very well situated, don't hesitate if you plan to visit Rome, Termini is a very good location as you can go everywhere in the city with ease thanks to the metro. Buy a ticket for a week (15 euros) and you're ok to go anywhere. And the center of rome is not very big, in fact we walked a lot, you can lot of monuments by foot from the hotel. By the way, great shopping in rome for the girls. Just be careful with the italian restaurant, they charge bread + services + water and some charges even the \"table set\", lot of tourist trap. If you go to Starhotels Metropole, you MUST eat at the restaurant Giglio (in front of the theater opera), which is by far the best food and service we had in Italy. If you're looking for a good hotel in Rome, wich deserve his 4 stars, don't hesitate, Starhotels Metropole is a good choice.

We were told that reservations were made for us at another hotel (which was way on the other side of town, completely defeating the purpose of staying at this hotel because we had an early train out of rome the next day). We were obviously unhappy about the situation, but in the end, i'm sure this \"problem\" is not unique to this hotel. Our main complaint, however, was how rude we were treated after finding out that we did not have a room waiting for us despite our pre-paid reservations from Hotels[--] (the couple next to us that suffered the same fate and were on their honeymoon even called multiple times in the days before and had assurances from the manager that their room would be guaranteed). We asked to speak to a manager and were handed a phone to speak with \"the manager\" who had left for the day and was on his cellphone. Apparently there is not always a manager on duty and overbooking is so common that he didn't think to stay to oversee the problem. At one point after we asked them for a refund and told them that we didn't want to be moved to another random hotel, the woman told us that a refund was impossible, but they would cancel the other reservation, adding \"OK, bye bye.\" As if that would be a reasonable resolution to the situation. Clearly it would have been more convenient for her if we had just disappeared.

We chose the hotel, in part, because it was close to the Termini (Rail Station) and we were coming into Rome from Sorrento by rail and then catching the bus back to the airport from the Termini the next day. It was convenient for us to stay near to the Termini. We did have our reservations about the area, as the area around the railway station is generally not the best in most big cities, and my husband was a bit concerned as we walked down the street to the hotel. However, our fears were completely unfounded as the hotel was very good. The lobby and reception area are spacious and quite impressive. The reception staff were efficient although perhaps a bit business-like for some leisure travellers. It is not the most picturesque part of Rome but we felt completely happy waking around even at night. It is about a 15 minute walk to the Colosseum from the hotel but you can walk this along the Via Nazionale which has plenty of shops to keep you interested along the way. We walked back from the Piazza Navona at night and it took us about 25 to 30 mins. By the way, don't eat here if you can avoid it. Although the atmosphere and setting is lovely, the service is a bit slow, the food is only average and you are charged for the bread they put on the table regardless of whether or not you asked for it and there was a 5 Euro service charge added to our bill as well. There is better food to be had away from the really touristy areas at better prices. We had a room on the 7th floor and it was fantastic. Looking at the floor plan on the fire escape map, it seemed to be one of the largest on the floor even though we had only paid for a standard room. The room had a separate living area with sofa, tv and tea and coffe making facilities. There was also a spacious bedroom with the biggest and most comfortable bed of all the hotels we stayed in during our trip. You could also ask reception for a range of different pillows, should you need them for back or neck conditions. There was no noise at night and we had a good night's sleep. The bathroom was again large with a whirlpool bath and a lovely powerful shower. Complimentary toiletries of a good standard were provided. There was even a set of bathroom scales and a mini TV in the bathroom! There was also a electricity socket in the bathroom next to the mirror and the hairdryer for all those girls who can't live without their hair straighteners like me! Bathrobes were also provided. Some of the other reviews of this hotel said it was in need of repair and attention. From our experience, this is unfounded. The hotel and room was spotlessly clean. Perhaps some of the carpets in the public corridors of the hotel had been worn a bit but they were still kept in good order. It was certainly in a better state of repair and more newly furnished then the hotel we stayed in on the first night of our trip to Rome. We did not eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on that. The only few things that we would say is that if you want internet access you must pay for it by the day which can be expensive. There is no free internet in the lobby or a designated room as there is in other hotels. Breakfast is not included as it was in the other hotels we stayed in in Italy during this trip and there wasn't a view from our room (although from this part of the city, I don't think it would be possible to see any of the major sights anyway).

The convenience to the Termini is very useful also if you wish to take some bus or rail trips out of the City e.g. we took a trip to Assisi on the train (which was much cheaper than taking an organised tour) . And you can pick up the city bus tours from there also. We were upgraded to a beautiful large double room on the 9th floor. The bathroom had lots of nice toiletries with the added touch of a bathrobe and slippers not forgetting the mini tv in the corner. The weather was still hot and humid so we appreciated the very good air conditioning that was most user-friendly to operate. Don't forget when you open the windows the air-conditioning goes off, the helpful security man pointed that out to us. Our room was cleaned everyday as well as fresh sheets and towels. We greatly appreciated our mini fridge where we kept our own little snacks cool. The hotel also as a very nice restaurant with friendly and helpful staff, we enjoyed two of our evening meals there and both were excellent. The restaurant is spacious with a little hint of luxury, you do feel your are dining out. I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel or indeed Rome, the only quibble would probably be; that a week is not enough!!! One hint about the sight seeing. When we went to the Colosseum on Sunday the english tour had just begun so by the time we would have queued we would have definitely missed it. But as luck would have it we were approached by an english speaking 'Green Tour' guide and we took their tour instead. It was a little bit more expensive but worth every penny. Our guide was most informative and amusing they also give a free complementary tour of the ancient Forum. We also wished to visit the Catacombs so it must have been providence that we met this tour group because, right after the Colosseum guide, they had another trip going to the Catacombs, which for us was an absolute must. There is so much to see and do in Rome and therefore time is of the essence that it was great to be just taken to the Catacombs arriving just in time for the english tour. It was a truly spiritual experience. When you get your bearings you can walk quite easily from the hotel to alot of the tourist sites. The Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica is just around the corner and is very, very beautiful. One last thing, there is an audience with the pope every Wednesday and is completely free and we found heading for the Vatican afterwards just fitted in very well. Also , when we went to Saint Peter's we found the official audio guide so helpful enriching the whole experience. It goes without saying we flung the coin into the Trevi fountain, once is never enough to visit the Eternal city.

Earlier reviews refer to not feeling safe etc - essentially what they are alluding to is the fact that the streets nearer to termini has a few african immigrants either selling fake handbags, or just loitering and passing the time away, or there is the occassional arabic internet cafe, indeed at the other end of via principe amedia the street is littered with bangladeshi grocery shops, resturants and internet cafes, likewise the whole of via flippo turati (which is parallel to the termini) is populated by Chinese businesses - so if your averse or frightened by immigrants getting on with their lives - then stay away from termini - otherwise it's quite safe. As soon as we arrived at the Starhotel we were upgraded immediately - didnt even ask! - Mario F (who is usually the concierge in the day will sort you out, he's also the most objective and caring and will advise you honestly on any travel plans you have rather than fob you off with the standard responses like the rest of the staff do. We were placed on the 8th floor, all the 3 lifts smelt of food - presumably from room service not having their own service lifts and using the guest lifts - so the smell varied from day to day depnding on what food had been ordered that day - leaving a constant stale stench of food in the lifts, the communal area on the 8th floor was dreary, worn carpets like the lifts, but luckily no smell in the corridors. Our room was excellent - i recommend upgrading to a suite to be on the safe side, everything was clean - almost new, definitely refurbished, there were 2 downfalls - no view - only a view of the rest of the rear building accomodation, and we were close to the lifts - round the back of one - so we could hear the lifts going up and down anywhere in the room, but we were out most of the time and the quality of the room offset the disappointment. The breakfast in the morning is really just cold and continental. They have scrambled eggs only, no toast just rolls and firm baguettes, the bacon and sausage is too wierd tasting to count as such, the rest of the food although cold is ample if you get there before 10am. Mario the concierge gave us lots of guides to Rome so that helped - but Termini is terrible for eating out, in fact i didnt come across one good resturant from Termini to Piazza Spagna! - i think this may be due to the fact italians like eating at home, that 99% of the resturants are tourist traps - you know you're in one if you pay more than 5 euros for pasta (and the menu is in English) but then in this area you have no choice, i'm well travelled and trust me when i say Rome is not the place for good food, maybe if you ventured out of Rome away from the sites you may well get proper italian food that is not cooked frozen food - which alot of the food was. I can only recommend one resturant near the hotel - that is turn left out of the hotel, left again into via viminale, straight down and adjacent to the fountain is a resturant which is out of the way, ok food but not great - but the best in the termini area. As for drinks after sight seeing or shopping - go to the hotel opposite - Hotel Diana it has a roof top garden pub/bar - go straight in and ask reception for the lift to the roof garden - the drinks like hotel prices are 4-5 euros for a glass of wine, half a lager, or any spirit with mixer - its the best place to chill out near the termini area - all in all the hotel and location is satisfactory, you can get to anywhere from termini because that is the only place where the only 2 underground lines in rome -red and blue tube lines intersect (be warned the underground shuts at 9pm!) and where you can get any bus you want, and of course you dont have to haul your luggage around when you arrive/depart from the airport into rome. Oh yes i recommend the no110 tour bus to see all the sights to see what interests you and then go back and explore in more detail the same day - 13euros for one day pass. all in all I probably wouldn't stay in Termini area again because i hated the food, and i would have liked to be closer to the shopping and sites in Spagna or Barberini - which is where i would stay next time.", "Date": "September 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich", "Title": "\u201cSimply excellent!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3841920", "Content": "The hotel is in a good position, nearby Termini station.

None of us felt in any way unsafe in this area during our stay though, and the streets around the hotel were pleasant to walk along whatever the time.

They deserve better surroundings to work in! The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The breakfast buffet was ok and the range of food available was good. Now the bad stuff. The room I stayed in had an air conditioning system which leaked water through the light fitting. Nice! The room had clearly had a damp problem at some point. Furthermore the walls were cracked. The room looked to me as if it had not been redecorated for about 10-15 years. Some highlights of the impressively 80's decor included....a gold plastic mesh ceiling (see photos), peeling wallpaper, a wash basin mounted in faux marble plastic wash stand, and half carpeted walls which were stained with something rather unpleasant looking. The curtains would not close at all. However, there was a working blackout blind to compensate or I would have been forced to change rooms. There was kettle in the room, but no milk! Overall I would say that the hotel has probably once been very nice and furnished to a high standard, but on the basis of the room I stayed in and the somewhat faded grandeur of the communal areas, I think that the hotel is long overdue a refurb and would suggest that you give it a wide berth until some serious cash has been lavished on it.

I paid about \u00a37 more per night, but for the slightly higher price I had a modern, well appointed room in a better location for seeing the sights.

It was like a larger UK hotel room, very modern in styling. One frustration was that the three-speed fan control for the air-con didn't seem to make any difference to the noise it made, and I couldn't sleep with it on. As another reviewer has pointed out, the air-con goes off when you remove your key-card from the slot in the room, but we got round this by asking reception for a second card which we left in the slot in the room when we went out in the evening. Result: nice cool room when we returned and I could turn the air-con off to get to sleep! In our room we didn't have problems with noise from rooms around or above us as some have reported; we were located on one side of the hotel so avoided the street-noise problem (but don't expect to get views of Rome from this hotel - our window faced the next-door building a few metres away!). It was also very clean and relatively new, not as per one recent report posted on this site. There was refurbishment work going on so it may be there are older rooms on other floors. Some people have expressed concern about safety walking the streets around Terminii station. This hotel is at the north-west end of Via Principe Amedeo and the immediate area seemed quite touristy and safe, with street-side cafes in abundance. One evening we walked the length of the street and it changes character as you go south-east - if you are nervous, then I'd avoid going much further along than Via Gioberti, four blocks away. Access to the main train station, the metro and the bus station is very easy; we visited most sites in Rome using the 64 or 40 buses that go between Terminii and the bottom end of St Peters, and/or the metro. With a three-day pass this was easy to do. You can also walk to some of the attractions, but don't forget that Terminii is at the top of a long rise if you plan to walk back! Breakfast was good, other reports have accurately described what is on offer. We never had to queue but August in Rome isn't the busiest time of the year for hotels. We did encounter several Japanese tour groups during our stay. We never ate an evening meal in the hotel, but used some of the pizzerias and trattorias in the surrounding area.

The hotel is very old and needs alot of repair. The location is great. There are a few other hotels across the street (on Via Principe Amedeo) that seem nicer, but I don't know. DO NOT purchase your rooms here without looking at it first. Also, when you leave the air turns off automatically.

I must say it was an excellent choice. The location is very good being about a 10 minute walk from the major sites such as Trevi Fountain & the Coliseum and easy walking distance to and from the train station were most of the connections from the airports arrive. Upon check in at the hotel earlier than the stated check in time we were upgraded to an 'Executive Room' without even having to ask. The check in staff were very friendly and informative. The room was excellent very modern and contempory with excellent decor and amenities. Also the bed was very comfortable as other reviews had previously stated. The only criticism I could find was that the noise from the room above could be heard when walking on the wooden floors and moving chairs etc etc, but the room itself really was excellent and a very good size for a European city hotel.

This web site was instrumental in helping us to choose to stay at this hotel and I am pleased to report back that it was as good as we had hoped. Excellent and quiet location in a side street, within walking distance to the Termini and main streets offering good shops and restaurants. We stayed in a twin room on the top floor (9th). Our window opened out into a courtyard arrangement with rooms on the other 3 sides and the stained glass ceiling of the bar below. We were therefore facing inwards, not overlooking any streets, and it was very peaceful. The room was decorated to a good standard, very clean, with good supplies. We even had slippers! Breakfast was good - ample choice, although don't expect much in the way of hot food. We found the staff at the reception desk to be extremely polite and helpful in providing maps, directions, and good recommendations for restaurants. As 2 travelling females, we can also say that we felt reasonably safe and confident in moving around the city - although you shouldn't rely on taxis to get you back from anywhere, especially late on a busy Friday evening! We waited at one taxi rank for nearly 2 hours. We used the Metro during the day. It is unbelievably cheap and easy to use, and it takes you to quite a few of the major sights in the city. I would also suggest either a very good guide book or the services of a guided tour. We went a little blindly to some of the sights and would have liked more information as to what we were looking at! I hope to return to Rome in the not-so-distant future and would definitely stay at this hotel again. A great hotel - good value for money, and a wonderful holiday.", "Date": "May 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "Shutter_Bug", "ReviewID": "UR3374474", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here because the pre-season prices were very good and the location was incredible (near Roma Termini train station).

I saw a strong sophistication on the part of the staff and many of the people staying there that I didn't always see in what one would call the more \"luxurious\" hotels that I have visited. As with some I questioned the hotels nearness to the Termini station,but when I arrived there I found it to be extremely convenient because one could come directly there from the airport and walk to the hotel if they chose to. Also, the subways are right there as well as trains you could take for other cities. There are very good restaurants in the area and if you felt like walking you could \"stroll\" to some of the famous landmarks.

That is probably because it caters to Japanese tour groups. The Japanese collectively have the world\u2019s highest standards for hotel amenities, and it shows at the Metropole. Our room was large, classy, and recently remodeled. The bed had a modified futon mattress that was the best I slept on in Europe. The hotel is located about 3 blocks from the main railroad station: a 10-minute walk. The railroad station is also a bus line and subway hub, so it\u2019s not hard to get around Rome from there. The main downside to the hotel is that its neighborhood is far from charming. There are a remarkable number of one- and two-star hotels in the area and a great many restaurants that serve overpriced, mediocre food to the unsuspecting tourist hordes. The area seems run down but not seedy. We walked the streets with no fear for our safety. I got the place on Priceline for 2 nights @ $120/night, which was a value. We ended up staying a 3rd night and paid 160 Euros: about $200. Across the street from the Metropole, at the Hotel Diana, there is a lovely outdoor bar on the roof. Flanking the bar are two elevator shaft towers, which you can climb to enjoy the view. The Roman skyline is not terribly dramatic, but we went up there with a city map at sunset and were able to spot a number of landmarks. It seems to me that almost no one knows about that little bar. This location was virtually deserted the 2 times I visited. It\u2019s a nice place for a drink and the antipasto table.
