The room was very spacious, large bathroom, large closet, trouser press, safe, flat screen tv, tea/coffee making facilities. Cant comment on the breakfast as we thought that it was over priced so did not have breakfast in the hotel. The hotel throughout was very clean and well kept. As I have seen in a few other reviews the air conditioning was not working in our room (617) so the room did get quite stuffy at night. Check in was speedy, I thought the girl at reception would give us a map and go through some basic directions/places of interest but we were just handed our room key card, so we called later for information, which was very limited, I felt that she didnt want to spend too much time with us even though there was only 1 other person waiting at the reception. The M\u00e4rkische Museum underground stop is right outside the hotel which is great for getting around Berlin, as well as being straight forward to travel to and from Schoenefeld Airport.10 mins walk to the Museum island and a further 5mins to Alexanderplatz. The complimentary 2 beers and 2 waters is a great perk in your room daily.

Pros: -Location is convenient to walk to restaurants in Nikolaiviertel and a supermarket down the street. Hotel is within 20 min walk of Alexanderplatz, Museum Insel, or Gendarmenmarkt. Also it is located right next to the M\u00e4rkische Museum stop on the U2 U-Bahn line, which means you can get anywhere on the west or east side of the city pretty quickly. -We love to drink water, which can be tough to get for free in Europe, so the two free bottles of water were much appreciated (beer too!). -Room cleaning was friendly and punctual every day, and the front desk staff were also helpful to us whenever we asked about something. Rooms are a fairly decent size for Europe. Cons -Wifi signal in the room (which you get for free 1hr/day) is pretty much nonexistant. It does work pretty well in the lobby though. -Beds are a little soft for my taste -As good as the location is, we would have really enjoyed having a nice cafe for breakfast right outside the hotel.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cSCAM reservation front desk System\u201d", "Author": "dolldetails", "ReviewID": "UR126067194", "Content": "Ok watch out what you book.

I was late for the breakfast and though snacks and were till left no coffee was served, so I asked for a cup of coffee, but as I was in hurry I couldn't wait till they bring. During check-out this coffee (8EUR) was included in the bill but when i just said that I didn't drink it they simply and easily discard it from the bill. Very pleasant approach. Second, on the previous day of my leaving, I found that my key doesn't work. At the reception I was told that it was a mistake and they thought I have already checked out! I have only one hand case with me and practically no any items in the room. It was very disappointing especially when I thought they made-up the room in which little things were left. But as it is really an excellent hotel, after 3-4 minutes I was in the same room, got apologizes, and was given my mobile charger left in the room and even one piece of special apple pie which was left from the previous evening and I did not want to eat this second piece, but even it they carefully stored as it was bought from outside shop and was in a box.

It is also my opinion that in 2011 (now 2012) free unlimited WiFi in the rooms should be an obvious comfort. In this hotel we got one hour per day for free and then we would have to pay. This should usually be enough, except that with the login-system in the hotel I never managed to spread the one-hour access over several 5-minute periods, and we could only use one device at a time. Too much hazzle when all we wanted was to check if we had new mail and maybe set a new facebook status for five minutes using our smartphones.

Otherwise, staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel would have been good value had the room temparature been within guest's control - something I would expect from a 4 star rated hotel.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Meath,Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location in berlin\u201d", "Author": "Bobafetts", "ReviewID": "UR118102072", "Content": "Lovely, clean modern hotel right next to Markische Museum U-bahn, (two stops from Alexanderplatz) yet in a quiet area.

I chose the hotel primarily due to the good reviews in Tripadvisor and its affordable price. Glad for that decision. Good location, peaceful and yet central (2 subway stations away from where the action is - Alexanderplatz), good service, friendly staff, we were upgraded so we had a room with living room and view of the river, spacious room. We did not eat breakfast there because it is expensive for small breakfast eaters, I read the selection is good though. The hotel is very good, I highly recommend it and will stay there again if I return to Berlin. Just two minor suggestions for further improvement: it would be helpful to have an alarm clock/clock (sidebed) since visitors would always want to see time; and more coffee, sugar and creamer when replenishing. These are very minor details which will make guests even more satisfied. The pillows were too soft for my taste but it was my fault I did not request for other types (they can change, upon request). Thank you and more power to Derag Grosser Kurfuerst. With regard to Berlin as a city to explore, please do not miss the rich historical value of the place. Holocaust will definitely affect you in gloomy way but that is history and we should be aware of what happened then with the hope that awareness will make us avoid the same incident in the future. The East/West Berlin history is also captivating. Checkpoint Charlie and Potsdamer are two places worth exploring. The Free Walking Tour is good to try - a 3.5 hour tour with good general overview of Berlin. We ended up giving as tip the same amount a real walking tour will cost but it is good way to reward the guide(s) who deserve same for the professionally done job. Bus 100 will give you chance to see what you should see. If you are interested to go to Reichstag (Parliament), please remember to book in advance and you should have proof that you booked (print confirmation). Do not forget to bring your passport. This is one thing we missed because we relied so much that booking would be enough and did not have our confirmation letter with us.

The Berlin subway was very easy to use and ran about every 5 minutes during most times of day. While it was very easy to get to the action, the immediate area around the hotel was very quiet. This was great for getting some rest, but not so great for finding an open shop in the evening. The rooms were quite clean and the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. They spoke excellent English and were able to help with any requests I had. The complimentary gummy bears and beer in the room when you first arrive were a nice touch. I did have two issues during my stay: 1) The card reader in my room malfunctioned on the first night, flickering my appliances on and off. This was quite annoying! Fortunately, the staff placed me in a new room right away. 2) The two rooms I was in both had windows that opened into the hotel lobby. Since neither the lobby nor the rooms had air condition, the rooms were rather hot! I slept very closely to the fan provided in the room. It was cooler outside, so having an outward facing window might have remedied this. Though the rooms themselves were a bit uncomfortable and could use some upgrading, I was impressed by the level of service that I was provided, and the hotel's location was perfect.

First point is that it is in the Mitte district which really IS a great start point for the vast majority of sights and things to do. The actual location of the hotel is just brilliant in a good, semi-residential area with a very pleasant 'feel'. Down a fairly quiet side street, the Markisches Museum underground station is quite literally outside the door, so it's perfect if you feel like hopping on the tube rather than walking. The hotel itself is smart, staff know what they're doing and the rooms are well appointed with fridge(not mini-bar) that includes free welcoming bottles of beer and water, comfy beds and pleasant, bright bathrooms. The public atrium which also doubles up as the bar, is impressive as it is the full height of the building, some six floors. Breakfast at time of writing was \u20ac14 per person per day. We did not bother, and walked to the end of the road to Millie's Kitchen, a nice little caf\u00e9 that offers a good selection of breakfasts at very reasonable prices. Next door to Millie's is a small supermarket that's very well stocked, has a bakery, and sells everything for a breakfast picnic in your room! Within a short walk are lots of places to have breakfast so it's worth just going out and seeing what takes your fancy. Again, there are so many good restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel, that we never used the hotel's own restaurant. The only blip and it is small, is that the bedroom was very warm even though it seemed that the heating was not on. This might suit some people though we opened the window -very wide!

I still recommend buying the \"kleingruppenkarte\" if you are party up to 5 persons, it will give you unlimited transportation for a day and Berlin is large so you don't want to walk around to the different places - instead use the excellent U-bahn and S-bahn system.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "northampton", "Title": "\u201cA good base for exploring the city!\u201d", "Author": "diva80", "ReviewID": "UR50091822", "Content": "Location and price were our main factors in choosing this hotel, we nearly booked the smaller sister hotel Henriette across the road due to price, but upon reviews we chose this one, and we were not disappointed. From the airport we took a train to the hotel (had to change once) to get to the Markisches Museum U bahn station, and the hotel was literally right outside the station! there are 2 exits, so take the one that says Nikolaiviertel to get directly near the hotel entrance... The hotel itself is clean and fairly modern, the reception staff are friendly and speak good english. We had booked our standard room through Expedia, and the reception said for an extra 10 euros a night we could upgrade to a larger room on the quiet canal side of the hotel. Personally, I would have thought they should had given us a free upgrade, but we took them up on the offer nonetheless. Our room was on the 5th floor, nice and spacious, and tastefully furnished. The room had tea/coffee making facilities, plenty of wardrobe space, and a desk, comfy chair and table. Surprisingly although it was a double room, we were given two single beds pushed together, and two individual duvets - not very romantic! There is a distinct lack of toiletries on offer, apart from soap and a dispenser in the shower for a 2 in 1 shower gel/shampoo concoction. So don't forget to bring your shower cap, body lotion, cotton buds, and anything else you might need! The shower was pleasantly powerful, and there was a nice big sink. There is also a mini bar in the room, though we didn't take anything from it. There are plenty of channels on TV, but not many English speaking ones. We didn't eat in the hotel, and instead chose to have breakfast in Alexanderplatz station, which is not far by train, and have plenty of variety of food on offer... better than spending 14 euros for breakfast in the hotel, very expensive! Berlin itself is amazing, and there is plenty to see and do! We stayed for 3 nights, but would have loved an extra day or two. Some of the good things we saw: Jewish Museum, Checkpoint Charlie Museum, Reichstag (with amazing dome designed by Norman Foster!), TV Tower, Berlin Dom (Cathedral) and the East Side Gallery (largest intact section of the Berlin Wall). We didn't eat dinner in the hotel so can't comment on that. But if you like Thai food, theres a lovely restaurant called Good Time near Oranienburger Tor station. Nice romantic atmosphere, and really nice food. We also visited a kebab/pizza place called Grill und Schlemmerbuffet in Rosenthaler Platz. Kebabs were nice but a little different from kebabs in england (this place didn't do lamb) but the pizza there was amazing! Very fresh and tasty, and the staff there are great... A popular snack there is Currywurst, a chopped fried sausage with curry powder and ketchup, usually accompanied by some french fries. Sounds strange but pretty tasty and good for a snack! And of course, there is beer a-plenty in Berlin, so you must try this. If you're not big on beer, another alternative is a Berliner Weisser, a sparkling type beer, which you can have with a shot of red or green sweet syrup... One thing we noticed in a number of small eating places that the German's generally like customers to take their plates and cups back to the desk, especially if you've been to a cafe type place. As a clue, I just watched to see what other people did first! We learnt a few german phrases, but found we didn't really need it as pretty much everyone spoke really good English... I thought the hotel was a really good base for exploring the city, as even though its in the business area, from Markisches Museum station is really easy to get to other stations and areas... We purchased a Berlin Welcome card from the airport for 72 hours for 25 euros, which gave us use of the trains, and discounts in certain places, such as the Jewish Museum, Checkpoint Charlie Museum and the TV Tower. To use it, you need to validate it once in the boxes on the platform.

The hotel was very easy to find. It is situated in a more quiet part of Berlin right next to Spree River. The hotel has parking facilities 150 m up the Street in Fischerinsel... at least so it said in the hotel information in our room. I asked about parking when we arrived, and they advised us to park in the Wallstrasse just across the hotel, so we never found out until the last day. It was very easy to get a parking space very close to the hotel. We arrived aroung 11 am, but we noticed that there were always free spaces just outside the hotel. Tickets cost 1 Euro per hour from 9 am to 10 pm, so 13 Euros per day, if you want to leave the car there during your stay. Remember to bring coins or EC card for the ticket! We got a room with Spree-view. The room size was pretty much standard for a German hotel, and the beds were very comfortable. Generally the hotel was very clean. Our room was spotless. The bathroom was also very nice and has a bathtub, which was a pleasant thing after walking around in Berlin the whole day. Breakfast was ok: basically scrambled eggs, sausages or bacon, bread rolls, croisants, hard boiled eggs, fresh fruit salad, yoghurts, coffee, tea, juice and the usual selection of sliced cheese and ham. 2 days we had our breakfast buffet in the restaurant instead of the breakfast area, because it was too crowded, but that wasn't a problem at all. We spent about an hour in the wellness area downstairs at the hotel. It's open until 10 pm. They have a sauna, steam bath and a cold water tub. If you find the steam bath not very hot and steamy, try pushing the switch outside the door! You can borrow bathrobes and towels for free at the reception desk. It's also free to use the lockers in the wellness area. If you walk about 200 m from the hotel towards M\u00e4rkenisch Museum you will find a very small store, and if you cross the river and walk about 200 m towards the Berlin Dome, you will find a super market. The hotel is also near the Berlin Dome, the TV-Tower, Nikolaiviertel (old jewish town) and the Red Town Hall can be reached within a 5-10 minutes on foot. And the U-Bahn station \"M\u00e4rkenisch Museum\" (U2) is right outside the front door. This U-Bahn will take you directly to Alexanderplatz (TV Tower and much more), Kurfuerstendamm (main shopping street, the Zoo and Ged\u00e4nkniskirche), Potzdammer Platz (Checkpoint Charlie and Berlin Wall), Stadtmitte (Gendarmenmarkt). We recommend that you buy a Berlin Welcome Card. With this card you get to travel arount Berlin by bus, train and U-Bahn for 2,3 or 5 days. The card gives you a 25% discount on the hop on - hop off busses in Berlin. These busses will take you to all places of interest in Berlin and they also give you a nice impression of the city if you just want to stay on the bus for a full 2 hour trip. Also, you could take a boat trip and save 25% on the ticket. We went on the evening bridge trip, which was very nice. However, don't eat onboard. The food is not very expensive but also not worth the money! Alltogether we had a very nice stay at the Hotel Gro\u00dfer Kurfuerst. Our only complaints would be lack of information about the parking spaces, very expensive internet and only in the lobby and the room service. We tried to order room service at 10.30 pm. First they didn't pick up the phone. Then we got the reception staff to transfer the call. At that time they told us that the kitchen was closed even though the signs said that room service was available until 11.30 pm on one sign and 1 am on another. Oh, and one last thing: The staff at the hotel was very helpful but not everyone spoke English very well, and some didn't even understand English. Good thing that we speak German as well!

WOW!! What an upgrade indeed. The Derag Grosser Kurfurst is an amazing hotel. The first thing that caught my eye were its impressive atrium and majestic bronze horse and rider mounted 3 floors up. The rate for the double room we reserved for 4 days varied from \u20ac89 to \u20ac220, the highest being New Years Day. But since we were upgraded to a junior suite, our suite would normally have been \u20ac122 whereas a standard double would have been \u20ac89. The junior suite does not appear that much larger than the typical double, but it's the way the room is furnished that makes it so homely. The room comes with cable tv, phone, armchair, coffee table, pants press, electronic safe, and electric window shades. The fully stocked kitchenette comes complete with fridge, microwave, coffee maker, dishes, flatware, sink, colander, etc. The bathroom is bright and spacious, though it lacked amenities you would expect from a hotel of this type such as specially branded lotion, shampoo, and conditioner. Other perks included in the room rate were the hot breakfast buffet, and use of the wellness center which consists of exercise equipment, massage room, tanning beds, sauna, steam room, and hot tub. The location of the hotel is fantastic. The u-bahn station is right outside. There is an Indian restaurant across the street, as well as a German restaurant across the bridge. A little bit further down the street is an internet station that charges \u20ac1/hr. There is a small supermarket located at the far end of the street which also hosts an awesome doner kebab stand. The Australian, Brazilian, and Chinese embassies are also within walking distance. My only gripes are that breakfast seating is often limited, internet access is very expensive, and that bathroom amenities are lacking. Aside from that everything else is great.

Overall, excellent value for money. After a day of sightseeing outside in very cold weather Berlin, it was a pleasure to come back to the hotel and relax downstairs in the wellness area. The rock sauna was in full operation (even over Xmas!), as was the steam room & showers. The recliners were great to curl up with a book in between the heat experiences. Fitness gym, Key lockers & towels all included. All the above were included in the cost of hotel; the solarium was a bit extra (6 euros i think), which we ran out of time ot visit. They had massages, treatments etc also available for additional cost. The sauna was huge, but steam room smaller. The pool which resembles a jacuzzi is actually a cold water plunge pool!! We had swimsuits on in the sauna, but the locals (germans) who were staying at the hotel were all 'au naturel'!!! The rooms were a good size, very comfy pillows, excellent power shower (missing it now that i'm back at home!), lockable safe, and cozy warm room temperature. The bathroom fixtures & fittings were basic (not fancy), but were definitely adequate for how little this hotel + flight cost. There was a fixed unit on the wall for shower gel/shampoo which you had to squeeze a bit hard, but manageable. Towels were thick, but not super-long/large. However, definitely adequate. It's not a 5 star hotel, so you shouldn't expect 5 star luxury/decadence, but it was definitely excellent value for money for a 4 star hotel. I give it 4 stars because of the wellness area downstairs. Without it, it would be a 3.5 star hotel. Another bonus was that it's right outside the underground tube station so very convenient. It was very easy to get here on the public transportation (bus) directly from the airport. I would recommend purchasing a red \"Berlin Welcome Card\", which entitles you to unlimited travel for 72 hrs, including to/from airport & discounts off museums etc. Excellent value for money vs. taxi, which takes just as long to go from airport to hotel. Breakfast was very expensive (14 euros per person) with minimal vegetarian selection. Instead, i would highly recommend having brunch or dinner at one of the many veggie restaurants in berlin (eg Samadhi restaurant, or Good Time restaurant). See my reviews on www.happycow.net. There were no veggie items on their restaurant menu for dinner, however, directly across the road in Hotel Henriette, there's a restaurant called Shezan which did, and was convenient when tired / strapped for time. The reception staff were very helpful in locating items on a map, making dinner + concert reservations. Check out the hotel's website which is very helpful.

The hotel is literally next to the underground (dont worry you cannot hear a thing, and we were the closest room to it) which is great when your tired after a great day of sightseeing and all you want to do is chill out :) The hotel is situated in a quiet businessy area, it is easy to access the whole of berlin within a few minutes. The rooms are nicely presented, spacious, comfortable, have good facilites, large bathroom, nice choice of tv channels, and dont smell funny. The overall hotel has nice decor.

Oh, and also bring hair conditioner and shampoo, the bathroom facilities are good, but it is just an all in one body wash, and shampoo thing. Also, it was a bit annoying that a 'double' really means two single beds put together, it tends to take away the intimacy, and they just give you two single duvets rather than one double duvet.

Don't bother with Checkpoint Charlie - its a fake! Literally... 3. Dont bother eating in - go out and see the world.... this includes beakfast! its cheap but filling! 4.

I called the front desk to ask how to turn it off, and I discovered that a) one does not have individual control over the systems in each room as a guest and b) while they could turn my heat down, they could not turn it off. I then opened the window wide. This, in turn, led to a lot of street noise coming in. I travel a lot, and I had probably the worst night of sleep in any hotel the past year. It does no good to have a clean place and a good breakfast if you are tired the next day when you meet your client.", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cToo much \"OK\", but no \"WOW\"\u201d", "Author": "Writerwriter", "ReviewID": "UR15636135", "Content": "I stayed in the hotel room - so maybe I'd have felt different if I'd stayed in one of the apartments that are also offered. First, the good things: it's just steps from the U-bahn metro. It's immaculately clean. Bathroom has a large tub. Staff were friendly enough. The room is large. well decorated and beds are comfortable. I think we had one of the better rooms, overlooking a little green scrap of park and facing south. The worse points wouldnt have mattered if it had been a cheaper place, but for the money it's just that I have had better value elsewhere. (There was too much \"OK\" and no \"WOW!\" in other words.) The buffet breakfast was OK - the scrambled eggs were burned yet were still put out for the guests to eat. Not a great selection of cereals, breads, etc. not bad, but just ....average. The bedside lights weren't comfortable to read by, although there was plenty of lighting. The district, though not far from the centre, was sort of suburbanl, not many places to eat locally if you didn't want Indian or the hotel restaurant (after the burned eggs, I was wary of the latter) and there was no vibe to the district at all. There was an electricity saving system in the hotel which is theoretically good - but it meant you had to remember to put your key in a slot as soon as you entered your room, so the electricity would keep working. I kept timing it wrong, putting the key in before the room door was shut, or forgetting and then being in the bathroom when the electricity suddeny went off, etc.! Towels were barely adequate, small and thin. Toiletries OK, nothing luxurious. I just didn't feel it was a hotel I wanted to return to, but if you're already booked there, don't cancel ....I think you'll find it is okay even if does not thrill you. .", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel\u201d", "Author": "AhVienna", "ReviewID": "UR14853680", "Content": "Great location for exploring Berlin.

The location is a little far to walk to Alexanderplatz but the U-Bahn is really like 20 steps from the hotel. We took a deluxe apartment but with the short stay option rather than the hotel. That saved us about 30% off the price. Apparently the difference is that the rooms are only cleaned twice a week and breakfast is included. The apartments have a kitchen - a FULL kitchen with cutlery and plates cups and glasses and a dining table and everything you need. We bought food and made our own breakfast. We were pretty tired when we arrived so we ordered room service. The food was a bit pricey and ok quality. The apartment was big and clean and neat. The TVs are small and the choice of english language programs was incredibly poor. Thats not really the hotels fault - it's a German thing. The staff were polite and efficient most of the time. The safe in the room is tiny - too small for a laptop. That was annoying. The wifi is pretty expensive, especially when they say they are a 4 star hotel and nowadays I expect free wifi in a 4 star hotel. A week of wifi cost about 70 EUR and the download rates I was getting were only like 20 or 30 k/s so we couldn't really stream video on the laptop either. Podcasts came through fine though. Their authentication system would cut in every few hours and kill any downloads you were running as it resets. That was a pain. The aircon & heating is seperate from a ventilation system that works all night whether you want it or not. The fans were a little noisy and kept my wife awake on the first night. The next day we called, and they got a technician to turn it off only for our room. We also needed their help to get the heating system working. There are no instructions in the room and control panels are pretty useless without someone explaining it to you. There is no temperature control. The parking was about 150 m. away from the hotel. We had sunny weather most of the time but I can imagine that being a long 150 m. in the wind and rain. Next to the parking is a supermarket that actually had a pretty good range of organic foods. Just down Wallstrasse there is a shop that specialises in Australian food. It has some really nice things. I can recommend the Tasmanian Leatherwood honey. Its pretty strong but there is nothing like it on some toast with a little butter. On checkout, they said we had used the minibar which was not true. They immediately removed the minibar items from the bill. Overall, I would recommend it - especially for a family trying to get a nice, big, clean room for a reasonable price. With a few changes it could really be a fantastic place.

We got it included in our package price which by the way was only 70 Euros per room per night for bed and breakfast (early bird offer from hotel itself) The lobby area is small but impressive as it is open all the way to the top of the hotel (6 floors) and the rooms are off a gallery landing around it. The bar is in this lobby area and be warned is only open from 6pm onwards. Complimentary coffee seemed to be available in this area from breakfast time onwards but was never there when we arrived back from a day of sightseeing.
