The room was very clean and looked liked it had been renovated recently. Really nice bathroom and little balcony. The staff did not speak much English at all but they were nice and helpful. The biggest negetive is that this place is hard to find at night and they don't give very good directions. Take these instructions with you if you go: Basically, from the train station, you should exit the station doors on the right hand side onto Via Marsala. Turn Right onto Via Marsala, then left onto Via Castro Pretorio. Now here's the tricky part. The hotel is on Viale Castro Pretorio (not Via) Via Castro Pretorio becomes Viale Castro Pretorio so keep walking down Via until it becomes Viale at the stoplight. At the stoplight, contine straight, you will see a big sign for Hotel Enrico-this is where you want to go as Serendipity is in the same building. Simply buzz at the gate and they will let you in.

I traveled with a friend and had a wonderful time and decided on settling on this location for my last night prior to my departure back to the U.S. Finding this \"hotel\" was the first problem. There is no clear signage and is located on a major corner with other businesses and hotels. The location was close to the Termini (main subway station in Rome) but was in a very dangerous part of town with other low end hotels. After a long day of traveling from Venice, I entered the gates and could tell from the get go that this was not what was advertised on TripAdvisor. Fear was my first reaction since the courtyard is extremely dark and, as I mentioned, hotel is located in a not so nice part of town. I got to the reception area and was greeted by a young man that said that he had been trying to get a hold of me on my cell phone wondering where I was at. It was 7:30 p.m. and I had emailed the hotel a week in advance (and they acknowledged receiving it) that I would be there approximately 7:00 p.m. The hotel attendant then proceeded to tell me that my hotel was actually in another building and that he needed to know right away how I was going to pay for the hotel since he would be departing immediately for the evening and that there is NO hotel attendants during the night for anything, including emergencies. Only phone numbers are posted in hallways in case an emergency occurs. After lugging my suitcases up a elevator that fit only myself and one suitcase at a time, we finally found our room which was sparse to say the least and very disgusting. The beds were actually cots. I found two fleas immediately on my bed and there were several mosquitos flying around since the windows had been kept open. My friend was bitten 5 times during the night by them and I was bitten twice. The bathrooms were also disgusting with only 1/2 role of toilet paper provided for two people and no way to get additional supplies. The hotel smelled of mold. I chose not to take a shower since I felt cleaner than getting in a disgusting stall that obviously hadn't had a good cleaning in quite some time. We looked into getting something else immediately after entering the room but since it was a Friday evening and late, we could not find anywhere and had to depart for flights 9 hours after arriving anyway so we decided to stick it out. The only upside to this location was that the front desk did reserve a taxi for us early the next morning (which arrived on time) and we were able to depart this disaster before the hotel attendant arrived for the morning shift at 8:00 a.m. I highly recommend AGAINST this place and continue to be baffled by the reviews.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest", "Title": "\u201cGood location, basic services\u201d", "Author": "elche74", "ReviewID": "UR45599334", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights, and we were satisfied.

It wasn't easy to locate the Serendipity, at the gate I found its name amongst the residents and after pushing the button the gate opened. The reception and the rooms were in different buildings, and the reception is not 0-24 hours, the guys there are only between 8-20. We arrived later but I wrote it on the booking form so they waited us. The check-in was OK, they told me how would we find the room- it was a bit tricky. The room was OK, with a larger and a smaller bed, SAT TV (even with a Hungarian channel), A/C, mini bar, small safe, large bath. Everything was tidy, but in the bath they should fix a few things. I found Wi-Fi signal but didn't know the password, and didn't found anybody in the reception at 19.45 to ask. The window looked to the street which was noisy, but the good windows reduced it. The breakfast is not in the residence but in a close bar, it consists of a cake, a coffee and a juice. Not too much but good for starting the day.

Yes there is a main way to cross to get there- in Rome drivers do not know what these white lines are, so you just need to go and they have to stop. Thats the way in Roma. Arriving through the gate turn left and you will find reception desk. I was greeted by smiling and very helpful staff - did feel very welcome at all times.

My room (301) was on the 3rd floor in the next building (big single or small double), clean, big bathroom, small showercabin, a tiny balcony with view to the yard. A good standard room for Roma. Aircon did work perfectly. Notes on Serendipity: 1) There are few rooms next to the reception area (ground floor), the rest is situated in neigbour building on the 3rd floor. 2) Elevators are tiny (very common in European cities)- and you need to remember to close all doors in order for the next arriving guests to use it!!!! It is noted in the cabin it self in several languages. 3) The rooms does not have phones- so if you need help or need to contact the staff, you need to go down by elevator/stairs and find the reception. 4) Breakfast is not served at the residence itself- you need to go out and cross the busy street in order to get your coffee. I did not try it- so can not comment on standards. 5) When situated near a main trainstation you meet all kinds of people- a few homeless people etc. Would not consider this area as seedy. No worries. 6) as you probably know, Rome is incredibly expensive- if you need to buy water etc. Get out at Termini, turn right and you will find a SPAR-supermarket (Called DeSpar in Italy). 7)Termini Station- here you find many thing in food, newspapers, shopping and transportation to airports. Just in front of maindoors you will find busses, Metro and sightseeing coaches. I do recommend The Serendipity Residence for its great location, decent rooms and rates.

We walked from Termini train station (which wasn't very far). If we ever travel back to Rome we would stay there again for sure. You never know what you'll get in a hotel room and we were pleasently surprised.

We arrived at 10:00 pm, coming from a flight at Ciampino. We walked from Termini. It was a 5 block walk and was easy to find. We buzzed in and with a little help from someone else entering, found the entrance. The desk clerk couldn't have been nicer. He immediately brought us some cups of juice and signed us in. The room was right off the lobby area. This was fine as we were only there for 1 night. The room had no view and was small, but was immaculate. There was air conditioning, t.v., good sized bathroom with hot water. My husband was sick with the flu, so we didn't go far for food. The area is not one that I would stay in if I were going to be in Rome for any length of time, but the Serendipity and the people couldn't have been better for our purposes. There was also a breakfast included. I would definitely recommend the Serendipity.", "Date": "May 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawrenceville, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "DaddyB_USA", "ReviewID": "UR7293673", "Content": "I booked the Serendipity in 2006 for my family's 5 day trip to Rome.

Heat and cooling worked very well. Being a small hotel, noisy guests could be heard but it was reasonable. The facility was SUPER CLEAN. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable.
