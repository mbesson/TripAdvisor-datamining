Airport and train stations a bit run down, and in places a tad dirty, but city itself seems quite nice but very business like and not as touristy as I was hoping for.I would not venture out much after dark walking around in this downtown area, unless I was with others. We used the train, and went direct from train to hotel, not so bad (other areas are better).Tried to check in early (my wife was getting over a cold and wanted to sleep after the red eye flight) but hotel was (supposedly) fully booked so we could not get a room until just past 11 AM (normal check in is around 12 noon to 1 PM), sitting in the lobby for 3 hours. At first, the front desk lady was a bit abrupt (possibly overwhelmed with the hotel being full and her being alone on the desk), but eventually warmed up into a nicer human being.Hotel a tad expensive for what you get, but being downtown is convenient, especially being across the main train station, though everywhere is easy access by train (especially day pass) so this turns out not to be that important.Internet is way too expensive (everywhere around the area too, it seems).Room was not as spectacular as other similar priced hotels in other countries, but I cannot compare to others in Frankfurt (just passing through 1 night), but it was also okay to stay in (though with really dated furniture, possibly by choice).If staying 1 or 2 nights, there is a 2-day train pass that is more economical than buying single day passes.Breakfast was typical western and local fare, and acceptable.", "Date": "Apr 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR357247428", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "NorthernComfort"}, {"Content": "Very handy location I stayed in the Manhattan for 2 nights with my wife ,daughter and daughters friend. We had 1 double and 1 twin room both a very good size for a city hotel and both comfortable and very warm after walking round the city all day .Our visit was for the opening ceremony of the Christmas market and we had an excellent time in Frankfurt in general which was much nicer than I had expected.To be honest I had wanted to stay in one of the more Boutique hotels like the Concorde or Townhouse but had left it to late to get a room at a reasonable price. That said I would say the location of the Manhattan is better as being directly opposite the train station you are away from the red light district (just) rather than in the middle of it like most of the hotels seem to be.We more or less managed to avoid the red light district all together by using the public transport system both tram and underground which stop outside the station about 50 metres from the front of the hotelThe decor of the Manhattan is a bit dated (80's ) but very well kept, and the breakfast buffet was great with a very good selection of food and help full staff.The reception staff where efficient and friendly and booking in/out could not have been made any easier. To sum it up if I was returning to Frankfurt I would certainly stay here again rather than I can't wait to stay here again, But may be that's the difference between a city and a beach hotel", "Date": "Dec 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR697169338", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "itsonlymoney"}, {"Content": "Manhattan is Wonderful! After one night at the Steigenberger Hotel Metropolitan (see separate review), we switched to the Manhattan Hotel and what a wise move that was! For 75 euro per night we had a very large room with a king size bed, a sofa, a desk, a table, two chairs, a large closet, a very up-to-date bathroom, and 2 large windows. In addition a wonderful breakfast was included each morning. The staff was extremely accommodating and the decor was very modern with, of course, a Manhattan theme. If you're in Frankfurt for just one night or a week, this is the place for you if you're interested in being close to the Hauptbahnhof which is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. While the trains are very accessible, you can walk to just about anywhere in the city from the hotel in a relatively short time.The only quibble we had was with the lighting in the bathroom - should be brighter.

I stayed at the Manhattan for a couple of nights. It is located accross Frankfurt's central train station, which is good if you came to Frankfurt on business, or staying there for a short while, and would like to have a functional, simple, hotel close to the Bahnhof (you don't need a taxi or anything like that / just cross the road). However, its location also means that the street is not really quiet (I had trouble falling asleep because of drunken people shouting down the street - and my windows were shut); it also means that the neighbours are a fur factory and several travel agencies representing the world's favourites dictatorships (not kidding here) and most importantly, that the whole area is too dodgy to let women or children walk there alone after dark - full of prostitutes, strip clubs, drug dealers, etc. As for the rooms, they are simple and functional (but not as amazing as the hotel presents itself on its website, Hotel Bristol in Frankfurt is much more impressive). The lobby is a bit small, and the lift is really tiny. If you're obese and have suitcases with you, others will have to wait for the next lift. The staff is very friendly. The breakfast is disappointing, but only because someone here has written that it is amazing. It is not bad, but it is certainly not that good. I've been to several better hotel breakfast - no warm breakfast was served at all (I like eggs/bacon/mushrooms/tomatos for breakfast, at least when travelling), except for hard boiled eggs. They did have cheese, salami, fruits and cereals, so if you're not into warm breakfast, maybe its not *that* bad... The waitress was a bit rude : she accidently spill juice on my wife, but only vaguely apologised, and then did not clean the table until we've asked her to. There is a great hotel, not really far away - Hotel Bristol. If they have vacancies there, I'd prefer it anyday, despite Manhattan's location near the Bahnhof.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR639007034", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Verrrrrrrrry good Hotel We had a verry nice stay at the Manhattan Hotel.The staff was friendly and we had a good breakfast.

I doubt if this is possible on a weekday. All the major downtown sights are within walking distance. The night manager, who also doubles as the bartender, has been unfailingly friendly and helpful. The new day manager was a bit gruff but did her job. The free European breakfast had a wide selection and was more than enough and the staff was quick to pour a second cup of coffee.

Terrible!!! For a hotel named after a great American city, they don't like Americans much. My husband and I stayed here two nights on our way to Paris. We spent 10 days in Germany and a total of 35 days in Europe this summer. We were in Riga, Latvia--Amsterdam--Berlin--Koln--Frankfurt--London  Paris. We traveled to Europe because I had to go to an academic conference in Riga, Latvia. This hotel is terrible. The one terrible place we stayed during our whole trip! A real let down after our great experiences in Berlin. The staff at this hotel are very rude and disrespectful. We paid for the breakfast buffet through Expedia, but hat to pay extra once we arrived. The bread selection was stale and seemed to be day-old stuff. The attendants watch you as you make your selections at the meager offerings of a breakfast buffet but are never around to bring you tea or juice. They make the American guest feel very unwelcome. Both my husband and I speak German as well as other languages. My husband was an exchange student and actually is very fluent,however, several of the staff members could not understand anything that we said in any language. Very unwelcoming and unhelpful. It is located in a bad area of Frankfurt that is loud and crime ridden~ although we were not robbed~you feel like you are staying in the bad part of town. The internet connect does not function in the lobby and the carpets in the room were dirty. The beds are uncomfortable and the bed frame was broken which left a big sort of U shaped area to sleep on. My husband and I woke up facing each other, smashed together in the center, with back aches,sort of like sleeping in a hammock! Bath room was clean but no ventilation and only one bath towel and one hand towel provided~so one person will use a wet towel to dry off after taking a very low pressure shower~a boiling hot shower~the temperature of which makes it hard to wash your hair! In the mornings, the maid staff come into the rooms early unannounced and if you try to stay in the room to read a book or write~you might be interrupted several times by the cleaning staff who let themselves into your room unannounced to perform checks.
