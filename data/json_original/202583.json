The hotel is quite run down, as is apparent on the furniture which showed big dents and scrapes in the wood of the tables and night stands. One really wonders what people did in those rooms to damage the furniture thus. Cleanliness is a big minus. One constantly had the feeling of uncleanliness there, which shouldn't happen in a 4.star hotel. The carpeted floor in our room was quite dirty. Big red stain in front of my bed. I told myself it was merely the spill of a reddish looking drink. On my more pessimistic days it looked like a gigantic blood stain... Bathroom: huge greenish water stains on the floor of the shower, and yellowish stains in the toilet made the whole bathroom appear unclean. Also kind of funny that the shower did not really have any doors to close, so the water kept spilling out on the floor. Caused a flood every time one showered.

Lots of signs of faded grandeur and indifferent maintenance around the place . For example, elevators that creaked and moaned, nasty water stain in tub and a shower head that shot jets of water in every direction, a room key card that had to be reprogrammed twice. No fun to come back to your room after a long day tramping around Rome and being unable to get in. Breakfast was filling but most of our party complained about the quality. I had no problem filling up on scrambled eggs and sliced ham with decent bread and borderline croissants. But, breakfast was served until 10 AM and the basement room was bright and clean. What more does a guy need? The elevators creaked and moaned but we never waited more than a minute or two for one to come by and there is none of the button overkill one sees in American models these days. The staff functioned pretty much the same as the elevators, grumpy but the job got done. On the other hand, when we asked a desk clerk/concierge about reservations to the Borghese Gallery she went right to work, made reservations, and told us all about getting the 910 bus at a stop 20 feet from the Hotel door. The hotel is in a reasonably posh neighborhood but isn\u2019t close to the heart of the tourist sites of Rome. There are, however,a couple of very affordable eating places on the same block as the hotel and at least one very good restaurant a couple of blocks away. I imagine you get more and better food for the money here rather than in hotels closer to the main tourist areas. There is a train station (Euclide) a short block from the main hotel entrance. After a short ride to the next stop (end of that line) you exit to the street and walk maybe 50 feet to the entrance to the Rome Metro (subway, tube, T). The Metro takes you to most of the sites in a quick two or three stops. All for a ticket with unlimited transfers (for 70 minutes) that costs one Euro. The Metro is better than London but not as good as Paris. You shuffle around a bit but routes are well marked, escalators worked, trains ran frequently, and the atmosphere was never scary. Thus the problem of the Hotel Regent being a bit far from the center of Rome is negated by the way it fits into the Rome public transportation network. Perhaps people staying only 1 or 2 nights in Rome would be better served by staying closer to downtown but we were there for a week and could afford to spend a little time on trains. We booked through Durgan Travel out of Boston so I can\u2019t comment on the value of the Hotel Regent because we don\u2019t know how much Durgan paid for our room or how much a comparable room might cost.

We arrived at the regent and were promptly sent down the corridor to book in at the adjoining Grand Ritz, the desk staff gave us a room and told us to go to the restaurant for breakfast. The room was on the fifth floor reached by one of two lifts licenced for six people. The room itself was about ten feet square overlooking the street and had a small bathroom which had definitely seen better days. The window was single glazed, very loose and had a drop down wooden shutter. The first night was spent listening to the local boy racers spin wheels and race round the adjoining square, Saturday night was like being in the pits at an F1 race with a few motorbikes thrown in, the noise level dropped at around 3.30am. Breakfast,we attended the restaurant and were sumarily sent to a basement area with several hundred other guests. Over the next three mornings we were exposed to drinks stations with no cups, juice machines with no juice, scrambled eggs some mornings not others, tinned fruit cocktail, one morning with only de-frosted sliced bread as the sole bread option, not a toaster or any other warm item in sight. We eventually complained and were allowed in the restaurant which was as we expected but with only seats for about 30 people it is obvious what the management strategy is. We witnessed guests asking to have a dirty table cleared so they could sit down to be told by the young man parading in a suit that it was not his responsibility. Locked and chained fire doors, smell of drains, surly unhelpful staff, I could go on.

Having said this, in my opinion, that is all it has to offer. It is listed as a 4 star hotel, never! Our first room had the black out curtains hanging off the rail, the windows (which were suppposed to be double glazed ) had cracks in them, there were no plugs in either the bath or hand basin, the towel rail was very loose,a lamp shade was missing from the bedside lamp and there was a awful smell in the bathroom. Why we did not change immediatly I do not know but perhaps being British we decided to \"make the best of it\" and the smell in the bathroom did seem to dissipate. When we returned to the room after out evening meal, however, the smell had returned with a vengeance so we decided enough was enough and went to the reception to complain. They said they would send a technician to investigate. This turned out to be somebody dressed as a porter carrying a fresh air spray which he used in the bathroom telling us the smell would be gone in 5 minutes. At the end of this time the smell began to return so once more we contacted reception who once again said they would send somebody to investigate. The second person also arrived with a spray and this time he did not get off lightly. We pointed out all the faults in the room and he agreed that we should change of room but that nothing could be done that night as the hotel was full. We,therefore, spent the night with the bathroom door firmly shut listening to school children in other rooms shouting to each other via the windows, which they could open. Apparently we were told that the hotel is often used for large parties of children. In the morning we were given a new room and the hotel did move our things for us. Compared to the original room the new one was great and even had a balcony! It was, however, not without its faults. For example the bathroom door knob came off if pulled too hard, the shower doors wobbled and threatened to fall off their runners if not closed with extreme caution and the bed was not very comfortable having a mattress that was too big for the base. Still, compared to the other room this was paradise. We were booked into this hotel as part of a choir who were sing in in Rome.

Also we found there we no resturaunts nearby so ate at the hotel every night, this wasnt a problem as the food was lovely, a great choice and not too overpriced, but it would've been nice to eat out at least once. Rome is a fantastic city and I would love to go back, I would certainly consider this hotel again, but would try to find one of a similar standard a bit closer to the main attractions.

The staff in the hotel were hit and miss- one person hung up the phone on me when I rang from the room, while another lady in reception couldn't have been more helpful. The breakfast each day was just okay with sliced ham, cheese and salmon. Also a selection of breads, cereals etc were available.

We used it once or twice, as we ducked the hotel restuarant. Rome anyway is full of pasta places, so why get ripped off by the hotel? To the left out the hotel entrance is another tiny pizza place, which does takeway and sells bottled water. The subway was 1 euro per trip or 4 euros a day. Keep the hotel card with you, because sometimes the taxi drivers don't know the hotel as it is a bit outside the centre. Once they had the name, they all used GPS to navigate there.

We did have an encounter with one waiter once, when we ordered the bottle of wine at dinner and waited for a long time to get it and when asked him again, were told we never ordered anything. Breakfast was fine exept juice was not good, but I liked the coffee and the pastries. The location is fine although not as close to city center as I would like. It was a little noisy from the street traffic but we were so tired, we did not really hear anything. The view from our room was great (we stayed on the 9th floor). Oh, one little detail, the elevator only goes to eight floor and it was quite a challenge to take our luggage using the stairs to the ninth floor. The rooms could use new furniture and carpet but well.. Overall, the stay in this hotel did not spoil my impression of Rome but I probably will not stay there again.", "Date": "October 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, VA", "Title": "\u201cDon't Go There!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3289735", "Content": "Very noisy with many students on spring break and not controlled--running up and down the stairs and yelling out the balconies.

Some kind of liquid trying to imitate orange juice. Maybe diluted orange flavoured pill, i do not know. 2) In the first room we stayed, there was terrible noise from outside. Having a shower proved to be a nightmare since the the water flooded as the hole was clogged...We asked to change room. 3) In the second room, STILL NOISY, the bathroom was ok but the air conditioner was not working properly and the atmosphere was uncomfortable, not cozy at all. The beds had only a single thin blanket and u couldn't get warm during the night. The water in the shower was warm (in the evenings only, see below) but not hot. So having a shower was made out of personal hygiene, the pleasure of a hot bath was completely out of the question. IN THE MORNINGS THERE WAS NOT EVEN LUKEWARM WATER(!!!) 4) Browsing pay tv channels is charged. There is no notification that u are charged. In decent hotels it is clearly stated that if u want to see a pay tv movie u just have to press \"ok\" or your room number. In Regent u are charged by this indirect way. On top of that, when we saw our bills online via tv, the result was zero. At checkout, the clerk insisted we pay 22 Euros (11 per day) JUST FOR BROWSING!!!!Of course we refused to pay for movies we did not see. When we explained that the fair system charges when both sides agree (by e.g. typing \"ok\" or room number), they replied \"that's the system\". Of course they knew that we were right and when they saw we were not stupid they gave us a block of paper and asked us to sign that we did not see any pay tv movies. So they did not manage to make full of ourselves. And generally it is an old hotel deeply in need for a renovation. Gives a vivid impression of impoverished and decadent aristocracy.

The more reviews I read the more worried I became but I need not have been. The hotel is probably more like a 3 star than the 4 star it is listed as-we found the hotel to be comfortable-the staff we spoke to were all helpful and polite. The breakfast was fine and is complimentary within the price you pay. We payed around 80 euros per night for our room and if you can get it for that sort of price it represents good value for money. It is located in the Parioli district or Rome and to get there you need to get to Flaminio metro station then take the ferrovio urbane one stop to euclide and the hotel is right at the exit of the station. A one day travel card will cost you 4 euros and it wirth getting-also getting to and from the airport you might want to get a bus to ciampino then the train to termini which costs 1 euro for the bus and 2 euros for the train and leaves you right in the centre with metro connections onward-all in all if you want a decent hotel in a good location for a cheap price you will get this at the regent.

We took our 9mth old daughter, and weren't impressed. The travel cot (ok, they supplied one as requested) had no base, so the legs in the middle created a small mountain over which a mattress (of rolled up blankets) was draped. They did replace this with a slightly less bumpy, but rather old cot once we'd complained. They don't have a kettle in the hotel (not even one!), so if you're needing to heat baby bottles, you'll enjoy collecting hot water (in the ice bucket or teapots) from the coffee machine in the hotel bar from the grumpy barman, unless it (the coffee machine) brakes down. We were anticipating walking into the centre of Rome, as we like walking, but the route in is not well lit after dark, and further than we expected (25-35mins to P. del Popolo). We opted for the train mostly but difficult if you're returning to the hotel after they stop running, which seemed to be 22.45 not a problem for us, but maybe useful info. I'd agree with some of the breakfast comments below, but it seems luck of the draw as to whether the staff are helpful/friendly - we had one friendly/helpful breakfast waitress, but mainly not. We had no hot water one morning - we couldn't find out why.

Rome is a very noisey city, if you want quite go for the upper floors, and ask for one away from the lifts. The location is right next to the tram to the metro station and only cost 1 euro, location was not a problem. By U.S. standards it would be a 3 star, but by what we saw it was in line with 4 star hotels around Rome. I almost let the guest with problems change my decision to stay here, I am glad i did not.

Service a nightmare despite on one occassion 2 staff for every guest (we counted 10 staff for 3 couples on our last morning) 4.) Advertised as having a gym, but actually there was none. 5.)
