That was not the case when I arrived. The hotel was sold out, an NHL game was on and they are very close and handy to the Rogers arena, for all you hockey fans!! I think they gave me the last room, which was on the 3rd floor right by the elevators, and right out the window was where the construction zone was. Now to be fair, in very tiny print they wrote the following on my thank you for booking : As a downtown property, city construction is part of our urban environment landscape. With that said, there is a new development project within our vicinity. We are committed to providing you with the utmost of comfort and superior service. Please feel free to contact us with any special requests. I think that handing out ear plugs upon check in would be a good idea. Since I wasn't given an orchid room,(the 10th floor is called the orchid floor and has special amenities for us ladies!)the night clerk had sent up a basket of these goodies, which was very nice. The bed was very comfortable ,and the room very clean. The check in service was pleasant and efficient and really only said the orchid rooms are based on availability at check in, and a request is not a guarantee even though I'd been assured of it when I made the reservation on the phone. And they would move me the next day. It should not have come as a surprise to be woken up at 7:30 to jack hammers.... but it was! And I know it isn't their fault. Hence the ear plug note at the beginning. I wonder if they could inquire with guests at check-in , if they were early risers or hoping to sleep in..and give out the rooms accordingly. I had an important medical appointment, and had hoped for a quiet gentle start to my up coming appointments. I just left my room as quickly as possible, besides the noise , the wireless internet (also free, thank you), kept cutting out. I left my packed bags, as I was told they would move them to my new room while I was out. When I returned in the late afternoon, I was given an orchid room... What a treat.. Better linen, a comfy sofa and several magazines too. But no bags. The desk clerk couldn't find them. I suggested he look in my old room, and he showed up with them shortly thereafter. If I had had this room for both nights , my review would have had top rating. This room was on the opposite side from the construction, thank goodness. When I checked out, I asked what the policy was regarding giving out the rooms. No real answer, although I was given the managers card and told he would be able to answer the questions better. It was great that parking was included in the price too. I definitely will go back again. It has a lovely look and feel.

We were in Vancouver for 9 days and after 2 at the previous hotel, we had to check out. Checked into Georgian Court and it was lovely! We did have a small issue though. We called from the other hotel to make arrangements and spent a few hours repacking all our things and getting lunch before heading over to Georgian Court. When we arrived, we were told there was a problem with our reservation and the King room we had booked was not actually available and that we'd have to take a room with 2 double beds. We were set on our king bed though and we had to pay an extra $30/night to upgrade. Despite this being the hotel's fault, we received no compensation but rather had to pay more. We didn't even get a phone call once they noticed the mistake to warn us. However, we were pretty much over it when we saw our exec. suite, just like it looks on the website. The bed was comfy, the room was spacious and clean, and they have Aveda products. Deluxe sized in the suites :) There is a Lady's floor on the 10th floor, but we were not on that floor. I asked if I could have one of the gift baskets that come in those rooms and it was no problem! Housekeeping brought a huge basket with all your hair tools plus hairspray, pantyhose, InStyle and Vanity Fair, and other girly essentials. It was a nice treat indeed! It is really about the little things that a hotel does, and Georgian Court has it covered with their special touches, the robes and slippers, the complimentary umbrellas, and the service whether we needed a corkscrew or whatever, it was at our door in minutes. Oh and did I mention location? It's 2 blocks from the Stadium-Chinatown skytrain and International Village shopping center. If it's yucky out or you don't feel like walking, the complimentary shuttle takes you anywhere you need to go as long as it isn't busy. You can always make a reservation though. Oh, and they had the best fitness facilities I've seen in a hotel! A free weight set with a huge weight machine and all the basics- treadmill, elliptical and bike. Also towels, water and a TV, but I don't know what's with the TV remote, that thing is ginormous.

We just stayed for a weekend and were very impressed. We had a corner suite, which they upgraded us to (apparently since occupancy over the weekend was not high). Everything about the hotel was comfortable and well thought out. For instance, there were two sets of disposable earplugs in the room. The location is not noisy, but is right across the street from BC Place and Rogers Arena. Presumably the ear plugs are for people attending noisy events at these venues. The room also had two robes, slippers, free bottled water, coffee and tea along with the coffee maker and rapid water heater. There was a mini-fridge, and (God bless them) no mini-bar. My wife was thrilled with the Aveda toiletries, and the sheets were so soft she asked housekeeping where she could buy them. The decor of the hotel is bright, with tasteful carpeting and wallpaper. The hot tub and steam room were clean and worked well. Equipment in the exercise room was health club quality. Staff at the front desk was consistently pleasant and helpful. It was rainy, and the hotel had an ample supply of umbrellas for guests to use. There is an Italian restaurant attached that looked nice, though we didn't try it. The location can't be beat if you don't mind doing a little walking. We walked without difficulty to Yaletown, Chinatown, Gastown, and the shopping areas along Robson. The hotel offers bicycles for free customer use (we inquired, but didn't use them). We've stayed at a number of hotels in Vancouver over the years, and the Georgian Court rates high on the price/value scale. To be fair, we benefited from a special rate offered by one of the coupon sites, but generally available rates for the dates we stayed were still very reasonable.

While it's not directly downtown, the location is excellent - close to the Stadium/Chinatown SkyTrain station as well as the water taxis to Granville, so it was super easy to get around. It took about 10 minutes to walk to Robson, hardly a big deal. I suspect the hotel would be considerably more expensive if it were right downtown. There's a lovely waterfront park just a couple blocks away. Yaletown is also nearby, and there are a lot of interesting restaurants there. I was very impressed at how customer service-oriented they were even before we checked in. The week before our stay they sent us a personalized Guest Folio that offered ideas about things to do in Vancouver. It also highlighted all the amenities and services of the hotel and stressed their willingness to assist with reservations for dinner, spa treatments or site seeing excursions. It seems they really care and want to go out of their way to make your stay an enjoyable experience and not just another hotel stay. If you're celebrating a special occasion like a birthday or an anniversary during your stay, it seems like the staff would be willing to accommodate special requests.

We found the Georgian Court hotel online and decided to book. Seemed like very good Value. We got to the hotel early and didn't think that we could check in. Our cab pulled up and we didn't see anyone outside to help us with our bags, (being girls away, we had a few each) but the guy at the front desk came out and gave us a hand. So nice. He brought us in, laughing and joking with us the whole way. Instantly we felt comfortable. He was really casual and it's nice to see that attitude when you get to a hotel. Thinking we were going to have to store our bags and wait a few hours, the desk agent, (Daniel is his name) found us a room right away on the ladies floor. Even gave us an upgrade at no cost saying he didn't want us to have to wait until check in time. So nice! We went to our room and were pleasantly surprised. Love the touches and the idea of a ladies only floor. I travel for business as well and if I had the option of staying on a ladies floor all the time, I would jump at the opportunity. I have to say, the hotel's exterior is pretty drab looking, the lobby is overwhelmingly beige, but the rooms were great and oh my god the beds are incredible! Very centrally located. They've got a decent hot tub free internet that actually works and a great hotel restaurant too. After we settled in, we went back down to the desk to find out a little more about the hotel and the city. Daniel recommended us some amazing restaurants, and managed to get us a reservation at one of his favorite spots. It didn't disappoint either. The boy knows his food! He also got us on the guest list at a club for after. Check out was easy, but we were sad to leave. This stay was great from start to finish. We had an incredible time in Vancouver and The Georgian Court was the perfect stop over before the wedding!

We got into room at about 330am after attending dinner and a concert. As we were lying in our beds sleeping. Security knocked on our door telling us that we had to leave and that they would escort us from the room and out of the building because they received a noise complaint. No warnings or anything. This was at 5am! Except for the long walk down to our room at the very end of the hallway, would be the only noise we agree to.. Did they want us to tip toe to our room? There are no CD players or IPOD docks in the room and the TV was off, so aside from recapping the night with a few giggles, I find it hard to believe we were making that kind of noise. I am almost concerned if their walls are made out of paper mache.. We have all traveled together before and this was by far the WORSE hotel experience of our lives. The security were so adamant that they be able to go into our room to ensure there were only 3 occupants. It was us 3 ladies who were all in our pajamas and privacy completely INVADED!! They walked around and were absolutely rude and invasive! This was apparently an all women floor (The Orchid Floor) and we were led to believe that it was. While discussing options outside of our room with security, a MAN in an adjacent room opened his door and asked us to keep it down. If anyone is to blame for the noise, it would be how the night time concierge handled this whole situation. He executed such POOR hospitality and customer service that it has turned what had been a great night to an absolutely horrible nightmare!! We are grown women and not a bunch of teenagers, treated so unfairly! Two of us are mothers who were seeking refuge in a mini weekend getaway from home.. Only to find ourselves more tired than if we had just gone home and woken up to our children in the morning!! None of us were being rude, we only questioned the basis of their reason to remove three women out of their room at 5am! To add insult to injury they called the police (how embarrassing!), when the police showed up at our door they were much more pleasant to talk to than security or front desk! They even apologized for having to do this call and thanked us for following the new drinking and driving laws and told us to go back to sleep! We only wished that they were there from the get go because it was obvious who knew how to do their job and who didn't!! If you are in Vancouver for a concert, game or anything that involves a fun weekend: DO NOT CHOOSE THIS HOTEL!! You will regret it as much as we do!! Side note: Bathroom is outdated. You literally have no room to bend and the toilet is questionable! Vanity is way too small, which had the only sink so if one were to wash their hands the person using the mirror had to move.

The rooms were roomy, mattress very comfortable, the sheets were of high quality, towels were oversized and the bathroom was stocked with Aveda products. Another thing I was delighted with was that the tub was deep, wide and not fiberglass. Several water bottles were in the room at no extra charge and internet access was free. Water bottles are also available at the front desk for the taking which is great for sightseeing. A newspaper in a cloth sack was hung on our door each morning. The daytime staff was very knowledgeable about what bus stops, water taxis or walking routes to take to various sites, and they will provide you a city map. There are three restaurants: a grill, a bistro and fine dining. We ate in the Bistro for both a breakfast and one evening meal; both meals were excellent, but we thought a bit overpriced (until we ate elsewhere and discovered all of Vancouver is expensive). They make their own ice cream and the pistachio was to die for. The hotel provides a free shuttle during some hours of the day, but I would suggest that you make a reservation to use it, especially around dinner time, as may already be booked. The Georgian Court is within walking distance of the Yaletown, Chinatown and Gastown sections of the city.

Nonetheless, the metro or bus are right there and if you want to walk even just 5-10 minutes, you will find plenty of places to go. We walked from the hotel to Stanley Park entrance and then all over Stanley Park and came back at the hotel. It is a beautiful walk all around, especially the marina side. We had a suite in the hotel at a really really good price of $168 per night (plus tax) and that included a very healthy buffet breakfast. We arrived at about 11:00am and Daniel, at the front desk was more than helpful and manage to get us in our corner suite right away. Talk about great service. The hotel has a night-turndown service and they place chocolate on your pillow. Very nice and tasteful. The suite was truly beautiful and big, with mini-fridge, big TV, computer desk, dining table and free wireless internet. There is a gym on site with one or two treadmill (I can't recall), an elleptical and a bike. Looks nice and clean although we did not use.

The next day, our room wasn't made unitl 4:00 PM. When we asked them why, they said that housekeeping was busy catering to a group checking in and that they will get to it when they're ready. The rooms are mediocare and the overall hotel experience is a 3 star at best. Not worth the type of money we were paying. WE WOULDN'T STAY HERE IF THEY PAID US!!!!", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed\u201d", "Author": "chinsb", "ReviewID": "UR18542918", "Content": "Not knowing where to stay in our 1st trip to Vancouver, a friend suggested we go to Hotwire, where we booked Georgian Court, a \"4-star\" hotel. Subsequent to booking through Hotwire, I looked up the hotel website to find that the rate was only $6/night more than Hotwire. At check-in, we were excited to be in Vancouver and approached the front desk with big smiles. We did not get a smile in return. The attitude was one of nose-in-the air. Immediately they called the busboy to carry our luggage (we had only carry-ons and usually prefer to carry our own) without asking us. We found the room to be OK in size. View was of the construction across the street. Even though we specified 3 persons in booking as well as at check-in, we found only 1 bathrobe/slippers in closet, and only 2 sets of towels in bathroom. The worst thing was that the black coffee maker and another black appliance in the room were covered with a film of white dust (see 2 pix). We were grossed out and didn't touch these throughout our stay. Sure enough, they were never cleaned and remained dusty day to day. I had to leave a daily note to the maid to leave us 3 sets of towels (with her tip). There was no bath fan in the bathroom. We asked for maps twice, and both times the reception person looked doubtful and said, mmm...not sure if we have any left, only to look down and find a map. The computer access consisted of a single standing kiosk in a stifling old phonebooth. Bottled water was supposed to be provided every day, but they ran out of water in 3 of the 5 days we were there. After we came home I realized I left a favorite pr of flipflops in the room. Although these were only $10 flipflips, comfortable ones are hard to come by, so I called the hotel to see if they found them. They did, and the housekeeper asked me for my credit card. Apparently this hotel isn't one of those who would send you a lost item out of goodwill. She said it wouldn't cost much for ground delivery, so I said OK. The $10 flipflips turned out to cost $13.35 to send back to me... The only positive things I have to say about this hotel is the location (convenient) and the linens (nice). The \"style\" of this hotel appears to be the kind that caters to older travelers (much older). Next time, we'll stay at Hampton Inn next door.

One word of caution - if you are driving to the hotel using the hotel's directions posted on their website, be aware that there is major construction on Cambie Street, making it difficult if not impossible to follow the directions. Contact the hotel or consult maps beforehand to figure out another way to the hotel. It appeared that Cambie Street construction will be ongoing throughout 2007.", "Date": "February 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cExcellent downtown hotel\u201d", "Author": "Garg_NO", "ReviewID": "UR6654626", "Content": "The hotel is placed close to Robson street, Yaletown and the rest of downtown.
