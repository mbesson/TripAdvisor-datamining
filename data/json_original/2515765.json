When we got there, we paid up front and was walked to our room to find there was only a door handle and the key lock above the handle was GONE and you can completely see inside! I said this was unacceptable and the guy acted like it was no big deal, he said he would bring tape to cover it up, never brought the tape back. There was a dead cockroach in the bathroom. When we got into bed, I couldn't sleep and 2 hours later we just got our stuff and left. Total for a room there was $99 and they expect you to have a door with a hole in it so people can peep in!? Unbelievable. I will be calling the manager today to get money back.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasanton, California", "Title": "\u201cTerrible accommodation, Horrible neighbors!\u201d", "Author": "magnet10", "ReviewID": "UR125566825", "Content": "renovated with new furniture but dirty and stains all over the bed. you can hear foot steps upstairs not to mention the next door. you may be trouble sleeping if you have wrong neighbors like i did.

I came to SD and did not want to rent a car and just rely on the Trolly. The SD Downtown Lodge is only two blocks from a trolly stop. The hotel location made that totally possible.

Here are a list of reasons why you should not stay at downtown San diego lodge: 1) On check in I had to pay more money than expected because the hotel added on extra tax plus I had already paid for the first night as a deposit which they apparently said I hadn't (even tho it had come out of my bank and I had it on my reservation papers). So i had to pay again. 2) our first room had a faulty lock and they only way we could get in was to ask reception to let us in. we slept with our cases and a bedside table against the door as we backed onto a road and didn't feel safe with a faulty lock. 3) we switched rooms because of the lock and because a group of lads next door were up all night fighting and banging on doors. Both rooms were dirty, the bathrooms especially. They were in the middle of a revamp and there was dust everywhere, wires hanging out the walls, no curtains in our second room and the air conditioning unit had half the front missing 4) there was no hot water. 5) the cleaner stole my shampoo and conditioner then admitted it to the manager when I confronted them (altho the manager was lovely and gave me some money to buy more) 6)one member of staff (receptionist) was rude and wasn't very helpful altho I couldn't fault the manager. 7) it's not good value for money. If your a group of lads looking for a place to kip after a night out then this is the place for you, altho a premier inn is just as cheap and a damn sight nicer.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorable esablishment with blood, roaches, bums\u201d", "Author": "dellinside", "ReviewID": "UR115848104", "Content": "The hotel was under what looked to be some construction, we were told we were getting an upgraded room, but there were dirty raisers in the bathroom, bottle caps in the ac, roaches in the sink and on the floor.... and when we brought all this to thehotel mgr he said, what's the problem?

This place doesn't give you value for your money. We were on a budget and decided online to stay here and made a reservation. The reviews were quite positive, so seemed the price together with the photos. The guy who checked us in asked nicely the required rates, but put far too much tax on it (18%). We were unaware of the rates for San Diego, so we paid it. The room he gave us was the worst we ever had. It was small, but we could expect that for a rate of $ 60 in downtown San Diego. The bathroom was dirty, with hair of someone else in the shower and in the (clean?) towels and a door that could barely open because it was clashing against the toilet. But the worst of all was the smell, like ten dogs had been sleeping there for a long time. As a result, the sheets also smelled and looked, together with the towels, more yellow than white. We didn't get enough of sleep due to the disgusting conditions of our room, the bathroom light, which switched on and off during the night by itself and the noisy neighborhood, like people are scoring crack outside. We saw the reviews below and thought it would be a nice place, but didn't realize they are outdated. So here is an update: get away from this horrible place!
