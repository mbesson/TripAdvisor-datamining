I just got back from Beijing on Friday, and honestly it is not as bad as the other reviews are making it out to be!when we checked in, they were super friendly, we did ask to check out the room first although we didn't need to worry because it was nice.The room we got was a business room in the old block, the room was clean, the air con was great, the room service excellent, the tv has cable but only one english channel cctv9 so if you want entertainment I suggest taking your own dvd player. You do have to pay for everything including the tea but even then its not that much I made a couple of mobile calls and it was a grand total of 1 yuan. I think you would definitely need to have a bit of mandarin under your belt to communicate properly with the staff or at least have a phrase book which is standard. I think it's a bit rude to go to a country and expect them to speak english so really, learn before you go. They organised a trip out to the great wall (mutianyu is better than badaling not so commercial but can be quite expensive). They also helped us find some streets we didn't know how to pronounce and even wrote it down so we could just show the cabbies.Overall, central location, good clean room with the added bonus that it's as cheap as a backpacker - why wouldn't you stay there?", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR273091064", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Beijingbelle"}, {"Content": "Hopeless Hotel in Beijing Beijing : Beijing Golden Palace Silver Street HotelDate : July 26, 2008.It was a terribly experience in life to stay in a [--] hotel on 17/7/08, to pay in advance for 2 nights for 2 rooms eventually only with 1 night stayed, then checked out immdiately to rather stayed in other hotels.

This summer my family and I decided to stay at the Golden Palace Silver Street Hotel in Beijing. Something tells me our life spans dropped significantly during our 4 day stay.The Silver Street described in the hotel's name refers to the tiny alleyway it is located on which took our taxi driver (and his friends through the intercom) about 15 minutes to locate. The fact that the misleading sign out front says Five Thousand Years Hotel Management as opposed to its advertised name makes it even harder to locate.Once we arrived inside, I was asked by the desk clerk if I would like to see the rooms we reserved before paying. Naturally I accepted, only to be horrified at how disgusting the basement-level rooms were. The carpets were filthy, the room was musty and an ominous-looking black mold could be seen creeping around the bathroom.I told them the rooms were absolutely unacceptable, and the woman at the front desk did not believe me, so I took her with me. She proceeded to try to prove to me how clean the bathtub was by wiping it with a sheet of toilet paper... only to pull it away black with mold. These were the dirtiest hotel rooms I had ever encountered.After I complained to the main desk, they (a little too conveniently) had another room available for me... only this room was a significantly more expensive. I went to see this room, but it was in much worse condition than the previous ones, and that is saying a lot considering they were the dirtiest rooms I had ever encountered. I told them I would take the first two rooms I had originally reserved through the internet, and they proceeded to have me (reluctantly) pay a 200RMB deposit for each room, in case I got the room dirtier than it was, or decided to use the cup of ramen or six tea bags in their minibar.We could tell the hotel staff was interested in squeezing out as much money from us as possible, and we had no idea what direction it might come from. They wouldn't even let us sit on their crappy wicker chairs in the lobby because we had to pay for their tea ceremony to sit down.We also decided not to spend too much time in the rooms, since the television had only 1 English channel with nothing good on, and the bathtub leaked water underneath the linoleum tiling so that the floor made a squishing sound as you walked. This was probably where all that mold came from.Leaving the hotel was a huge ordeal as well. We had to make a flight early in the morning so we had to take a taxi to the airport. We arranged with a Beijing taxi driver the previous day to pick us up at the hotel because the hotel-provided taxis were available for 115 RMB, almost twice the price of a regular taxi ride to the airport. The Chinese-speaking taxi driver tried to call the English speaking hotel staff to understand our gestures to the driver about what time to pick us up, but the hotel staff pretended not to understand us and offered us their own (more expensive) taxis, even though we knew full well they could speak English.We eventually got the taxi sorted out and by the time we tried to check out, we had to wait forever for someone to check our room to make sure we hadn't soiled their pre-soiled carpets. This was at 4:30 in the morning and we were the only ones awake in the hotel, so it wasn't like they had anyone else to check on. We were running late for our flight and asked the woman at the desk how long it would take to check the room, but she suddenly (and a little too conveniently) couldn't understand us anymore.Needless to say, we cannot possibly recommend this hotel to anyone, and we honestly believe we would be better off sleeping out on the sidewalk.", "Date": "Jul 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR560751602", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "ellen_bertelsen"}, {"Content": "Creepy soo my parents took my brother and i to china in 2005 to visit our grandparents. when we were heading back home to canada, we went to beijing first. we stayed at this hotel and it was the creepiest hotel ever! not that the people were, but the hotel i guess was pretty old and it looked like a haunted house. it felt reaaaaally creepy. the carpets in the hotel room were really dirty. there was hair EVERYWHERE. we had to wear our shoes the whole time. they said they were moving..or renovating? how did that go", "Date": "Feb 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR700712276", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "shelley-xo"}, {"Content": "Love this hotel! If you want to have a good experience in this hotel, make sure you pick the rooms from the new block. the rooms are very very spacious, after putting in 2 beds, you can insert another 2 more! I am not exaggerating, I would say this is the best deal in China for me. The bathroom is very clean and new, hot water and of course the nice plasma tv with hundreds of channels to watch including CNN and fox. So I am quite happy with that. The breakfast of just toast and sausages was alittle on the expensive side, but no big deal on that. Walking from the hotel to the wang fu jing area at night can be alittle scary if you are alone, because its a little street and no lights are switched on, but you can loads of people walking down that street. So be comfortable and walk along, there should be no problem at all. There are some light coming through from those small shops lining that little street, oh and you can get those fantastic tasting fruits from them at the local prices.

I thought I'd better take them up on their offer. When I saw the room, I said this was unsatisfactory. It seem dirty, dingy and had a musty smell. The offered me another room in the VIP section behind the main entrance through a courtyard. But, there was an increase of 234RMB for this room per night. What was I going to do?So, I ended up on the second floor of the VIP section with a very well used room that had only one English Channel and 50+ Chinese Channels. After two days, I noticed water dripping from one of the recessed light fixtures in the bathroom. I called houskeeping and the workman attempted to fix the leak from a pipe above the light. I thought this is a nice fire hazzard with water seeping through the light fixture. Water and electricity don't mix well.Well, all seemed fine until the next day I heard some water gushing in the bathroom again. This time, there was a flood of water gushing through the light fixture onto the toilet. I just thought to myself, I was very lucky not to have been using the toilet at that moment.I complained to the front desk that I need to change to another room. They had some difficutly finding another room suitable to me. One room had a TV that was fuzzy on the only English Channel. So they finally found a room on the fifth floor of the VIP Section. Guess what. There was another water leak in the bathroom again, this time at the sink. At least the workman fixed this leak properly.The only redemming quality of this place were the travel hostesses which seems genuinely helpful on answering all of your questions. One of the hostesses even accompanied me to the Great Wall before her working hours. She was a wonderful traveling companion who tried to find the most inexpensive way, (by subway and bus) to the Great Wall and returning in time for her scheduled work. Another one took me after her work hours to an internet cafe since their internet is not reliable all the time.There were times where the other full time front desk personnel would be confrontational to the customers. I over heard another Chinese customer arguing with the front desk personnel over a water leak in his room.I have traveled extensively in Asia and would not recommend this place to anyone.

When I gave them my reservation, they said it was after 6pm, and therefore they could not hold the reservation. They actually wanted me to believe that they had sold my room in the prior 15 minutes.

I recently stayed in the hotel but to call is a hotel is to flatter this place. I have stayed in much nicer hostels. From the start of my stay to the end of my stay the total experience is very poor and a let down for a supposed 4 star hotel. Check-in on day one, shown to a room that didnt match any pictures as displayed on the websites I checked or the hotels own brochure. When I complained I was shown to a newer and very small room in the basement which had no windows and next to a public toilet. I stuck with the larger original room so I didnt have to go outside to change my mind.The room, best decribed as very dirty, never vacuumed, stained carpet, sheets only changed after I spoke to reception and asked if they changed the sheets at all. (no advertised policy on not changing sheets if I requested) I could tell as the sheet had a rip in it and I could see the rip whenever I climbed into the bed. Sheets were changed once over 5 nights. Bins in the room emptied once over 5 nights. Bathroom a water hazard as water from the shower filled the bathroom floor. Shampoo never filled or replaced during my stay and the tiny bar of soap replaced on the fourth day. Most of the lights in the room didnt work and only fixed when I complained. The hot water in the bathroom get's colder the longer you showered and the shower is very small and you keep bumping into the water control.The Building, well a bit hard to find and about 5 to 10 minutes walk down a dark alley to get to the building. At night they seem to leave the hotel sign lights off so it makes it very hard if you arrive at night to find the place. As the previous person comented follow the signs to the public toilet off Wangfujing Ave and you will find it. Actually there are 2 public toilets on the way to the hotel from Wangfujing Ave. The lift in the building didnt work all the time and was really really slow. Not great if you are up a few floors. The room key can be intermintent as well and means a few extra trips to the front desk.The staff, at check-in only interested in getting me to give them my Visa card. They were not interested in hearing my complaints about the room. During my stay the doormen only opened the door once and that was when I left for the final time after walking in and out at least 40 times over my stay. They were usually busy talking to the taxi drivers outside. The cleaners, well a quick make of the bed and their work was over. They had a vacuum cleaner but I think it was purely for show as it was never used in my room before or during my stay. The maintenance guy when he fixed the lights he just opened the door and walked in without knocking. The front desk staff at check-out were only interested in you paying the bill. When I checked out my receipts slid into a crack in the broken assistant managers desk and the lady didnt want to give me new receipts. She only did as I refused to sign the credit card receipt until I had my receipts and was very annoyed to comply with my wishes.This place is truely an awful hotel. If you cannot stay elsewhere or your budget is limited be careful about this hotel. They charge for the tea and coffee in the room. There is also body wash and a few other things in the bathroom and they change for these as well but this fact isnt well advertised. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I stayed in a Deluxe Business Room and there was absolutely nothing deluxe or business like about the room.

Then we had to pay for all 3 nights we booked with an additional 600 rmb as deposit or in case they had to deduct for mini-bar items consumed.The lift is probably the slowest I've ever experienced in my life and it was tedious waiting for it but since we were on the 8th floor, we coudn't possibly run up the stairs with the luggage. I think it would have been quicker, though!The rooms were dark , dinghy and musty. Carpets were filthy and with little kids running around, we had to keep reminding them to wash their feet before they jumped into bed.The bathroom was terrible- the shower pressure was so weak it took half an hour for each person to take a shower and even after, we didn't feel clean because the water literally trickled. There was no door or partition between the shower and the toilet so whoever had to go had to sit on the toilet and get wet as well if someone was taking a shower.To top it all, the bathroom stank of the sewage; I think probably to do with the toilet and the shower using the same outlet. Sometimes during the night, one could smell it from the bedroom!The king-sized bedroom had a window which opened into the corridor so I had a fitful 2 nights as the bright lights from the corridor would stream into the room. On the 3rd night, after i kicked up a fuss, the staff then used some sticky tape to hold up some towels against the window so I could at least get some sleep. The children's room were no better! The neon lights of the signage of the hotel was directly outside their window so it shone in and disrupted their sleep.For location, it is quite convenient being 5mins walk to WanFu Jing and we had good breakfast of the best siaw long pau we had in Beijing just a 100 meters up the road and which were really cheap.But if i were to return to Beijing, I would pay a bit more and stay in a more comfortable hotel and definitely not in Wan Fu Jing area as I find that most things here are overpriced and catered mainly for the tourists.All in all, the stay was a great disappointment and spoilt my introduction to Beijing.After the 3 days which we were committed to, we immediately moved out to the Xidan area to Xi xi You Yi hotel which was a much more pleasant experience.
