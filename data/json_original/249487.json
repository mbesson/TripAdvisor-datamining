The concierge staff was very helpful and gave us great recommendations for dining and off the beaten path excursions. The beach front was well kept with helpful staff to provide umbrellas, towels, and chairs. I would definitely recommend this hotel and was very happy with my experience. Finally, the location was ideal because it was halfway between Old San Juan and Fajardo, where many of the excursions like snorkeling, kayaking, and el Yunque take you. Warnings: Breakfast is not included. The hotel breakfast is $14 but there are excellent $3 breakfasts to be had at Ruebens and Mi Casita, both within walking distance. The papaya milkshake at Ruebens is a must! You cannot access the hotel directly from the main street with all of the restaurants. Instead there is an alley way.

Comfortable bed. We were on the 4th floor. The rooms were always cleaned. - We were allowed to check in early. - We got a free upgrade to ocean view - The terrace was absolutely beautiful. The pictures are accurate. It's a great view and the atmosphere is great at sunset and night. - Free wifi and computer room where you can print Cons: - The blue lighting in the halls and elevator was dim and made me feel uneasy because it gives the feel of a cheap motel that is trying to hide something, but I got over it. - I was relieved we did not pay for the ocean view because the windows were dirty, which would have bothered me if I paid for the view. - There was a morning or two when the maids were loud enoug to interrupt our sleep (doors slamming and talking loudly) OVERALL - GREAT HOTEL!!", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, awesome location and amenities\u201d", "Author": "little_debster", "ReviewID": "UR127840415", "Content": "Just got home from an amazing trip today.. and we could not stop talking about how friendly and helpful the staff were at this hotel.

Also they supply you with complimentary fresh beach and bath towels (with 2 girls believe me we used a lot!), bring out fruit right on the beach in the afternoons, free lounge chairs and umbrellas (which they even set up for us during a rain spell when we wanted to stay on the beach cause we were so excited to be there). They have a few computers and you can print off them for free. The beach itself is great and literally steps from outside the hotel, chic lounge on the rooftop, good location between Old San Juan and to the east coast for day trips leaving from Fajardo. The only thing I would say is we would have liked a little more storage/places to hang wet towels/clothes in the rooms, and maybe a little more bright lighting.

If you are looking for a hotel to relax at and are expecting a comfortable, homey feel, this is most likely not the hotel for you. This \"hotel\" is more of a club, that happens to have rooms if you need to pass out after partying upstairs at their bar. I think I also saw a couple of snookis. As soon as you walk into the hotel, there is a blinding blue light. The concept of the hotel seems to be \"as much as blue as possible so we can hide all the imperfections and cracks in the wall.\" I am no perfectionist but for the amount of money we paid, this was off-turning. The elevator also shines blue light down you and pumps loud music into your ears. We stayed on the 3rd floor so we just took the stairs after the first time. I was hoping the rooms might be better but the hallways leading the the rooms were dark except for the blue, and when I turned on the room lights.... BLUE. The blue lights are strong enough to be migraine inducing. One good thing is that the staff are nice enough and so we had the blue light bulbs changed out to normal ones (which then the maid changed back to blue lights the next day.) Despite the information travel agencies offer, there is no American breakfast, iPod whatevers, iron boards, etc. There also is no ice machine available so the staff had to bring us a bucket of ice to our room. They used a sand bucket. Also, the room has a horribly loud AC and it also leaks water across the floor. I would not be criticizing this place so much if it were actually worth the money but it was not. The slight advantage they have is that the beach is right in front of you. You could roll down the stairs out the door and be at the beach. That being said, the beach wasn't spectacular, it was just okay.

It was probably designed more for her age group than mine but I didn't feel out of place. We arrived late after our plane was delayed at JFK (from the West Coast) and the desk staff was welcoming and offered late night food menus etc. We stopped for a drink at the rooftop bar, which was nice but the DJ was playing such loud dance music (with no one dancing) that we were reduced to screaming our drink orders at the bartender. Drinks were generous but we didn't return. The room is simplicity itself, perhaps a little too minimalist for most travellers. It's the sort of thing that looks great in a travel magazine; white bed centred in front of a huge window with a beautiful beach view, sheer white curtains, watery blue lighting and no, repeat no, extraneous furniture. We found the small wardrobe barely adequate for our hanging clothes and by the end of our five nights living out of our suitcases was getting a bit messy. There is no iron or ironing board but there is a safe and a (smallish) tv. You are not there to watch tv, hopefully. No bedside tables but small reading lights are convenient. The bathroom is good size and and clean and attractive although the \"rain\" shower is more like a drizzle. Stylish but it took me 15 minutes to rinse my hair! I'm trying to be honest but I would absolutely stay here again. All the beds seem to be kings, so my daughter and I shared. The mattress was very comfortable. The beach across the cul-de-sac is really lovely, and there seems to be no shortage of lounge chairs and umbrellas available for the cost of tipping the young man who carries them for you. There is (expensive) beachside service from the bar. We did have a short wait one day for more chairs. Isla Verde is probably the best of the city beaches, and this portion of it is very quiet and not crowded, unlike the busy area near the El San Juan and The Intercontinental. The smallish restaurant on the lobby floor is fine for breakfast, albeit a little expensive. Food was average, service smiling and friendly, although I think there was a mistake with my order every day that I ate there! My daughter's meals were fine, I think confusion resulted in the kitchen from my requests to omit meat and replace with fruit etc. As with many restaurants we encountered, they were usually out of one or two items. Coffee is fabulous almost everywhere in PR. I did use the small gym one day, and regretted not running on the beach instead. The windowless basement room was small, as seems reasonable for this small boutique hotel, and had two treadmills (one broken), two exercise bikes and some free weights. There were no towels available and the tv was not working on the one operating treadmill. The treadmill was a smooth and up to date model. It wasn't well air conditioned but to be fair, they may have been working on the room when I was there, as there were signs of ongoing construction. The rooms were quiet, we were on the 9th floor and couldn't hear the music from the disco. There was occasional noise from staff outside the rooms early in the morning. The cleaning staff was excellent, they seemed to swoop into the room as soon as we left it - if we went to the beach for a couple of hours the room was always made up when we returned, and the cleaning was thorough. I ordered a drink from room service once and it arrived promptly without an extra service charge. Drinks and food are expensive, which is typical for San Juan. The quality is almost always exceptional, which helps make up for it. Coming from pricey Vancouver we didn't have too much sticker shock. The valet and doorman were accommodating also, and there is 24 hour valet and front desk staffing. We had no difficulty getting taxis to go to Old San Juan, Condado and Plaza Las Americas. Each of these is about $20. All the Isla Verde hotels, with their casinos and restaurants are walking distance and the hotel is minutes from the airport. I have stayed at two larger resorts in San Juan, the El San Juan and the Caribe Hilton. I think I preferred the personal feel of this small property, and the price was very good. Imaginative decoration that suits the surroundings and very personable staff made it an enjoyable stay and I look forward to returning with my husband one day.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fall River, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cSlightly disappointing..\u201d", "Author": "princessnoleah", "ReviewID": "UR125621254", "Content": "Hotel was very conveniently located.

The hotel is quite stylish and unfortunately that is often it's downfall, it seems that they have chosen style over practicality. First the lighting, most of the lighting is blue to follow the water theme of the hotel, however it is just too blue, making the elevators and hallways too dark you can hardly find your way to your room. The blue lights even extend into the room with little light available besides the dark blue florescent lights; we had only one 11-watt compact florescent in a lamp and two tiny bedside LED lamps. We visited the local Walgreens and bought a real light bulb for the lamp to enable dressing and reading in the room. The room is furnished in an attractive minimalist sort of style but there again that is the downfall as there is almost no room to put anything away. We had one very small chest that was put into the very small closet. The three drawers in a chest that was the size of a small bedside table would not have done for one person on a 2-night stay let alone 2 people on a week long vacation.

My husband and his friend were playing in a baseball tournament so they both decided to take the wives to spend valentines week in Puerto Rico. Upon arrival to this Miami - esque boutique hotel, we were greeted by the valet (who by the way kindly opens the hotel doors with each entrance and exit of guests) The receptionist was very kind and accommodating. We had two rooms, 401 and 406. We stayed in 406 and because it was a room along the side of the hotel we were told the room is a bit bigger then the rooms in the back or facing the beach. The larger room did help with storing luggage and baseball gear. They only have closets to hang clothes, with limited drawer. We ended up living out of our luggage for the trip which was fine - just request a iron and ironing board to help witht he wrinkles. The elevator ride to our room was unique - In all my travels I have never seen a waterfall with a glass top in an elevator - very cool. Upon entering our room, there was a black light which made all the white walls, white curtains and white bed glow - that too was a unique experience. You can turn the black lights off as you please as they don't provide the best lighting and use the regular lighting instead. Everything was clean, neat and welcoming. The bathroom is also chic with glass showers and bowl sinks. There is a roof top pool opened 7am - 7pm which no one used as the beach is a few steps away from the hotel. They do turn the roof top pool into a \"club\" on the weekends but we didn't get a chance to see it. I do recommend going to the rooftop during the day to get some great pictures. My husband and I had our morning coffee on one of the roof top lounge sofas and enjoyed the views before we started our day. Every morning I walked the beach which was great exercise and a great way to get moving in the morning. They do comb the beach and remove most of the seaweed each morning so walking the sand was very easy. We did enjoy the beach a few days and Pedro, the towel guy, was able to set up our complimentary chairs, umbrella, and towels for us. He even came by and gave us skewers of fresh fruit which was very refreshing under the hot sun. Pedro was very nice and his service was commendable. One of the days it did start to rain, so we walked down the street to a bar and grill called El Alambique. This place does have a local feel as many locals visiting the beach will dine and have some drinks here. The food is also very good. We also ventured off to see other parts of the island and to help us plan we used the business off to do some internet searches as well as utilizing the front desk's knowledge about the island. The the front desk staff was very helpful with directions and tips. I wish I had their names as with each inquiry we had (we had quite a few) they were all very attentive to providing excellent customer service. Not once did we feel like we were a bother or rushed. I felt like were treated like family. They even started to recognize us as we entered and exited the hotel and greeted us as we passed by. Myself and the other wife left on Saturday 2/18/2012 so our husbands can focus on the remainder of their baseball games. We asked the front desk for taxi service to take us tot he airport. They do have taxis waiting outside during the day and only cost us $11 and $1 per bag - $13 for the one way ride. as an aside, one late night when we came off the elevator, we did hear some shall I say... \"noises\" coming from another room.. So couples -- be careful sound does travel. Another tip - since the hotel is on a dead end street there is little traffic as you are not allowed to park on the street. You can pay valet $10, but we just parked ended up parking on the side streets. The hotel is also adjacent to a walkway to the main strip so we had many options for parking.

The ocean view room I had was all white, had a flatscreen tv, and most amenities that you'd expect (hairdryer, toiletries, a safe, etc.). The good: 1. The staff - Everyone from the front desk people, the wait staff/bartenders, beach service staff, and the door people were extremely friendly. Everyone said hello and asked how things were going. The doorman offered us an umbrella when there was threat of rain. If the elevator was taking too long, staff would apologize. The beach staff made sure they addressed us by name, would set up your chair, towel, and umbrella, bring free fresh fruit and desserts, spray you with a mist machine, and of course, deliver food and drinks from the restaurant. 2. The location is great since you're on the beach and 10 minute from the airport. You are in the middle of Isla Verde so you can walk down the beach to the other hotels, casinos, restaurants, etc. There is a Walgreens a few blocks away and some high quality, low price restaurants around. They usually have cabs waiting out front as well, if you want to venture outside of the area. 3. The rooftop bar is beautiful. 360 degree view of the area. There is a bar (with appetizers) and a pool, plus couches to lounge on. In fact, it becomes a lounge at night. This might be a con if you're not into this type of scene, but it is great for couples or young people who want to socialize (very South Beach - like). Cons (minor nits, none of which would keep me from staying there again): 1. The pool is not large. More than 6-8 people in it would make it weird. It is great for cooling off and getting a quick dip. That said, I never saw anyone in the pool bc the beach was so close. 2. The rooms have a few little design quirks.

The walls are paper thin and we could hear our neighbors getting busy a couple nights, which we thought was quite hilarious, but something to keep in mind if you are traveling with kids. The first thing that will hit you when you enter the room is the neon blue lighting which we did not care for and kept off the whole time we were there. That being said, this stuff had absolutely no effect on our vacation since our main focus is always to explore the Island and not be stuck in the hotel at all and we had a GREAT time at the Water Club Hotel.

First off my reasons for selecting this hotel were 1)My event for NYE was nearby at El San Juan hotel who was commanding a ridiculous $500 per night when I had stayed prior 2 years ago it was only $150 so forget it 2)Last time in PR my friends had taken me to this hotels rooftop for sunset drinks it came off like a \"W\" hotel style modern so it peaked my interest more than others nearby & was directly on the beach. Ok so I had read the TA reviews both good & bad but decided on Beach Club based on my above stated explanation with a average level of accomodation expectations for a hotel that was basically almost 1/2 price compared to the ESJ Hotel I was intially planning to stay at. I was after 5 days stunned all around at the level of service and quality for the price during a holiday week. Staff gave a level of service I have encountered really only in 5 star hotels worldwide. Front door opened day & night nearly EVERY time I walked in, asked almost a dozen times how was my stay, is there anything you need today etc. Free beach chairs & umbrellas set up for me always 2 people there to help on the beach, & free continental breakfast. One morning my girl & I had a tour to meet up with and the staff actually packed our free breakfast to go because we were running late!! THIS IS HOW YOU KEEP YOUR CUSTOMERS!! NO noise from the maid she was polite and asked when it would be a good time to clean when we went to breakfast, internet was consitently fast and FREE, I was on the 8th floor partial ocean in view near rear of hotel so I slept great. Bed was comfy, four pillows provided as they should be. The rooftop had just reopened week prior to our arrival I would say you probably wouldnt want a room on the floor below roof to avoid any potential noise. Finally, I had the opportunity of getting 50% off tapas the first nite on the rooftop, food was amazing but to be honest I wouldn't pay the 100% price it would be too expensive. Only two concerns really, the shower head was too heavy for the pipe coming out of the wall had to keep adjusting it, and the water pressure seemed weak. The other concern was the room lighting, I really like the neon thought it was a great touch, but as others have stated room needs an actual normal light as well. Otherwise great job, keep up the good work and keep the great staff!!! Last word: Navigation is 50/50 in Puerto Rico, if you type in the Beach Club Address it will NOT take you to the hotel it will take you somewhere up the street, here are the coordinates for your navigation that will take you to the front door (at least they did for me) n18\u00c2\u00b026.589' w066\u00c2\u00b001.315'", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leavenworth, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Chris M", "ReviewID": "UR121802852", "Content": "We stayed here December, 2011 for a couple of nights pre & post cruise. Overall the hotel is good. Few things need attention, but overall I am very happy. If you're looking for a good room, good bed, great views, etc., then stay here! If you want an ocean views book this hotel! Our rooms were on the 5th floor overlooking the beach/ocean. Amazing view and sounds to fall asleep too & wake up too are great. One thing I would strongly suggest you ask in advance is about private parties. During our pre-cruise stay, there was a VERY LOUD party happening just two floors below us. The people yelling/music/noise went until around 3am. Phoning the front desk, I was simply advised that it was a private function and that she would let the events director know. When complaining further, I was told to shut my balcony door. NOT happy with that. The breakfast included with the rate was good enough for us. You get to chose a couple of pastry items, OJ &/or coffee. You can also order food- We did this one day, but we felt it was overpriced and not that good. The happy hour was a large disappointment as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly confusing and very restrictive. Pretty much if you plan to do the happy hour, just plan to drink rum and coke, sprite, or just rum; or the local beer\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich was pretty good. However, we did enjoy a few free drinks; simply coke & rum. There is a Wal-Green within a short walk on the main street behind the hotel. There are several fast food places to eat as well. We didn't get to use the pool or the top floor because it was under construction-- disappointed as we were told it would be ready when I booked this in January, 2011. The staff-- mixed reviews.

The free happy hour everyday at 5 is a great way to get the night started and meet some other interesting world travelers.

I do not know how long ago it was that she stayed here, but I'm guessing things have changed since then. I booked through Expedia after reviewing the hotel web site and reading many reviews here on Tripadvisor. We were attracted by the beach front location, the free happy hour cocktails, the on site restaurant, and the rooftop pool. The only feature that was actually available was the beautiful beach. And it was wonderful! The happy hour did occur on our last evening. Something about needing to renew a liquor license. The pool and restaurant we were told have been closed for maybe two years. Our room was okay, a great ocean view room on the eighth floor, #804, which I would happily recommend if it were not for these other problems. Things are clean enough, water pressure in the shower is not the greatest, but I've had worse. If you want ice, you have to ask the front desk to get it for you, and it comes in a bucket, like a sand bucket for playing on the beach. There is an included continental breakfast. This consists of choice of juice, choice of hot beverage, and various forms of bread. For convenience shopping there is a Walgreens very nearby, but they do not sell beer or wine.The location of the hotel is very near the airport, so the cab ride is reasonable at $10.00 with a $1.50 surcharge for fuel right now, and $1.00 per piece of luggage. Throughout Puerto Rico a 10% tip is always sufficient, and check your bill in restaurants because it often already included. The beer special at happy hour at most bars is the local Medalla Lite, usually $2 or less for a 10 oz. can. The long cab ride to Old San Juan is $20, but catch the bus near the hotel during the daytime for .75 (exact change ONLY) each way. At night the cab is the safer way to go. My husband recommends bringing binoculars if you have them, for better sight seeing at the beach. We enjoyed swimming in the ocean, which was warm and just a little choppy. There is no sea life in the water due to a large reef running parallel to the shore which keeps fish large and small away from the shore. As far as food in the area, we ate plantains several different ways, and if we had stayed any longer would most certainly have gone to the Outback Steakhouse at the Embassy Suites nearby. We enjoyed the casinos at the El San Juan Hotel and the Intercontinental Hotel(where I would look into staying if we go back to isla Verde).", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montr\u00c3\u00a9al", "Title": "\u201cIf you are looking for beach and modern rooms\u201d", "Author": "Mplove84", "ReviewID": "UR117941952", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel the first part of our trip and were very happy of the location.

Goods: - On the best beach in San Juan (we saw Ocean Park and it's really not as good) - Happy hour: get as many free drinks as you want form 5 pm to 6 pm (Laura made a mistake saying from 5 to 7 but the bartender let us have a drink at 6:15) - Simple but good breakfast: juice+coffee+bagel+pastry - The view from your room - The staff is very nice. Bads: - Miss of information (we received some wrong info from the front desk staff about renting cars, local calls, happy hours) even though they were very nice and friendly. we haven't been told about the terrace on the second floor, we discovered it ourselves the last night of our stay. - No frigo bar in the room. - Not many good restaurants to eat around. We went to a Japanese one, and decided to go in the Old part for the other nights. - Far from the Old San Juan. If you are there to visit, you better stay in this area instead - The toilet wasn't working well. We had to call to make it reapair several times during our stay. - Some mornings the service at the restaurant was slow, even though we were very few people eating and enough staff. - No pool Some tips: - Rent a car!!! We found some online at 17,95$ a day with enterprise (at the Ritz and they come pick you up at the hotel) - If you have a rental car, park it in the street, it's free and a block away from the hotel. You'll save 15$ a day - Don't book the tours, they are way too expensive compared with the real value, do it yourself with a car - Take the bus to go in Old San Juan, it costs 0,75$ per ride (!!!) instead of a 20$ cab ride, but the last bus depart at 21:30 from the old town - For the best beach, go to the Ritz, it's a few minutes walk from the hotel If you visit Old San Juan, here are other tips : - there is a supermarket where you can buy alcohol, water, drinks for cheap, it's worth it when you spend few days. - Eat a good meal and enjoy amazing ambiance at El Picoteo (great tapas) in the wonderful hotel El Convento - Go watch the sunset at El Morro and near the cemetery and then go down at the Princessa passerelle - Have a breakfast at the popular Cafeteria Mallorca (mallorca sandwich with ham and cheese is amazing) - Have a lunch and pastry at La Bombonera (more than 100 years restaurant, dinner style, very popular with the locals) - If you want to treat yourself and spend 150$ and more for an unfogettable dinner, go to Marmelade... and don't forget to try their pastry called Quesito! - Plaza las Americas is not worth it... same shops you can find anywhere in USA and Canada don't loose your time going", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cOverall we enjoyed our stay!

That all changed when we were trying to determine what the plan would be for her birthday when we concluded that since she loved Puerto Rico SO much we should finally make the trek together. With 0 expectations I arrived on the \"Island of Enchantment\" to be completly enchanted! The food, the people, the culture were all just as incredible as described, but what was more incredible then described was the TREMENDOUS stay at the San Juan Water & Beach Club. THE ROOM: The room was spacious, clean, and completely comfortable. Eventhough there's minimal time spent in the room, the time there was comfortable, sexy, and exactly what I look for in a hotel. The modern amenities in the room included an iPod radio clock, a mini-fridge, a \"kickin\" a/c, soft bed, plenty of mirrors for getting ready, a modern bathroom, sexy blue lighting for the evening hours, and the list can go on if I let it. The room far exceded any expecations that I may have had. THE STAFF: I can't reiterate how fantastic Nailin, Vierna, Rafael, Pedro, Neldise, Xavier and the everyone who works at the hotel was to me and my friends. They helped pull off a surprise birthday celebration during the daily free happy hour, they were accomodating always willing to lend a helping hand, engage you in conversation, and offer you a smile or giggle (in Xavier's case). The service was SUPERIOR to any hotel I've visited during my adult life and I travel quite a bit for work and pleasure. I would highly recommend that you stay at the San Juan Water and Beach Club your next visit to Puerto Rico. The hotel is close by the airport, the beach which is directly in front of the hotel is clean, the beach staff is super helpful and kind, the water was AMAZING and where the hotel is situated is close to EVERYTHING!

This was meant to be a relaxing trip with my sister - and unfortunately fell during college Spring break. At the end of the trip, we rarely found ourselves surrounded by or annoyed by loud drunk college kids and definitely got the incredible vacation we were looking for. I spoke with many friends who had previously been to PR and after days of reading reviews and checking prices, was at a crossroads between El San Juan and San Juan Water & Beach. For the price difference, I decided to go with the San Juan Water and Beach and our experience was wonderful! Need to know: While I have heard they have a fantastic rooftop - I would not know as that was \"under construction\" while we were there. I don't get the vibe they are working on it efficiently or care to move fast - so call and inquire if it's open before booking if that is a deciding factor for you. And, if you need a hotel with a restaurant in it, I think this is something they are working on also. Aside from that, we were able to walk downstairs and onto the beach (literally steps away) and have the employee bring us huge (twice as large as any I have ever seen) lounge chairs, towels and (if applicable) an umbrella onto the beach. We can get a pool anywhere in America but not the beach! If we were thirsty, the hotel does haphazardly send a cocktail waitress for drinks. OR you could get up, walk a few hundred feet (restaurants / bars next to hotel) and buy your own food and drinks (beer can $3, pina colada $6 instead of hotel $12). We did this to save money and not limit ourselves to indulge. Everybody who goes to PR should make a day trip to Old San Juan. If you want to save money, there is a bus stop in back of the hotel (street side) that takes you there. it's a few dollars roundtrip and you get a taste of the local flavor. There are mutliple fast food restaurants and TONS of other restaurants as variety within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. In case you need anything, there is a Walgreens 5 minutes walk. To summarize this - the value of our hotel was AWESOME. They also have a free happy hour everyday from 5-6. Take advantage of it. They book the excursion trips for you - GO KAYAKING in the bio-luminescent bays. It is BEACH SIDE. You can walk anywhere for food or toiletries or to go out dancing. Go to El Taquito (we did daily) for $2.50 breakfast meals and buckets of 5 Corona bottles for $5.

I was just there for 2 weeks in May and per usual, it was a fabulous experience and a wonderful stay. This is the only boutique-style hotel on the Island and they are true to the boutique form. By far the best part of this hotel is the amazing staff. From the moment you arrive until the moment you leave, you are treated like royalty. The level of professionalism, courtesy, responsiveness and attentiveness is top of the line and first class. I've yet to meet a staff member who wasn't warm, welcoming and who wouldn't go out of their way to at least try to accommodate your desires. This is a testament to both the management and the lovely people of the Island alike. The decor is minimalist and chic. I've traveled extensively for business and pleasure, and prefer the warm, simple ambience of the boutique hotel. This is not Miami, this is an island in the Caribbean - let yourself surrender to island time, respect the culture and you will have the time of your life. As for the renovations to the rooftop terrace, yes the view is unparrallelled there, but honestly, with the beach 3 steps from the front doors, I did not miss it at all (although I'm excited to see the final result when it's completed!). As for the lighting? The theme of the hotel is water, Slightly dim/bluish lighting builds on that. I find it totally relaxing and Zen. Leave the flourescent lighting for the office, thanks! And honestly, if you can't find your room because of the lighting? Invest in new glasses - it's never been a problem for me. And I must address the shower complaints. Flooding? Really? I would like to know what people are doing in the showers...running laps perhaps? :) In my 2 weeks there I had nary a DROP of water on the floor. Tip: stay behind the glass partition and you're fine. This shower design is actually quite common in modern hotels in the States, for example one of my faves, The W. I've stayed in several that had a \"rain\" shower head in the middle of the shower area and no door/partition. Welcome to modernism! The improvements that I've seen since my first days at the Water Club years and years ago are fab. Housekeeping was perfect and gracious. They always took care of me, even when I called to request late service due to work emergencies that kept me in the room later than planned. Love the beds, major comfortable and I never felt a spring. All told, you get what you give. If you want a resort experience, shell out the extra $$$ and stay at the El San Juan or La Concha. If you appreciate a sexy, intimate atmosphere and staff who treat you like friends, I highly recommend this property. I love what this place is now and look forward to what it will be in the future. Form your own opinion and give this unique hotel the chance it deserves. I've stayed at the resorts here and this place wins hands down! It's now my second home and I cannot wait to return.

The windows were filthy and we had to keep the draperies closed to avoid the nasty view. Noisy, noisy air conditioner. Nice staff and location.

My husband and I went on a last minute vacation to Isla Verde for our anniversary. We went with open minds and ready to relax. The moment we arrived we were treated with excellent service. Xavier was the person at the front desk at this time and he was wonderful. They allowed us to enter our room earlier than their check in time, which was great for us since we had a very early flight and were exhausted. The room was very clean. I did not see any mold or any of the things that other travelers experienced. We had a regular room with partial view of the beach. People complained about the blue lights, but they are optional there are regular lights in the room so no need to have the blue lights on unless you really want them on. The bed and the pillows were very comfortable and the air conditioner worked well. We had hot water the entire time we were there and the water pressure in the shower was great. The staff was amazing always opening the doors for us at the front, they were always able to answer our questions and offer suggestions on the best way to get around town. Cabs were always available at the hotel. We never ate at the hotel but it did look like a nice restaurant. The hotel was overall very quiet and peaceful. We were not aware that there was a complimentary breakfast, so we never made it to this. We were aware of the happy hour, but we never made it there on time since we were always out and about. It is a nice gesture of the hotel. We did have excellent service whenever we wanted beach chairs and umbrellas on the beach and beach towels. The hotel has a lounge on the second floor that is very peaceful and clean. Here you can sit have a drink and relax with the view of the ocean. I heard great reviews about the rooftop bar and pool, and unfortunately it was closed. I would definitely go back here and enjoy this hotel. Isla Verda is a great location with the beach right there and lots to do. There are lots of local affordable restaurants and hang out spots. The casinos and local clubs are within walking distance. My husband and I took the local bust for .75 cents to Old San Juan and walked along the strip at night feeling safe. My two favorite restaurants were Casitas a few blocks away and La Lechonera de Latin. Both were very affordable and great local food. For some cheap drinks and beer go to Taquitos only a few blocks from the hotel. If you are looking for affordable souvenirs, try and get them at Old San Juan, because all the souvenir shops in Isla Verde are very expensive. A few suggestions for the hotel are as followings, maybe the management team can consider getting some rugs to put in front of the bed since the floor is cold in the morning. The blind in the room we stayed in had holes in them, the air conditioner was very noisy and in the morning it was a bit difficult to sleep past 8am with the noise from the cleaning lady's cart. Also even though I'm not against the blue lights I think that it is a bit scary to have only blue lights in the hallway. If I was traveling alone I would not feel safe walking down the hallway with poor lighting. Also let travelers know ahead of time about the 50$ a day that they will be put on hold in case they buy something there? I think maybe you should just charge the person for whatever services they get instead of putting a hold on your credit card. Also you should consider the set up in the rooms. It was a bit weird to have the bed in the middle of the room. It made the room look a lot smaller than it really is. Maybe if you had the bed up against the wall and the side table on the side it would be a better layout. Also besides the small chair behind the bed there were no other options to sit in. Having everything white can be a challenge because you have to work very hard to maintain it clean maybe adding some color in there. There was no comfortable in the room like the description says, just sheets. The water in the shower kept coming out because only has a half a wall. Let the travelers know when they arrive that the pool is closed and t he upstairs lounge. Maybe the hotel can invest in having a shuttle to and from the airport, since it is only a 5 minute drive and the cab drivers are very expensive. Also please have more information on excursions and trips. We had an amazing time here and know that with a few suggestions this hotel can be one of the very best in Isla Verde.

This boutique hotel is conveniently located only a few minutes away from the San Juan International Airport. The hotel fronts a dead-end street right on a Isla Verde beach in Carolina. There are numerous dining options all within walking distance- everything from fast food, to casual sit-down, to upscale dining. I recommend getting out and exploring the nearby area, as well as Old San Juan. We booked a suite online well in advance of our stay. The website showed a well-appointed room with a small balcony. Unfortunately, when we got up to our suite, to our surprise, it didn't have a balcony. A visit back to the front desk informed us that all of the suites with balconies were reserved. This was disappointing, as one of the primary reasons for choosing a suite was the balcony and view. The suite was still nice, but there were some noticeable cons: - No ironing board or iron in room, even though the website said there was one. - Rooftop pool closed - The tacky \"South Beach\" style blue lighting - No ice machines or vending machines in the building (had to request ice at bar) - No mini-fridge. We resorted to purchasing a disposable cooler at a local drug store. - Glass shower door doesn't seal correctly and water leaks all over the floor - Multiple scuffs and damage to bathroom counter - Outside room windows look like they haven't been washed in years - General cleanliness issues, nothing serious- but the place could use a good scrubbing - Broken telescope in the room- it would be a nice feature, if only it worked. - Bathroom lighting was insufficient - Noisy, raucous guests in next door room one night during our stay (this was brought to the attention of the staff the next morning who sufficiently addressed the issue.) - The restaurant only serves breakfast And the pros: - Location and view - Staff friendliness - Free beach chairs, towels, and umbrellas - Daily happy hour - Large walk-in closet in the suite - Free WiFi - Taxis are always right outside the hotel (but consider renting a car if you plan to visit the National Forest and Old San Juan.)

First, this hotel is great for location. GREAT. You are directly on the beach, the hotel rakes the beach every morning so the hotel's part of the beach is gorgeous and clean (alot of other hotels didnt). You get free chaises, umbrellas, and towels (just tip the guy that sets it up for you). You are also located right on strip with many restaurants, walgreens, fast food places, the San Juan Casino (which is fun and beautiful) and the bus stop that you can take to Old San Jan which is also beutiful (otherwise a cab is 20 bucks). The service at the hotel is great, super nice people. But do not eat at the restaurant. They only serve breakfast, they are SUPER SLOW, and they food was not good or worth the cost. The rooftop is closed UNTIL SUMMER for renovations, so no rooftop bar, pool, etc. Be prepared for that. Also be prepared for a \"resort fee\" when you leave, which every place charges. We had one room for 2 people and it was 90 dollars. For food, I would suggest going to Gallaza Cafe for breakfast (SO GOOD AND AFFORDABLE) or the cafe in the plaza with Baskin Robbins, affordable, pretty good, service is a bit slow because they are always busy. These are both located when you take the little walkway (its like a hallway) next to the hotel to the strip and then take a left. Old San Juan is beautiful and you must visit, gorgeous. El Morro was very cool as well as El Yunque, The Rainforest....which has beautiful waterfalls and a nice hour long hike through it with a path. Bacardi Factory wasn't super interesting but it's free to get in and each person gets free 2 drinks so it's a cool experience. The hotel has nothing extra, at all. You get a bed, tv, bathroom. Thats about it. The sheets suck, horrible thread count (and I'm not a picky person that complains by the way), you get no tv guide, no ipod speakers as I read on another site, we had to request an iron. I will say that the maid is very nice and did a good job cleaning our hotel and would clean the bathroom and organize everything for us every day. I always left all of my jewelry and nice things out and nothing was ever moved. The whole hotel has a blue lighting, more so at night, which is cool and goes with the water theme but made it hard to see when doing my makeup and trying to pack,etc. If you walk down the dead end street that the hotel is on there are 3 bars right in a row, which are nice and chill with a beach view. Everyone in the San Juan area is bi-lingual...it is very americanized. So if you don't speak a lick of English you will still be fine. I even met a handful of people that worked there and originally lived in the central States.

This hotel is perfect for young couples who like a laid back and cool atmosphere.

Loved that the hotel was at the end of the dead-end street so not a lot of traffic noise, plus it was set off the main strip - preferable. Also loved that it was an adult-only hotel. However, the main strip was only a block away and was near a pathway to/from. Within easy walking distance of other hotels, casinos, stores and restaurants. The room was spacious, partial ocean view, clean and quite. The con's: the food - or lack thereof. The continental breakfast - you're not missing anything here if you skipped it. They should just offer a buffet with fruit, pastries and juices/coffee. No room service - not even cold sandwiches.

The San Juan Water & Beach Club was offered to us on the plane as one option. We are so, so happy we took them up on this offer! From the moment we arrived, we were astonished at the attention to detail that went into designing the space and lighting of this hotel. The theme is Water!, and it is set ideally right on the beach, so within seconds you can be swimming in the evening, then stroll back hand-in-hand, wash your feet in the gentle shower near the door, and go up to your room. As you enter the foyer, notice the avant-garde white couch which looks like a wave and is very inviting. immediately to your right is the cozy lounge which features live local muscial talent. The entire lobby and lounge are bathed in a cool-blue light, and everything from the ceiling fixtures to the custom glass floor tiles to the interesting cutouts in the walls to proclaim that the design of the interior space of this wonderful resort was given the closest attention to detail. The service was excellent. Our first night was a \"panic\" night because our plane couldn't land in St. Thomas. The hotel manager, Jeff, spent about 20 minutes with us carefully outlining some primo dining spots in Old San Juan. We made a beeline to Dragonfly Restaurant which featured some absolutely amazing sushi. (my new wife became the biggest sushi fan on our honeymoon!). We went back to the hotel, and were amazed at the real waterfall in the elevator, the cool blue lighting of the hallways, the pebble-photograph tile in the hall, and the thick, heavy doors to the rooms, which kept the hall sound out. The beds were VERY comfortable and we slept like babies. The rooms are done in white, so the room lights up if you keep the curtains drawn at dawn and you can see the beach sunrise from the room, or get up early enough and go for a romantic walk on the beach. The bathroom is unique in that there is no nasty shower curtain but a half-glass shower. We loved this feature, as everything is designed to keep mold to a minimum. The bathrooms are very modern, and the products they supply are high end H2O brand shampoos, conditioners and body wash. Since our next day was spent on a plane trying to land in St. Thomas, we were very relieved that the pilot went back to PR, and I immediately called the Water and Beach Club and reserved another Full Beach View room for 6 days. Pay the extra few dollars for this view if you can get it, it is totally worth the excellent view of the Isla Verde beach! We loved our week in Puerto Rico because of this hotel! The entire staff, from the housekeepers to the front desk, to the girls behind the bar, to the doorman William, were always helpful and friendly. We absolutely loved William! He provided great advice, and was always there to hail a cab. He could be featured on a poster for Puerto Rico travels! Valet service is available. We enjoyed walking down the street to some excellent little restaurants, featuring sushi, beef, chinese food, you name it. I can honestly say that we didn't have a bad meal in Puerto Rico! If you exit the hotel, turn left, and walk down the beach a ways, there is a lounge on the beach with beds set up (yep!) so you can enjoy live music and sip your drink with your honey, arm in arm enjoying the rhythmic lapping of the waves on the sand! So the hotel is very central to the area, and very accessible, yet tucked out of the way of traffic noise. The food in the lounge at the Water and Beach Club was very good. Sometimes you just feel like staying at the hotel, know what I mean? The drinks there were also very good. Our honeymoon, which was in jeopardy because of the tropical storm in St. Thomas, was completely salvaged by the superb General Manager, Jeff Palmer, and the following staff: William (hi William!), Paloma, Xavier, Tania, Giselle, Laura, and Ileana.

The nicely redone baths are cute, but a bit dumb since they didn't bother with shower doors or large enough glass partitions, so the floor is either always wet or covered with towels. The blue lights are another cute idea, but I wished they had spent the money on better linens; the bedding felt worn and was somewhat soiled and stained in places. Overall, it was an OK place with a great location that's basically on the beach, which is why I would recommend it to someone.

The girl at the front desk told me she would call me if the room was available, but it probably wouldn't be ready until 4. I think we got there at 12. We walked around for a little bit in between waiting. The location was great, the beach out front was great. While waiting in my friends room we kept hearing all this banging, not sure what it was. We just figured there was construction going on outside the hotel. We decided to take a trip up the to roof top pool/bar. We exited the elevator only to be met with pounding and jack hammering. We turn the corner and see everything is blocked off due to construction on the entire top floor! Now we knew where the construction was coming from. This was around 2p.m. We went back to the front desk and inquired about the rooftop. Why didn't any one let us know the pool was closed? What did they have to offer instead of the amenity? The only answer she had for us was the bar in the lobby. When I asked about the pool she rudely replied with \"That's not my problem.\" Outraged we went back to the room to discuss what we planned to do. Part of our picking the hotel was the pool. We decided to stay and see how it went, seeing as we were already there. We went back to the desk at 4p.m. to check on the status of my room. The same girl was there, and she handed me the key, saying it had been ready for hours and that they had called me. I showed her my phone and said I had it all along and that we had already been to the front desk. She shrugged and walked away. When we had booked the room we had asked for adjoining rooms. We were told it was no problem. When we got to our room we realized that wouldn't be happening as there was no door to provide that. When I finally got to my room I was relieved. No jackhammering. My friends room next door, however, was completely different. Let's just say I had the lucky hand. Bigger bed, nicer set up, nicer bathroom, etc. It's fine to set your rooms up differently, but when two rooms are traveling together, someone is going to notice if one is nicer than the other. The downstairs bar was great. The young bartender was excellent and always made us something delicious. The breakfast we ate at the hotel wasn't bad either.

We had a view of the ocean. Roof top bar was also great. They do play loud music, so if you are one to go to bed early, dont stay in the higher floors. Restaurant in the lobby was good.

After reading some of the reviews I was a bit worried about staying at the hotel. The hotel was easy to get to from the hotel. The taxi drove right up to the beach to the hotel entrance. The lobby area is very upscale and modern. I love hydrotherapy and waterso I was excited to see the water concept throughout the hotel. The hotel is small and the elevators small but I loved the water effects in the elevator--the propery is dark in many places but it seemed to add to a serene, secluded atmosphere. The first room we stay in was very small but a lovely view of the ocean. We were going to be on the property for a few days so we upgraded to a two room suite the next day. I will post pictures of both to show you the difference. We loved the WET bar on top of the hotel but the service was slow and no one seemed to care. It was almost an hour before we received an order of sushi and the restaurant was not that busy. The drinks arrived quickly but we did not go there for food again-(do not try to sushi--pass on it at this hotel). They have a pool on top of the hotel and the view from the pool and the WET BAR is not to be missed. The breakfast each morning was delightful--the staff was much better and so was the food We had a five course meal at Tangerine one night and the food and service was excellent. We would stay at this hotel again because of the intimate setting but would reserve a suite. This is a great hotel is you like the night life as the WET Bar was poplular but still quiet if you don't. The staff was great about setting up the chairs and towels on the beach and we loved walking out the door to feel the sand on our feet.

We were moved to another room which had a door on the bathroom (yay) but... gigantically loud construction started about 10 minutes later (like right out of that commercial from a few years ago). Hoping this was a one-off, we hit the beach. When we came back, we turned on the shower, only to find... no water in our shower. At this point we just cracked up laughing and coughed it up to some bad luck. Ended up having fun laughing at just how bad our rooms were. Elevators and hallways were not air conditioned, so even leaving the building you'd break a sweat in June. Ridiculous given the hotel class, but I think this was actually due to said construction breaking something. This place COULD be amazing if they just fixed these little issues, but given our rather unfortunate experience, can't in good faith recommend it too highly.

To be clear, this hotel is not beachfront. To me that means you can almost literally walk from the hotel into the sand. This hotel has a small street that lies in between the hotel and the beach.It's not like it's by any means an exhausting walk to the beach, though. It's right there in front of you. You just have to cross the street (which is not busy) to get there. You will have to walk a little ways to arrive at a nice clean area of beach. As soon as you are on the beach walk as far to the right as you can. That way you'll still be close to the hotel and someone can bring you a beach chair. They were very good about that. There is breakfast every morning (free) and yes it is very simple. Cereals, milk, toast, yogurt, juice and muffins. This should be expected however. I'm sure no logical person thought they'd be getting the full breakfast works for free. This is not an all-inclusive resort nor a bed & breakfast. But it is a cute boutique hotel. I didn't really have any issues at all during my stay. Well, the A/C leaked water on my 5th day there. I called and they sent someone up immediately to fix it. But it only fixed it temporarily because it leaked again the next three days. This became more of an issue because the rooms are not carpeted so the water would puddle. Now on to the shower situation. No the shower does not make any sense. It is only enclosed half way. Water WILL spill onto the floor. No way around that, even if you take a quick shower. There is a cool bar at the top of the hotel where you can sit with your cocktail and look out to the ocean. Bar staff was very friendly. Mingle with others. I met people from all kinds of places. Behind the hotel you will find a Walgreens, comes in handy to purchase things you may have forgotten at home, and also many many fast food places. Try to avoid these. If you're visting PR from the US then you are very accustomed to the customary fast food chains. Try to eat where the locals do. The hotel should recommend places. The bus was pretty easy to navigate on but keep in mind they get FULL. I never really felt unsafe and i walked the beach every night and explored San Juan. Old San Juan is pretty cool in the downtown area. The bldgs are different vivid colors. Overall, friendly people, handsome men and if you walk far down to the right of the beach its quite pretty. Also finding the hotel from the beach at nighttime is very easy. Just head to where you see all the windows lit up with blue. FYI while in your room, if the blue irritates you, it can be turned off. This is not at all a hotel for children. It's for adults wanting enjoy a fun beach stay without breaking the bank.

If you want to super-charge your experience in Puerto Rico, then you should sure stay in the San Juan Water and Beach Club. From checking in, to relaxing on the beach, to being productive, this hotel has given myself and my other half Alissa the best experience we could ask for. Alissa is a model and she is picky about a few things and its great when we travel and i hear little to no complaining. The beds practically cuddle me when i sleep. The beach is beautiful. I was able to work out at the gym. The restaurant there is top-notch. We ate there way more than we planned. i danced on the roof top where there is a bar with friendly bar tenders and a swimming pool and beds to rest in or read or chat with buddies. I am using the business center to write this review this minute. Ive been using the Wi-FI in my room, no problem. Also, we like to party so the roof-top parties are our cup of tea. If you are a person that likes friendly folks, this is the place for you. All of the staff we've experienced so far the week and a half we've been here are just fantastic. Here are just a few of the great staff that made it great. Abraham and Paloma are consistently helpful at the front desk. William is super super positive and very very welcoming as if he is the humble heir to the place( I'm assuming he's not an heir) but even on rainy days he's smiling. And then there's Kevin (seen below), he gets the chairs and the umbrellas and towels and almost all of our beach needs. so don't worry about a towel because this really cool and friendly chap has your back. That's the best part for Alissa so during an impromptu photo shoot on the beach, we snapped one of him and her together because it was her favorite part...the beach.

My husband and I have always had a positive experience here, but perhaps that is because we always get ocean front rooms? My only complaints were the bathroom lock being broken, but that was barely an issue, and the doorman the first day we got there - when I walked up to the door with bags in hand, he was on his cell phone and I had to say very loudly , \"I guess you juggle your own luggage AND open your own doors in this place\" before he snapped out of his cell phone trance to hold the door. Needless to say, that was the only time that happened. Everything else has always been absolutely PERFECT for me, they even have treats for your dogs upon checking in and inside the room! The staff has always been very helpful even prior to arrival. My husband planned many surprises for my bday ahead of time with the hotel and everything went off without a hitch :o) However, my friend and her boyfriend were with us last time, and they were not so lucky. The got an INSANE deal from Expedia so got one of the rooms in the back of the hotel. Let's just say the service they received was less than stellar. They had to change rooms 3x because the hot water wasn't working in the first one, the phone and safe were broken in the next, and finally the 3rd night they got a decent room but obviously by then they were put off. She also said the staff had attitude but like I said, she may have just already been put off by that point. They did credit her one night and offered her a free night should they return, which I doubt she ever will unfortunately! I'm not saying that what she experienced is excusable or should be tolerated by any guest, but I guess you get what you pay for sometimes... My recommendation would be to get an ocean view or partial ocean view room at least to avoid any of those problems.

I thought the accomodations were worth the price that we paid (about $100/night for the room), but I would also stress that this hotel definitely caters to a distinct subset of the population - a younger subset. Blue lights and a rooftop bar that pumps out tunes until the wee hours of the morning are not for everyone (i.e. me). But my brother and sister loved every minute of it! Our room was clean but needed a few minor touch-ups. We did not have a particularly nice view. I did not have any problems with the AC or the bathroom. I do think that full shower doors and ventilation fans in the bathrooms would have been a good idea, but we got along okay without them. What I did like: The hotel was literally steps from a fairly clean, quiet beach, where beach attendant Kevin was always happy to set up a trio of umbrellas for me and my siblings. The hotel staff were unbelievably friendly and hard-working. The area around the hotel felt fairly safe, although I did not go out after 11pm. The free continental breakfast was good (cereal, muffins, yogurt, fruit, toast). There is a car rental operation and a Walgreens right across the street and a guy named Cotto who gives surfing lessons just a few blocks away Our room had a safe in it and Internet service (standard, not WiFi). What I didn't like: The decor was not my style and the common areas and lobby are in need of a little TLC. The fitness center had nice equipment but smelled very strongly of chemicals each time I visited it. The hotel is not located near many good/interesting restaurants or near any of the popular attractions in San Juan - we spent a lot of time waiting for/riding the bus to and from downtown San Juan and Old San Juan. The hotel's rooftop bar got pretty loud on Friday and Saturday (although some people, including my sibs, will see this as a plus). If you are young (or young at heart) and your idea of a fantastic vacation involves late night parties and lots of time in the sand, I would recommend this hotel to you! If you like NPR and going to bed early and are interested in exploring all the sights and sounds of San Juan, I would suggest that you consider other accomodations.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lynchburg, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNice Try.

On a more careful inspection, I found this hotel has been given about the same number of poor reviews as it has good ones. There is good reason for this. I cant quite figure out what to attribute the positive reviews to, other than lack of experience, sheer luck, friends of friends, or what the reviewer is used to. While the property has potential, it misses the mark by a wide margin. I love staying in these small designer boutique hotels, but I was more than disappointed in this one. At arrival we noticed that the inlaid lights on the steps were nearly all broken The facade showed a lot of rust running from the air conditioner units and a real need for some major painting. As far as location, this hotel has it made. The beach is beautiful and expansive. The road in front of this hotel is more of a driveway and not at all a bother. Also happening for this hotel is an open roof-top with restaurant and bar from which you will be rewarded with amazing ocean vistas. The Cubano sandwich; a mere ham sandwich with mustard and pickle that anyone could make at home, was very expensive The white leather/pleather beds that look really inviting and sexy on their website, are in fact, dirty at first glance with an alarming amount of mold on them underneath the pillows and on the reverse sides of the pillows themselves. I picked one up to place it under my head just to uncover this wet, slimy, black-moldy underside. This isn't something that happened overnight and reveals the type of care this property receives. The pool, only a few steps away is about the size of two or three standard hot-tubs. One couple seemed to be really enjoying it and having their own private party in it however. The lobby is inviting and the elevators are trying really hard to be hip and perhaps if the glass roof-tops hadn't been so dirty and marked-up, it would have made them appear a bit more chic. The hallways are dark and cool, but its difficult to find your room number as it is embossed into the door handle and has no distinct coloring. When we entered the room, it was freezing cold, which I attributed to a nicely working air conditioning system. I was once again disappointed. After less than a day, I realized the environmental controls were badly lacking. First of all, there is no ventilator fan in the bathroom, which would be fine if that were the only issue. Secondly, there was no balcony and you cannot open the windows as they are nailed shut. And back to the air conditioner, there were two choices: we could be freezing cold, as in 60 degrees F, or turn the unit to a warmer temperature and have the condensation from the unit all over the floor. Not just a little run-off, but a slippery skim over half of the room all around the bed. And, yes, as stated in previous reviews, your shower will run off into the floor as well. All of this adds up to all of your towels on the floor to sop up all of the water, absolutely no fresh air, damp clothes, a bathing suit that never dries and getting out of bed to put your feet down on a wet floor. Very uncomfortable. We never felt comfortable or dry in the room. We expected high humidity in the natural environment, but certainly not quite this much in our room. In our Ocean Front King room, the hotel provided us with mismatched bathrobes that were hanging in the bathroom over the room's only full length mirror. That's because there is no where else to hang them or much else for that matter. There is no closet in the room, but the hotel provides a wardrobe cabinet instead. The only problem with the wardrobe is that it is a fraction of the size, vertically speaking, that it should be. You can hang a shirt, but nothing longer. We stored our backpacks in here too since we couldn't leave them on the floor and of course ended up bumping our heads a few times when we had to get something from them. Their website distinctly states that they have updated and made modern their bathrooms. What this really means is that they have installed a counter top sink and a modern shower head. The floor tile was badly marked-up and did not look modern or newly installed. The Desire Program they have partnered with, again, on their website, turned out to be a little bit of a joke. To sign up, I completed a survey and answered the question of what we would prefer to drink and have as a snack upon arrival. About 15 minutes after getting to our room, we had delivered ONE bottle of water and a bread plate with loose peanut M & Ms poured onto it covered with plastic wrap. We shared the water. Thanks for being attentive to our desires! However, for nine dollars, we could have another bottled water and each of us a full pack of peanut M & M's from the mini-bar. There is absolutely nothing classy about skimping. I realize this was free, but to advertise something so lush (Desires) and fail to deliver is only going to set the customer up for disappointment. The lighting in the room is your choice of black light, or dim reddish/yellow reading lights attached to the bed. Both are fine, cool, hip, chic and all that jazz, unfortunately there is no real illumination for you at night which can be a little frustrating if you really need to see or are trying to pack your bags. So the black lights are forced on you, like it or not. On their website they write extensively about how they are set to cater to the business traveler with all of their high tech amenities, however, when we went to the second floor to use the business center, we found two computers in a closet. One computer was a PC, the other a Mac. The Mac could still be trying to locate the address I typed in for all I know, we could never get it to work. Both of us, by the way, are in the computer industry. And, when we tried to print our boarding passes, we found that the PC did not have the Adobe Reader installed, so we couldn't get the simplest of tasks done. We were even going to use the back side of our hotel bill to print the boarding pass as there was no paper in the printer and none in the computer closet. Any claims that are being made that this facility is equipped for the modern business traveler is questionable at best. I didn't see any evidence that a designer had attempted to pull things together here, with tired, old furniture and hints of 1970's paneling veneer mixed in with the tile and door jams that have had no attention whatsoever paid to them. The black lighting was a consistent theme as well as the white paint . Other than that, it was hodge-podge and flea market/auction items that must have been limited in quantity. The employees are very nice, pleasant, generous, warm and professional, with the exception of the wait staff, who were cold and unresponsive and not at all service oriented. Checking in was quick, the front doors were always opened for us, taxis hailed and chairs set up for us on the beach. They provided us with a map of Old San Juan and gave us some direction for our outing. The employees always had a pleasant greeting and wished us a nice day as we left the hotel or a welcome back greeting when we returned. Obviously this was an initiative, but they carried it off sincerely. I don't stay at places like the Ritz because they are usually out of my price range. I do like honesty and good value for my money. I felt like I received both through out Old San Juan and Isla Verde with the exception of this hotel. I do appreciate places that are cared for and clean, regardless of a glamorous environment. A hotel does not have to be expensive and plush or luxurious to be a comfortable retreat as your home away from home. A lot of TLC and attention are needed here if this hotel hopes to be anything close to what it represents itself to be. I loved Puerto Rico and Old San Juan in particular and plan to come back to the island often.

The people are very nice, but the quality of the place falls short from being mediocre. My boyfriend felt deceived. From outside the place looks nice, especially since it's right by the beach.

The room smelled a little strange too; especially the bathroom. The upstairs area is nice with the couches and pool, but the pool is small and the couches look weathered. The food was ok. We had an issue with our room because the door would not lock. The maintenance staff had to bang the door a few times to get it to work...we weren't even offered another room. My boyfriend and I looked at some of the different hotels in the area and decided that although we had already pre-paid for our room at the San Juan Beach and Water Club, we were going to stay at a different hotel. We ended up staying at the Continental (down the street), and WOW, what a difference. The Continental's room was AMAZING compared to what we had before...wow...we were upgraded to an ocean view, and it was truly an ocean view...with a balcony and all. It really saved our trip.

The bed and pillows are welcoming and the hotel staff is very friendly and accomdating. One nice little perk is that if you ask, you can check out at 1pm instead of noon which worked out for us - we were able to get in some last minute beach time before we headed off. I thought the location was great - it almost felt secluded in a way - its literally 2 steps from the beach and located right behind the strip so you're away from street noise. I loved the fact that its right on the beach in isla verde! I did have the following disappointments, but by no means are these reasons not to go back, because I would definitely go back to this hotel! 1. Continental breakfast: This was lacking! There's some toast and a few muffins, but definitely not worth bothering to go... there are many other places you can go to for breakfast, like Mi Casita, across the street or the Espana Bakery which offers up some nice pastries and good breakfast sandwiches. 2. Parking: You have to pay for it. Its appox $22 per day, which is something you should consider if you're renting a car. I highly highly highly recommend renting a car if you can b/c the public transportation system hasn't caught up to the times yet! Besides, its very easy to get around the island and there's sooo much to do in PR! 3. Bathroom: There is no shower door and its part of the design so there's no way around it. Its a standing shower with half a glass door - the part thats shielded by glass separates the toilet from the shower head - but thats it! Water was all over the bathroom floor and eventually leaked into the bedroom so we put alot of towels down to prevent the water from escaping the bathroom. Also, the toilet paper is in an odd spot. 4. Hallways: Too dark! I understand the whole cool, trendy theme, but really the hallways don't need to be that dark - its a dark blue light that to me was a little annoying. 5. Weekends: The rooftop gets LOUD! For myself and my husband, we were fine with that but the music is very loud and doesn't stop till 2:00 am. Its great if you're joining the crowd, but if not, dont plan on getting any sleep earlier than 2:00 am! 6. Pool: Very small!!! Don't bother when you have an incredibly beautiful beach right there infront of you! As I mentioned before, these reasons would not prevent me from going back. I would definitely go back! Its location is priceless but I wouldn't want to give a review without explaining everything I got to see for myself and provide my opinion. I read the reviews that are posted on this site and I make my decisions based on the reviews so I just want to give anyone who's reading this, the same exact courtesy I get from reviews by others. One other thing worth mentioning is that their spa services are a bit overpriced - we found a great little spa with more available treatments in Old San Juan.

Your greeted by Willie right at the door aswell as awsome front desk clerks. Building and everything is all white filled with black lights( dont worry it wont hurt the eyes) which made it special. The rooms are great ( conftable beds, luxurious bathrooms for you and ur partner, your own bar to fill wat ever your needs are. Excellent view of the ocean/beach to make it that much extra special. We had room 702) Then that leads me to \"The Wet Bar\" which I called it the king floor. You get to order from the resturant on the lobby floor, Drinks etc. Cant forget that you drink for free from 5 to 6pm (recomend Mojitos and Long Islands Blue or Reg) and after that any drink you want, they have it! The Wet Bar has the best view of all which is the whole beach strip up and down the coast. Gotta let you know why they call it \"The Wet Bar\" , there is a pool up there with a better view of everything! ( Recomend once you get settled in your rooms, go straight to the \"T\" floor to to enjoy all of that before you do anything. It makes it real special for you and your spouce, Sets the tone and mood on the rest of your Vaca or buisness trip) Most chances Demilo will greet you at the bar and he knows his stuff ( Thank you for everything).

The pictures on their website and the comments on Facebook made it seem like a fantastic hotel, however, we were so disappointed when we arrived. Like many hotels in this part of town, It's just around the corner from the airport - although this isn't really a problem (compared to everything else). Although the hotel is right next to the beach, there's actually a little road which finishes in front of the hotel. From the photos we thought you walked out from the hotel onto sand - but you don't. It's really just the case of crossing this quiet end of road, so no big deal - but not what we had been lead to believe from the photos. When we arrived, nobody helped us with our bags. The hotel looks quite run down during the day from the moment you arrive. At night they cover this well with clever lighting, but it looks as if a major renovation is way overdue. The style is not to my taste; it's very tacky and cheesy, and it all looks so dated now (although some how, this doesn't show in the website photos). There's a fountain encasing the elevator, but it's so old and dirty. The light doesn't shine through it properly, and it's very unpleasant to be in as the light is so gloomy. The corridors of the hotel seem like an old night club, with dim grubby lights - the wifi didn't work in the bedrooms. We couldn't get it to work in the communal areas upstairs where it is supposed to work. The bedroom had an old window which was double-glazed, but with condensation in it,obscuring part of the view. The air conditioning unit was built into the window frame (which again is a shame given we'd chosen a room with an ocean view), but the air-con made SO much noise, you wouldn't possibly sleep with it turned on - and Puerto Rico isn't somewhere you want to have the air conditioning off, as it's very humid, as well as hot. The room was much smaller than I would have expected, but the quality had no relation for the price- the previous week I'd stayed in a cheap cheap ($30) hotel in Tampa which had a much nicer room than this one. The door to the room didn't lock. We went to the roof terrace to have some lunch (not knowing that our room wasn't locked - luckily for us, nobody else knew, and nothing was lost!)... We had to wait 40+ minutes for the lunch to be served, however my fried food was absolutely served cold, and my partner's \"grilled chicken ceasar salad\" only contained limp salad, with no dressing, and boiled or steamed chicken. I personally quite like steamed chicken, but that's not what we ordered - and we certainly shouldn't have had to wait 40 minutes for it. I have rarely seen less appetising food. The swimming pool and deck area is also run down and looks dirty. I don't know if it was dirty, or just old and aged - but the trouble is, the hotel has a minimalistic look, with lots of white, and white looks terrible when it's old - and that's the trouble with the hotel through out. It's looks cheap and nasty now. Whilst complaining about the room and service we overheard another guest being told the hotel had run out of towels. In the end, we felt so ripped-off that we looked for another hotel, and found the Ritz was available near by (also near the airport), but for only a little more money - basically the cost was the same (perhaps slightly less) but didn't include breakfast whereas this hotel did include breakfast. To be fair, once we complained, we where shown another room with a door which did lock, and the manager tried his very best. We were given a free evening meal (which was better than the lunch we'd had), and a free bottle of wine. We even obtained a 100% refund, including for the first night, which I appreciated. His conduct was very professional - and I wish him the best of luck. But even he conceded that the hotel was looking very shabby around the edges, and was overdue a refurbishment. I advise against staying here until some major work has been carried out. The quality of the facilities bear no relation to the price.

I haven't taken a real relaxing vacation in 3 years and after much research around the Caribbean/Mexico area, I found this gem on CheapCaribbean.com. I couldn't recommend it more. Awesome location just a cheap cab ride from the airport, the beach faces one of the finest stretch of beaches you could ask for in an inexpensive tourist area. And I mean that in the best way. I ended up spending my entire trip in or around the hotel because it was so enjoyable. Comfortable rooms with great lighting that face the beach, free continental breakfast that is filling and appreciated, steps from the beach where they provide chairs, towels and umbrellas, and a staff that were above and beyond helpful and friendly, it was hard to leave this hotel. But, I will be back again in the future, this I know. If I had any gripes, it would only be that the hotel is not the quietest hotel I've ever stayed in, with doors slamming in the halls and often trucks in front, but I don't think this is a problem unless you want to go on vacation to sleep. The Wet Bar on the roof and Tangerine off the lobby are both fine places to relax and up and down the beach there are cozy, fun restaurants and bars.

And Virna is all smiles and truly wants to make your stay desirable. Tips for saving money: Don't book airport transportation through expedia or orbitz... it's only around 12-15 dollars to and from the airport in a cab. Buy a foam cooler and case of beer/liter of Don Q on the first day to bring to the beach & even up by the pool (they don't mind). Beers & liquor drinks on the beach and at Wet Bar after happy hour are expensive. Be sure to go to Wet Bar every day from 5-6 for happy hour!! Also, if you go on a snorkeling trip that promises free pina coladas and rum punch... it's true... BUT, they are very weak!! So bring a water bottle or two of Don Q to spike them up ;) El Ambique, next door practically to the hotel, has wonderful food. We got grouper and sweet plantains and i highly recommend both! Also, it's fairly priced. Old San Juan is a must! It's beautiful and quaint. Rent a car and go the rainforest. There's a car rental place behind the hotel on isle verde ave. called Charlie's that's good. Snorkel and/or dive (although it's no great barrier reef).

It was not my first choice and there were not many other hotels available, and after reading the reviews I decided to stay here. The staff: not as friendly as helpful as I expected. There were a few, it depends on who's there at the moment. The first night I talked to a lady at the frontdesk about places to eat in Old san Juan. While she did give some good suggestions, she failed to mention that virtually all of San Juan was in Condado for a culinary festival. Old San Juan was like a deserted ghost town that night, luckily found out from a waitress there about what was going on. The culinary festival was awesome btw. The room: I would definitely not stay in any other than the oceanview room that I was upgraded too. It was decent size but pretty dirty and dingy. While the view of the ocean was the only redeeming factor the window itself was so dirty, greasy, and just plain filthy and falling apart. Does that make any sense at all for an oceanview room? I hate to think what the other rooms looked like. Also the coffee maker was right next to the bathroom sink. Who wants to drink coffee from something that is covered with toothpaste stains? The shower has a stupid design like other reviewers mentioned but if you lay some towels down it's not that big of a deal. The bed was lumpy and towels, sheets were dingy with stains. The walls are RIDICULOUSLY thin. Could hear the couple next to us having every conversation, and fight when they came back from the bars at 5am. Definitely DO NOT STAY here if you are a light sleeper, you will be miserable. The rooftop pool: really dirty with bugs and other stuff floating around in it, but I wasn't planning on using the pool at all. The beach: this was a beach trip so I was pleased with this factor of the hotel the most. Right next to a clean and beautiful beach. It seemed like Isa Verde had much nicer beaches than in Condado. Chair and towel service was OK, no umbrellas btw. It was only from 9-5. While I was there they ran out of towels everyday. One day it rained a couple of times and they closed up at 2/3 pm \"because of the rain\". Went to look out the window after leaving the beach to see an event crew setting up for a wedding, how convenient for them that the beach area in front of the hotel was now free! If I wanted to stay in Isla Verde for the beach again I would stay at one of the other hotels. The Isa Verde area: pretty run down compared to other areas in San Juan. There is absolutely nothing to do at night, unless you only want to go to one of the other hotels in the area. Went to either Old san Juan or Condado area every night by taxi. The nightlife in Condado is much, much better, really good restaurants. Got to see my first choice hotel that wasn't available, La Concha. It looked like such a beautiful and well-maintained hotel.

From the moment, we arrived at the property we felt incredibly comfortable and it was almost as if we had known the staff for years... The room (703) with it's great ocean view and balcony was magnificent. It was spacious, laid out well, and provided a very comfortable envirnoment for both Linda and myself. The view of the ocean as you laid in bed was breathtaking and mesmerizing. The continental breakfast in the morning at Tangerine was a welcome addition and being able to sit outside and peruse the ocean to start your day was awesome. Matteo greated us every morning with his fabulous attitude and engaging smile and could never do enough for us. Not to mention the cost of the buffett, FREE.... Free Happy Hour nights, what a concept. Seriously,it was a great feeling going to the Wet Bar high above the hotel with the open air feeling and great views of the ocean. What a way to unwind on a nightly basis. Not to mention, the greeting from Danilo and Pedro with my Medalla light Day after day and night after night, we were greeted at the front door by both William and Ricky with their infectious smiles, constant great greetings, and warm attitudes. Most people at hotels such as this just do their jobs. Clearly, these two guys LOVE their jobs and are a great ambassador to the hotel. A picture of William is attached, just look at that smile and you'll undertand my thought process. The front desk staff, Gretchen, Maria, Cynthia, and Mardeliz, were always warm and engaging when we either came downstairs or just needed information. Both Linda and I would continually comment on their incredible attitudes and willingness to assist us with information or restaurant recommendations. I travel a great deal and believe me, the staff at a hotel can either make or break your visit. This group of individuals is a great asset to the hotel and a welcome sight to seasoned travelers such as Linda and I. My man Kevin at the beach was a great guy and a joy to speak with everyday. He would always bring us chairs and towels, greet us with his engaging smile and introduced us to his lovely wife and beautiful new daughter. Another employee who takes great pride is his job. Finally, what can I say about the Manager of Desires,Virna Concepcion. She is an incredibly warm, engaging, generous, and giving person whom both Linda and I felt after a week like we have known her for a lifetime. Even before our arrival, Verna was constantly calling and emailing us to make sure all aspects of our trip were taken care of with great detail. She made all the necessary arrangements for our Kayak, Catamaran, and Snuba trips. Set up our evening at La Perla, one of the best restaurants we have ever seen and provided us with recommendations for local establishments which we love. Linda and Virna really felt a bond and special relationship during our time at the property, a sort of Sister ship, if you will. I attached a picture that illustrates this bond. I wanted this trip to be very special for Linda and Virna ensured that it was one of our best trips ever. If you look in Webster's under great customer service, you might just find a bio and picture of Virna Concepcion. On a personal note, I would like to thank Mr. David Lopez personally for taking the time to meet and greet us and for being so available for us during our stay. It's rare a GM spends that much time with his guests and we truly appreciated your time and efforts on our behalf. In closing, I want to say that I went to the Water and Beach Club seeking rest, relaxation, and a great time. Instead, in a word, we found NIRVANA. It was truly a great vacation in every aspect of the word. The staff clearly is truly the epitome of customer service and relationship management. We plan on coming back to the property soon and to continue our relationship with all of the staff.

They did this when I checked-in and we were hooked up with one of hte best rooms in the hotel, 8th floor, direct ocean view, and very roomy (unlike the sample photos of rooms you see on their site which is of much smaller rooms). Doorstaff was great also. On the downside, the reviews I read prior to booking of paper thin walls are absolutely true.

It was ridiculous at a point where some kids would make it to the rooftop pool and then yell from the top to their friends still at the beach to pretty much say come up here its so easy. And soon after, groups of 5 would come up, jump in the pool, not caring for the people actually paying for the use of the pool/hotel and making a ruckus. This happened multiple days. The pool itself is TINY. If you are looking for a hotel with a nice, big pool, this is absolutely not the place. But we mostly went to the beach which is right in front of the hotel. If you want a beautiful, big pool go to El San Juan, Intercontinental, or the Ritz. But expect to pay up for rooms.

However, the hotel seems to have been maintained pretty poorly since, and lost its cool as a result. The location is decent (effectively on the beach), although the beach can get very loud (Reggaeton-loud) and crowded, especially on the weekends (it is a public beach after all). Our room was spacious for a boutique hotel, otherwise no-frills. Claims of wireless internet to be taken with a grain of salt - signal in room was very weak to non-existent, reception suggested I go up to the roof to get better signal, still didn't work so ended up borrowing a neighbor's signal on the roof. I could not find a LAN line in the room and reception did not know if one existed. Business Center was also experiencing tech problems as indicated by a fellow traveler. Amenities are largely there to fulfill a checklist - pool is a dipping pool, rooftop bar is inadequately staffed and stacked, beachside chairs and umbrellas on concession and inadequate (although guy is quite helpful and friendly), beachside service is painfully hit-or-miss, restaurant serves uninspired food in the most basic sense of the word. That being said, elevators have glass ceilings and a waterfall wall - both of which contribute to the heat inside the elevators and the a/c in the elevators (assuming it exists) is very inadequate. Also, no a/c in the room floor hallways, so by the time you are out of your room to go to the lobby it is time for another shower. Room a/c's are older-type stand-alone units - loud and irregular function, and no a/c in the bathrooms. A hot shower and/or blow-drying in the bathroom can heat up large parts of the room very quickly. The room was not attended to and cleaned until 430pm - 500pm. Odd mix of clientele, from semi-hipsters who thought it would be a cool hotel to older couples who appear totally out of place to spring-breakers (although not the rowdy ones) to others who are trying to make sense of it all. This mix could be as a result of the various promotions the hotel runs through online travel agencies, possibly to fill the rooms. If you can reserve for $150 or below a night, it presents an OK alternative to the nearby Ritz and El San Juan (where last minute deals could be had for as little as $229 at the time). At their \"list\" price of $250 or so, better alternatives exist.

It is not a quiet hotel and you can hear doors slam next to you. The room we had had a half panel shower as in another review, and we figured out that it must have been tested out a smaller stature person since it did not flood out with me, but did with my husband who is over 6 foot. There was no bureau in our room. The floor was kind of sandy and gritty, and while it did get cleaned, it wasn't thorough. We were disappointed in the continental breakfast. Each day we had to ask the staff to replenish the fruit. There were no juices and only bread for toast and pastries. Some yogurt, cheeses, granola/cereal, or even hard boiled eggs would have been a nice addition. Having stayed at other boutique hotels and B&Bs, this was by far not worth the $10 extra a night. You can go across the street to El Taquito's (it doesn't look like much) and have a delicious breakfast burrito for approximately $4. Would I recommend this hotel?

I would would have preferred to have stayed again at the Marriott, but was unable to get another night at the great rate I had obtained previously through Priceline. While at the Marriott, we used the computer in the business centre and were able to get the SJ Water Club (3.5 start), for $90 a night. Their regular rate is $250.

If you look closely, you will see that the paint covers up scratches and dents, and sometimes not even that. After waiting for almost an hour past the 4 oclock check in, we were given free drink coupons and since our room was still not ready, the girl at the front desk gave us an upgraded ocean front room. That was appreciated. The room is very nice, but again, as I said, don't look too closely at the scratches on the furniture, the mold on the shower ceiling, etc. The room was ocean front and we were able to sleep with the door open and listen to the waves. We had to, the air conditioner was so noisy, we wouldnt have been able to sleep with it on. I know this sounds negative, but if I had had to pay the top rate, I would have been very dissapointed. Even some senior citizens who stayed there only got a discounted rate of $190. A continental breakfast was included, which was very nice. The service was excellent. For example, they let me use their phone to make calls, including long distance, and there was always someone available to open the front door, or store your luggage while you waited for your room to be ready.

The customer service at this hotel cannot be compared to anything I have ever experienced. Every employee from the General Manager, to the Sales and Conscierge staff, all the way to the Bartenders, Waiters, and Beach Staff were generally concerned that I was having a good time.

First, the blue neon lights EVERYWHERE was a bit too much. Blue light itself is very unnatural, and we would much rather have enjoyed a more serene environment. Secondly, the waterfall in the hallways and elevators was a bit moldy, and my allergies were angry with me the entire trip.

The door man was quite charming and pleasant, and Kevin - the beach chair guy - was amazing! We were always made to feel as if they were there to serve any needs we may have. Although we never visited Tangerine for dinner, or the rooftop bar Wet, it looked very nice. We did have breakfast at Tangerine most mornings, and it was good yet standard (not free).

However, it was so trendy that it made it uncomfortable at times. Let's start with the hallways and elevators, there is no AC at all in them. So, when you are coming back from 90 degree heat back to the room you really feel it going up the elevator that seemed to take forever. I think I lost 5 lbs just riding in the elevator and sweating. However, the ambeance of hallways was neat with the waterfalls in the hallway. We had a king size partcial view room. The rooms seemed really clean as well as the bathroom but there was no alarm clock, or clock for that matter at all in our room. The lack of dresser space didn't bother me since I like to keep my thing in my suit case but I could see how it would be bothersome for someone who enjoys unpacking. (We were there for 10 days so most people would unpack that long.) The blue lights in the room are VERY annoying. We kept ours off and used the only floor lamp but the maids would turn them back on. The TV tube was going out so it would go back and forth between color and black and white. The bed was very comfy and there were plenty of pillows, which was nice since it was really the only thing in the room. The walls were \"thin\" we could hear everything in the room next door so we know they heard us. I know they cleaned the bath room every day cause they would pack all my stuff back into my travel bag (which I really didn't appreciate, felt like they were going though my stuff). I also would leave my shampoo on the shower floor since there was not enough caddy space to put it and they would move it to clean the floor. The shower is great for two! And yes, if you are in there by yourself no matter what you do you will get water on the floor. The 1/2 glass wall just doesn't come out far enough. So be sure to put a towel down. There is ZERO counter space but I guess that goes for them minimal feel with the rest of the room. The staff is GREAT. They all will bend over backwards to help you and they are sincere about it. We were there during hurricane Omar and they made every accomendation to entertain the guest. They brought out a Wi and provided drinks and cookie, they went the extra mile since everything closed at 10 pm that day to prepare. Kevin and the door guys are the best. They will give you the low down on everything. Where to go, where to eat, what things are open before you spend the day driving there. (i.e, the caves). They make up what the rooms lack considering you really aren't spending that much time in the rooms. The amenities were so so. Wet, the roof top bar and resturant, was closed most of the time we were there but that was due to the hurricane. The pool is really a 5 foot wading pool but the leather lounges are nice. Tangerine was nice as well. We didn't eat there because it was so expensive but we had a drink there. The gym was closed when we where there so I just walked on the beach. I do have to say it is the best location for the beach. Yes, you walk across the street but it's like 10 steps and the other hotels you walk further. It's on a side street so not a lot of people hit that part of the beach. The El San Juan Hotel and Intercontinental are right there for the casinos, shopping, and dining so you can walk there in less than 5 min to enjoy those. Plus, you can really tell the difference between the staff when you visit the others. Water and Beach has MUCH better staff.

The only complaint we had was their bathrooms....yah yah some water did splash onto the floor but not as much as others describe...just put that towel on the floor and its all good; BUT the shower head itself made a LOUD noise and seemed like it was coming from the plumbing rather than the shower head itself. Really....thats MY ONLY complaint. For the location (RIGHT ON THE BEACH) and the superb service.....its not that big of a deal. Their restaurant Tangerine is SO CUTE and CHIC although quite EXPENSIVE....the meal was finger lickin good and it was my birthday so I wanted to splurge. Get the lobster rolls - theyre worth it! We actually ate breakfast and dinner down at Tangerine once and had lunch upstairs on their rooftop lounge. Oh...take advantage of the coupons on their website...but 1 drink get 1 free...theyre there for a reason! The rooms are cute and a decent size...we were upgraded to an ocean view, but they dont have dressers so you leave everything in your luggage.

The bell boy in the morning and evening were really kind. They know all the places to go and will tell you how to get there. Also, Kevin the beach guy was very cool and down to earth. I asked for a room upgrade with a better view and the accommodated us the very next day with an ocean view room! Our rooms were really nice and clean. The bed was a king size very comfortable. Our mini bar was full and they had a basket full of snacks and some other products that we might need for an extra charge. The cool thing about the room is that they had and Ihome where you can plug in your ipod an listen to your own music. Also the blue lighting was ok...but it makes the hotel unique. Bathroom was small, but clean...no complaints..and cable TV. If I had to suggest something for the hotel i would suggest them to upgrade their TV to a Flat screen...it would make the rooms feel more chic and modern. The beach was literally across the street from the hotel...was absolutely beautiful. The roof top was really nice and chic. The pool was really small...and i didn't spend too much time in the roof unless if it was in the evening. The drinks were really good but a tad expensive. We had some drinks at the Tangerine bar and the bartender (young guy around mid 20's) was sooo friendly and yet he made great strong drinks. If you do want to save money a block away was a Walgreen, you can buy some snacks and beer and not waste money at the hotel...it will cost you! We didn't have dinner at the Tangerine restaurant, we went to Mi Casita which is a 5min walk from the hotel and i highly recommend it for breakfast and Dinner (inexpensive) and sooooo yummy try their Pork Chops and Mofongo... it's soo yummy! Old San Juan is about a 45min bus ride from the hotel. It is totally worth it and beautiful. If you do go their, you must go to La Bombonera in Calle San Francisco...delishes pastries and Cafe con Leche...so delish!

Everyone there knew you by name and used it regularly along with English. The service exceeded that of many 5 star hotels I have stayed in. Any questions I had they had an answer for. I had read a lot of reviews about how the nightlife there affected the rest of the hotel. I did not have this experience to the contrary. We did choose this hotel based on the fact that we would not have to leave to go party being it was a girls weekend, but things worked out otherwise. Unfortunately, the nightlife never seemed to be at the level we anticipated so we would venture a short walk down to El San Juan's Brava. This worked out well and really did not cause any inconvenience. So the notion that this hotel is not suitable for relaxation seekers or families is rubbish. We did notice that there were mostly couples there and from the people we talked to they also enjoyed their experience as well. Rooms- decent size, rm 401 with king size bed. Kind of awkward for us girls to share, but what do you expect when you book through Priceline? Check-in was simple, but there was no availability to check in early since hotel was booked. This kinda stinks when you get there at 11am and have to wait until 4pm to get unsettled. But it goes with the territory. Nice blue lighting in the room makes for some amazing pictures. Looks like the room is a giant tanning bed! Not good for makeup application, though! No dresser, just used the entire wall bench under the window. Bathroom and cleanliness adequate with nice toiletries. Pool- rooftop and very tiny! But being from FL where everyone has a pool, we were there for the beach! Which, by the way, is in no comparison to FL beaches! Food- let's face it, we weren't there to eat! We ate at the hotel very little, but was told the sushi bar was great several times. We did have breakfast at Tangerine which was quite good and reasonable. Was told dinner there was excellent but never got around to it. Service and coffee was great!!! Beach- just a few steps away and sooo gorgeous. Courteous staff even setup your umbrellas and chairs with pads for you!!! How fabulous is that? Great scenery, and I'm not talking about the beach!!!! Watch out for that sun, too!!! Location-perfect! Liked being at the end of the street which created less traffic. Short walk along beach will get you anywhere you want to go.

Excellent stay at Water Club\u201d", "Author": "dorasclone", "ReviewID": "UR18801188", "Content": "Please don't be influenced by the bad reviews left about the Waterclub Hotel. My best friend and I stayed at the hotel for 4 days and had a wonder stay. Is the the hotel The Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton? No..., but this is a nice, well kept luxury boutique hotel with all the amenities and impeccable customer service you would find in any 4-star hotel. I booked the hotel through a Travel Agent, but I did first read the reviews from TripAdvisor but my decision was not swayed by the bad reviews left. (one because they were trivial) We were greeted by courteous and helpful valet who immediately grabbed our bags and took inside while we checked in. The hotel decor was very hip and stylish and the aroma of fresh tangerine immediately appealed to your senses. We received complimentary breakfast receipts (which were not included in our package) and drink tickets valued at $10 (1per day per person) Our room was the 4th floor with a view of the beach and ocean. I dont believe the hotel has double beds, which is fine, the King suited us just fine. The room was nice, (its not spacious, but who stays in the room all day when you're on vacation) The ONLY thing about the room which I did have a problem with was the shower. There was only a half glass pane, which when you took a shower we had to lay a couple towels on the floor because water splashed everywhere. In addition to that, when would return from the beach to take a shower the sand would not drain properly in the shower so we had to call housekeeping to clean the shower out. Now, as far as the reviews in reference to the noise level. For one, this hotel is not for the 40 and older crew. This is a hip, young, party hotel. The rooftop constantly has activities every nite that normally don't start til after 9pm. I'm sure if you have room that is right underneath the rooftop (WET BAR) noise definitely probably is a problem, us on the 4th floor had no complaints. The hotel has a great location, the beach is just about 15 steps from the door to the sand. We didnt get a chance to eat at the restaurant Tangerine, but there were so many other places to go and eat. The airport is 5 minutes away. Housekeeping changed linens everyday ( and we didn't sleep under covers not one day) The hotel has a business center with 2 computers and one being a MAC, and a printer that actually works. Its open 24hrs. There was a gym with the basic equipment you would need. Walgreens is maybe a 5 minute walk to get anything you may need. I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is 30 yrs old and younger and likes to have an AWESOME time! I will definitely be back again", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and service, super attentive staff\u201d", "Author": "George_Vesa", "ReviewID": "UR18498443", "Content": "The kind of boutique hotel where the general manager, Bob, knows all of his guests and makes sure your stay is 5 star.

From the moment we got out of the cab to the final hours spent at the hotel before heading back to New York, everyone was friendly, courteous, helpful, cleaning and always smiling. The first room assigned to us (406) was fine except for the barking dog every morning beginning at 5:45 am. There are 3 private homes to the left of the hotel and the one closest to the hotel has a dog that is put outside every morning and barks for approximately 2 hours. So if you are a light sleeper as I am, request a room on the right side of the hotel. After the third morning I requested a room on the other side of the hotel. They told us they could accommodate our request and that it would be ready at the end of the day. When we came back from our activities later in the afternoon and went to the new room, we found ourselves in an ocean front room on a higher floor (703). Now I don't know if it's because we belong to RCI or that they just had the room available and wanted to please us. Nevertheless, it had a flat screen TV with better reception, an armoire with draw space and a small balcony. The bathrooms are decent with the only real problem being the shower. Water does get on the floor and into the room if you are not careful when washing. And make sure to put down 2 or 3 towels. The water pressure is not great (especially for those of us who have long hair and need that extra force to get the shampoo out). The blue lights are fine but they should put more real lights in the room (in case you need to look for something). The hotel is pretty much centrally located on the strip. There is a small alley-way between the hotel and the private home that takes you from the front of the hotel to the main avenue. If you go to the right there is a 24 hour Walgreens. If you go to the left, there are many fast food places (KFC, Long John Silvers, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Ponderosa). There is also a Burger King which is in a strip mall that also contains a supermarket, Subway, Chinese, Mexican, surf shop, etc. In the same strip mall is a restaurant called Mi Casita. This place is cheap and has great food. On almost any given night there was a line out the door for this place. They serve authentic P.R. food as well as Italian. There is also a bakery further down the strip mall called Gelo's. They have good breakfast foods and are also cheap. The rooftop pool was great. There was never anyone up there so we pretty much had it to ourselves. The white cushions were clean for sunbathing and they provide towels for your use. The view is great, there is a bar menu and you can have both the food and/or drinks brought to you while taking the sun. The music on the roof is loud on Friday and Saturday nights. You can hear the base even if you are on a lower floor and it usually goes until 2:00 - 3:00 am. And you can definitely hear your neighbors in the next room (if you know what I mean). Make sure to check your mini bar as soon as you get into your room. When we switched from one room to the other, the mini bar was not stocked like the first room. We told the front desk and they had someone come to check and restock. But when we checked out they tried to get us to pay the bill ($25.00). We told the girl that we had spoken to someone the day we changed rooms about the mini bar. The charges were taken off ASAP. We had a great time and would stay here again. The blue lights are romantic, the staff is great and the location is great. The hotel is a bit older and could use some updating (they were painting outside by the pool and inside over the front desk as we were leaving) but if you can look past that you will have a good time. They also hold your bags if you arrive early or have a late flight the day you leave and allow you to use the facilities.

Of course there is the bathroom light, but when sharing the room with two other people, that's not always accessible.

First of all, they try and create a romantic atmosphere in the hotel with dim blue lighting, but it only makes the place look scarier and feel like a hospital with all the white curtains and bedsheets in the hotel room. The lobby is quite small, as well as my room. But that's not the worst. On our 2nd day there, we got back to the room around 1 and nothing had been done to the room, no fresh towels, bed unmade, nothing new and we needed to take showers. I went downstairs to complain and the girl at the desk jotted down my room # and told me someone will go up soon. My friend and I left and came back around 3:30 and still nothing had been done. I went down a 2nd time and spoke with the manager. She got someone right away to go up, but my room should have been cleaned that MORNING! When my friend and I got back around 5, they were STILL in there, finishing up, so we had to wait in the scary blue hallway until they were done and even then, the maid came back because she had forgotten the toilet paper and soaps. As if that wasn't enough, that night when I went to go to bed, I noticed one of the pillowcases had several marks on it, which I don't even want to think about where they might have come from! The bus that takes you to Old San Juan is up the block, around the corner and down another block and after walking through the humid heat to even get to the bus, it takes close to an hour for it to come, hindering on your day greatly. We ended up taking a cab which cost us $15 after I talked him down. The only good thing I can say is it's very close to a supermarket, Subway, gift shop, Walgreen's, etc. And yeah yeah yeah, the staff was all smiles and friendly, but that means nothing to me if I don't get service I'm paying or.

We planned for a small beachside destination wedding in Puerto Rico. We both have never been to the island and not sure what to expect. We then found and spoke to the wedding and catering sales manager, Marilyn at the Water and Beach Club. There she said not to worry about a permit for they have there own platform and quoted us a price. We were happy to have found a place that seemed to good to be true, that's because it was! After receiving her rate we sent our contract back to the hotel through air mail. She said that the canopy priced increased and because she had not received anything, this was the price to set. Ok, not happy about that but will get over it. Then THREE weeks before the wedding they tell me they can not do the beach side wedding without a permit. This permit was a non refundable extra $500.00. And still this permit may not have enough time to review and if it was denied we would still lose the $500.00. THIS IS AFTER THE CONTRACT HAD BEEN SIGNED AND ACCEPTED! This is very upsetting so close to the date and the worst part was they did not seem sympathetic at all or offer any compensation. After settling for the site on their terrace I ask for some compensation. After a week of not hearing anything from them, even after multiple emails and messages. I call the GM and he does not offer anything, we had to demand a free stay at there hotel for failing to live up to their contract. This was a small feat at which should have been easy for them to arrange and still that was a struggle. The worst is yet to come. When we arrive THE DAY OF Marilyn says the seating arrangement we had would not be able to comfortable seat the people we had in its original spot. So she offers 3 other sites within the hotel. After we choose another alternative, she then says we can not have the space due to THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE PAYING PATRONS USE THE SITE FOR MASSAGES!!! Then after expressing my distaste in this hotel she says that I may use that site for an additional 250 charge. This hotel does not care at all about the thoughts and feelings of there guests!! A wedding is a special event and should be treated as so. Yet massages for other guest were more important then my dinner reception. These people falied to first know the limitations of their beach permits then treat me like it didn't matter to them how we felt about the situation. Not even to offer something to ease the situation. Even the GM did not give any consolation.

Previously, we stayed at Ritz Carlton when we visited San Juan. But, since Ritz Carlton changed the pet policy (we like to travel with our pet Chihuahua, Bruiser), we decided to give Water and Beach Club a try. Normandie Hotel, another dog friendly hotel in San Juan, was a disaster. Since we read a lot of negative reviews about the hotel, we came prepared, mentally as well. One thing that we worried the most was the noise level due to loud music from the roof top, as this loudness seemed to be the common complaints based on other people's reviews. So, we brought ear plugs, so that we could sleep at night. Surprisingly, it was not anywhere near as bad as we expected. What bothered us more was that walls were so thin that you could hear \"everything\" from the room next to you. Other than that, we were suprised to find that we had a very pleasant experience at the hotel. All staff were extremely warm, friendly, and helpful. In fact, I just received an email from Virna, Manager of Desires (membership that you can enroll when you visit the hotel site), wishing me Happy Birthday. Our ocean front room was very nice, good size for San Juan hotel, and had a great view of the beautiful beach. The hotel is also conveniently located to go to Old San Juan and visit other beaches etc. We did not eat at the hotel, as we have been to San Juan so many times, and we have our favorite restaurants. Here are a few restaurants that we recommend : 1) Marmalada located in Old San Juan - amazing food. This is our favorite. 2) Pikayo located at Museum of Art of Puerto Rico - great food and amazing service. We could not believe that the restaurant staff remembered where we sat and what food we ordered 6 months ago. 3) Aguaviva located in old San Juan - great seafood. For breakfast, we were initially going to Inter-Continental, as this hotel is a short walk from San Juan Water and Beach Club Hotel. But after 2 days, we found a local diner nearby and had breakfast there each morning instead of spending $60 for two at Inter-Continental. Getting back to the resort, one thing that we loved was that the hotel is extremely dog friendly. Every one loved our Chihuahua, Bruiser. It was so cool that we could bring him with us to the roof top where the swimming pool was and hang out there all day. So, for pet lovers, we highly recommend this hotel. The beach across from the hotel is not like the US Virgin Island or British Virgin Island beach with powderly white sand and turquoise blue water. But, it is very pretty and it goes on for miles. The hotel will provide you with beach chairs and towels. All in all, we were happy with the hotel. This hotel is great for a quick getaway, not for long vacation.

Eveyone smiled, they refered to me by my name, the doormen introduced themselves, shook out hands, very very positive and happy -- all the time. Eveyone gave off the impression of kindness and concern. They all have great personalities. That's the positive. The negative - the aesthetic needs a total overhall. The concept is cool and in its day Im sure it was. Magazine clippings framed on the lobby walls indicte that it was selected as one of the top hotels \"in the world.\" When you look at the date of the article, you find its 2003. There is no way its one of the best hotels in the world. Walking up the front steps to the entrance you see chucks of the concrete stairs missing, concrete railing pillars crumbling (not exaggerating). Not a great first impression. The lobby looks cool overall but when your eyes focus on the details you notice that its all tired -- all the walls are covered in out of date white polyester shears, floor to ceiling, The blue light that illuniates all the common areas including the lobby hides the dirt well, but if you're a clean freak like me, its dirty. The water fall in the elevator is cool but dated, it needs repair and you can see that the glass is stain, there are blue mozaic tiles missing, etc. You get off the elevaor and step into common halls which are extremely dark, lit only by blue light. All walls are covered by white sheers which are dirty - how could they not be?. The sound of the ocean is piped thru the halls, which is cool. You feel in a way that you're under water, the concept is cool. I walked into the room and the stench of dirty water which had been slopped over the floor by a dirty mop hit me like a ton of bricks, that was aweful. I told the maid that I didnt want the floors mopped at all during my stay. The room however is cool, no complaints, linens were great and very clean, bathroom was updated, but again, those white floor to celiing sheers on the walls and the blue light. Everything is lit by blue light; however the chioce to switch on headboard halogen and an incandescent floor lamp was available. The partial ocean view was just that, partial. You couldnt see the ocean unless you walked up agianst the window and looked to the left; you couldnt see the water from anywhere in the room. The room didnt have adequate storage for clothes, you had to live out of your suitcase, which isnt so bad if thats what you're used to. The location on the ocean is great, although I thought that the beach area in front of the hotel was dirty; its also a local beach and people on the island litter like crazy and no one cleans up, at least not for the three days I was there. The ocean front is great nonetheless. The area outside the hotel is nothing at all, many American fast food places around, the area is not glamorous at all, but it did seem safe, which is important.

Despite a pleasant experience with friendly bell and front desk staff, Friday would entail the beginning of some major challenges. Upon returning to the hotel on Friday evening we recognized a multitude of activity both inside and outside of the hotel. It was clear the restaurant and roof top bar were both very popular on the weekend. The problem is the music being played, particularly the sound of the bass, made it impossible for us to sleep. The noise did not subside until 2AM, essentially destroying any potential of a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Much to our chagrin, the unbearable noise levels would continue on Saturday evening and persist until after 3AM! My future mother-in-law called the front desk and complained about the intrusive noise. The front desk agent advised they could accommodate a room change, however this obviously was not a practical solution at that time of the morning. That afternoon we inquired about utilizing the venue for a Friday evening rehearsal type event. We were advised someone would call us on our cell phone. We did not hear from him and therefore requested he meet with us when we returned to the hotel in the afternoon. He briefly spoke with us and was smug at best. He advised there is a 10K minimum for the roof top space during that time frame. To be honest, we would not spend ten dollars with him based on his poor and unaccommodating attitude. Later in the day we spotted him standing on the beach. We called him over and attempted to again converse about the possibility of having the event there. He appeared annoyed when we asked him to put a proposal together for us prior to our departure the next day (Sunday). We asked him to leave it for us and of course he did not. Based on his insulting attitude we were not surprised. The most frustrating part of the experience was that there was absolutely no communication regarding the potential for noise disruption on either night. I do not have to guess if this was an accident. Every guest of that hotel should be made aware at check-in, or prior to booking, of the noise levels that persist into the wee hours of the morning.

The rooms are not large or well-appointed since it has the minimalistic, hip design flair. But they are attractive if you like a more modern approach. bottom line is that we felt the service of doormen, front desk staff, and lounge staff to be above average and we loved the location and modern approach in the middle of SJ.

Second this is not a star resort with tons of amenities: If you want that stay at the Ritz down the street. This hotel is chic and while it does tend to try to be a little trendy, the blue lights in the rooms were really calming and relaxing. The furnishings are modern with an Asian twist and spot on for the environment they are trying to create. The music that plays in the lobby is light trance music. And my room was on the highest floor next to the rooftop bar and it was a weekend and I could barely hear anything. Third: Definitely try your best to come up with the extra money to get an ocean front suite. It is really hip and has a totally seperate living room and much more drawer space and clothes hanging area. The beach was right out your front door... might as well be ocean front and was very clean and relaxing and it was easter weekend.

Unfortunately in 2008, the hotel has obviously seen it's day come and go. The general look and feel of the hotel is one that is meant to overload the senses (once again, this may be cool if your on E). Most of the lighting throughout the hotel is by blue or black lights; in all of the rooms, hallways, elevators and common area's. There is a recurring soundtrack of waves crashing that is played ever so loudly in the hallways. That is layered on top of loud, cheesy techno music. So much so that you can hear it while you lay in your bed. The elevators and the ends of the hallways have waterfalls inside of them. The first time you ride in a elevator with a clear ceiling, a waterfall on the back wall, filled with blue lights, and blaring techno music you might think that it is cool(if your a raver-monkey). The WORST part of our stay at the hotel came at night. There was a planned rooftop party with 5 different DJ's that started at 11 and went until 5AM. The techno music was loud enough to keep even the soundest sleepers (such as myself) awake. But it was the drunken people in the hallways screaming that really put me over the top. I remember looking at my cool bedside IPod clock stereo when I heard the last yelling at 4:56AM. We were offered bottles of water in return for the worst nights sleep the next morning. The hotels restaurant \"Tangerine\" had an appetizing menu, and promised an award winning chef; however the food was nothing special. My sister had a $20 caprese salad, which consisted of 2 slices of tomato and one slice of mozzarella. I had a small $30 dish of linguine with 4 shrimp on it, with the most unflavorful cream sauce. My wife had $36 ribs that tasted great but were colder than room temperature. Our room had a very dirty floor. Sand had not been swept up since the last guests. Over near the window where the air conditioner was, the pergo flooring was all bubbled and peeling from previous water damage. In the bathroom, as you can read from many other guests reviews, there is a pane of glass that is far to small to block the spray of the shower head. Water will go all over the floor. Hot water lasted approximately 3 minutes before turning cold. As other reviewers have said, we had no safe in our room when we showed up. They did put one in shortly after, but it was not bolted down. Which leads me to believe that the hotel has a short supply of these and rotates them around, not securing them when they do. The supposed flat screen TV was a 19\" ancient Zenith TV with a mismatched remote that had electrical tape holding it together. I would be remiss if I did not point out some of the hotels good qualities. The location is on a dead end culd-de-sac right across from the beach. The location provides easy access to many of the nearby attractions and the airport. The rooftop has a fantastic view of the beach and surrounding areas. The rooftop pool is pretty cool with J Lo like white lounge couches surrounding it. (However, some had large tears in them and were obviously dirty). The free little hotel soap and shampoo was some designer stuff that was actually really nice. The IPod clock radio was another nice little touch. I have hardly ever in my life complained about a restaurant or a hotel. But I feel the need to warn those who are drawn into this hotels cool boutique feeling and inviting photographs.

Beware of the LOUD experience... on many levels. When entering the hotel you'll be greeted with the sound of rushing water... not only are there many fountains all over the building, they pump in (loudly) the sound of running water and crashing waves. While I appreciate what they're trying to do, the water sounds pumped into every level, on every floor in every nook and cranny, are way too loud and way over done. The upsetting part of the stay was the horiffic sounds at NIGHT. And I'm not talking 10 p.m. 11 p.m. or even 12 p.m... A roof top DJ party raged well it 6 a.m. While I was staying on the 8th floor (and the roof top is the 11th), I was kept awake by blaring techo music and crazy people screaming drunk in the hall ways all night long. I am a very heavy sleeper, and it was the first time I can remember being kept awake. I was not notified that this party was taking place (by expedia, or the hotel). Upon calling the front desk at 4 a.m. 5 a.m. etc, no one even answered so that I could complain about the rediculous noise and bed base shaking boom boom techo going on. (Please note that I am 22 and not a 60 year old... I like to party as much as the next guy... and I didn't even get to bed until 1 a.m. that night anyway) In the morning the \"manager\" of the hotel promised to comp money for the horrible time, however this never happened and I've been sent on a wild goose chase to try and get some type of compensation for my almost 300$ night laying awake listening to screaming drunks and techno. The only up-side to the loud techo late-night/early-morning techo party was that it music was beyond loud enough to drown out the annoyingly loud water crashing waves music that may have otherwise kept me awake as well. The area surrounding the hotel is unsafe. Speaking with the bell boys, I was able to find out the area was previously very over-run with drugs etc, and that police were constantly patroling the area to try and keep an eye on the safety of the tourists. While this might appear to be comforting, be aware too that you can take a short walk around the corner to one of the worlds biggest cock-fighting arrenas. Its a stange area to stay in. While its a pretty location and the decor in the hotel is great... beware of the LOUD music and water noises.

While the location was great, there are some things that could be attended to that would make this a great hotel. Our room was nice - on the 9th floor, with a french balcony. We booked a deluxe room online and we had an ocean view - not ocean front, but we could see the ocean. It had a king bed, with a tv. Very clean. Now the issues - there was no bureau in our room, so we had to live out of our suitcases. Not a big deal, but there wasnt even a closet in our room. There was a space that looked like it would be a closet, but there was this desk drawer thing that made it impossible to hang up a dress or pair of pants. The \"mini bar\" - and I use that term loosely - was set up on top of this desk drawer. It was a wooden tray with some snacks in it - no refridgerator or anything. We didn't have a safe or an ironing board in the room - we did have an iron. We called down and they brought us up a safe and ironing board. Well, if you can carry a safe up, you can carry it out of the room - it wasn't bolted down or anything. And, it didn't work. So I am glad that I didn't bring my laptop. We would just put our valuables in a suitcase and lock the suitcase - not the best security, but better than nothing. And nothing was ever taken. We were also missing the binder with all of the hotel info, room service menu, etc in it. So on a night when it rained, we went down to the front desk to ask for a room service menu - they said it was in the binder, which we didn't have. We were also missing the marker for the \"Your Desires\" board, so we could never communicate what we needed. These were all of the little things that we felt could have been taken care of and would have made a big difference. It in no way ruined our trip, just made for some annoyance. And our shower leaked all over the place - we just put towels down to absorb the water. The bar on the roof was great and we had some good sushi and drinks there one night. We booked the trio tour package through the hotel, which was to the Rain Forest, Luquillo Beach and the Bioluminescent Bay. We highly recommend it; Debbie our tour guide was great. We also spent one day in Old San Juan and toured the 2 forts - definitely worth seeing. We walked every night down to the other main hotels - Intercontinental, El San Juan & the Ritz.

Yes the entrance of the hotel looks like South Beach Miami but the rooms are not. Just to give you an idea of our taste, I'm 28 and my boyfriend's 37, we've traveled pretty much to all the top destinations internationally. We consider ourselves part of the trendy crowd and easy to please. We usually hit the new trendy clubs but also traffic sports bars and wine bars. From the pictures posted on the hotel's website I'd say the photographer did an amazing job but in real life the furniture looked like it was purchased from Ikea, small rooms with a small closet area, the restrooms - shower does not have a sliding door or curtain nor exhaust fans to remove humidity - basically you'll have to crack the window in the shower to let out the humidity and let in hot air, plus you'll end up with water splashing out of the shower and into the restroom. Big mess and I can assure you I'm pretty low maintenance, this stuff usually doesn't bother me but I was annoyed by how much we payed, I expected 5 star hotel amenities for that price. And lastly the pool was dirty and the nice view blocked by the dirty safety glass around it. Hotel food is overpriced, instead we opted for a hotdog from one of the vendor's on the beach, yummy and only $2.00 each, oh and they come with shoe string fries on top. My boyfriend and I found better options in Old San Juan. The best food and atmosphere was here in Old San Juan. Try Dragonfly or Tantra restaurants. We tried several restaurants in Old San Juan area and were never dissappointed, can't wait to go back to eat here. In Old San Juan you will also find nice nightlife, not chic and trendy but better than what the Beach & Water Club has to offer. Back at the Beach & Water Club - beautiful lounge and you'll hear hip hop and some salsa all night long, would be nice if they alternated the music a little. We tried out the hotel's lounge one night and the music was way too loud, lounder than a club, I asked if they could turn it down a notch and they said no, crazy since I noticed other patrons were annoyed by it too, I'm sure I was not the first nor the last to request this. Anyway their response was, they were trying to bring in people from the other clubs around the area, not sure why since the crowd was kinda young and rowdy - Spring Break crowd - the lounge has a rooftop but is open all around, basically their theory was play the music loud enough so that everyone in a five block radius can hear it and come party. The best club we found at the time was at the casino, even Tommy Lee and his buddies partied there that night. I think as long as the music is enjoyabe and you're with good company then you'll have a good time. Things I recommend to try while in Puerto Rico - While there we toured the Bacardi factory, very fun and even better with free drinks. We also did the rainforest, loved it. FYI - wear you're bathing suit under your clothes so you can enjoy a nice cool dip by the waterfall, you'll need it after the trek down to it. Things I liked about this hotel, only two - the beach is beautiful and the lounge has a great view. Overall I give this hotel a 2.5 stars out of 5 because of the lack of hotel amenities, overpriced for the quality, the staff is not very friendly with the exception of the boutique owner - he's a sweetheart. We will not be staying at this hotel again. This hotel is lost when it comes to which crowd they are catering too. I recommend this hotel to the Spring Break crowd.

When walking in, you can see that someone put some thought into making it very trendy and modern. The problem is that this was apparently done a few years ago, and not much maintenance has been put into the hotel since then. Its literally falling apart in some places. Paint is chipping and dirty, walls are scuffed and you can see in some places where several coats of paint have been applied. But thats the lobby / public areas. Unfortunately, the rooms suffer from the same issues. While they are nice and modern and artfully decorated, they are not very well maintained beyond the standard cleaning that goes on. One thing that bothered my wife and I immensely was the loud air conditioner that did not manage to keep the room very cool even at the coldest setting. But because of the humidity we didn't really have a choice. Another thing that bothered us was that the restaurant on the rooftop never seemed to be fully functional. My wife and I had a ticket for a free lunch at the rooftop restaurant. We went up there, and nobody seemed prepared to greet us or take our order. It seemed very disorganized. But the food did arrive somewhat quickly. Much to our dismay, the pizza we ordered ($12) was not much more than microwaved frozen pizza. It was horrendous, especially given the quality that the hotel espouses. Its very cool to have the hotel right at the beach. Its actually a public beach. The hotel will provide towels. Get there early if you want to grab one of the limited beach lounge chairs. Overall, we give this hotel a 3 because although it is very cool and trendy, it is not well maintained, especially given the cost. The food (that we had) was overpriced.

Of course, with all of the construction in the area there was a lot of noise by 10:00 a.m. every morning. So, light sleepers may have a problem with the noise factor. The hotel itself has great potential. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is modern and crisp which is a refreshing break from the traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotels. When you first walk in, the hotel shows quite well but if you slow down and pay attention to the details, you will see where some sprucing up would be in order. There are some areas that need attention, namely the elevators and the water features on the walls. The elevator was slow, and despite the dim light you could still see the worn and dirty carpet. The hotel has music playing pretty much all day but I actually liked it and it added to the overall atmosphere. The hotel has a wonderful feel to it overall and I think with a little TLC it can be a real standout. The room and bathroom was not as small as I had feared, and the room was decorated very nicely. Everything was clean, white and modern. There's an interesting bluish light surrounding the perimeter of the room that enhances the decor. If there is one issue it would definitely be the lack of storage storage. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tiny three drawer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ikea\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type dresser in the closet. There was no place to store luggage so I ended up using the armchair during my stay to place my luggage. The lack of storage can be a definite problem for most people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially on an extended stay. There was not a full sized ironing board either but rather one of those small ones with no legs that are typically used in college dormitories. That was a bit of a hassle since I had to prop it up on a chair in order to iron my clothing. The bathroom shower has a half \u00e2\u20ac\u0153door\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd enclosing it but I did not have any problems with water going everywhere. The bathroom was not luxurious by any stretch of the imagination but it seemed to work well with the overall d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the room. It was clean, modern looking and everything was in good working order. I booked during off season and well in advance so I only paid $137 per night for a standard, non-ocean view room. I had a chance to see the inside of a full ocean view room and the view was spectacular. Frankly, with the close proximity of the beach, unless you are fortunate enough to get one of the ocean view rooms that has a walkout balcony, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if it is actually worth paying the premium for the view. One of the highlights of the hotel is the staff. Everyone was professional, friendly and willing to help in any way they could. They really made the stay even more enjoyable. Just so you know, the cleaning staff does not change the sheets every time they clean the room. So, if you like your sheets changed daily, you may need to ask. A few things about the area surrounding the hotel. First of all, you can get to the casinos at the InterContinental, El San Juan Hotel and the Ritz Carlton by taking a short 5-10 minute walk with the Ritz Carlton being the hotel furthest away. There are a lot of fast food restaurants within walking distance, including Mi Casita (authentic Puerto Rican food) and Metropol. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an Outback Steak House, Ruth Chris and other well known American restaurants within walking distance. The area is heavily patrolled by police, especially at night. There are a few eateries as well as a Walgreens that is open 24 hours, and there are a lot of people walking the streets late at night. I and my friend (we are both women) actually walked from the InterContinental casino on two nights well after 2:00 a.m. and the streets were well lit and there were quite a few tourists and locals out and about. The police drive up and down the stretch every few minutes with their blue lights flashing. While it is always good to not take any unnecessary chances, I can honestly say that I never felt unsafe walking the main streets at night. You can get to Old San Juan by taking the A5 at a bus stop located just a minute or two from the hotel. The fare is $0.75 and the ride is about 40 minutes or so. The route meanders through a lot of the local neighborhoods and a few shopping districts, but the very last stop on the route is at the bus station in Old San Juan. Once you get off at the last stop, you can exit either through the front or rear of the bus station and will immediately see the shops of Old San Juan. I highly recommend taking the bus if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning a day trip to Old San Juan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it sure beats paying $19 one way.

Richard, the doorman out front was very friendly and was chock full of info for us...i.e where shops and restaraunts were located at. BTW, there were several within walking disance and the prices were just like here in the USA. It was a breez to go visit Old San Juan; just catch the bus 200 meters from the hotel,pay your dollar and enjoy the 45 minute ride! On the downside of this hotel was the unbelievable expensive restaurant they had at the main level. They charged $13 for a stack of pancakes and $16 for a hamburger and fries. Happy hour was a joke, it was by one get one free, but it was only for their cheap liquor...not for beer.The hotel was fenced off in some places,guess there are lots of shady people at night wandering around.

This hotel is SICKKKK...it's definitely for young couples or singles. I stood here for a long weekend and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel. Let me start by mentioning their hospitality...the minute we arrived the gentlemen at the door asked us our names and throughout the stay they would always say to my boyfriend, \"Hey Alex How is everything?\". No matter what any of the employees were doing they would always stop and say hi, they were definitely on top of their game. The Room: I knew my trip was going to be a blast the minute we checked into our room. Our view of the beach was just flawless. The bathroom, yes was small but I wasn't planning on spending my vacation in there...it was spotless and that means more to me than anything else. There's an Ipod Dock that allows you to place your ipod and play music...That was my favorite part b/c I got to listen to my tunes the whole weekend. Overall the room was amazing. The Food: We went to a couple of restaurants that were amazing. Levi's which is on Ave. Isla Verde was realllly good..it's located about 10 minutes (driving) as if you're heading to the Condado..if you go you must try the Mofongo (smashed green plantains)..one of the best! There's also 'La Casita' just a couple of blocks away that was cheap and excellent. Every morning and afternoon that we would pass by the restaurant there was a long line, so we knew then and there that we had to try it. The massage: It was my birthday and my boyfriend called the hotel in advance to book an hour massage for me. The hotel contracts the services of this young lady named Karen Lugo. This massage was like no other. It was the most spiritual massage I've ever had...she's a body healer and you can feel all the negative energy you have inside just release your body as she massages you. The massage took place on the second floor balcony of the hotel..it was surreal to look up and see the turqoise water as I was getting this amazing massage done. YOU MUST YOU MUST GET A MASSAGE...her phone number is (787)635-1440 or email her at bodyhealer@hotmail.com....TRUST ME you will love this! Activities: There plenty to do around there. For starters, the hotel has a lounge called 'Wet' on the roof, which also has a pool that yes is small but it's really nice if you want to just lay out in one of their white beds and soak up some sun. At night a lot of people visit the loung upstairs because the view of the island is amazing from up there. There's also El San Juan Hotel (ESJ)...the minute you enter the lobby of that hotel there's people dancing because of the salsa band that plays there at night. It was very crowded and a mix crowd of young and older people They have a really nice casino as well. And of course, you must go and visit El Viejo San Juan (Old San Juan), it's just mesmerizing beyond words. We spent a whole day just walking the beautiful streets...it was just so romantic.

We made the right choice with Water Club. Being in the Hotel Industry, I am probably one of the most cricical of critics when it comes to hotels. My clients have included Ian Schrager, Leona Helmsley, Starwood, Marriot, etc. So I will be very candid in this review. 1) Does if have the vibe of Ian Schrager? Yes. It is totally South Beach Miamai and New York all wrapped up. Does it need some attention to maintain the vibe? Of course, but considering it is a tourist hotel with a hip, chic following, what more would you expect than a little wear and tear. 2) Rooms? Nicely appointed, very hip, great use of space (think HGTV's \"Small Spaces). They take every square inch of space in a 300 sq. ft. partial ocean view room and utilize it nicely. My only observation was, \"Why didn't you upgrade the bathrooms to be hip and chic? Air conditioning worked great and we had a nice \"partial view\" of the Isle Verde beach! After all, who is going to sit in their room and stare out the window. 3) Staff? All I can say is \"WOW.\" Very attentive, friendly, and gracious. In fact, when we checked out yesterday, they were having a staff meeting in the lobby and each and every staff member wished us well and thanked us profusely for visiting. Favorites bartendar Philip (yummy), Julia waiteress in the \"Wet Bar\" on the roof, Kevin the beach guy, door man who I forget his name but an older (not ancient) guy who was just the best, Christina at the front desk, and the list goes on. 4) Location? Great. If you want a cool, hip, hotel without the overwhelming tourist traffic and over abundance of american eateries, then this is the spot. Isolated? Depends on your view. We loved not being in tourist central (Old San Juan), steps to the beach where chairs and umbrellas were always ready and waiting (thank you Kevin), drinks a plenty. Negatives - Isle Verde does not have an over abundance of restaurants unless you like Burger King (two within two blocks of the hotel) Wendy's, Subway, etc. However, the adventure of trying the local hangouts was good - Metropole(Puerto Rican/Cuban Cusine - recommend the Cuban Fiesta Dinner), Bachallina, Mi Casita (great local place next to the supermarket and subway), Ediths for true local, local dive hang out. However, be prepared to pay $15 - $20 each way to get to Condado or Old Town San Juan. 5) Tours? The tour group recommended by the hotel was top notch - Ask for Joey as your guide! He was awesome. We did the Rainforest (beautiful), another beach and the bioluminescent kayaking. Nice day, very long (9:30 a.m. - 10:00 p.m.) but worth it except for the beach (was just a public municiple beach). But as I said, ask for Joey!!! 6) Recommendations in Old San Juan - Sonne (Sangrias), Turkish Restaurant, Pina Colada Club next to the Fort for great iced frozen cool down drinks (non-alcholic and great on a hot day when visiting the forts and walking). Happy Hour at the hotel, drinks 2 for $5 from 5 - 6. Use the free drink welcome coupon at Wet for your free Mojito. Use your free lunch coupon at wet, just be prepared that if you have cocktails your bill will still be $40. Try the nachos. Interesting use of Wasabi Chips. 7) Disappointments but not complaints? Maid service lacked on a couple of days, but use the \"Desires\" board in your room and everything will be fine. Elevators slow. Drinks expensive at the hotel, but what do you expect. 8) Ignore the comments about the noise and music(we stayed in room 710, right next to the elevators which have the cool music that resonates day and night and never heard a bit of the music in our room nor the elevators), enjoy the oversized couches on the roof deck, bask in the chic atmosphere, ignore the comments about the gift shop (nice stuff), elevators are a very cool experience, enjoy the white pallette of the hotel and minimilistic approach, and most of all \"take it all in.\" Was I overwhelemed by the experience? Being a hotel guy - not overwhelmed, but truly enjoyed the essence and experience and would stay there again when in Puerto Rico.

We love that San Juan is a direct flight from Boston, and that within 10 minutes of landing, you can be on the beach or at the roof top pool. Because we loved it so much the first time, we actually came back (something we have never done)--and we invited friends. We had told them how wonderful the roof deck and pool was, how good the restaurant was, what a fun city San Juan is, etc. I had read that it had changed owners, but some of the reviews seemed to suggest it hadn't declined much. They could not be more wrong. This hotel went from a polished, south-beach-cool kind of place to a dirty, cheap (there is now a hat-rack in the lobby selling beach hats), over-priced place trying to do everything in its power to induce orgies. However, unlike a scenester places in NYC or South Beach trying to create an orgy-effect, this place doesn't discriminate as to who it lets in--which frankly can be a little disgusting. The result is a bunch of overweight locals wearing bikinis and terry-cloth short-shorts taking over the roof starting at 4 pm and staying until the night is over. You'd like perhaps to have it be the beautiful people of San Juan, but it's not. It's literally late teens and early twenties types who would wear terry cloth short-shorts in the evening to a place that ostensibly doesn't allow men to wear shorts after 6--not true by the way. As I mentioned, the chubby terry-cloth-short-clad girls are no accident. The hotel has clearly changed its target demographic. Probably the most overt example of this is the menu of the restaurant, Tangerine (which USED to be fantastic, e.g., one of the best soups I've ever had, a very rich Pumpkin-Galangal soup). This example will seem bizarre, but keep reading. The quality of the very expensive food should really be guessed at by the descriptions of the menu items. Literally every single menu item has some sort of soft-core porn sounding description; example: the \"title\" of the soft shell crab appetizer was \"It's soft now, but can it get hard for me?\" Literally every single one had something like that. It's not particularly obscene, it's just ridiculous. But, we figured we'd try it because last time it was very, very good. Well, turns out the title of the soft shell crab appetizer was actually rather apt; the tempura on the crab was quite soft and mushy. I hope that's not really what they were referring to. The crab itself was also not that fresh (disgusting really, when you think you're eating the whole thing), the ceviche too was not fresh. In fact, the only thing any of our party of four ate that was good, was our $37 half rack of tamarind-marinated lamb chops. But, you'd have to char that to wreck it. OK, but the restaurant was not the real problem. The biggest problem was the pool. Two of the three days we were there, it was closed until 2 pm. Now, this wouldn't have been such a big deal, except for two things. 1) the roof top pool was literally the driving reason for our taking this trip. My husband doesn't like sand (weird, I know), so we really do care about the pool. We like that it's so comfortable, that there's bar service, that you can see the beach, etc. The other reason that this made us absolutely livid, is that they had a \"pool party\" two of the nights we were there which caused it to be closed (it is also one of the reasons all of the teenagers were there in their terry cloth shorts). Well, they let all of these non-hotel guests into the pool, and as any pool owner knows, after you have a large party, you HAVE to completely clean the pool, shock it with chlorine, etc. Well, these guys had to do this, too. And, apparently their filter broke due to all of the gross stuff in the pool from these pool parties. Now, if the guests at this pool party had been hotel guests, and we were all hungover the next day until 2 pm, and had been the cause of the damage, I think I'd be ok with it. But, as I said, that wasn't the case. They let any one in, and they let any one into their pool. The result was that the main reason we came down was unavailable to us for 2 of the 3 days. This was unacceptable. When we mentioned it to the manager, he just blew us off. Then there was the music. The music was jacked up to dance party levels every day starting at 2 pm. Even if you were the only people on the roof, and you asked them to turn it down b/c you were reading, no dice. You couldn't even talk it was so loud. Now, I don't mind that at some point during the night, I actually like it, and I wouldn't have minded it if it were only some parts of the roof, but it was all parts of the roof, starting at 2 pm. As I mentioned, they weren't particuarly interested in whether any of this appealed to their hotel patrons. Going to this hotel is like watching something beautiful be wantonly destroyed before your eyes. I will say, we still had a good time. The fantastic public spaces that the original architect put in do a lot to keep the place on life support. But we won't be back. After all, there is very little evidence from this trip to suggest that the owners have any ambition for the place save turning it into a 24/7 disco. And if they turned on the music any earlier that would have destroyed the few hours I was able to enjoy on the roof. Sadly, I don't know where else to suggest to stay. I liked El Convento when we went last time, but the rooms are dark, and being in the city with no access to the beach and so little roof top seating makes that a hard choice in my eyes (San Juan is too hot to stay out shopping all day, so don't kid yourself that you don't need a nice hotel with nice places to relax for hours at a time). I'm not a big fan of the clientele or the general vibe of the big places like the El San Juan or the Ritz, either. They are stodgy in a flat-footed sandle and elastic-banded-waist kind of way that is surprising, especially in a Ritz. I think I can only hope that someone buys the Water Club and returns it to it's former glory by limiting the number and type of non-hotel patrons who can use the roof, and realizes that more money can be made as a boutique hotel than as a disco/brothel staging ground. Or two, that someone else will open up another boutique hotel and stick to those standards.", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLooks can be deceiving\u201d", "Author": "redtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR7720783", "Content": "I travel often, and I can say this, if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing, clean hotel in san juan where you can unwind - find another place.

No amount to \"hip\" or \"chic\" makes up for extremely small rooms and bathrooms (smaller than you would expect in New York), shabbiness and just plain dirtiness. The elevator is hot, the floor is filthy, and there is always a maid cart or room service on it running over your toes. The edges of the floor and walls are unfinished in the halls. The room is too small to do much besides lay in the bed (and we asked if they had a larger room and were told no). and the bathroom is too small for 2 people to even stand in. The ceilings are popcorn, the fitted sheets are not fitted and too small and will not cover the bed and there is no mattress pad. You will find yourself sleeping directly on a dirty, stained, sagging, and creaky mattress. The sheets are of a terrible quality anyway, but at least they hopefully wash them. The walls, bedskirt and bedspread are visibly stained in many places. We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast once, it was not good and slow. The man with the beach chairs showed up late or whenever.

So no naps in your room in the afternoon, and be prepared to be woken up all through the night by endless music and drinkers. All in all, I would think a very basic chain hotel would be much preferable at least for being clean, and I can think of no reason to stay here.

From the minute we arrrived, the staff was helpful and attentive. Our room was not quite ready so William, who is awesome, suggested Mi Casita, a small local place right down the street from the hotel. It was lunch time and we sampled MoFongo, which is mashed fried plaintains with garlic and topped with pork. It was delicious. Our short flight from New York was in the past as we enjoyed lunch at this little authentic restaurant. We were immediately taken with the ocean view and the gorgeous beach, which is literally steps from the hotel. Every morning, we would walk out of the hotel and be greeted by the wonderful staff and then the beach staff would set up an umbrella and chairs for us. The ocean itself was wonderful to swim in - clear, warm water, no seaweed and the ocean floor was not rocky at all. We spent alot of time in the water and walking on the beach because it was so beautiful. We had lunch at 2 separate beachfront cafes and I would recommend both. If you walk down the beach toward the el san juan hotel you will see the bar that serves lunch and you can sit at a table on the beach and look out over the ocean. We watched the sun set from there one nite with a pina colada! I would suggest the beachfront lunch places as opposed to lunch in the hotel which is expensive, although the waitress service on the beach is excellent. We ordered drinks only. The other lunch spot is set back from the beach on the small road that leads into the hotel. Its a bar and little cafe that serves salads, sandwiches, drinks, burgers. We had lunch there and each time the service was great and again you feel a great breeze since you are steps from the ocean. Breakfast in the hotel was ok. Pricey and nothing special. I really wanted some fresh fruit and it was just a mediocre fruit plate for $11. The same area where Mi Casita is, there is a bagel shop where you can have breakfast and coffee as well. Yeah, the blue lights and techno music are a little much but I never felt overwhelmed by it. The safe in our room was broken, and within 20 minutes someone had come to replace it. We reserved a partial ocen view as an upgrade and we could not have been happier. It was a great view and the bed is facing the windows which makes it lovely in the morning. You can tell they upgraded the rooms but only with trendier amenities. There was no fridge, but there was an iPod clock radio. The rooms are minimal, but the bed was comfortable. It was like they went to Ikea and decorated the rooms. At 4pm our room wasnt cleaned one day (it appeared they had just fogotten the 9th floor completely) and that was annoying. The cleanliness of the rooms is questionable but I am pickier than most. We were on the 9th floor and never really heard any of the late nite club music and dancing that others did. It rained one evening when we were going out and I thought the hotel should supply umbreallas but they didnt. You can walk to Walgreens but the area around the hotel isnt great. You really just want to be near the ocean because the ocean breeze and view are wonderful. When we stepped away one afternoon, we wanted to go right back to the beach! Restaurants we enjoyed: Raices in OSJ, Mi Casita, and Platos which is down Isla Verde Ave past the el san juan hotel. And Pikayo is inside the Museum. It was superb. We each had a chef's tasting menu and I cannot say enough about it. Our experience there was delicious, romantic and memorable. Beware of the trip into OSJ. While it is a very quaint area with many many bars and restaurants, its an $18 cab ride one way. Cabs are not cheap so try to avoid them. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much. It was relaxing and just what we needed.", "Date": "April 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern NJ", "Title": "\u201cCool, but loud/expensive\u201d", "Author": "kja2007", "ReviewID": "UR7381232", "Content": "My fiance and I recently stayed at the Water Club. The staff, for the most part, was extremely friendly and strove to be helpful (especially the doormen). The space is very chic and cool, which I really liked, even if the blue lights in a lot of spaces can get to you a bit after a while. The place is extremely cool, as I said, if expensive. It has clearly been renovated pretty recently. We didn't have a chance to have dinner there, but we did have breakfast in the main restaurant, and it was excellent (again, though expensive). The cosmo I had at the bar wasn't great (especially for $14 each), but my fiance said that his specialty drink was good and was plenty strong. The beach outside is gorgeous, as is the view from the top floor. If you want to check out the other big hotels around, it's not a bad location from which to do that - the Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, San Juan Casino Hotel, etc. are all within easy walking distance (even in heels). The biggest problems: 1) Noise: We were on the 10th floor. We had a fabulous view as a result, which was great - but we also had to listen to ALL the roofdeck noise. Since they have a club space, bar, pool, etc. up there, this was no small matter. Both mornings, we had to listen to them scraping furniture around starting at 6am - and I do mean LOUDLY! It was a bit better the second morning after we said something to the front desk, but we still heard it, and it still woke us up. And this was after listening to the club music until almost 1am, preventing us from going to sleep! 2) Expense: Even though we got a good AAA rate, it was still quite expensive for the small (though cool) size of the room, and given the noise issues. 3) Not much to do in the immediate vicinity: The hotel only has one main restaurant and a brief sushi bar time upstairs. If you just want to walk to other hotels, you can do that, but there isn't much past that. I would say that this hotel would be good to stay at if you sleep deeply, like cool decor, want to be right on the beach, and will be busy most of the day. It's probably not a bad base if you're seeing friends or family in the area, have business nearby, or will be taking many day trips. But this is definitely not a hotel for someone who wants to hang out there and have enough to do in or near the hotel. I would also say that the younger adult crowd (late 20s-early 40s) would probably be most comfortable here. So... when I return to San Juan, I will definitely eat at the Water Club, but I am not planning on staying there again.

Towels and beach chairs were missing twice when I went to the beach. The waiters in the overpriced restaurant ignored you or treated you like you were bothering them. The rooms simply weren't cleaned properly. For two people in a room, they provided one robe even after I called and complained over and over. The room I was supposed to get was not available when I got there and I was given a lesser room (view of the parking lot) and they didn't adjust the price. I mentioned it twice, they said they would adjust it, then I did auto check-out and saw they still billed me at the more expensive rate. When I brought all of these things to the managements attention, they did nothing at all. They didn't even really accept responsibility. They offered a small discount and then never gave it to me. I fought over the bill with them for weeks afterward. They never gave in. I approached the management company of the hotel - they sent me back to the manager of the Water Club. It was like a bad dream. For a hotel that charges as much as the Ritz, the experience doesn't even come close. Just stay at the Ritz - the service is great, it's right on the beach (rather than crossing the road filled with bums to get to the beach) and has a great pool (unlike the WC's crappy and tiny pool).

We're both in our mid-20's, and found the hotel to be perfect for our age group. The rooftop pool (ok it's 5 feet deep and small) bar and lounge couches were wonderful! The pool has plexiglass so you can look right out onto the beach/ocean. The couches on the roof were great because you could lounge around and even take a nap, which was so relaxing for us, especially after slaving away in New York City day in and day out. The hotel is pretty much right on the beach, you only have to cross the street to be on one of the most beautiful beaches in San Juan. Not only that but you can also rent jet skis (we had a blast) or go parasailing. Ask the hotel and they will direct you where to go. Our room was on the 8th floor and had an ocean front view as well as a french balcony (awesome!). We never heard our neighbors, the maids, or anything else for that matter. Maybe we just had quiet people staying around us, but we were never disturbed. The room itself was very much reminiscent of Ikea, but we liked it. Neither one of us is into the cheesy flower/carribean decor that all of the other hotels offer. The bathroom was indeed small, but it's not like you're spending your entire day in there so that's kind of silly to complain about (Re: another review i read). The rooms were always clean when we requested service and all everyone on staff was very kind to us. The front desk directed us to a few off the beaten path restaurants that we really enjoyed too. Ohhh, and the elevators are really cool! They don't have a ceiling so you can see all of the machinery. Very strange, but nifty.

The room I was assigned (410) was non-smoking as I had asked, but it had obviously been smoked in. They said they would \"refresh\" the room, but it did not make one iota of difference in the smoky smell. I did not spend much time in the room so I did my best to put it out of my mind. The room was comfortable and had everything I needed. The view was not great, as it was on the 4th floor looking out onto a small condo building next door. The bed was nice, and the sheets were good quality (though, to be fair, there was a bit of pilling). I had filled out the \"desires\" information on the hotel's website, and they did -- in fact -- have my requested snacks waiting for me in my room. Nice touch. Good shower with H2O brand products. The bathroom was very clean. The floors in the room did get quite sandy after a day at the beach, but the maid service would keep it in check. There is a roof top bar with lots of places to lounge and look out over the beach. The bartender makes great drinks (most mixed drinks about $10), and the service was good. It was a great place to lounge before dinner. They do serve sushi up there and will allow one to order from their asian fusion restaurant, but we were more for great Puerto Rican food that would not break the bank. The beach is ten steps away from the front door of the hotel, and they have complimentary chairs, umbrellas and towels for hotel guests. They also have a waitress who will come take your drink orders. Since it is not a big hotel, the beach out front is not crowded. The area is safe, and we walked to the Walgreens and the little grocery. We walked 10 minutes down to the big resorts and played a bit in the casinos, but it was good to come back to the great service and smiles in our small, comfortable hotel. One thing I should make clear to everyone -- this hotel is a boutique hotel that caters to adults. I didn't see any children there, and it seemed that everyone was happy about that. It really is a couples and singles kind of hotel, as there is not much for children except the beach. Personally, I was thrilled with the lack of children.

All I can say is big mistake. We changed rooms immediately upon check-in for a beach front rather than beachview room. The first room was on the 10th floor directly under the night club with no closet or balcony. The hotel staff moved us to a beach front room on the 7th floor for $30.00 more/night. The new room had a better view and a balcony you could stand on, but no chairs. The bathroom was old and grimey and there was a small closet. The rooms are also really small and have about 2-3 feet of clearance around the king size bed. Now onto the public areas. There was only one elevator working so there was quite a wait for a 12 story facility and there were black lights everywhere (in the halls, lobby, elevator, bar, even the rooms but you could turn those off). There was really loud techno music playing incessantly. The pool was really small and the lounge chairs were all connected to one another instead of separate lounge chairs. It was basically unuseable. The beach is across the street and very public.The upstairs club was cool, but pricey. The whole surrounding area didn't have many restaurants or bars to choose from unless you went to another hotel. The next morning we awoke at 8 am to sledgehammers and construction noise.

Be patient because this is a long complaint but worth reading. After numerous emails back and forth with the Desires Manager at the Water Club BEFORE I even left the US, I was assured my room would be available upon my late arrival. I even went as far as to email the manager copies of the negative reviews I had read to make sure I didn't have the same problems. She told me via email that she tagged my room for late arrival and that I would be ready to check-in whenever I got to the hotel. WRONG! CHECK-IN: With that being said. I arrived at the hotel around 2:00 a.m., on July 17th as planned...I was tired from the flight and just ready to crawl in bed for a few hours so we could hit the ground running that Monday. Upon checking in, the not so friendly lady behind the desk informed me they had NO rooms available for us and that our room would not be ready until 3:00 p.m., 12 noon at the earliest. You could have knocked me over with a feather. I even printed out the conversations the manager and I had via email and showed it to her and that email meant nothing...she rambled on and on about how the manager didn't know what I meant and therefore gave me the wrong information. She offered to call around to other hotels for us to stay. I was NOT paying for another room or taxi ride when it was there screw up. I was very upset by then...I told her that I would camp out in their lobby with my luggage for all their guests to see until my room was ready 13 hrs. later. She didn't care one bit...even offered to store our luggage in the back while we waited 13hrs. for a room. Me and my best friend rolled all our luggage right in front of the lobby doors and waited. FINALLY, after waiting about 30 min., the financial manager came out and told us that our room had been sold 2hrs. before we got there, he was very nice and apologized. He got on the phone, called the Hampton Inn & Suites hotel and got us a room, which they paid for..he also paid for our taxi ride over to the hotel. He told us to call back around noon to see if our room was ready. The Hampton Inn is a VERY nice hotel and I wish I had booked there..they even had comp. breakfast for us that morning. Of course the room wasn't ready, we only had one night at the Hampton so we checked out around 11 and wait edin their lobby with all our bags. Our tour guide had a cancellation that day and ended up pickin' us up tand driving us around until our rooms were ready. THANKS MIKE! Finally we checked in around 1:30...the hotel had NO WATER but they told us it would be on in a few hours. Thank goodness I didn't need a shower. We had booked an ocean view room at the Water Club and the room was FANTASTIC..I loved the room and the view..very beautiful. After finally getting into our room and enjoying some touring in Old San Juan and finally feeling better about the vacation. we got a freakin' call from the lobby saying we had to bring a credit card down for a room despoit..we gave them a card that didn't have a big spending limit (didn't trust them) and when they couldn't put a $400 hold on the card, we had to take $400 IN cash which would cover their $100 day room deposit, that we new NOTHING about, in case things got missing for the mini bar. The mini bar is a joke..it's NOT locked and not refridgerated so the cleaning crew could take whatever they want and blame it on us. I took pics with my digital camera of the contents of the mini bar and then I tied rubber bands around the handle on the doors so that I could tell if it had been messed with. I even went as far as to putting the 'DO NOT DISTURB' sign on the outside of the hotel door while we were out 'cause I didn't want anyone in the room, not even the cleaning crew. CheckOut: We got up extra early 'cause I had a bad feeling about getting our cash deposit back. We got to the lobby around 7 a.m. to check out...they told us they didn't have enough money to pay our deposit back and were gonna give us a bunch of $1 bills...we gave them (4) $100 bills. We had to wait almost 45 min. for them to get the cash to pay us back and it was all small bills.

No where did anyone mention that the hotel is in the middle of renovations. There certainly were no renovation prices. Amazingly upon moving to a room where we were assured there would be no renovation noise, we faced it again and again. It started very early in the morning too. And then there was the night time noise coming from the roof top bar and lounge, which is a very nice place and the staff there was good. But no one should have to listen to music blasting upstairs at 1 and 2 a.m. We were four floors below and could hear the music over the TV and air conditioner that late at night. Calls downstairs were met with no response. Typical. Also, the restaurant Tangerine was not good and way overpriced. The prices were all in the 20s to 30s for entrees and nothing came with a side dish. Blah taste for 25 dollars. Gimme a break. Then you had to pay 7 - 10 dollars for a side dish that also was dullsville. On the plus side, there are some very nice staff that work the front desk and upstairs lounge. Karla at the front desk is extremely helpful and nice. And Marabella at the upstairs bar is a perfect waitress.

The Lonely Planet guide gave the Water Club its recommendation, so we gave it a try. It exceeded our expectations. The hotel is located in the middle of Isla Verde, within walking distance of a number of good restaurants (I would particularly recommend Fontana di Roma at the Howard Johnson). The only downside is that cab fare each way to old San Juan is $20 each way and it starts to add up if you want to make the trip more than once a day. There is a city bus that runs downtown, and I think that would be the more economical way to make the trip during the day (the bus service ends at 8:30). On the up side, the airport is only a ten minute cab ride away. The Water Club is in an older building and is probably the smallest of the beach-front hotels in Isla Verde. I suspect that in high season, when it is crowded, it has a much different feel. But in the early-June low season, the hotel has a relaxed, intimate feel. As other reviewers have noted, the hotel d\u00c3\u00a9cor goes for a hip \u00e2\u20ac\u0153South Beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel, and of course, there is the ever present waterfall theme, but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go overboard on the theme. The hotel staff upgraded us to an oceanfront room on the third floor. It was a bit small, but clean and well-decorated, with a very comfortable king-sized bed. (No closet though). The hotel has a very nice but small rooftop pool. In addition, there is a bar/nightclub on the rooftop terrace. Drinks are expensive ($7 for a beer and $9 for a mixed drink), but the view is amazing. The restaurant in the lobby (Tangerine) is also very pricey (and they charge a lot for just the breakfast bar). There is music playing in the lobby, elevator, and halls, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too loud and they play a good variety of styles. I was there the weekend that the water went out, and it was a bit of a drag. But it is hard to complain since most of San Juan was without water. In additon, the Water Club had their reserve water tank filled the next day, so we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t without water for long. By itself, I would rate the hotel above average, but its location and service raise it to excellent. The Water Club sits at the end of Calle Tartak, right next to Isla Verde beach. Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a public beach, but it was never crowded when we were there. Most of the waves break further out, so the water is very calm. The Water Club has a free towel, lounger and umbrella service, as also offers bar service on the beach. The beach staff is great. On Saturday, I left my sunglasses out by the lounger. The staff found them and brought them in to the hotel even before I reached the elevator. Likewise, the hotel staff really goes the extra mile to help you.

Finally, I was assured that the proper authentication had taken place and we went to our room. I should add that I modified the bill, crossed out the erroneous charges, initialed the changes and then signed the documentation. Needless to say, when we checked out, there were more erroneous charges including, ironically enough, the $40 breakfast that was complimentary for our inconvenience.

We walked into the room and were shocked at the poor use of space and the strangely appointed furniture. The bed is on an angle in the middle of the room! There was no closet, only a little hanging rod in the mini bar cabinet that was so short, I couldn't hang any of my dresses or pants in there. The bathroom was small and had one of those half shower doors that does not keep the water inside. But we did have a great view of the ocean so we tried to ignore these issues. Then came night time. We were on the 9th floor and the bar/club is on the roof which is the 11th floor. Well, the music might as well have been right in our room. Until 2 in the morning. It was just miserable. Our hosts had provided us with earplugs in our gift bags and we thought it was just a joke but we really needed them. Even with the plugs in, it was incredibly loud.

We also decided to have breakfast there one morning and couldn't believe the prices. It was ridiculous for the amount and quality of food that was served.

If a hotel were to undergo a refurb by MTV's \"Pimp My Ride\", this is what it would look like. Basically they have taken a very average 3 star hotel (sort of thing you find in any main Spanish / Greek resort), and pimped it to maximum effect. The result is a hotel that on first impression looks both luxurious and incredibly chic. The design and imagination that has gone into the hotel and its aquatic theming is striking, with a waterfall on every corridor, illuminated by blue neon lit Mediterranean-style drapes and scented vanilla candles. The blue glow continues into the very large bedrooms, with good views of the beach through white venetian blinds. The bathrooms are a little less inspiring however. With a name like The Water Club, you would think the bathroom and shower would be the talking point of your stay, but unfortunately they are decidedly ropey, with dodgy tiling and decoration, and a shower that looks and operates like it was reclaimed from a 1970's Russian guest house. Rooms certainly AREN'T dirty as some reviewers on TripAdvisor have commented. Another sore point for me was the guest parking which is valet only and an uncomfortable $20 a day. Few rooms have balconies, and no fridge in the room, meaning chilled drinks have to be purchased from the bar for an extortionate $18 for a beer and one G&T ! I suggest buying some from the supermarket and keeping them chilled in an ice filled sink...

For that reason many people who haven't actually stayed here might have a misleading or better impression of the hotel than it actually deserves. The roof-top pool, although small and dated looking, is saved by the adjoining bar and double bed loungers. This place really comes alive at night and turns into one of the hottest venues in San Juan with a young, moneyed crowd listening to resident DJ's play house. Most nights this bar hosts parties (Moet champagne promotion party when we were there), and the 2nd floor occasionally has local bazaars. Like most trendy businesses in San Juan, The Water Club have nailed the soundtrack, and EVERYWHERE you go in this hotel, hidden speakers pipe either whooshing wave sounds, Cafe del Mar chill out beats, or in the evenings, soft beach house. (You can buy their own cd's from reception). Free towels and loungers are available on the beach adjacent to the hotel, and all the staff are professional, helpful and generally affable. Close to airport (10mins & $12 in a cab), but the trip into Old San Juan, home to the best restaurants and clubs that will make you feel you are REALLY in Puerto Rico is a little longer. Either take the A5 bus on the main road ($0.75 coins only), or take a cab for about $25 plus tip. Buses take about 30mins depending on traffic, but finish at about 8.30pm, so a round trip in two cabs can add $$$ to your night out. Overall, The Water Club have realised they can't compete with the large chain hotels that dominate the San Juan area. Because of this, they are offering a completely unique style of accommodation and experience. It works well, but not at the price you will pay. For us almost \u00c2\u00a3200 a night - simply too much for the quality of room we received.", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing....\u201d", "Author": "dcharles", "ReviewID": "UR4932314", "Content": "Unfortunately the hotel was a disappointment.

We got to the hotel early and when we walked in it seemed OK. I was instantly struck by the loud music playing in the lobby and as it turns out they have non stop music everywhere at all times. This was annoying to the point of exhaustion. Our room was not ready which was fine because check in was not until 3:00 but when the room was not ready until 4:00 I started to have my doubts about this place. But this was certainly not enough to prepare me for the rest of my stay. When we checked in and they told me that we were on the second floor in room 208 I immediately asked if we could be on a higher floor. The hotel was booked solid so we were not able to switch. Room 208 was simply a disaster. For example; the trash cans were almost too dirty for my trash, there was a hole in the bathroom wall, the blinds in the bathroom and bedroom were broken and hanging to one side, there were no closets (only a small area about 4x3 not big enough to hang pants), when you flushed the toilet it sounded like the pipes were going to fall out of the ceiling, the toilet paper holder was held in place by a piece of broken plastic fork. ( I discovered this while sitting on the toilet...and when I pulled the piece of plastic fork out the whole thing fell in pieces on to the floor!), on Saturday they had not cleaned our room by 3:30 and when I called they told me they had not forgotten about us but were still not there by 4:00. When the cleaning lady came it took her 45 minutes to clean it. Another nice surprise was the kitchen staff putting out the recycling every morning at 7:30. Also, of note is the fact the the second floor is often rented out for parties which was the case the day we checked in. The music was so loud that it felt like the party was in our room but at that point I was not in the partying mood.

In short, the WC turned out to be a delightful spot that we very much enjoyed. In light of the many criticisms heaped on the WC, it's worth initially mentioning that new on-site management just came on board and is immediately addressing some of the deficiencies prior reviews have listed. I spoke with the new manager and I am confident that the shortcomings of the property will be corrected. In fact, we witnessed several improvements just during the week we were there. He seems quite competent and experienced, which bodes well for future visitors. I'll hit some items: Design/Decor - if you like the cool, minimalist modern design style, you'll appreciate the property look. With little space to work with, the lobby, restaurant, rooftop bar, rooms, and common spaces have a hip, well conceived style and design. The design provides a unique and enjoyable ambiance to the property. You can immediately assess is you like the style by checking out the hotel's website. Prior postings have mentioned the poor upkeep on the property, along with the Best Western-like bathrooms. Our bathroom was remodeled. Its not a Four Seasons bathroom, but nicely styled in accord with the hotel and very functional. I assume that all the bathrooms are in the process of being updated. The halls and some vacant rooms were also getting fresh paint while we were there. With that said, the place does need some sprucing up - mainly minor things like tears in the duvet, worn floor spots, broken treadmills, etc. These are very correctable problems that I assume the new management is addressing and needs to do so. Rooms - The rooms are small, but comfortable and well appointed with sat. TV, comfy bed, small desk, safe, cool blue mood lighting and quality bathroom amenities. View of the beach/ocean were excellent and joy to wake up to. Again, with some referbrishing, the accomodations are quite nice. A mini fridge would be nice. Restaurants/Bars - Tangerine serves breakfast and dinner. Both well done, especially dinner. My recommendations are the salmon benedict for breakfast and the snapper for dinner, which was sensational. Breakfast is expensive and priced like a big city hotel. Dinner was also expensive, but worth at least one visit. The rooftop bar serves a decent, but limited lunch menu. Beach - A definite high point is the beach in front of the hotel. It is the nicest stretch of an otherwise very nice beach. Powdery sand, warm, blue/green caribbean water, nice breeze - can't ask for much more. One note of caution - while the whole beach is combed every single morning, it is public and you do find the occasional piece of glass in the sand. Keep your eyes peeled and wear sandles if you are walking off the shoreline. It isn't Turks/Caicos or Anguilla, but its quite fine a joy spend the day on. There are hotel owned chairs and towel service available at no cost. There is food/drink service as well. It is also uncongested, which is not the case in front of the other big botels on the beach (El San Juan and Intercontinental). The roof top pool is small and unheated - go to the beach! Service - The service, top to bottom, was consistently superb. It is on par with what you'd expect at a Four Seasons or Ritz. We were often greeted by name, our requests were promptly addressed, and we were upgraded without cost or request. I have not had better service anywhere, period. General Recommendations: Do not stay on the top floor (10). The night club goes late into the night and unless you like be lulled to sleep with pulsing techno music, you will not be happy. They also rearrange the furniture to convert the roof top lounge back into its daytime configuration - which is noisy. I would also avoid rooms next to the elevators - noisy. We stayed on 9th floor, ocean front - perfect. I'd recommend floors 6-9 for optimal view and less noise. If you're a breakfast eater, go to the Golden Bagel in the strip mall across the main street. Its nothing special, but decent food/coffee without spending $40. If you are a sushi eater - go to Shogun, which is a five minute cab ride. Excellent. (We went twice.) I'd also recommend the beachfront restaurant in front of the neighboring InterCont. for its tasty pizzas and beer right off the beach. One last thing - we did an excurion on the East Wind catamaran. It goes to Icacos or Culebra. Great boat, well run - very fun. The hotel desk will arrange it for you. If you are looking for a non-resort, unique spot to stay on a great stretch of beach - you will not be dissapointed witht the WC. Feel free to email with any questions.

It was the first time either one of us had been to Puerto Rico, and we used Tripadvisor reviews to help us pick a hotel. The Water Club had mixed reviews, and now I know why. First, let me say that the place is really nice... Very cool and trendy. Blue lights bathe the hallways and guest rooms, and the cool pebble photo tiles, waterfall elevator, and soothing piped in sounds made for a really unique atmosphere. Our room was impressive at first, but then disappointing. We were right next to the elevator shaft so all day and all night, we heard loud sounds from it-- it sounded like somebody dragging dumpsters across the floor. It was hard to sleep. We requested to switch rooms the next day, but ended up in the same situation on a higher floor. I think if we had a room closer to the end of the hall, we would have been much happier. We had a room on the 7th floor, and on the weekend, we could hear the music from the club loud and clear. We didn't mind that noise, but I could see how it could bother older guests. The rooms looked like they started the renovations then stopped once they got to the bathrooms. The bathrooms looked like they were leftover from a previous incarnation of the hotel. I didn't see any of the really high-priced rooms, but they're probably gorgeous. The rooftop lounge was great. Really nice place to sip a martini and listen to music. You can look out at the city and the sea and enjoy the breeze. Not many people were dancing when we went though. The location of the hotel was perfect. We were right across the street from the beach, which was beautiful. Very clean with warm water. The hotel is near to the main strip of Isla Verde. There were a lot of people out over the weekend. Overall, we really enjoyed Puerto Rico. We took the 25-cent bus over to Old San Juan a few days for shopping and sightseeing. It was nice experience.

The Hotel is beautifully appointed with its whitewashed walls, wooden floors, waterfall elevators, sensual bars and lounges that are designed for mingling or bringing couples closer - much closer. The chefs and bartenders are creative if not a bit eccentric in their preparation and presentation of foods and drinks, always with just the right touches of sophistication and allure. The Water Club provides a relaxing atmosphere for those who wish to stretch their legs and breathe in the warm salty air, as well as the choice of various upbeat, fun, sexy venues, especially the rooftop bar/restaurant where we enjoyed great food (wonderful sushi) and deliciously wicked drinks amidts a funky and diverse crowd who knows how to have fun to great music, especially on the week-ends, when the place is hopping!

From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, we received excellent services starting from the bellmen, the reception, parking attendants, food and beverage personnel, the cleaning staff, and the General Manager. The multi-lingual staff ensures that each guests leaves happy, and if there is anything amiss or not to the client's liking, they immediately react to satify every (reasonable) desire. As such, most importantly, what impressed us most was the attentiveness of the Hotel's personnel, including the Manager of Food and Bevarages and its General Manager post an injury suffered by the writer. The Hotel called in a Doctor to do a thorough examination and followed up to ensure that further care was not needed. This was most appreciated and allowed us to enjoy our vacation notwithstanding the accident and, in addition to already really loving the Water Club for all its amenities and excellent services, we developed a deep respect for its management and the way they envelop their clientele with humanity and caring.

Good feature- The Water Club is located on a great beach and the the hotel supplied an umbrella, towels, and lounge chairs. We did not have to pay for this and on Thursdays thru Sundays a waitress comes around to take your orders. We had cocktails and lunch without even leaving the beach (can get pricey...but convenient). The room looked like it did in the pictures..though smaller than I had thought. Still fine for two people and comfortable. Keep in mind it is a boutique hotel. I thought the atmosphere was really cool...def a must to hang out at Wet and Tangerine. The view from the top is amazing. The pool is small but everyone goes to the beach so we lucked out on two days being the only ones up there. I have to say the customer service was exceptional...maybe they were getting alot of negative feedback..but the beach staff, store staff, front desk, housekeeping etc.. all greeted us each time they saw us and answered all questions. Some glitches- The first morning we had no hot water..called the front desk and within minutes someone was up to fix it. We stayed on the fifth floor...and with the air conditioning we really could not hear what went on in the other guests rooms. Exception...the weekend gets crowded I think many people come from Friday to Sunday... we had very loud neighbors...I think above us? But all in all in was a positive experience.. it is a pricey hotel and I did stop in some other hotels furthur down the beach and was wowed. However, Water Club definetly has its own unique style. I recommend this hotel for twenty and thirty somethings....no families... and older people who are well traveled and have stayed in variety of accommodations.

I had read about this, and overlooked this because I had verified my reservation and view multiple times. I had a fax confirmation with me, so they gave us a suite at no additional cost because they did not have a full ocean view available. This was their second chance.

Although there was so much dirt and sand covering the road, I can see why the hotel believes it is \"on\" the beach. While checking in my wife noticed that we were assigned to a smoking room. Innocent mistake I thought, but when I brought it to the clerk's attention, I was told that she was only trying to get us into a room as soon as possible. (Thanks for the effort, but we prefer not to spend our week in \"paradise\" sleeping in an ashtray). Upon entering the elevator we were a bit surprised to see that the hotels \"waterfall\" was little more than water trickling down a pain of glass. Look up and you'll notice that the top of the elevators are removed allowing you to view the entire shaft. This allows the elevators to double as a sound transfer system. During the evening you will be able to hear everything that is happening in the hotel from your bedroom. It was so loud we couldn't sleep our entire first night. In addition to the noise, the room was small, the bathroom dirty, and there was no where to put your clothes, no dressers, no closets. Our room did face the ocean but the view was obscured by the small, dirt encrusted windows. Apparently some one forgot to install our floor to ceiling windows. After a midnight battle with management we were given a suite on a higher floor. The suite was nice, with larger windows, but of course it was a smoking room. We made every attempt to leave after the second day however, we could not get a reservation elsewhere. We decided to make the best of it. We would stay off the beach to avoid having our rented chairs and towels stolen a second time. (I also did not have a nice bullet proof vest like all the cops were wearing, while patroling the sands.) We decided to take advantage of the roof top bar/lounge/pool area, which was actually very nice. Unfortunately after one day of frolicking, the hotel closed the pool for three days and the bar for a day and a half. If your looking for nice accomodations, service, safety, and some acknowledgement that you are a guest in a hotel, go to the Ritz down the block, it was only $20 more a night.", "Date": "July 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2263934", "Content": "This was the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in.

The bathroom was full of mildew. In sum, it is just not a nice place. The rooftop bar attracts a crowd in the evenings and this lead to drunks roaming the halls making noise all night.

And if I return to San Juan, I will most likely stop by the bars here, as they were fun and attractive. However, we seriously contemplated moving hotels. The Water Club is a wonderful example of how great marketing (hip places, trendy decor, celebs) of a poor product (an awful, outdated hotel that was re-vamped without much concern to quality or substance) can make a lot of money. We paid for an ocean view room and my favorite part was being able to see the ocean while laying in bed. I didn't enjoy hearing the entire conversations of the neighbors. (The adjoining doors were shut, but provided no soundproofing whatsoever). While the fake wood floors in the rooms and tile floors in the hallway were attractive, they simply amplified all the noise. We weren't expecting it to be silent. We are a mid-20s couple who enjoy going out. However, we were woken up at 3 or 4 am on several occasions. (Liquid (the downstairs bar) letting out, etc.) One night, the fire alarms in the building went off at about 3:30 am. We all ran down the stairs and met outside. The hotel never announced what was going on or when it was safe to go back to our rooms. Totally unprofessional. As far as I could tell, the bathrooms had not been renovated, apart from new light fixtures, since the hotel was built. Not only were they tiny (two people could NOT be in the bathroom at the same time, unless one was physically in the tub/shower). The bathroom was no nicer/different than what you would expect at a Days Inn. The \"pool\" on the top of the building is approximately 6 feet x 10 feet. Not exactly made for swimming. However, there are nice lounge beds/sofas on the roof. If you go, take money. We couldn't believe that on a rainy day, when asked to borrow a game (from a list they had), we were charged $16 for UNO. We visited many of the neighboring hotels/casinos and I will not return to the Water Club. It isn't worth the price, simply to seem cool and hip in a crappy hotel.", "Date": "May 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cChi-Chi without substance\u201d", "Author": "DaBeatman", "ReviewID": "UR1756961", "Content": "I recently stayed at The Water Club while on a business trip at the beginning of March. To The Water Club will appeal to the same people who go to chi-chi lounges in SoHo (NYC) to see and be seen rather than get a nice meal and drinks at a decent price. A warning to business travelers: do NOT stay here. The Water Club's rooms are small without a large desk and have no room to work; there is no business center, either. Not to say that The Water Club ever claims to be that kind of hotel; just be forewarned. It is a place full of art deco design, where stunningly beautiful young women work on staff, but are not very efficient. Most of the young women working there are gorgeous, and they know it, too. You can cut the attitude and pretense with a butter knife. They don't smile or say hello to you when you walk past them or through the lobby. They are more comfortable walking down the runway catwalk. If you're looking to be attended to as a hotel guest, do not stay at The Water Club. You'll have to ask for towels or other amenities several times and will finally give up. A few things to note: (1) do NOT eat in the rip-off lounge on the lobby level. Breakfast for one can come out to $30 for a lousy omlette and some fresh fruit!; (2) check your folio VERY carefully before checking out. I was billed for valet parking every day...and I didn't even have a car!!; (3) expect to hear the \"drip, drip, drip\" recording of water in the very dimly lit hallways...it can get annoying after awhile, not to mention the fact that the three votive candles that were supposed to illuminate the hallway did not do the job. Those who will enjoy The Water Club are young couples looking for a break from the hustle-bustle of home and want to masquerade as part of the \"in crowd\" of beautiful people. The Water Club is a bit dirty in places, too. When I checked into my room there were long, black hairs on the bathrobe and bedsheets. There were also hairs and some \"scumb\" in the shower, too. The sheets and pillowcases on the bed were all wrinkled, indicating that the sheets had not been changed when the last people in my room had checked out. To be sure of this, I drew an \"X\" on an inconspicuous spot of the bedsheet and then asked the front desk to make sure my sheets were changed. When I returned to the room later that day, I noticed the \"X\" was still on the sheets. However, the chamber maid swore she had changed the sheets but said she'd do it again if I wanted her to. The gym downstairs is a dark room with The Water Club's trademark blue neon lights...absolutely no other lighting other than that, which gets maddening by the time you reach your third mile on the treadmill. One good thing about The Water Club is that the beach area in front of it is very nice. But, would I stay there again?

Now that I've been there, I think there are a lot of misconceptions out there. I'll try to address them....First, this is a boutique hotel, not a resort. That means it is a fairly standard hotel, but with lots of stylish twists. Water Club is over-the-top in it's stylish themes, but my main message is NOT to expect a resort. Aside from the IKEA look, the rooms are pretty standard hotel fare - average in size, with average amenities. You are paying for the style and - more importantly - the proximity to the beach....A lot of people complain that their reservations were messed up, but mine were right on. I would suggest calling the hotel itslef (not going through an agent). I got a better rate calling them myself, and they were quite friendly through and through. Also, know that an Ocean View room will not be on the Ocean. If you want to open your window directly in front of the beach, pay the extra $$$ and get the Ocean Front. I found the hotel staff to be delightful, but I am an easygoing person. I notice a lot of people being snotty with the hotel employees, and I don't care how much you are paying, it doesn't make it right to be impolite. That's not to say that everyone who complained in their reviews didn't have a legitimate beef, but I would suggest that travellers bear in mind that they are dealing with another human being when they have a complaint. A content employee will be a lot more inclined to help than one who's been scolded....All in all, the Water Club is a bit pricey, but it costs WAY more to stay at the resorts in the same area of San Juan....Some tourist tips: Don't expect yummy eating, we were wholly disappointed with every meal in San Juan (although my wife like the sushi in the Water Club's rooftop bar).

The restaurant, Tangerine, was very good, although the room service food and lunch at the bar were not. Yes, most things are overpriced, but you're paying for the view/location.
