{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great location for the price Stayed in Le Cascine (or Cosmo D'Medici) as some of the hotel pamphlets call it.This was a great location - right round the corner from the train station, round the corner from CAF Tours departure (who do great Chianti valley wine tours) and about 10 min walk from the Duomo. Really you couldnt pick a better location to stay in.The staff are also very friendly - they recommended restaurants which turned out to be lovely and reasonably priced.On the negative.. the room was tiny.. but tastefully furnished.breakfast was distinctly average - your usual croissant, coffee, pre-packaged hard toast. Nothing that would make you want to rush down to breakfast. Still for the price it was all good.Only one major complaint!! - we stayed on the 2nd floor... and there is no lift from the 1st to 2nd floor (well none that we could find anyway) and we had to lift the bags up and down those wooden stairs - and boy were they heavy.. it was an ordeal..not for people who've bought too many shoes in Florence !", "Date": "May 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR158023490", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "veegal"}, {"Content": "Decent This hotel was good and the staff was friendly. One of the front clerks was veryyyy loud. The front desk is right by the dining area where you have breakfast. So first thing in the morning a loud lady on the phone is the last thing you want to overhear. The room was fine and seemed as though the bathroom was an aftermath thought once the room was built. It's on a higher level than the bedroom floor and so small that literally from the toilet was a step away from the shower and the sink landed in between, you just had to see the humor in it. Must say that visiting from North America we are used to a certain standard of hotels. One needs to put that thinking aside when staying at hotels in Italy even though you are paying through the nose.", "Date": "May 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR811217390", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "thisissar"}, {"Content": "Staff were very friendly and helpful We stayed in this hotel 5 nights out of 8 nights in Florence. This was included in a package deal. Centrally located and walking distance to all the sites but very quiet. Rooms were very clean but quite small, with the exception of a few rooms reserved for families. Breakfast was inferior to our other hotel a block away - Hotel Porto Faenza, which I also reviewed. I really like the fact that a computer with internet access, free of charge, was provided for hotel guest.", "Date": "Mar 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR780189874", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "am2338"}, {"Content": "Recommended Don't be put off by the rather dreary entrance from the street. The hotel is on the first floor. The rooms are a little small but clean and agreeable. The staff are friendly and helpful. The area around the train station has something of a reputation for being seedy but we encountered no problems of any kind, day or night. The area between the station and the river, however might be a bit dodgy at night. The hotel is very convenient, and has a few good restaurants very close, if you are too tired to walk in the evening after a day standing in galleries !", "Date": "May 21, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR856052954", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Small but convenient This hotel is located within walking distance of the train station and most of the sights in Florence.
