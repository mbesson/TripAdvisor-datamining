This was our second visit to this hotel and as we were very pleased the first time round, decided to repeat and would obviously go back again for the comfort value and situation of same. The hotel is located near the Chueca area of the Gran Via and there are tube stations some 2 mins walk so you can be in any part of Madrid within minutes. The hotel has a nice reception area with a bar which looks out onto the Gran Via so is nice to sit and have a drink and people watch....They also serve food there as well. The staff both in the reception and elsewhere in the hotel are all very nice and friendly and one feels at home. The rooms are very comfortable and again comfy bed, pillows and very clean. Everything is left very well and spotless clean each day by the cleaning ladies. A good nights sleep is ensured once you ask for a room that does not overlook the Gran Via !!! our request on both occasions for a quiet room was granted. We booked with room only at the hotel although we did have a drink in the bar on various occasions (as we have styed in other H10 hotels in various places, we are always invited to a free cocktail in the bar and here was no exception). This is a nice thought on the part of Management and well received. They also supply wonderful peanuts and almonds with the drinks which are of excellent quality. All in all this hotel is very good value, situation excellent and great for coming and going each day. There are two computers in the lobby of the hotel with internet connection. The Gran Via of course is a great shopping area and that of Fuencarral and Hortaleza which are a stones throw from the hotel. There is a great Tapas Bar just 2 mins walk from the hotel and right on the Gran Via called \"El Mercado de la Reina\" and would highly recommend this place as well as it serves tapas, meals and also good Gins!!!! so if you don't feel like going too far at night, it is the perfect place. We will certainly go back to this hotel again for both price and location and nice relaxing atmosphere. If I were to have a complaint about this hotel, the only thing would be for slightly better lighting around the mirror in the bathroom for us woman for putting on our make -up !!!!! but that is all,otherwise everything perfect and highly recommended.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value at a good location\u201d", "Author": "John_Corne", "ReviewID": "UR137074997", "Content": "As others have said, a good value hotel in the right place to visit.

I had a double bed which was essentially two beds put together. It could be a challenge sleeping in the middle as you can fall between the beds. The mattresses used to be hard, but this is no longer a problem. One big problem the weekend I was there was the air conditioner either worked poorly or did not work at all. If this is a chronic problem, I could not stay at the hotel again as it is really hot in Madrid during the summer and you really do need relief when you're in your room. Breakfast: Breakfast continues to fantastic. I recommend to anyone who stays at the H10 to purchase the breakfast options. There are tons of difference choices that are all very tasty.

The location cannot be beat. The hotel is located on Gran Via which is a busy street in the center of Madrid and ,therefore, close to every site you would want to see in Madrid. I walk everywhere so for me it was a short walk to the Prado Museum and Palacio Real. There is an abundance of shopping and restaurants on the pedestrian streets that run from the nearby Plaza del Callao to the Plaza Puerta del Sol. To the north is another pedestrian area - Chueca. The hotel staff was very friendly. I wish that I had asked the name of one woman at the front desk who worked almost every day of my 6 day stay because she went out of her way to help me plan a side trip to Segovia as well as give me directions to a local supermarket that I never would have found without her help. The hotel breakfast was great every morning and well worth 10 Euros, especially since most hotels in Europe would charge at least twice that amount for an in house breakfast. The room was great. Even though it was an interior room with no view, the large frosted windows gave the room a lot of light without having to look into a neighbors room. The room had two items I always look for in a hotel if I am going to be there for a week - a refrigerator and a safe. I will definitely return to Madrid and I will stay at this hotel when I return.

We emailed the week before requesting a room on a high floor overlooking the Gran Via and advised them that it was our anniversary. ROOM 602 - We had read the views and were a little nervous when entering our room but were very surprised to discover that we had a suite! It was gorgeous, a lounge area with tv, bedroom with beautiful high ceilings, tv and a huge bed which had fresh scattered petals, french doors onto a balcony and french doors onto a patio area. Large bathroom area with double sinks leading onto a small bathroom with toilet, sink, bath/shower and bidet. Lots of toiletries. There were more french doors from the hallway area along with a unit with a music centre, safe and mini bar. All that was missing was coffee/tea making facilities. Overall there were 9 large windows/doors. There were welcome chocolates, bath robes and slippers. Early evening freshly prepared fruit was bought to our room. It was all so perfect. The roof terrace was amazing with spectacular views of the Gran Via. NOISE - Didn't ever hear anything from the other rooms - day or night. The traffic noise from the Grand Via is aloud when you have the doors open or on the terrace but sound proofing is pretty good when closed. You do notice sirens from emergency vehicles so I would say if you are a light sleeper, take some ear plugs. RECEPTION - very friendly and welcoming and gave us codes for wifi access for the 3 days. Also explained everything we needed to know as we had asked a few questions. Very helpful. When we checked out, we left our cases at the hotel for the day. BREAKFAST - Good choice and very enjoyable. There were 3 different coffee machines although we struggled to get a full cup of the coffee we thought we had chosen but chose not to say anything. A good choice of continental food along with fried and scrambled egg, choice of sausages and bacon. Choice of juices, not freshly squeezed but refreshing. Lots of freshly prepared fruit. Nice dining area and friendly staff. LOCATION - Fantastic. A 2 minute walk away from the Gran Via metro and a short walk to the Puerto del Sol square as well as many other famous areas. Some great restaurants within walking distance as well as roof top bar terraces. We ate the first night at 9.30pm and it was very quiet, so set off at 10.30pm the next night. It is apparently very normal to eat late. TRANSPORT - We used the metro from the airport which was very easy to use and also used it to get to the zoo. Otherwise the open top buses are great for getting around the city, plenty of them and they are very frequent. MADRID TOURIST CARD - This wasn't as cost effective as we'd hoped. We thought it included the zoo but it didn't. It said you get priority access to places but it didn't and also didn't get given maps and information which other people got who'd purchased normal tickets. Unless you are going to use it for everything listed, I'd give it a miss.

These are the negatives. To balance them: the room was kept spotlessly clean throughout or visit (4 nights) and it had a shower/bath; a room with a view would have had a window onto the busiest street in Madrid and my \"internal\" room suffered no traffic noise. The breakfast was of the typical buffet type that has become the norm throughout Europe. The price was good for a city centre location and that location is perfect.

The room was quite small, in fact the first time we checked in, we were given a room with a single bed for 2 person and we both male. Asked for a room change and eventhough the front office said that they were full at first but then they managed to get us a room with a double bed which I really appreciated and the room is quite spacious in my opinion. The room was very normal if not a bit too dark, but clean. Bathroom was normal and standard, shower in the bathtub, but they didn't have any anti-slip mat so it could be quite slippery in the bathtub. Aside from that, there's no curtain for the shower so the floor could be quite wet depending on how you bathe. The breakfast was enough for me, selection of bread, bacon, eggs, cakes, yoghurt, fruits, juice, which is not too extensive but will be quite enough if you want to have a heavy breakfast to start the day. I didn't experience the sound of the street at night, so I couldn't comment on that account. But the front office staff was quite helpful with every request I made, though I feel they could be more friendly.

Obviously, the location is stellar. Getting here from the airport requires changing trains twice. As such, in terms of interior, the hotel has everything you would expect (with free internet access in the lobby and wifi throughout). And yet, three points we encountered are of a nature not to be able to recommend this hotel without the following reservations: 1. A week in advance, we had written to ask for a quiet room with a double bed, i.e. not two singles. This email was replied within 24 hours indicating that they would attempt to do this. Upon arrival (Friday night around 10pm) the receptionist - not in the slightest aware of this request - informed us there were no rooms available with a double bed and that we should have come earlier. Our complaint that this was the very reason why we had written in advance was met by a rather indifferent attitude. They suggested we could \"ourselves\" try to put the two beds for one person together...In the end, a staff member of theirs came to do it. The next day, we were moved to a room which did have the bed type requested. While in the end they did seek a solution, it was clear we were considered a nuisance for pushing this point. 2. The most significant drawback is the breakfast room. It is manifestly too small to handle the amount of guests. Result: you have to queue both to get a table and to get your food (at some point it was 5 minutes to fill up on coffee...). As such, no complaints about the breakfast buffet which has the choice one could expect of a 4 star. Staff was a bit slow though when it comes to refilling items, even after having been pointed out that item X was missing. 3. Noise: while we had been given (as requested) a room facing the interior of the building, noise isolation of the rooms is pretty poor. So while in your bed, you do hear people passing through the corridor... Overall: this is definitely a 3 star, but it lacks some of the elements to make it a solid 4 star.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a city break in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "NikkiClaire", "ReviewID": "UR119636718", "Content": "Ideally located on the Gran Via - close to the metro (only \u20ac2.50 to get from the airport to the hotel) and in walking distance of all the great sites!

Location is excellent, right on Gran Via and opposite metro. Very clean, well serviced, and staff were mixed - some friendly, others not. Also very good value - we got a mid week room for 90 euros, thats only a few more euros than some of the 3 star hostals so exceptionally good value. Internet was fine too (contary to some reviewers). Only negative/advice (similar to other reviews) is to be careful which rooms you are allocated/choose. If you book a standard double then the rooms are adequate size (not tiny, not massive) but there are two types. The first (and the one we were first allocated was a interior room overlooking a covered small courtyard). It had windows, but essentially onto an interior area. The room was very hot (it was only 8 degrees outside!) and had no air at all and they'd set all aircon to heat only due to it being winter. So if you are one of those people who hates air, closes every window, and puts the heating on max then this is the room for you. Prob OK if we were there 1 or 2 nights but we were staying 5. Benefit of the room is it was quiet. However, it was too stuffy for us so we asked to move. They were full that night (Madrid fashion week) and we never asked until later in the day so they kindly moved us the following day to a room overlooking Gran Via (the main road). It was airy and much more comfortable (although same size, etc) but just what we wanted - we just wanted fresh air. Note because they are on the main road these rooms will be noisier. So my advice is if you book a normal double then make sure its an exterior room on check in, or alternatively book a superior which are slightly larger. However, the standard was great for us, once we were on the exterior. Breakfast is nice enough - if included, 10 euros pp if not.

After reading the reviews I decided to book the superior room and I must admit I did the right choice. It is 25 Euro difference approximately per night with respect to the standard double, but the difference is definitely worth the money. The room was very large and had everything we needed: heath control, big flat screen TV, fridge, towels and bathroobes, internet connection etc. It was located on the first floor, above the lobby (room 202) with a bacony overlooking the Gran Via. The streets is very busy and noisy at all times of the day. You can hear police and ambulance sirens constantly, but when you have your windows closed, the noise is not much of a concern. The staff is friendy once they get to know you and you establish a good relationship with them. The servers do not work for the tip unlike in North America and they will not go out of their way to provide you with the best service ever, but if you are approachable and friendy they will make sure they make your stay very pleasant. The breakfast was great, excellent chouice of items for all tastes (5 different types of cheeses, hams, salami, sausages, beacon, eggs, mini sandwiches, pastries, and many many more). All the premises were very clean and new. The location is excellent. We never took the subway, as Madrid is not extremely spread around. You can walk everywhere and be in 20 minutes at Prado, Retiro park or Royal Palace or even Plaza Mayor and Mercato San Miguel. The area around the hotel is very popular for its restaurants and bars and it is always very busy and yet safe. You might see prostitutes on Calle de la Montera, which connects the hotel to Plaza del Sol, but at least in winter times you might not even know that they are actual prostitutes. These girls are all dressed normally and look like any other girl on the street. Calle de la Montera is very popular for shoe and handbag shopping but we found the quiality of shoes and bags to be very poor in general. Spain has lots of god quality leather, but Italy makes much better shoes. Restaurant prices are quite affordable if you eat where all locals eat. Many places have fixed menues for 10 euros where you can have 3 course meal, coffe/tea and 1 alcoholic drink (or more). Some places even offer unlimited tapas for 4 euros, but they tend to me overcrowded. Keep in mind Spanish people dine late so many restaurants migh not be open for dinner before 8:00 or 8:30 pm.

We picked the H10 Villa de la Reina because of the price and good reviews on TripAdvisor. I have traveled a lot all over the world and this hotel was outstanding.

We arrived at the hotel around 10am and were told the room wouldn't be ready for a few hours. Upon finding out that we were on the 1st floor (one above street level), we asked if we could have a room facing the Gran Via. The staff was initially reluctant because of the street noise (the road is always busy, think New York City). We told them the noise wouldn't bother us and so they reassigned our room. The windows kept out most noise and it never woke us up. We toured the city for a few hours and as promised, the room was ready. The room was spacious and very clean. The housekeeper kept the room clean for our five days. The bathroom amenities were very nice (shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, tooth brush, comb, etc). The shower pressure was up to US standards and the hot water was always available on demand. The hotel lounge was a nice touch each evening. Prices very reasonable. They didn't gouge. The front desk offered complimentary Cava each day from about noon on. The hotel offered breakfast which was included in our rate. They had pastries, cereal, fruit, cheeses, sliced meat, sausages, eggs, coffee and juices. Food was good and fresh. The hotel is centrally located on the Gran Via. It is located about 80 yards from the Gran Via metro stop. We only used the metro once and that was to go to the train station. All other times, we walked. Lonely Planet's recommendation for the best Sangria and Mojitos in Madrid are within 5 minute walk from the hotel. There was a whole in the wall pizza place two doors down that my son loved. It sold by the slice and was open until 7am. The only downside and this is very slight is you have people heading home from a night of drinking walking past all hours of the night (up to 6am).

Everything I wanted to see was within 15 mins walk of the hotel. 30 mins from the airport, 1 minute from the Gran Via Tube. V easy to find. Greeted courteously. I had booked a small double, but asked for and got a twin with a view. The room was a very decent size, facing the street. V. clean! Air con worked perfectly. Clean bright room. The glazing was really effective in keeping the noise from the street below at bay ( the hotel is on the equivalent of London's Oxford St, so quite noisy). Next morning we went to the restaurant for a buffet style breakfast. As you would expect it was dearer than a cafe ( we had booked a room only basis so it cost \u20ac16 each). Still, the menu was extensive: pastries, full english, fruit, juice, tea and coffee and yoghurt, all of good standard are available there, but not the churros and chocolate, which is a Spanish speciality ( go to Calle San Gines for that \"treat\"). H10 passed the customer service test when room service delivered the wrong food to our room. The correction was made without any fuss or argument, and we received an apology which defused what might have become a tense situation. In a perfect stay I do add one caveat. If like me you value peace and quiet please note: at present during the week there is building work in progress next door to H10 (Aug 2008). On the final day of our stay (a Monday) , incessant banging started at roughly 7am. By 8am we got up because we could not take it any longer, and guests in other rooms had begun banging back in response. This is the only gripe, but if you going for a midweek break it is relevant.

Thankfully the Villa de la Reina was a cool oasis to return to in the blistering heat of the afternoon. My good-sized twin room was on a light well, so very quiet though a bit gloomy, but that was a positive advantage in the height of summer. The air conditioning was easy to operate and the shower in the spacious bathroom worked a treat on every occasion I used it to cool down. The public areas are mostly very good with the roomy hotel lobby looking sophisticated and comfortable at the same time with a bar that sold very good coffee if like me you don't drink much alcohol. The only downside to the hotel was that the corridors looked rather shabby and could do with a bit of a make-over. Also in the lobby are two free computers along with a printer for guests to use, very handy for printing off new flight details when I decided to prolong my stay. The staff was absolutely lovely with very sweet and friendly girls on reception and although I experienced no problems whatsoever, I got the feeling the staff would have bent over backwards to help if I had. As the heat acts as a kind of appetite suppressant with me I skipped the hotel's breakfast in favour of a large cocktail of fresh fruit at Vitamine, the excellent juice bar just a few doors away, so cannot comment on the food. The mini bar in my room was reasonably priced with bottles of water (so essential in the heat) actually cheaper than those on sale in the street outside. This hotel is situated on the Gran Via and many tourist hot spots such as the main museums, royal palace, botanical gardens and Retiro Park are all within easy walking distance. The Gran Via itself is full of good shops (the sales were on while I was there) and has several theatres and cinemas. All is fine during the day but at night when the shutters come down on the smart shops the place becomes transformed as they are without exception covered in graffiti (a problem everywhere in Madrid though) and the prostitutes that hang out in the back streets, venture out onto the Via. I never felt threatened, but it isn't pleasant, the night time security at the hotel appeared to be very good though. There are quite a number of hotels on the Gran Via that all looked very smart, but I was pleased with my choice of the Villa de la Reina and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting Madrid.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and great Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "TravelNut8", "ReviewID": "UR14871088", "Content": "This is a great hotel with a fantastic location.

We were not disappointed with our choice. The location could not have been better. The hotel staff were efficient and very pleasant. We had requested a double room but got twins on arrival. When we asked about this, they said they did have a double and we would be welcome to it, but it was an 'inner' room with no view so we opted for the twin room overlooking the Gran Via. The double glazing was very good and kept most of the noise out, but bear in mind Madrid is a noisy place and Gran Via is a main road so it is busy all day and all night long. Our room and bathroom were very clean and better than a lot we have stayed in around the world which have cost a lot more. The breakfast was really good, better than we had expected or hoped. There was everything from fresh fruit to the full English, ham rolls, cheeses and they even had Soya milk for vegetarians. Bar staff were slow but efficient when they served. We decided to put this down to our 'English impatience' and in the end it forced us to slow down, chill out and relax. If you want to see the sights and don't need to spend much time in your hotel then it is a terrific place to stay.", "Date": "September 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in the city center\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3690408", "Content": "This is a very nice and modern hotel in the center of Madrid.

We had quite a good deal pricewise but as we had not made reservations directly with the hotel we were worried we would not be getting the non-smoking fifth floor room we had requested. We were however granted the room we had asked for and though it faced the busy GRAN VIA, traffic noises were not heard through the night (apart from some ambulances or police cars with sirens). The buffet breakfast was definitely quite good, and so was the room itself as regards cleanliness. Staff was friendly and helpful. The location is just perfect and this to the point that we mostly walked to the differents sights.

The room i was in was not the largest room, but had good modern decor and and lovely marble bath. There was no daylight coming into our room as we stayed in the middle of the hotel. Breakfast was nice but you need to get there early (before 9am) to get the all the buffet choice. Service was ok, but the staff smiled and were generally pleasant.
