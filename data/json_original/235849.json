Be careful with the \"Superior Rooms\" They are located in a separate building what they call a castle. When they take you to this remote building, you have yo make a sharp climb 40 stairs up with all your luggage and of course no help. You actually go up into an apartment which has 4 rooms and you occupy one. If you object and dont accept the room, they leave you no option and force you to accept since you have already given them your credit card information you actually have no choice. They further explain that the superior room is what i selected and actually was the only thing available.

We very much enjoyed our stay at Hotel Benardi. Our room was in the annexe a very easy walk from the main hotel. Our son was delighted that there was wifi access in our bedroom. Transfer from Marco Polo Airport on Alalaguna was easy but slightly expensive although a fantastic way to arrive, we decided to use the airport bus back (included on our 72 hour Vaporetta ticket giving us unlimited access to the routes along the Grand Canal and out to the islands). Bought this ticket afternoon of our second day so transfer back to airport was included. Only main thing for the Hotel to improve on was the instructions given by the breakfast staff, on our first morning we weren't sure what we needed to do and the staff didn't give us much help, but by day 2 we were \"up to speed\" and knew to ask for whatever drink we wanted (including a lovely hot chocolate for our son.)

We are well aware that it is very difficult to find accommodation at such a reasonable price in Venice, and chose this hotel based mainly around cost. However, we did find the shower very cramped and we had intended to take advantage of being away to sleep late in the mornings, but found it quite hard to do so due to the noise from the hotel corridors and surrounding rooms (we were on the top floor of the main hotel building).", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c3 nights in Venice\u201d", "Author": "Tessie O", "ReviewID": "UR127326572", "Content": "3 girls Saturday evening arrival from EMA returned from Treviso @ 9.30pm Tuesday. Travel- Ryanair, efficient, bad landing but bought return bus ticket to city centre for 13 euro, well worth it as bus is outside airport ready and waiting( double decker you cannot miss it). Bus takes about 40 minutes but if you don't go with Ryanair there are ticket offices in airport before you exit with similar offers, AVTO about an hour Brazi buses about 45 mins. Arrival to Piazzalle Roma - buses take you here which is in effect the end of main canal. Get off the bus and look for the red zebra crossing ( if you check the busstop when you get off the return times are on there, every 3o mins till about 8pm). Cross over and you will see the boats and a ticket office. The main line is Line 1 which goes to all stops on main canal through to Lido, tickets cost 6.50 euro and last one is about 11.20 pm. We got off at Ca D'ora, 5 stops, at 11.30pm and all very safe and clean. Boats - the main canal is serviced by waterbuses (vaporetti) that have yellow bustops along the canal, easy to spot. Tickets can be bought on the boat but you must tell them as you get on that you do not have one. You cannot buy returns on the boat but ti kets last one hour on any boat so you can hop on and off at most stations there are ticket booths, when you have a ticket you scan it before you get on WARNING they canfine you 50 odd euro if you do not. These are regular, cheaper than water taxis and fun to see all areas. You can get passes, we were there April 2012 and it was 16 euro for 12 hrs, 18 for 24 hrs etc. Hotel - we stayed in a shared room at Hotel Bernardi Ca D'oro, basic but clean with shared bathroom in corridor. We never saw anyone else using the bathroom so felt private, if you want a place to lay your head this is it, our room had view of the alley but was very clean and room service came every day, it cost us 60 euro per person for 3 nights in shared room and was well worth it. There is a curfew here for 1 pm, almost everywhere shuts at midnight and boats stop running before this so not really a big deal and on one night when we wanted to stay out later they accommodated us as we gave prior warning. This location was great, we were practically in the middle of the island and financially it worked well, 5 min from McDonalds and the only supermarket we saw and also a few minutes from The Irish Bar, again only one i saw and drinks were really cheap when compared to other places. I did get bitten by mosquitos at the hotel so take a plug in, we did not have breakfast here although it is available for 5 euros. The reception staff were lovely, helpful and worked out our broken Italian! There is a TV with two English news channels, beds have sheets and blankets with comfy pillows, the room had a sink with complimentary soap, plastic cups and shower gel. The only thing that would have been great would be the addition of some more mirrors as 4 girls and one mirror was a struggle and we could not find a full lentgh mirror in the hallways ( room 20). The hotel was very quiet which was wonderful, you can hear the church bells ring but you are in Italy and it adds to the experience. Drink - find a supermarket! Water is 30 cents but outside of the supermarket 1.30-1.60 euros, there are no real newsagents so you have to pop into a cafe. Coffee - you can get a latte for 1.50 if you stand at the bar, sit at a table and you go to minimum of four euro. Wine - 3 euro standing at bar 8 euro sitting down. Beer - in a restaurant i was asked did i want a medium or large beer, i said large and it cost me 12 euro! A medium was a pint and this was 6.50. ASK for a drinks menu before ordering as they offer the food one and ask do you want a drink while you are waiting so they make a lot on this. FOOD - there are many cafe bars and for breakfast we chose these but prices vary greatly, we had a coffee and a panini and for three of us one day it cost 20 euro and the ne xt 30 for the same items in a different place. Lunch was often a pizza slice or another sandwich and came in at around 4 to 5 euro. Dinner we chose set menus which are available everywhere although look around as some do not charge on top for service or seating and other do. A typical 13 euro menu was a boel of pasta and sauce and then a prok chop or piece of fish with a side ( chips or salad - they called chips fried potatoes on the menu ). This is e only side on a set menu, you do not get any other garnish. For 18 euro you also get ice cream but drinks are not included. Trips - guide are extortion and nothing you cannot do by yourself but do take a MAP, there are thousands of tiny side alleys to get lost down but they are all signposted really well and major attrqctions are signposted in yellow all over the city on the sides of buildings so you will not get lost. Riallto Bridge - lots of shops and markets around here, more graffitti than expected. San Marco Square - shop around, my friend got a Murano glass clock here for 4 euro which we saw in other places for 20 so it is not always the most expensive place. The BASILICA is stunning and on Sunday morning the prayers are on speaker across the courtyard. It is free to go through the main entrance but we could nt enter the church with mass on. Campinale - in the centre is the. Big tower, 8 euro to go up in the lift which is worth it for the views and pics but ut is freezing and super windy. When you are outside the Basilica and Campinale you can see two columns, one with a lion and one with a man. Left of the lion is the promenade, great views, pics and shopping. Right take you to San Marco waterbus and Harrys Bar ( famous for the bellini byt also 10 euro for a coke!) if you get the waterbus frm San Marco you can go to Murano. Murano - we got the waterbus 6.50, get there before 12 and one of the factories let you see the glass blowing for free, 3 minute presentation so we saw, bought some souvenirs and jumped back on the waterbus in the hour so we did not have to pay another 6.50 back. The trip on the water takes about 15 minutes. Jewish Quarter - this was really interesting and every two hours there is a tour for 8 euro from the synagogue explaining why Jews were exiled here. There is also a shop called Davids Shop, this man is super helpful and you can pick up some allly great gifts and souvenirs as his sister makes Murano glass so necklaces and earrings start at 2 euro and in other places they are charging 8 plus. There is also a Kosher restaurant called Gam Gams which is nice. I am Catholic but meeting David made me feel very welcome and very interested in the culture, great place! Frari Church - small fee to enter, 3 i think, insanely large ornate church, very dominant and from outsid eyou would not expect the vast area or stunning interior, however the statues did scare me, look out for the white eyes on the four black statues near the pyramid tomb, terrifying! Peggy Guggenheim - we got the bus to Academia, the whole area is very arty but kn the way to the museum there is a little corner bar where drinks like coke and coffee are 2 euro, i think it is called the corner bar and is the only one he. 12 euro for the museum which was too much for me on the day so i made do with looking around the museum shop and browsing through the books, Venice Jazz Club - we went here from a recommendation on trip advisor and it was soo good! Get the bus to Ca Rezzonico, walk down the alley and you reach a square, turn right and go over the bridge ( secind bridge here is the Bridge if Fists in the guidebook where men used to fight to the death). You will see a small vertical sign that says JAZZ in black and white. It is a hidden gem, 2 hour cncert led by Frederico the bar owner, coats 20 euro and your drink is included, small and intimate playing Myles Davis, Elliot Duke and Charles Mingus when we were there, also serve food between 8&9. Venice - there are no bikes, cars, scooters, skateboards, it is foot or boat so take trainers, most people are wearing them as it is like a workout especially with the number of bridges. It is expensive but street vendirs are serving top quality food and if you are tired grab you food and head to one of the many squares to sit in the sunshine. People have a lot of small dogs with them, including in the bars?! Treviso Airport - very small, do not go untik you have 2 hours until your flight as they will not let you into the gate lounge and there is hardly anywhere to sit. Before you check in there is a reasonably priced food lounge and a newsagents, however no English language books or mags. If you want food you had to lay first at the newsagents when i was there even thought there were tills in the food court. Do NOT listen to shop assistants when they tell you it is okay to take drinks through, 100 ml limit stands as they confiscated our Grappa! After check in there are four shops, duty free, sandwuches, coffee and clothes. Once you go through to your gate be oreoared again for no where to sit, about 20 seats for 4 gates? Souvenirs - prices vary massively, i paid 20 euro and saw the same mask for 10 and 40, the paier mache handmade masks start at around 100 euro but are beautiful, Murano glass ranges from jewllery to cross to lighrs, fishbowls and even the Scream sculpture, they make everything. Scarfs are also popular and you can get a ten euro scarf to six ir seven when bartering, there are few items you wint find somewhere else. Pasta and spices come in all shapes and sizes and some with free eye masks so you get two gifts for the price if one. Safety - even though alleys are narrow most are well lit at night, i felt very safe with friends and alone. I would imagine pickpockets could easily get close in summer as you are often pushed due to the narrow lanes and there are beggers, not many one every few miles but around Riallto Bridge they tend to follow you asking for money rather than others who are sitting on the streets displaying injuries. Mobility - i do not see how anyone with limited mobility could see the city, the streets are flat not cobbled but the amount of bridges and the sleek marble edge to the steps would be a concern for me. Anyway i had an amazing time, would do it all again exactly the same way with the addition of a couple of days to go to the beach at Lido and to travel to a few more of the surrounding islands!", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Location": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cVery friendly and helpful\u201d", "Author": "Shisher", "ReviewID": "UR127195422", "Content": "I didn't stay in the hotel but ventured in for help.

I am not sure girls about any leg shaving as I am under 5 feet and it was tight, lol. The bed was very hard, almost like park bench some people like it, I sure don't so I did not sleep well. We did not have any view as the hotel located in tiny street. Also be prepared to carry your luggage upstairs but it seems to be the norm in small hotels. We paif 65 Euro a night so I think its pretty good value for the money. They also offer basic breakfast. The only thing I did not care about was the attitude of front desk, which treated some guest rather with dissprespect, ok toward us but not outgoing and somewhat cold.

It had a wash basin with water in the room. And it was shaped in L form and one area was quite dark which was not convenient. They could add one electric lamp there.

Venice itself is very expensive, and my husband and I really didn't get what the hype is. I mean, besides the fact that the canals are AMAZING we didn't find much authenticity in Venice, plus we couldn't ever find anywhere to just sit down and enjoy the scenery (besides an expensive cafe) like we did in Florence and Rome. The \"streets\" in Venice are also really cool, its fun to wind around in them and get yourselves lost. But Venice is very touristy. Not to say that it's not worth the visit, I'm glad we went. On a good note, Hotel Bernardi was a good pick. The decor is old and a little worn but the hotel is clean and a very good budget accomodation. The location is perfect, in the middle of all the good stuff. Venice is small though and everything is close-by everything else.

As ever, the value for money and location can't be bettered in our opinion, just a short walk to the Rialto Bridge and the Grand Canal. Following tips and comments in other reviews here, we stayed in the \"annexe\" and were well pleased with the quality on offer. A huge tiled lobby gave access to the rooms, and while ours wasn't en-suite we actually had a bathroom for our exclusive use just three steps from our room. Being November we had varied weather to say the least! A combination of rain and high tides (I assume seeing as water was coming *up* out of the pavements in places) meant that some portions of Venice were under water for part of the day. One morning we found water inches deep outside the annexe's front door, but all was saved by our breakfast server / chambermaid who asked our shoes sizes and came back five minutes later with wellington boots for us both. A few last comments about the breakfast, which seems to have been an issue for some. For one thing, it is *included* in what is already a very competitive price for a hotel in Venice - I've known other continental hotels charge 5 or 6 euros per person for not much more than you get here. Secondly, it's a buffet so you can just keep helping yourselves if you want! Note that fresh bread rolls are now included, along with the filled croissants (OK, so they're plastic wrapped), yoghurt, preserves, orange juice (OK, so it's from concentrate) and hot drink. One thing we spotted this time that had escaped our notice before is that there is more on offer than the simple tea/coffee choice we assumed - simply ask for espresso, latte, macchiato or cappucino if you prefer.

We took the water bus (#1) from the train station and got off at the Ca d'Oro stop, and from there it was just a short walk. We were very happy with the location. The hotel itself was very cute. It's definitely in an old building with steep stairs (no elevator that we saw) but that contributes to the character. We paid extra for a room with a private ensuite bathroom which was definitely worth it. The room itself was nicely furnished and very clean, and the bathroom was basic but worked fine. No view out of our window (except into a window across the narrow alley) but that was just a product of being in Venice (and not staying right on the Grand Canal).

Even people snoring at night in the room next to you. The afternoon of my first arrival I was exhausted and wanted to rest before exploring Venice. As I tried to nap, it became impossible as the reception clerk was having a very loud conversation with someone in the reception area. I waited, hoping the talking would subside, after a half-hour the conversation continued. I went to the clerk and explained that I was tired and trying to rest and that it was quite loud. He shrugged his shoulders and said it would be quiet at night, then he continued to talk with what appeared to be his entire family who were sitting in the reception area.

As a family of four we booked a quad room and were taken to the annexe. No complaints on the room and it was what we expected. Yes, breakfast is meagre and there is very little welcoming hospitality but hey, we're not too fussy! However, on our second night one of the children was terribly ill (another had been equally ill with a virus in Slovenia). Without going into detail we had to change the bedding completely, which I was able to do and leave no mess at all in the room. The spoilt bedding was placed outside the room on an open landing in one pile......we didn't know what else to do at 2 am. We didn't throw it out without thinking or place it where the cleaners might not find it. My wife was also poorly during the night and I was too on the flight back. Sorry Mr Bernardi but we had a virus, these things happen. The next morning I went to reception as we were meant to check out at 10.30 (which, incidentally is a bit early in my opinion). I asked if we could stay an extra hour in the room as two of us had been ill and were struggling. The stoney-faced male receptionist could hardly bring himself to look at me and said he was aware of the illness as the cleaners had informed him about the sheets and bedding. I apologised and he asked me what was wrong with the bathroom if someone was ill as it was in the room. I explained that the bathroom wasn't in the room but through a door and down a 10 metre hallway. A small child does not have the presence of mind to prevent themselves from being sick and wandering out of a pitch black room. He was surly and had no interest in my explanation, nor did he ask how we were. I told him to forget it and we'd be out by 10.30, although he then belatedly said no, it's okay for another 30 minutes. We were able to leave our bags in the dining room with those of other guests but that wasn't an exceptional service afforded to us. I have never experienced such rudeness from a hotel member of staff. I have no idea if it was the owner or not. I'd be interested to see what sort of spin the hotel puts on this review as they seem mightily defensive. As I have said, I have no complaints about the place in general and I'm very sorry the illness caused inconvenience. However, there is little personality about the place and the website tries to be touchy, feely and stress the family factor. In closing, I'd like to reiterate that we had no option but to strip the bed and dispose of the bedding as well as we could. We are a responsible family who do consider others which is more than I can say for the San Bernardi.

The local wines were particularly good. Another positive to the location was the proximity to what I would call the center of the city - the Rialto Bridge. It was about a 5-8 minute walk.

However the graffiti on the side of the hotel by the entrance should say it all. The room was loud (room #5 a Triple) as the next building is literally 3 feet away and everyone keeps their windows open and you can hear it all from the homes and street. If I had a measuring tape, I could've gotten an accurate measurement on the depth of the dust on top of the headboards which where just beneath shoulder level so very visible. The mildew/mold on the bathroom walls/shower stall was another issue. The decor was severely dated and ill used. The photos must have been taken long ago on the website. Most times we came back to the hotel there was no one at the front desk and we just simply took our room key, (no elevator) which of course means that anyone else could do the very same; not a comforting thought at all. Upon check-in the receptionist made me aware that she knew of the food allergy which I submitted at the time of the reservation made months in advance to the manager, but he decided not to accommodate it; so I paid for food which I could never eat. If this is run by a family, we never saw them. Out of curiosity we went to the annex and couldn't believe the difference. The annex is much, much better. Needless to say we felt like we had gotten ripped off after paying for a triple. Point being, only stay here at the main hotel if you are on a string shoe budget.

Making the reservations with Leonardo and Santina was easy using e-mail. The location is good, close to the Rialto Bridge and other Venice sights. The night manager was very friendly and helpful. Small discount if you pay cash when checking out. CONS I had confirmed a room with two single beds and was surprised that our room actually had one double bed (standard mattress) and one small single fold-out cot. I drew the short straw and slept on the cot both nights -- it was NOT pleasant -- I would say two of the worst nights I have had in recent memory. The front desk staff (Leonardo and I would assume Santina) were NOT at all welcoming and not that friendly. They never gave us the impression that they wanted us there as guests. We overheard on both days different guests having \"concerns\" with the management over their nightly rate (this wasn't a problem for us as I had a copy of my e-mails confirming our rate). The staff who served us breakfast both days (same people) were not pleasant at all. No smiles, no nothing. Not exactly the most pleasant way to start the day. WOULD WE STAY THERE AGAIN?

The guy at reception told us in a heavy Italian accent \"ehhhhh.... yes !.... U aff foond aeh juell!\" (\"You have found a jewel.\")....as usual the Italians are masters in excelling in the art of exaggeration ! A jewel it is definitely not...but as far as the extortionate rates of Venice hotels go, this place is pretty reasonable priced at 60-160 euro per night considering its central location INSIDE the main part of Venice. However I would offer some points of advice to whoever wants to stay at this place (and in general for other smaller privately run hotels in Italy): 1.) Get confirmation of the rate you are quoted in writing (either on arrival or by email or fax beforehand AND the name of the person who has quoted it to you. I was quoted one rate on the phone and then another on arrival. I argued and mentioned the name of the person who gave the original quote and managed to pay only that. Other people I saw getting billed during my stay there paid much higher prices. 2.) Make sure your room has a bathroom with a sink, toilet, AND shower and that you do not have to use a shared one. 3.) Virtually every extra facility you might expect to be included in the rate had an extra cost. Air conditioning - Extra fee; en-suite bathroom -extra fee; remote control to watch TV - extra fee; etc, etc. Read the fee's lists in your room carefully ! 4.) Ask when and if they close the hotel at night so you are not locked out ! 5.) Make sure you know when check out time is (it can be as early as 10.00 in the morning sometimes!) 6.) Italians rarely have more than a roll or croissant and a small espresso for breakfast - don't expect to get much unless they specify more. 7.) Make sure you get a receipt. (As with everything you may pay for in Italy.) 8.) Get your passport or ID back as soon as they're done registering your details. If they insist it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a form of deposit leave a credit card NUMBER instead. ------------------------------ The room we had was an en-suite (with shower) which was spacious and clean and we did not have any complaints while we were there. Venice really is beautiful and the wonderful thing is that there are no cars creating a tranquillity you won't find anywhere else in Italian cities elsewhere. However some points to keep in mind when visiting: a) It's VERY maze-like and no matter how reliable your memory or orientation is, you WILL get lost at some point. Bring a good map. (On the other hand, because it's an island, you'll never be able to wander too far off. b) When going and coming from the airport take the local orange-red public bus (not the boats) which stops on the only dry part of Venice that has cars. BIG savings! c) Buy drinks from local supermarkets in the side alleyways (avoid anything on the main squares and roads) unless you want to pay 10 euro for a can of coke ! d) Check the small writing on the bottom or the back of your restaurant menu. Chances are you will be billed a 3 to 10 euro cover charge PER PERSON, AND a 5 to 20% service charge on top of your bill! Avoid those restaurants which do this to an unreasonable extent! Venice is notorious for this ! e) If you feel you've been overcharged anywhere, get a receipt with all charges detailed (by law they have to give you a receipt for income tax purposes), and tell them you will go to the \"Guardia di finanza\" (Italian finance police) to review the charges.

We were VERY happy with the hotel!! First disclaimer though, you get what you pay for. It's one of the best values in venice- meaning that it's not a 4 star hotel with world class service. Per other reviews, yes- you could stay at another pricier hotel, and get breakfast staff that have a smile on their face. Frankly, skip breakfast for a cappucino and pastry on your way out to the sites. With that in mind, this hotel is a great choice for your venice stay! Hotel details: Breakfast is a typical european spread with individual bagged croissants, coffee, and some jam. Nothing great. The wife/owner was very nice, while I agree the breakfast staff and husband/owner doesnt give much notice to the guests. But, again who cares! Just remember to ask for your passport back upon check-out, as they might not remember for you. We stayed in their 'annex' which was just a couple alleys away. It was supposedly cheaper (90euros) and we never went back to the main hotel except on check-out day. Our room was really, really big, clean, had a bathroom, and again the owner woman who checked us in was very friendly. I've highly recommended this hotel to friends, as it was such a prime location and great value in venice. The hotel is just off a cute main shopping street, and in walking distance to everything. It's also close to a major canal stop (good when you're lugging luggage around), and there's a gondola crossing you can take near the hotel for only a few euros (take your picture with them instead of paying 70euros for a short, non-eventful gondola ride). Other TIPS: we met people staying at a nicer hotel right on the grand canal, and they were really bitter by the end of their 4 night stay. They said the grand canal is busy all night long and kept them up. As for other noise, expect some construction nearby at almost any hotel, as the city is constantly under construction. But they only work during the day, while you are out, so doesnt normally matter- unless you are a late sleeper. If you continue to take the public water bus from the hotel all the way to the dom, you will get a great (and cheap) view of venice. Dont hire a water taxi, they show you the same thing for more money. Also, venice is a city of alleys. When we first arrived, I thought it was dirty and scarey. By the end, you are used to it and it's fun to think you're heading to a dead end when all of a sudden, a small passage on your left appears. I also think you can do most of venice and get your fill in 1-2 days. We also recommend trying: lots of gelato, a spritz aperol (alcohol drink) in summer, and visiting verona (about 1.5 hours from venice).

This hotel in located a little ways out of the centre of Venice but in my opinion is a much better location than getting caught up in all the tourist rip offs closer to San Marco. The closest Vaporetta stop is Ca D'or which is about a 2 minute walk and within 5-15 minutes you can be anywhere you want in Venice. It seems to also be in a more residential neighbourhood which is great as you can hang out in the campo with the locals!! Also, try out the Coop grocery store for some cheap wine and grab some awesome cheese and bread for lunch. If you are looking for an excellent and affordable restaurant, seek out the Taverna San Trovaso which is near the Accademia Vaporetta stop. The address is Fondamenta Priuli, Dorsoduro 1016 . A huge plate of spaghetti Scoglio (shell fish) is 11 Euro but it is loaded with Mussels, prawns, clams etc. etc. If you get a second course you could split it with another person. Delicious.

The location seemed as convenient as any, it was certainly as easy to walk to San Marco as it was to take a vaporetto there. I recommend the bar/restaurant directly across the narrow street from the hotel office. The have a wide assortment of cichetti (mostly fish and shellfish appetizers/tapas) that, along with their house white wine make for a good, cheap evening meal. If you don't like fish, then you should probably admit that you are an incomplete person, unworthy of the best Italian food, stay at home and eat at the Olive Garden. My kids hate fish, but they managed to always find something to eat (they are unworthy too, but I take them along anyway!). Regarding the hotel, the proprietors responded quickly to my e-mail inquiry, they take credit cards (I guess not that unusual these days!), and the rooms were always made up every day while we were out seeing the sights.

Venice was the third stop on our 2005 trip to Europe between September and October. Other stays included the Residence La Tavolozza in Positano, the Hotel Alimandi in Rome, and the Mercure Tour Eiffel Suffern in Paris. Also see my reviews of these hotels. We had stayed at the Bernardi for three nights in September 2004, and came back this year (2005) for six nights. There are important things to remember about this hotel. It is family-run (owned by Maria Teresa and Leonardo Pepoli). It is not a luxury hotel - it is a simple place. It is not in a prime tourist area, and frankly, I consider that a very good thing indeed. It does not have elevators. It's in an alley. If you want luxury, by all means stay near St. Mark's Square, but be prepared to be surrounded mostly by other tourists and be prepared to pay a fortune for food. One of the joys of travel is to experience the locals, their customs, and to enjoy simply prepared local food. I have read mixed reviews about this hotel on this site. I wonder about them because the sense I get is that people are bringing their own expectations to staying here. If you want to be pampered and coddled, or want room service, or want a big breakfast - don't stay here. Those things are not germane to the Bernardi. Starting off, the Bernardi is in the Cannaregio neighborhood of Venice, not near St. Mark's Square. The hotel is about an 8-minute walk from the main post office and the nearby Rialto Bridge and incredible Rialto Market. The hotel is a minute away from a typical small Venetian piazza, Ss. Apostoli Square, from which The Strada Nuovo begins. The square has amenities like an outdoor cafe, a newstand, some restaurants, food shops, a beautiful church (Santi Apostoli), and plenty of people hurrying to and fro. The Strada is a fantastic neighborhood street filled with bakeries, gelateria, banks, food shops, shops selling glass or clothes or soaps, even hardware and stationery. There is even a medium-size supermarket. The Strada runs for about 20 minutes and will take you - as it bends and crosses footbridges and changes its name - to the Santa Lucia Train Station, Venice's main station. On the north side of Cannaregio - a six minute walk from the hotel - is the Fondamente Nova vaporetto stop (the boat bus) from where you can catch the vaportetto to the islands of Murano and Burano, or take a ride around the north side of the Venetian Lagoon to the Lido. We had purchased 3-days boat/bus passes for 22-Euros at the vaporetto kiosks outside the train station. The hotel is minutes away from the Ca' D'Oro Vaporetto stop, which is down a narrow alley off The Strada. This is one of the main stops on the Grand Canal. Again, it is highly recommended that you buy a pass because the boat/buses can cost 3-6 Euros per ride depending on where you are catching them. The Grand Canal Vaporetto (boat/bus #1) is now 6 Euros. A pass makes sense. And the #1 is the main boat from the train station to the hotel. The Ca' D'Oro stop is at a beautiful restored palazzo - the classic, famed Ca' D'Oro building. Get off the boat and walk up the very narrow alley. You'll get to The Strada. Turn right. Walk a few minutes to Ss. Apostoli Square. You'll know when you're there. Turn left, walk past the cafe and a couple of storefronts and you'll see Calle de l'Oca. This is a very narrow lane (alley). It's important to note and remember that Venice is made up of thousands of very narrow alleys. It is no shame to get lost in Venice. Even the Venetians get lost. A visitor is expected to get lost. It's a time-honored tradition. Frankly, the rule is that if you haven't gotten lost, you haven't really walked around Venice. When you look down Calle de l'Oca, you'll see a small white sign with black lettering that reads Hotel Bernardi. It's across from a restaurant and next to a restaurant. That's your home in Venice. Your welcome will be pleasant. If you are staying in the main hotel building, you have already chosen not to have a bathroom in your room. If you accepted a room on the very first floor (the least expensive rooms - and this is not an expensive hotel), you will be off the lobby near the tiny breakfast kitchen and you will have to walk across the hall to get to your shower and toilet. The upper floor rooms have shower rooms and separate toilet facilities in the hallway that you will be sharing with other guests. Ask questions before you book. I don't understand people who don't ask questions. The Bernardi also has rooms and suites down some alleys near a small canal. This is the Bernardi Annex building. The rooms will have both a private bath (with a shower) and toilet in-room. The second floor rooms are comfortable and not tiny. Some of them are very spacious and wildly decorated in the classic Venetian tradition. The owners have also remodeled a third-floor at their Annex and the rooms are superb-looking with beautiful bathroom facilities. We were in a second floor room - in fact, we were in the same room we had in 2004 - and that was alright with us. We did look at a remodeled third floor room, and it was wonderfully re-done. Here's one bit of advice regarding those new Annex rooms. The stairway up from floor 2 to floor 3 is very, very narrow. You have to walk - no elevator, and you will bring whatever luggage you have - large or small - up a step at a time. I should point out that the marble stairway from the Annex's street level entrance to the 2nd floor is wide, but again, if you have a heavy bag, it's a step at a time. By the way, around the corner from the Annex is a movie theater. And the men's clothing shop near the Annex has great affordable items. The man who owns it speaks solid English. Remember, the Bernardi has stairs to navigate in both buildings. If you want in-room bathing and toilet facilities, they are not available in every room - except in the Annex. You will pay more, although the Bernardi is not an expensive hotel. Very importantly, the Bernardi's housekeeping is top-notch. The rooms are cleaned daily. The towels are refreshed daily. The sheets are clean. The ladies who do the cleaning are wonderfully friendly and expert at maintaining cleanliness. Leonardo and Maria Teresa run a hotel that prides itself on room cleanliness, and it shows. If you're concerned about Venetian mosquitos, bring along some spray or repellent or buy some along The Strada. We only saw three mosquitos in our room over six days and swatted them with some newspaper. I have also read that people are concerned about the smell of the canals. Yes, on occasion the canals will have a slight odor, but not every day, and not all day. If the water in the lagoon is high - due to rain or tides - there might be sewer odors. Might. Trust me, the odor won't kill you, and it is not an all-pervasive smell. You're in Venice - it's an old, old, old place, and utterly fascinating and magical, even on cloudy days. It seems to be decaying, but it isn't. It's vibrant. People live and work there. There are no cars (except on the Lido island) and the joy of walking and the pleasure of the quiet are amazing experiences. I have read that people found some of the staff at the Bernardi rude or surly. Leonardo can be perfunctory - perhaps some will call it curt. He is really a very nice man and quite pleasant. Warm up to him. Try some Italian. He does speak very good English. His wife, Maria Teresa teaches English, and she's a beautiful and charming woman. If you have a problem or a question, don't be afraid to bring it up. Leonardo is not going to bite off your head. The breakfast at the Bernardi is simple. Prepare yourself for it. Coffee (or tea), juice, yogurt, and pound cake or pastry. That's it. A classic European continental breakfast. Nothing more. Yes, one of the girls serving it needs to smile a bit more. Why not give her a smile? Give her a small tip - perhaps a Euro. We did, each day. Take charge during your trip. Don't hesitate to act, rather than only react. Dining in Venice is pleasurable, but watch out for the Ristoranti Al Vagon, which is near the Bernardi, and has outdoor tables near a small canal. The restaurant is in the Al Vagon hotel. By the way, the Al Vagon Hotel does not have good ratings on Tripadvisor. We are not very demanding people, but this is a restaurant where the staff is definitely not pleasant and the food only passably good. The woman who seemed to be in charge pretended she did not speak English, but when push came to shove, she spoke it. I find very few Venetians who play this game. In fact, I find very few Italians who play this game. When I ordered a roast veal entree, the woman asked me if I wanted a salad or vegetables or potato to go with it. She clearly indicated that it came with the entree. By the way, this was the worst roast veal I've ever eaten. The slices were 1/16 of an inch thick and seemed to be veal roll, not pure meat. Imagine my surprise when the check came and I was charged a steep extra fee for the salad that I truly expected to come with the meal. The restaurant also has an absurd 3 Euro per person cover charge. This is often seen on the menu as a \"coperto.\" And it's sometimes a bread charge and is usually one Euro or 1.50. Never have I seen it 3 per person. A table of four Brits near us questioned 12-Euros on their menu for seemingly nothing - a few breadsticks is what they give you for your 3 euros per person. The Brits missed the tiny type indicating the 3-euro charge per person. Avoid the Al Vagon restaurant. A restaurant to definitely seek out is Trattoria Ca' D'Oro Alla Vedova. The restaurant is in a nameless alley entrance off the Strada Nuovo. It's card reads Cannaregio 3212, Fermata Ca' D'Oro. That means it's near the vaporetto stop at Ca' D'Oro, which, of course, is the Bernardi's stop. Here's how to find it. Leave the hotel. Walk up The Strada to the Ca' D'Oro Vaporetto Stop alley entrance. Stop walking. Look to your right and you'll see walk space that goes back about 50 feet. There's a restaurant at the end. That's The Trattoria Ca' D'Oro Alla Vedova. The food is world class, with a mushroom lasagna - if available - that will knock your socks off. The eggplant lasagana is also spectacular. Seafood? Of course, and it's superb. The restaurant is not big on desserts, however. We ate there twice and one time I had a succulent liver and onion dish that changed forever the way I will look at liver and onions. I've never experienced anything like it. The dish came with a breathtakingly delicious polenta that was the color and consistancy of fresh cream. Here's how you secure a table at this restaurant. It is very popular, but not impossible to get into. You can always stand at the small bar area and have tastes from the tiny buffet and have a drink. Many Venetians do this. But you really want to dine there. Reservations are vital for regular evening dining hours - 8:00 to 10:00. The restaurant's doors are closed until precisely 6:30. It is not open on Thursday or Sunday. Odd days, but that's their plan. Anyway, at between 6:30 and 6:45 p.m., go there and ask for a table. You should be advised that you can have a space, but must finish eating by 8. Or, of course, you can go in at any time and make reservations for another night or as many nights as you want. Most of the tables are long (rectangular) with dark polished wood, and seat six. But, they are usually set for four. This means you will, if you are dining with only one other person, enjoy a meal with another twosome. This is a great way to meet people and is lots of fun. We ate at here in 2004, arriving very late for that meal. This year, we went in once at 6:45 and ate until 8, and also made a reservation for a second night. On the second night we shared our table with a thirty-something architect from Munich, Germany who was with his 75-year old mother (a great, vibrant lady). He had brought his mom to Venice for the weekend as a birthday present. Nice son. Nice present. It was a terrific meal and the comradery was wonderful. There is a lot to see in Venice, but I do recommend a boat ride to Murano island to see the glassmakers and take in the shops. I also recommend a boat ride to Burano island to see the lacemakers. Burano is also famous for its colorfully painted homes. Both can be done in the same day. The Lido is also a great place to visit. In Venice itself, I was pleasantly surprised by the very eclectic modern art collection at the Peggy Guggenheim Museum on the Grand Canal. Well worth a visit. While taking some back alleys in the Santa Croce neighborhood to get to a vaporetto stop, I happened upon a shop in which a glorious woman, Teresa Della Valentina, makes some of the most incredible hand-painted tiles you've ever seen. The shop is called Arca and is at 1811 Calle Tentor in the Santa Croce section of Venice. Calle tentor is directly off the walk that is near the San Stae vaporetto stop. Stroll south for about three minutes from the stop. Teresa is a true artist and absolutely filled with joy and pride at her work. We bought some more of her amazing tiles. Her range of work and her colors are exceptional. Her photo is included with the batch of photographs I've posted with this review. And, of course, no trip to Venice is complete without a visit to the Rialto Market and a hello to the fabulous Giuliana. The day we were there she was wearing a fantastic leopard print jacket and white sunglasses while selling her terrific produce. I also want to mention a day-long side trip we took from Venice to Bologna. We caught a mid-morning train to this most interesting of cities. Bologna gets very few American tourists and that's unjustified. The train took about two hours and it was worth the ride. The city is fantastic. The archways that cover almost every sidewalk are amazing. There's a great old tower you can go up into (598 steps for 3 euros for a breathtaking view of Bologna and the surrounding hills). Every person in every store we entered (gelateria, restaurant, olive oil and cheese shop) was incredibly friendly and was thrilled Americans had come to their city. Bologna is home to the world's largest university (100,000 students). It has a fascinating old town section. It's a big city without the insane traffic or graffiti that Rome has. The San Maggiore square is huge and the main church - Basilica San Petronius - is truly beautiful. We had a flawless meal at a restaurant where students and professors were hanging out. The place was called Il Ristoro Della Fate and is at 24/f Via Zamboni in the university quarter. I had perfect tortoloni (invented in Bologna, by the way). Trains run constantly, so returning to Venice late at night was not a problem. Venice is unlike most cities you've experienced. My best advice is to get into the swing of things. You will walk. You will boat. You will mrvel at the decay and the beauty. You will get lost. All perfect.

Each morning we spent at least as much, if not more, for a pastry and coffee at cafes on the street, and probably would have done just as well or better with the hotel breakfast. The hotel is dificult to find for someone new to Venice. It is located on a small alley/street and we walked past it a couple times before stopping an elderly gentleman, who spoke excellent English, and he directed us to it. The hotel should post a clearer map and give more detailed instructions on its website. It is a great value, and centrally located to many things.

The room was spacious, clean, bright, and packed a real Venetian punch aesthetically with the ornate mirrors, cupboards, bed, side tables etc. The fact that the hotel is tucked away in a side alley makes it all the more endearing. The manager, Leonardo, was always very friendly and helpful. Location-wise, it's a magical 15 minute walk to St Marks square and everything is reachable by foot. Truly, the best value accomodation in an otherwise overpriced city. Will definitely return.

To tell the truth we spent little time in the actual hotel as we had a lot of sight-seeing to cram into the one weekend, however, the room and service of the hotel was more than adequette. It was great that, although we arrived at midnight, the reception was still open and expecting us, and we had a very warm welcome. Although our room's bathroom was in the hallway, it was clean and substancial- and I didn't bump into anyone or have to que at all. Breakfast was fine- it filled our stomachs till we were able to lunch out (even though it was limited and basic) and service was good. Location was perfect- a 4star anywhere else couldn't have been better as where we were situated was in a quiet back alley just off of a nice piazza and one of the main roads in Venice- Strada Nuovo. Everything then was just a little walk away- but in venice no distance seems long as there is just so much to see and admire. And the price for all of this- amazingly low in comparisson to other hotels- what a great deal! Of course if you want a luxury stay in venice then these standards may be a little low- but as I feel to truly experience a place,- a culture then you should do it the local way and if that's modestly-then great!

When we made our reservation we inquired about getting an \"annex\" room as we read that the annex was newer and a little nicer but they were unable to accomodate however the room we had was very nice. Having stayed in several hotels throughout Italy the room was above average. Three of us were sharing the room and did not feel cramped, in fact there was plenty of room for us. We had a private bathroom which was nice however (as is typical) the shower was about 2x3 feet so don't drop the soap! Being curious my wife looked at the shared bath facilities which were down the hall. Interestingly the toilets were down stairs and if you wanted to take a shower you had to go upstairs where the showers were located. The bathrooms were very clean. The hotel is in a great location, you take water taxi #1 and you can walk to the hotel in less than 10 minutes (probably about 5 minutes if you know where you're going once you arrive). Front desk help was polite and helpful. The noise level at this hotel is much better than what we experienced in Rome which was somewhat noisy. You are a 15 minute walk from St Mark's Square and there are great restaurants all over the place.

It's in a great part of Venice that's slightly more residential than San Marco. Still, its only a 15 minute walk to St. Mark's, and fairly close to the Rialto Bridge. The rooms were comfortable and clean, the shower is tucked into a tiny corner and could use an update. The breakfast is a roll and coffee, so go try a cornetti and a cappuccino at one of the many places nearby.

It is located in a back alley which STINKS beyond belief. We would have to hold our noses shut as we passed through. You get to the hotel and the reception area is horrendous. It is cluttered, the receptionist wasn't even there. We had to wait 30 minutes because there was no one even attending the front desk. We then were given the keys to our rooms - AND THEN told there is no elevator. We had to haul our lugguge upstairs - since we were on the top floor. The room STANK like cigarette smoke. It still gives me a headache thinking about it. The carpet was disgusting, the sheets and pillows had stains on them. The bathroom was very very small. I didn't even realize it but we were about 3 ft away from the house next door and saw a man staring at me, as I was about teo change. I quickly had to shut the shutters - beware. The day we checked out - we asked them to hold the luggage which meant - leaving it in the back hall by the doorway. totally unattended, no locks, nothing. Since we had bough the Venice Rolling Pass (for people between 18-29 I think it is) - it clearly stated that Hotel Bernardi gives 10% off. They did not honor it. I would NEVER stay in the hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone. I highly recommend you spend a little bit more and get a cleaner, friendlier, and safer place.
