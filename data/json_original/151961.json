I had researched several options on Trip Advisor, and finally chose the Milano. I was not disappointed. The lobby is very nice and the customer service was great! I was in Room 303 - very basic - no view, but did have a large window. Very clean and a decent size, with round table and 2 chairs, Queen size bed, TV (only 5 channels but you're in San Juan!! What do you need to watch TV for??!!), air conditioned, elevators, hiar dryer in bathroom, full bath/shower, etc. I arrived 3 hours before check in, and asked for an early check in. The room I had booked was not available but they did give me an upgraded room which was ready. The location of this hotel is ideal - just walk out the door, take a right, then the first left, and you can walk down to the Carnival Port in 5 minutes or less. There is a wonderful Mexican Restaurant as well - out the front door, turn right and keep walking till you can't go any further due to police baracade. Turn right and you'll find El Parnaso. Great little Mexican Restuarant! Also, for a unique experience....out the front door of the hotel turn right and take first left. You'll come to a Jewelry wholesale store that sells all kinds of supplies for jewelry making - BUT they have an artist on staff so you can buy the supplies, and pay a small fee ($5) for her to make anything you want. I had 5 pairs of earrings made, that I had designed myself!

What made me stay here is the price, it was a good price for a wonderful area (other hotels were the same or more and further away). I stayed for one night in beginning of April. Room: I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in to the room. There was a queen size bed (def. not European), closet, lots of space for clothes, a fridge and windows! although they were strangely placed at the top of the wall there were extra pillows. I could not have asked for anything better. Oh and the housekeeping left some chocolates for me!! The bed was comfortable, slept like a baby (not sure if its the bed or me exploring the city for 5 hours. There was no noise, as I had the back room, the only thing I would recommend is if you are staying during busy season get the furthest room from the \"glass security door\" as possible as it will make a banging noise every time someone comes and goes (I was right in front of it), but again not a big deal. TV had several channels which was nice, and I had to keep air conditioner on as it was a little too hot in the room (I was staying on 4th fl facing the back). Bathroom: Everything was there, Shower was good and there was another window as well. There was soap, shampoo, and hair drier. I was very happy with the room, the ONLY negative that somebody might find is the tv remote control did not have a back cover, so there was a tape there, but if you coming to explore Old San Juan and not watch TV you will not notice!! I decided to go wth breakfast ($5.30 was not included) on the roof. Although it was cheap the choices were as well. I usually book hotels w breakfast, so that I can eat twice a day: a filling breakfast and a late lunch/dinner. There was cereal, bread, pastries, fruits, and juices. Now I don't know if its a regular breakfast that hotel offers or if its because there were only 4 or five rooms occupied during that time. I would say walk a few blocks and grab yourself a seat at a cafe instead. Location: This is the only reason why I chose this hotel in the first place. Everything is around this place. There is CVS fifteen minutes from it, Payless on the next block (in case you make a hole in your shoe <from walking> ;) ), free trolley 2 minutes away, Coach store maybe 15 min, Cruise ship area 15 min. I basically walked around the area for several hours just exploring. How to get to hotel and from: I decided to skip the taxi and do it the old school by public transport. (no suitcase, just carry-on), if you walk closer to Cruise ship area there is a police station and the bus terminal, you grab bus 5 to isla verde (it will take about 40-45 min), there at the same stop wait for b40, or aeroporto(50) it would be 15 min and it takes you straight to the entrance of the airport. I would definitely stay here again!!

Since it wasn't a 'destination' hotel for us, all I wanted was a clean, comfortable place to spend the night without spending a lot of money. This worked out fine. Our room had small, high windows that I had to stand on tip-toe to see out of, and faced the rear. The staff were pleasant and helpful. Free wi-fi in the lobby area. The location is good - near lots of shops and restaurants. The air conditioner worked well, but was noisy as is to be expected for a room air conditioner. Since it was on continually, it served as \"white noise\", but if that kind of noise bothers you, you may need to look elsewhere (but all hotels in Old San Juan may have the same issue). There is a continental breakfast available ($5.25 per person) on the roof terrace. The food was mostly commercially packaged stuff - not that great, but the fresh tangerines were almost worth the price by themselves - the best I've ever eaten. If I stayed there again, though, I'd probably look for a local bakery for breakfast instead. Although the hotel is only a few blocks from the bay, our cruise ship was at the new pier which was farther away - it was about a $20 taxi ride plus tip. Fare from the airport to the hotel was $19, plus baggage fees and tip. Be aware that taxis in San Juan charge $1 per large suitcase and 50 cents per small bag in addition to the fare.

We parked our car and when we checked out the next day and picked up our car the parking garage charged us 50 bucks for just an overnight stay!

The elevator was a joke; there was no one to help take the luggage to the room; we were told to keep the glass doors on our floor shut and locked for safety purposes, yet everytime we shut them, a hotel person would open them and prop them open. It was easy access for anyone who wanted to break into our room.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. The bed was incredibly comfortable; no problems getting a good night's sleep. Although breakfast isn't included in the price, it's very inexpensive and conveniently located on the roof top terrace, with a view of the Old City and the port. The bathroom was as good as could be expected -- no complaints there. Once I got the air conditioning going, the room was quite comfortable. And the entire hotel, including my room, was very clean and well taken care of. I deduct one star for the fact that despite asking for and being promised a room with a window, all I got was a room with two 1-foot by 1-foot slabs of glass high up on the wall.

The room was fine (we had a front Queen bedroom), not huge but good enough, the shower was very powerful and hot, there was plenty of space to hang clothes. but the real plus for the Hotel Milano is it's position, right in the centre of the old city with all the restaurants, bars and sites within walking distance. The downside of this of course is that can be a little noisy with dustbin collections at 6am or the occasional police siren but with the windows closed and the air conditioning on this is not too bad and the price you pay for a city center location. We even managed to park our hire car right outside the door on the three nights we needed to although i think this was probably a little lucky but there are a couple of multistory car park near by. The only negatives were the breakfast is served on paper plates with plastic cups and cutlery and the internet connection seemed a bit flaky (but it worked if I reconnected but would not stay up for more than 20 minutes), it is however free \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Holiday Inn and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd establishments please note.

We arrived at the Hotel Milano on November 4th at 11:00 p.m. Check-in was very slow because the computer was down. Our room #302 was very old and dark, carpeting needs to be replaced. The light beside the bed did not work (electrical wiring malfunction) even though I asked the clerk at the front desk to give me a light bulb so I can change it myself. It appeared that the hotel was short staff at this late hour. After I changed the light bulb, the light still did not work so we had to turn on the washroom light and pole lamp to see where we were going in the room.. It was a little difficult getting things out of our luggages in partial darkness. We requested a queen size bed but I think it is only a double bed so not much room for my husband and myself. We are not big people. I can't imagine 2 people sleeping in a double size bed unless you kiddy size. The air condition was very loud so it kept me awake most of the night. The shower curtain had mold and mildew when I showered in the morning, only upon stepping out of the tub I discovered the mold and mildew shower curtain. At least the water was hot. I guess housekeeping don't believe in cleaning with bleach or Ajax. I would not recommend this hotel as it is very old and if you need a good nights rest, this isn't the place. It may have been ok if we arrived during the day and did not have to turn on the lights. The front desk clerk does not know when the free trolley bus comes when I inquired, even though this trolley bus passes in front of their hotel. If I was working there, I would make it my job to know exactly what time this free trolley bus comes by and let customers know that you can catch it 3 blocks down the street on Calle Fortaleza. The clerk couldn't tell us if the bus came every 15 minutes, 1/2 an hour or on the hour. They just don't seem to care or have the knowledge about their surroundings. Anyways, the hotel was good in storing our luggages for a couple of hours after check-out. We didn't have to board our ship until 2:30 so the clerk was able to lock everything up for us. That service was excellent so we tipped the luggage handler. The other thing that was great about this hotel is that breakfast is up on the roof so you do get a good view of San Juan. You get a wide variety of toast, cereal, croissant, fresh fruits, juice, milk and coffee. The coffee was excellent. Other than that, this hotel requires renovations with king or queen size beds, new carpeting, fix all electrical wiring re lighting and invest in some cleaning agents for the shower curtains to get rid of mold and mildew.

When we came back I had noticed a sign that announced that the roof top resteraunt serves breakfast from 7:00 am to 10:00 am. When I asked the clerk about that - you guessed it! He informed me that the resteraunt would not be open because it was the slow season and they had only 3 rooms occupied. Duh! I hope next week you don't have any rooms occupied! Then you can go home and learn how to run a hotel. Don't be fooled by the pictures by the way. The room we stayed in was dark, musty and smelled and looked old. Nothing like the pictures! I can't say what the resteraunt looked like since it was not open. The picture of the front door does not show the true character of this hotel either. The streets are dirty and have almost a urine like smell. There are much nicer hotels here for about the same price. The only thing I can say about the hotel that is positive is that it is in Old San Juan and there are resteraunts in walking distance.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mayaguez", "Title": "\u201cBest altenative for Internal Tourism\u201d", "Author": "Veronica S", "ReviewID": "UR118412835", "Content": "My husband and I travel to San Juan (we're from Mayaguez) on a regular basis to do business and had never stayed or heard of the Milano, until a friend recommended it.

We were leaving San Juan on a cruise on Sunday and needed a cheap place to stay Saturday night. Many people gave great reviews of this hotel. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because of the location, otherwise it would only be 2 stars. I knew while booking it, it wasn't going to be the best hotel...but the price and the fact that it was within walking distance caught my husband and I's eye. It wasn't the worst hotel I have stayed in, but pretty bad. The rooms were not nice at all and our room had windows on the top of the room, so I had to stand on a chair to even get a look out of our window! But, it was an okay stay for ONLY one night. The location was great, in the middle of Old San Juan. We could walk everywhere from this location. There were also many restaurants around this hotel. And it was great because we walked to the cruise port with all of our luggage very easily! Many people say it is impossible, but we had 2 rolling suitcases and it saved us money on another taxi ride (since that is all we did in all the other cruiseports)! We walked to the cruise port on Saturday to find the easiest way to get down there with our suitcases and worked out just fine. If I were vacationing in Old San Juan (which I don't think I ever would, wasn't the biggest fan!), I would definitely not stay here. I would pay a little extra money to stay at the Sheraton, or somewhere in Condado on the beach.

Nothing in old San Juan is a long or difficult walk, so location is not a big issue when finding a hotel. The one drawback with this location is in getting there from the airport. The main streets east and west in Old San Juan are one way, and many north south streets were blocked by police to all but local traffic. It took us longer to make the loop through the old city to get to our hotel than the trip from the airport to the edge of the old city. Unless you have a lot of heavy luggage bags, I would recommend having your taxi driver drop you at the Plaza Colon. From there it is a short walk of less than 2 blocks straight down Fortaleza. The room was clean with basic furnishings. Do not expect luxury and you won't be disappointed. The bed was comfortable, the tv and air conditioning worked fine. We requested a room at the front of the building and were happy to have the extra natural light as well as a view of the street. (noise was not a problem). The staff at the front desk as well as the breakfast room were pleasant, accommodating and eager to offer advice. Upon leaving San Juan, the staff secured and watched our luggage after check out so we could take advantage of our last few hours without having to cart our bags around town with us. The continental buffet style breakfast was basic fair, but the roof top seating was a major bonus.

I'm really not a picky person, so I gave more weight to the positive comments posted here--in other words, I thought that some of the reviews might have been a little harsh. I also wanted to stay in Old San Juan and was looking for good value. My family and I stayed at the Hotel Milano for a total of 7 room nights: we had a number of rooms booked at the front and back end of our cruise vacation, so I saw more than one room and solicited feedback from all of my relatives before composing this review. Location: The hotel is located in the heart of Old San Juan within walking distance of all of Old San Juan's attractions and restaurants. The location couldn't have been better for seeing the sights. On the other hand, the location can also be a negative factor. As others have noted (and my family and I experienced), the street on which the hotel is located is noisy, especially if you have a front room. The management realizes this and thus charges less for the front rooms. If you can put up with noise into the wee hours (especially on weekends), a front room will be fine for you. If not, book a back room which, we discovered, is less noisy. The Hotel: The common areas of the hotel are nicely decorated, up to date, and clean. The rooms need attention. Each of the rooms I was in could have used new carpet (read my other reviews and you'll see that worn carpet is a pet peeve of mine). The air conditioning units worked well, but often make the rooms smell musty. I really couldn't have stayed there more than two nights because of the smell. I thought it was just my room, but at least one other I spent time in had the same problem. Upon check-in, we weren't told that the unit could be controlled by a remote, if desired. Another guest (not related to my party) approached the front desk and complained about the temperature of the air conditioning unit in his room and was given a remote to fix the issue. The rooms could have been cleaner. I found small pieces of trash on our floor (just under the bed skirt) that didn't belong to my family. In general, I always felt the rooms were just barely clean and needed to be renovated/updated. Breakfast: Breakfast was fine. The gentleman who was the host was friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The price was reasonable for a continental breakfast buffet ($5.35, I believe), and the setting was fantastic: we had breakfast on the roof terrace. Note: there aren't many places to get a reasonable breakfast in Old San Juan. Service: Check-in was not a problem. We got the rate promised, received information about the area, and information about the hotel. E-mail communication prior to arrival was always prompt and helpful. On the day of check-out, my family and I hung around the hotel's lobby before going to our cruise ship's port. The person at the desk welcomed this and even helped \"store\" our luggage (chained it together in the lobby). Other guests did the same. Apparently the hotel provides this service a lot. The only time we received poor service is when we needed a taxi. The young man staffing the front desk was involved in a lengthy personal phone conversation for at least 15 minutes. My father and I stood at the desk patiently waiting for him to finish so we could ask him to call a taxi, but he never made eye contact with us--again: we were standing right in front of him. Realizing that we weren't going to be served on our schedule, but rather his (and not knowing when), I walked to the taxi stand about a block away and secured a taxi. I'd recommend this method to anyone staying at the Hotel Milano. Parking: There is inexpensive parking in garages nearby. The management left a letter in each room encouraging guests to post comments about the hotel on this website and also displayed the hotel's 2010 TripAdvisor rating (a 4) in a frame in the elevator. A rating of four is a stretch. To be frank, I had a difficult time deciding between 2 and 3 for this review. The owner of the hotel needs to renovate the guest rooms if he/she wants to get better reviews on this site.

They have information about tours and activities and everyone we talked to was friendly and spoke good English. Our room on the third floor facing the street. The room was clean has a large closet, small refrigerator / minibar, TV, dresser, small table and a small table with two chairs.

There was no safe in the room but they did offer one behind the front desk. The hotel does not have a restaurant, but does serve a continental breakfast for $5 on the roof. There really is not much there and I would suggest strolling down the street to one of the bakeries or small restaurants for breakfast. Old San Juan has many places to eat and should be able to find something to suit your tastes. We just walked around until something caught our eye. There are many street vendors at the close by waterfront and we ate some of our meals there. You can also buy crafts and look at the cruise ships. They often have bands and entertainment in the evening. This is a very short walk from the hotel. The hotel is central to all the sights in Old San Juan.

We stayed there for 3 nights following a cruise. Though it is listed as a \"superior room\", it left a lot to be desired. (The location was excellent, however, and there are a number of really good restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner within a block, so that helped us feel a bit more comfortable with our choice.) Anyway, because it's the rainy season and humidity was high, the 4' wide room air conditioner was working hard and dripping condensation on the carpet at quite a good rate. We had to place towels under it the entire 3 nights of our visit to soak up some of the moisture. I'm pretty sure there was a lot of mold and mildew developing right next to where we slept. It was starting to smell. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for anyone with allergies. Also there was a smoke alarm (which probably also incorporated a sprinkler) in the bathroom which developed a significant leak for about a day and a half before it was repaired. (The people at the desk didn't believe us when we told them the smoke alarm was dripping (so bizarre!), so they took way too much time to check it out. I had to take a photo and show them.) The bathroom is quite tiny, and the smoke alarm is right in the middle, so you had to sit on the toilet with a towel on your lap to keep from getting wet. The wetness made the tile floor really slippery, so we had to put a pile of towels on the floor to avoid falls. The bathtub didn't have a mat inside it, so taking a shower was quite a dangerous activity as well. The bathroom is quite awkward with no place to hang used towels and only inches for bathroom counterspace. There is a hairdryer on the wall which was adequate. The small refrigerator was located in the closet which reduced the space for hanging clothing. The ice machine was one floor down, but the ice did not come in cubes, it came in sheets about the size of a magazine. They looked like big ice waffles! The ice sheets had to be broken apart by banging them on the sink in order to use the ice in any beverages. The continental breakfast on the top floor was very sparse and unappetizing looking, and cost over $5 per person besides, so we ended up at a wonderful breakfast place just up the block (Cafe Mallorca). We would NOT recommend the Milano's continental breakfast at all! It looked very pretty, but the food did not. The lobby is quite small (though charming), so if one is expecting to hang out there following a cruise, there will be no place to sit and chill until you can check in at 3 p.m. (We found a nice Mexican restaurant nearby and nursed our cervezas until check-in time.) The desk staff was very willing to store our luggage in an office, however, until we could check in. We received polite assistance taking our bags to the room. We didn't see any indication of the excellent service, warmth and friendliness that people were so complimentary about on this website. Room decor and furniture was strictly from the early 1970s. Carpet not so clean, and mold was likely an issue. Room was small and had two double beds. Beds were comfortable enough, but the room was quite cramped with the three of us (my elderly mom, my husband and myself) and our four suitcases and two carry-ons. We were expecting \"quaint\", given the age and size of the hotel, and we knew it wouldn't be up to modern hotel standards, but we weren't expecting this.

As a side note for the cruisers, some have mentioned that the hotel is walking distance from the cruise ship pier. But my cruise left from the Pan American Pier which is about a $20 cab ride away. My experience with the Hotel Milano started off very nicely. I engaged in e-mail correspondence with the owner, Mr. Juan San Emeterio. He was kind enough to offer us complementary continental breakfast each morning, which we enjoyed (more on that later). I asked him which room he'd want to stay in and he assigned me to room 408 on the top floor, which is a front room. Communication was very good and Mr. San Emeterio was very kind and accomodating. When we arrived in San Juan, we were told that our room was no longer available and that we were assigned a room on a floor one floor lower. Now that might not sound like a big deal to you, but it was to me. The Hotel Milano's views aren't great but the best by far are on the top floor. Also, the owner had personally assigned me to the room and it was prepaid, so why was I being moved? I politely requested either the promised room or at least a room on the top floor, but the desk clerk said that was \"impossible\" and told me the story about some man who wanted to be near other family members. I said that was fine, but I was assigned to the prepaid room and he was not. Also, I had just flown 3,300 miles and hadn't visited San Juan in 8 years. Finally, after searching through his computer for over 20 minutes and saying \"impossible\" about 20 times, he found a way to put us in the room next door, which was room 407. The room itself was not fancy, but was extremely clean. The furniture was spartan but was in better condition than I had expected. I was afraid that I would be kept awake by street noise, but that was not the case and my visit included a weekend stay. We had a fairly substantial problem with the air conditioner. While it worked, it didn't work very well at all. Certainly the room was cooler than it was outside of the building, but not nearly as cool as it could have been. This adversely impacted my sleep quality, which would have otherwise been just fine. Also, the plumbing was somehow crossed where the cold water was hot and the hot water was cold, but we worked around this without too much difficulty. As mentioned, the owner was kind enough to provide continental breakfast in the rooftop restaurant and it was very good, as continental breakfasts go. Even if you have to spend the $5 per person or so, it's a decent value. The variety of food included nice Puerto Rican coffees, pasteries, white or wheat toast, orange juice, pineapple juice, steamed and regular milk, an assortment of cereals, fresh fruit, crackers, yogurt, cheese etc. I didn't catch the name of the fellow who runs the restaurant, but he was an extremely nice and helpful gentleman. Be sure to tip him if you receive good service. The view from the rooftop restaurant is decent and it's a nice place to start your day. However, when I first visited the restaurant, the sign on the front door read closed and I almost left but decided to open the door anyway to find that it was actually open. So even though the sign says closed, it might not be. I also found one of the front desk clerks to have a very snotty attitude. We were a bit late checking out and he wasn't very nice about it. I also needed to print up documentation and boarding passes for my cruise but couldn't access the Wi-Fi. I though he could have been much more helpful and instead he seemed either amused by my problems or else not to care a bit. A couple of other gentlemen ended up helping me. I have mixed feelings about the Hotel Milano. The location is terrific and right in the middle of everything. I'm confident that there is no better location if you want to walk the streets of Old San Juan. While the rooms are older and basic, they are very clean. The owner seems like a nice man and I feel a bit guilty giving his hotel a so-so rating because he was so accomodating. However, the value is average, the rooms are somewhat dated, the air conditioner didn't work properly, my confirmed room was given away and I had to stand around for over 20 minutes getting situated, the plumbing was funky and one clerk had a bad attitude, in my view. So overall, I think that a 3 star rating is fair. I do recommend the Hotel Milano, but you should book it understanding what it is that you are booking. My message to the staff at the Milano is that it's a nice hotel in many ways, but there is room for improvement in the areas that I have mentioned.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGood location but that's about it.\u201d", "Author": "jjcoello", "ReviewID": "UR108567764", "Content": "We stayed here for three nights and didn't have one good nights sleep.

EXCELLENT location. I will definitely do this deal again at just a little over $100 per night. This hotel is located in between 2 gift shops and another one is across the street. The place across the street also has a cute cafe (the hotel has a rooftop cafe but it was closed when we got there). AWESOME LOCATION- high end restaurants and bars just steps away from Hotel Milano. The hotel is very European/Spain (of course b/c it is Old san juan). Positive- we checked right in, no wait. Lobby is beautiful,antique feel very clean. Not many negatives but if I could think of just one, the AC is on the 1st floor and not turned on in the other floors. So when you head to your room, it is muggy. This was not a big deal BUT some other places as you're checking in they make sure to turn the air on....well when we walked into our room, it was HOT. Not a biggie. Got in for the night at 1 AM- again, muggy once you get off the elevator, but a nice security feature was the doors to get to the rooms section on each floor are locked. We had to use a key to get into where the rooms were on the floor. What a great added safety feature. They have small safe's downstairs were my friend kept his passport n wallet. Deposit of 10bucks that u get back. Breakfast in the morning is on the roofdeck. It is very pretty..they had an outdoor seating area......around half a dozen people eating. Noise level from our room- quiet during the day, we got in at 1AM and I could hear some bar music. Once we turned on the AC I heard nothing and fell right asleep. Raices restaurant is 2 blocks away (really authentic pr cuiisne). Aquaviva restaurant is a high end (amazing food. All dishes are 30dollars. Average 90 per person) Calle de la Tanca has a cafe also btw forteleza n street. Cafe Majorica is across from the hotel- sits 10 people and has 5 small tables. Again, the location of this hotel is amazing- there is a free ferry/tram (that is always packed but eventually u can get one to do a loop tour). We did 2 different ferry/tram rides....the \"city hall\" and \"el morro\". BUT we never got off the tram, we used it for sightseeing. It was ALWAYS packed so if u r in a rush, this is not for you. Restaurants: over a dozen within walking distance. All just minutes away. The cruise dock is minutes away walking. Prices at the shops are very affordable. Wear sneakers, streets are narrow in Old San Juan and alot of cobbelstone. If you know a little spanish and want to grab the bus out of the terminal....the beach is just minutes away on the bus. The Bus station is located at the trolley stop 2. It is just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The bus is the: M3 (bus all the way to the right when u enter bus terminal). I heard the M1 also goes. It only costs 50cents. NOBODY knows English in the terminal it is a \"locals\" bus terminal. Once on the bus...it is a 5 minute ride. When the bus makes a right turn away from the water onto a one way street,u will see the beach enterance, he stops at the next corner. So u walk 2 minutes to get to the beach. The beach is called: Escambron beach (5 min bus ride from terminal) it took longer to walk to the bus and wait for the bus than it took for the bus to get us to the beach (probably 2 miles from hotel).

I had absolutely no worries when I went out at night to walk to the clubs and restaurants which were numerous and all within a 2-3 block radius of the hotel. The staff was excellent. The evening Concierge, Edwin, was extremely helpful and friendly and knew exactly the right spots to recommend for dinner or for good Salsa Music and was quick to respond to any requests for assistance. He is definitely a hotel asset. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the a/c worked very well. Downside was i only got TNT and the Weather channel on the TV- they need to expand that a little. Yes most of the time you are out enjoying the wonders of Old San Juan but would like to have seen a little news occasionally while changing for dinner. They have a continental breakfast setup on the top floor of the hotel with an excellent view of the harbor. The cost was $5.35, a good price. I only ate there once since I prefer protein at breakfast. If they added scrambled eggs and bacon I would have been there every morning even if they had raised the price some to make up for the cost. I talked to other guests and they all agreed with that assessment as well. Mainland Americans like their eggs and bacon in the morning. That is why the 4 stars for service. I had a rear room and yes it was warm when I walked in (as a previous review mentioned) but if they are such delicate creatures that they can't stand the 5 minutes it took to cool the room then they needed to go to the Sheraton where they would have paid 2-3 timesas much so they could be cool those few minutes and would have missed out on the atmosphere and charm that I found here.

As bad as that might sound, it was a perfectly decent location for a short stay - such as our one night before our cruise. You can see the sights, enjoy the town, and for a short stay it makes for a perfectly acceptable place to get some rest. I *would* recommend it to others in a similar situation.

Several hotels had been recommended by friends/travel agents etc, but all were fully booked or had a 2-night minimum stay. We stayed at the Hotel Milano based on previous Trip Advisor reviews, and I was not disappointed. The hotel is located in a perfect location, right in the middle of the action of Old San Juan. We spent the entire day just walking around, exploring the area. Within walking distance are numerous restaurants, bars, shops and countless beautiful historic buildings. We didn't explore the forts, but could have walked to them. I booked a double/double room at the front of the hotel, and that is exactly what we got. The room was quite large, and had a bar fridge and a small kitchen table with 2 chairs. We didn't use the table, but definitely used the fridge (there are grocery stores/Walgreens etc within walking distance, which was perfect for picking up fresh fruit, other snacks and bottled water). The furniture in the room was basic and dated, but I found it to be very clean. There was an air freshener in the room which was quite strong, so we just closed the lid on it. The windows were very large, and all opened, which made the room very bright, and provided some fresh air (the hotel does have rooms with no windows). The previous review mentioned problems with moisture from the air conditioner - our room didn't have any moisture problems. The air condiitoner was a bit louder than most, but was nice to have in the room. Like the rest of the room, the bathroom was also large in size, but quite basic. It did have a full tub, instead of just a shower. A lot of the other reviews have mentioned the bar noise at night. If you are a very light sleeper, or want a more resort-type stay, then Hotel Milano is not for you. As I mentioned earlier, it is located in the middle of the action and the music from the bars played most of the night. When I got up at 5am, the music had stopped, but there were still people partying in the street. When I left the hotel at 5:45am, they had gone. The noise on the street didn't bother me (I actually wished I was out there joining them!), and the air conditioner provided a nice white noise to muffle the music. If you don't want the noise, but do want to stay in the area, then maybe a room at the back of the building might be quieter? The best attribute of Hotel Milano is definitely the staff and the service they provide. We arrived at the hotel about 11am - way before the check-in time. We were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was ready. We dealt with the front desk several times, and every person we dealt with was friendly and helpful. We were given street maps, restaurant suggestions (and even a menu to look at), and plastic cutlery to eat our snacks on the plane, among other things. In the hotel lobby, there is a computer and printer, which is available for all guests to use - and free. I was able to print our boarding passes the night before, and which saved some time at the airport. When our cab arrived early the next morning, the man working at the front desk even helped to take our suitcases to the street. When I stay in hotels, I mostly look for cleanliness and location - I'm not looking for the flash. Hotel MIlano is not a 5-star hotel, but then you're also not paying 5-star prices. If you're looking for good value, a great location and amazing staff, then consider staying here.

Although it says the rooms aren't available until 4pm, we were able to check in and go to our room at 1 pm on Saturday when we arrived. We stayed until 11am the following Sunday. Other than sleeping and showering, we probably spent 45 minutes total in our room. We had room 408 which is in the front and a little larger than the ones in the back with windows that face the street. I know that people complain abut the front rooms being noisy, but we were not bothered by it (although we did come back to our room sometime after 2am after having several drinks). We slept very well. The room itself was nice and clean. One thing that bothered us is that there is no safe in the room and a sign on the door that says something like \"we are not responsible for valuables left in the room\" but they did have safes in the lobby you can use. We did not use the lobby safe and hid any valuables in our room - there were no issues regardless. The staff was very friendly and gave us some good choices of restaurants for dinner. We woke up too late to try the breakfast on the terrace - I think it closes at 10? The location of this hotel is amazing! It is centrally located to all the great spots in Old San Juan. We were able to walk around the whole area knowing we were not too far from the hotel if we needed a break. I know there are several nicer hotels in the same area, but we wanted to spend less than $150 for the night, and Hotel Milano did not disappoint. Next time we visit, we will probably stay somewhere nicer, but nearby (if we're not on a tight budget). We would like a hotel with a pool and a restaurant/bar in the hotel. Here's a brief review of what we did (if you're interested): We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel for $19 +$1 per bag. We then walked to El Jibarito restaurant for lunch and it was awesome (mofongo is delicious!) - I highly recommend going there. We then walked to the pier area and visited the visitors center to get a map and a free rum punch. We walked along the waterfront and Paseo de la Princesa to El Morro Fortress. El Morro is absolutely beautiful and picturesque - I highly recommend going here. We spent about 2 hours walking around the fort itself and on the beautiful lawn. Afterwards we got a couple mojitos and good tapas at a restaurant right near the hotel (it is next to Dragonfly), went back to shower, then went to dinner at Cafe Puerto Rico (it was down the street from the hotel, the food was good). Afterwards we went to a Dragonfly to have a drink, and then (around 11) we walked around trying to find the \"nightlife\" but it wasn't too happening nearby. We walked to the pier area again, and this is where it was happening. We walked around the Paseo de la Princesa again, went to a couple bars, and eventually went back to our hotel and passed out. ****DO NOT WEAR HIGH HEEL SHOES IF YOU PLAN ON DRINKING*** The cobblestone streets get very difficult to walk on as the night goes on, and I fell on our way back to the hotel and I fractured a bone in my foot and messed up a tendon there - I was on crutches the entire cruise.

I had found the Milano on this web site and read many of the reviews before deciding to book the room. I must admit I was a bit concerned about the potential noise problems listed by some, but that turned out to not be the case. Even though our room was on the front of the hotel, and there were plenty of late night partiers in the street, the noise did not keep us up, or even awaken us during the night. As a matter of fact, I slept great. I do want to point out how helpful Carlos was at the desk upon our arrival on Saturday afternoon. He was very helpful getting us checked in and making dinner recommendations. I had previously heard of a place just a block down from the Milano and asked him about it. He said it was okay, but if we wanted the best that San Juan had to offer in terms of local cuisine, then La Raices was the place to go. And he was right. It was fantastic. (I plan to enter a review for it as well.) He offered some additional advice for lunch the next day while we waited for the ship to sail. Overall, Carlos certainly helped to make our stay very pleasant. He was by far the friendliest person I have ever encountered at the desk of a hotel and I have traveled to every inhabited continent. So there is no problem with the hotel staff not wanting to be of assistance. Our ship did not depart until late in the day so we checked our luggage at the hotel and went for lunch. When we got back the Milano staff called a taxi for us, waited outside for it to arrive so that we did not have to since it was quite hot, loaded all of our luggage into the taxi (and there was quite a bit, we always overpack for cruises) and come in a got us when all was ready to go. I did not get the name of the gentleman who was handling luggage that day, but if a copy of this makes it to the Milano, it was on the afternoon of May 10. This gentleman was also working in the small roof-top restaurant when we had breakfast. Speaking of the breakfast, it was good, even if it was essentially a continental breakfast.

The Saturday night we arrived, I was told we were \"upgraded\" to a larger room #407- you guessed it - a front room. All was quiet until 10:30pm when the vibration of the bass and music from the club next door literally shook the windows and floor until 4:30am. No joke. This was on top of blaring car radios, screaming revelers, and other street noise. Ear plugs were useless. The night clerk was unable to move us to a quieter room because the hotel was completely booked. In the morning, I asked why were were given an unwanted \"upgrade\" to a noisy room, ignoring my \"guaranteed\" rear room. I told them that had I known they would not have honored this guarantee I would have booked a different hotel. I was not given an answer as to why the room was switched but they offered to give us a slight discount for the inconvenience. Here are Pros and Cons of Hotel Milano. It's a very affordable Hotel and a decent room for the price. It's a great location in Old San Juan and is literally walking distance to the Carnival Cruise Terminal. (An easy, downhill 10 minute walk with wheeled luggage.) The many other T.A. reports of the excessive noise are no exaggeration. If you plan on partying all night or can sleep through anything, then this is probably a good choice if you want to be in OSJ, I would, however, beware of their guarantees of a quiet, rear room due to my experience with this bait and switch. I was told by the front desk that the rear rooms are, in fact, quieter however this may only be relative since the hotel is next door to a club.

They lock your suitcases with a chain and give you a claim ticket, so you can go shop, eat, or see sights in Old San Juan. The lobby is a little small for hoards of suitcases, and everyone tries to check out at once, so do give yourself an extra 10 minutes if you need to catch a flight. The rooms are basic. We stayed in 309 one night and 409 on our return. 409 was nicer and less noisy, although we were in 309 on a Saturday night. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Nothing special, but perfectly fine. They have a continental breakfast on the fifth floor (not included, but only about $5.50 per person - ask for a bottle of water on your way out (free) so you don't have to buy one while touring Old Town). Also, they have a computer in the lobby which you can use for free to check e-mail or print out a boarding pass.", "Date": "February 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cAre they kidding!!!\u201d", "Author": "imleavinnow", "ReviewID": "UR24106884", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Milano for one night prior to boarding a cruise ship the following day.

(We had paid for the full three nights months ago). Funnily enough, the lady at the front desk did not seemed surprised at all that we were disappointed with our room- as if this were a common event for her.

Then we headed out to beautiful Old San Juan after waiting for the elevator with a \"professional\". (nope, not kidding).

It was small, but we are used to cruise ship cabins so that was ok cause it was cheery and clean. The next morning there was persons to greet us in the restaurant with a nice selection of things from toast, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurts, muffins, milk,coffee, and juice to start off our day. It was a balmy morning so we choose to sit on the balcony to eat. In leaving for the day the front desk answered all our questions we needed to get on the right bus to get us where we wanted to go. It was lovely just to walk to the awesome 400 year old fort of San Christobal and walk to the many plaza's that surrounded the Hotel. Many stores available for shopping and a great restraunt called the Parrot Club for great Puerto Rican dishes. Unfortunately the Milano Hotels dinning room was closed while we were there for our stay so we ate at nearby restaurants which was no problem. Also we were walking distance to Burger King and McDonalds. Taxi stands were on the corner, but we found it enjoyable just to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Once we took the trolley from San Christobal to the other Fort called El Morro and the trolley was free. It goes from fort to fort which by the way was only $5.00 a person entrance to both forts. At the end of each day our room at the hotel was waiting for us with clean towels for a hot shower and clean made up bed. I had read in this web sight postings that the Hotel being next to the locals clubs at night could become noisy, and yes it was a couple of times, so I took ear plugs just in case, but we were so tired from the day of sight seeing we crashed and it really didn't bother us. The last bit of great news for the cruisers who read this and that is you can just walk over to the peirs and check in to your cruise ship with no problem. Also for 25 cents pp you can get on the ferry right at the same place to take you across the bay where you get a taxi for $6.00 to take you to the Barardi Rum Distillery that gives you a free tour and free rum drinks which my husband really enjoyed.

The main advantage of the hotel, in my opinion, was its location. It was great to be within walking distance of so many of the sights in Old San Juan. Also, there is a free bus to El Morro, which we took advantage of while there. The hotel is also within a few blocks of 2 of the main cruise piers. Unfortunately, our ship departed from the third! However, it was a short taxi drive, and not a problem. We booked a room in the front of the hotel, as we had read that the rear rooms were smaller and some lacked windows that could be opened, which sounded a little claustrophobic to me. The room itself was quite adequate and clean, though a bit small, as we expected in an older hotel such as this. Our main problem was the noise from the street, which continued until 4AM both nights we stayed. Part of this was our own fault, as we left the windows open. However, the air-conditioner was just 'On or off' - with it off, the room was very hot, but with it on it was frigid - so we opted to leave it off. It may have helped with the noise to have the unit turned on, but I'm not sure we had enough blankets for that! The restaurant on the roof was very nice, although the views are not as scenic as the photos, as there is a lot of construction in the area. The food was good, and so was the service - so it was enjoyable. However, the complimentary morning breakfast was very minimal - beverages, packaged donuts, and boxed cereals. It was a start to the day, though - and we found several nice restauarants nearby for a more substantial meal.

We were near clubs, restaurants, within walking distance to the piers and tourist center as well as parks, churches, and other major attractions. if we wanted to go to the beach, a taxi stand was around the corner, or two small blocks over, is the public bus depot to take us to any of the major beaches we deisred to go to. The hotel is secure, and an attendant is always at the desk for any assistance, including directions, maps or change for the soda machine.

We paid $135. per night for a room with a queen size bed. For the same money we have stayed in better hotels in Rome and other locations so the price seemed comparatively steep. Other alternatives in Old San Juan were almost twice as much. First the negatives; the lobby was fine but certainly not quant. The elevator had a strange odor that we later discovered was coming from the upper floor kitchen. The room smelled of disinfectant but this faded over time. The room was furnished in dated, motel style furniture. The cable TV had 9 channels, most were Spanish speaking. There was a charge for local and 800 calls. We had three small windows at chest height that did open. The view was the plain walls from different buildings. Parking is not provided and is a couple of blocks away at a cost of $12.50 per day. We had been told that the rooms in front had larger windows but these rooms were $155, too high for this grade hotel. The continental breakfast was disappointing. There were pastries wrapped in plastic, similar to what you would find in a vending machine. Wheat and white bread were provided and a toaster for making toast with cream cheese and jellies. There was cereal in their store containers that you could fill with the provided milk. Less than fresh fruit, different juices, and coffee completed the assortment. It was strange that plates, utensils and cups were all plastic considering the location in the restaurant. The outdoor deck was filled with rather shabby plants and the view was of the unsightly roofs of the surrounding buildings. There was a view of the mountains in the distance. On the plus side this is a good location, walking distance to all of Old San Juan. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room and bathroom were of good size, the bathroom was clean and modern. The closet was large and could hold a few bags. The air conditioner worked well and there was a small refrigerator. The halls were quiet. In summary, there are not a lot of hotels to choose from in Old San Juan. The prices are comparatively high and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a lot for your money.

If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not into the insulating mega-hotel/resorts in the Condado (tourist area near the ocean), or the all-inclusive, all-expensive giant resorts out of town, your best choice is to stay in the wonderful, lively, funky Old San Juan (Viejo San Juan). In OSJ you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have too many choices either, but El Milano worked for us, far be it from perfect. First and foremost, contrary to its self-description, it is in no way, shape or form upscale. I would describe it as solidly middle-scale (Compare it to El Convento to see what I mean.) In spite of obvious daily efforts to keep the place clean there is also plenty of evidence of maintenance delayed too long: nearly every acoustic tile on our room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dropped ceiling was stained, chipped, or askew. There were also enormous bubbles of paint, signs of chronic water damage, on our exterior wall. And the mid-80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the room could definitely use a little updating! It was, however, basically clean, quiet enough, and safe. And speaking of our room, it was very small and claustrophobic. As described by other reviewers, there were no real windows, just two 12x12 glass bricks (see photo) high up. The new-looking air conditioner, though lacking any kind of thermostat, was effective at cooling but not at dehumidifying. Eventually we discovered, beneath the shorty curtains to either side of the glass bricks, tiny crank-open windows. Once we got those open, propped the curtains out of the way on the cranks, and started the A/C, we were able to achieve a comfy balance of temperature and humidity. We really felt the absence of that basic of tropical amenity, a ceiling fan! Also note: washcloths are NOT provided, nor are they available upon request. Extra hand towels were unstintingly forthcoming, however, and did the job. Also note: in five days, housekeeping never once replaced our bathroom glasses, and nor did they ever wipe off those little dots of toothpaste that unavoidably land on the mirror. Also as pointed out by others, breakfast in the roof-top Panorama Restaurante is very basic, but adequate to get you going, and you can take it al fresco with a bit of a view of the harbor and the flight path into Isla Grande\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small airport, if you enjoy watching little planes buzz back and forth. IF YOU WANT BETTER COFFEE, request espresso, put it in a full-size cup, and add hot milk (routinely provided) to make Puerto Rican caf\u00c3\u00a9 con leche! To the restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great credit, they handled a lunch for 12 we hosted there excellently, and the guests all enjoyed their truly Puerto Rican-style food (the mofongo is particularly good.) The rest of the hotel staff seemed pleasant but I would not describe them as exceptionally warm and friendly one way or the other. Juan San Emeterio, the very present and available owner, seemed business-like. The best thing about El Milano is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredible location. You can easily walk to all of OSJ, including El Morro and San Cristobal historic sites. Each evening we walked around the harbor along the Paseo de la Princessa (have dinner at the outdoor La Princessa restaurant down there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c food\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great!) or entertained ourselves in the shops and restaurants within the old city.

We figured for one night, we could deal with the full-size bed. After having stayed there, I feel one night is the most we could have dealt with. The room was clean, but it was very small, had no windows (they had not told us that), and the AC was weak. There was a hint of cigarette smell, but we didn't feel that it reeked. I am sure every room is different, though, and some probably do reek.

The rest of the hotel was very hot and stuffy. Each room has its own A/C unit, but ours was just moving around hot air until we called down to complain. In response to our call, the man at the front desk said he would send up a remote that would make the room cooler - well, he did just that! We had to walk to the elevator closest to our room, and when the doors opened, there lay the remote, by itself, on the floor of the empty elevator. We had to use that remote to make our A/C blow cold air, and then ship it back down to the front desk using the same empty-elevator technique. Hardly 4 star service!

The room was just fine- spacious enough, small windows, strong A/C, clean. Basically, it's all about location! You really can't beat it- it's central to everything. A couple of times, we forgot things while sightseeing, and all we had to do was trot back to the hotel, and ten minutes later, we were on the go again! The rooftop restaurant is pretty subpar though- have a drink up there for the view, but don't waste your money on the entrees. really, it's kind of a rip-off. We decided to eat there because we were dead tired- but I definitely would not do so again.", "Date": "April 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto Canada", "Title": "\u201cSan Juan's Goodwill Ambassador ! !\u201d", "Author": "Esquires", "ReviewID": "UR3402808", "Content": "April 25-2005 This is a follow up review to our previous pre-review ( see below ) of our stay at Hotel Milano in San Juan Puerto Rico. If there is one hotel that deserves recognition as the \" Goodwill Ambassador \" to San Juan, it is the management and staff of Hotel Milano in Old San Juan. ( Note to the San Juan Tourist Office; please make a well deserved notation on your files regarding Hotel Milano ) From the moment we checked in, the welcome, the rooms, and the overall impression and location of this hotel gives you the feeling of care and appreciation for their guests. We stayed for 2 nights on two different weeks and it felt like \" home \". From the reception, the spacious rooms, dinner under the stars at the 5th floor restaurant/patio, it was an absolute delight. ( a feeling that was shared by all the hotel guests we met during our stay ) We highly recommend the Hotel Milano to all who visit Old San Juan, be it a short or long visit, you will not be disappointed; it is an absolute delight!
