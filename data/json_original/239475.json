Unique, querky, slightly old-fashioned, and utterly in keeping with the whole \"decaying renaissance grandeur\" that is Venice! Despite being at the height of the season, it was peaceful. Our room over-looked the quiet little canal which - to our surprise - was on the \"gondola route\" so we had fun and a birds-eye view, watching the occaional passing gondola: got some goods photos, and one boat had an opera singer on board - when he finished his song he was surprised when we applauded from our window! It is tricky to find - and had it not been for another review we read, we would have had problems. The best route it to go to Rialto, get directions for the Disney Store (only about 3 mins walk) and then take the alley way down the right hand side of the store, over the bridge into the campo Maria fava (you see the big church infront of you). Take the alley to the righthand side of the church (there is a sign for the hotel cavena on the wall), turn right and its under the little archway. The staff are friendly and helpful: desk is open 24/7, but not all of the staff speak english, but most are fine. We read a review about the breakast not being up to much so we went elsewhere the first two days. This was a mistake! On the 3rd day (due to tiredness) we decided to try it - it was great and the best deal for the money that we found. No fry up (but then you dont expect that on the continent) however there was ham and pinapple, fruit juice, tea, coffee,choice of cereals, bread rolls, coissants (the Italian sort with apricot jam inside), cheese etc as much as you wanted. The rooms are quite basic - but very clean and with everything you need - hairdryer, fan, hanging space, tv, reading lamp. Only thing you could want would be tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was shared, but we were surprised tht this wasnt a problem and everything is spotlessly clean. The only slight downside was that, this is a \"working canal\" and around 7am the \"bin men\" come round in their boat collecting the rubbish which can be a bit noisy - but actually the fact that the canal was used by the community did make it feel as though we were staying in \"real venice\" ! The staff were very helpful and despite us vacating the room around 9am on our last day, were happy to look after our cases until 7pm when we needed to leave for our flight. We had a great time. It's a good location once you find it, easy to walk to everything and access the vaporettos. Sweet and atmospheric - and great value for money.

Since the lady working at the front desk didn't speak English, we tried to translate and explain that the sheets were dirty and ask if we could get new ones, as well as towels. She told us that since we were only staying 2 nights, we couldn't get new sheets. After trying our best to explain the stain was old and not from us, she stormed off, grabbed a sheet and 2 towels, threw it in our room and slammed the door on us only after cussing the whole way in Italian. Later on we realized that they had actually given us towels after all and just put them in a different spot. We left for dinner and after returning noticed a set of the towels were gone. We asked the owner at the front desk if someone came into our room and he said yes, he could come into our room anytime because he's the owner and called us liars about the towels. He also mentioned that if we want clean sheets we could stay in a 4 star hotel. STAY AWAY!

The entrance is down at the end of what looks like a dark alley but in fact is one of Venice many charming streets. It was great value for the money we paid and the room we stayed in was awesome. It overlooked one of the canals and was probably the biggest hotel room we stayed in during our entire trip through England, France, and Italy. The entire hotel is slowly sinking and is nowhere near level anymore. The ceilings and floors are trued up with wedges and at times it feels like you are trying walk properly in a slanted floor amusement park fun-house but I think that just adds to its charm. For the buildings age it was in surprisingly good shape. The staff were in the process renovating parts of it and expanding the hotel but we never heard any construction noise at all The daily breakfast that was prepared in their dining room was beyond our expectations. Even though our stay in Venice was marred by some of the worst weather I have ever seen and for the most part we were forced to spend too much of our time in our hotel room we still talk fondly of Hotel Caneva, the great breakfast, and watching La Ruota Della Fortuna in our hotel room, waiting for the rain to stop.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence, Italy", "Title": "\u201cAwful Management, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "youngLTtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR61132763", "Content": "I tried to book the hotel online but their website wasn't working so I emailed the hotel in order to reserve a room and they bumped up their March price to the April price and refused to sell it to me to the genuine price.

The Hotel Caneva was one of the more reasonably priced hotels we found in Venice and after doing much research via Trip Advisor as well as other travel sites, we felt confident that it was a good choice. We were not disappointed. While the hotel is not overly fancy, it was very clean and simple with several rooms overlooking a small canal, which was just delightful in the mornings as we opened our shutters to greet the gondoliers and taxi drivers. The office staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the location could not be better for getting around St. Marks or hopping over to the Rialto Bridge area. The pros: * Superb location and great canal views (from certain rooms) * Friendly office staff * Clean rooms * Decent breakfast with juices, pastries and cereals as well as coffee/tea. No hot items though. * Very affordable (for Venice!) and the individual air conditioning units worked beautifully. The cons: * Smoking was permitted in the lobby so it did smell like cigarettes (and as an ex-smoker, this bothered me a little.) * IF you don't like morning activity/noise outside your windows, don't face the canal. We loved it but I could see how it might be bothersome if you are looking to sleep in! Overall, we loved this hotel and the location,despite it being very simple. Would definitely stay there again.

The water from faucets in our bathroom did not get very hot, not even after 5 minutes of letting the water run. So I had my shower in the a shower located down the hall. Here the water got VERY hot.

Easy to find, simply take the boat to Rialto bridge and follow the directions from the hotel. Simple, clean rooms, breakfast was not all that great if you got there late! So if you want to eat, get up early! Bruno, one of the guys at the desk, likes to push his tours on you but simply say no thanks and he is good to go! All in all, good value for Venice in August.
