Great for the deal we got through cheapcarribean.com but the staff was a bit uninformed about the benefits we were to receive from the deal and gave us misinformation on where/what to redeem within the resort. We ended up paying an extra $50 on a dinner because we thought we could redeem a credit there, but couldn't because the staff told us we could go there. Other than that, the staff had great recommendations for great places to go locally in Old San Juan and Lucillo.The hotel is about 30 minutes from Old San Juan, so plan on renting a car if you want to sight see. I got a mass of bug bites while staying here. The others in my room got much less, but did have some bites. We had friends staying in another room that had none, which leaves me to believe it couldn't have been beach fleas, or something else from the environment, but from the room we stayed in.

My friend with COPD couldn't even visit our room. The little couch in the room was covered in black mold. Black mold covered the AC vent. Very strong odor. Was sick by the 3rd of 7 days. Was difficult to get moved even though the resort seemed fairly empty. Was told it was not possible to speak to a manager when I asked...unheard of. Although the resort, pool and grounds are gorgeous, it doesn't look like anything has been repaired since opening. If something becomes broken, ripped or frayed, it just stays that way and gets worse. Tiles missing throughout pool area, many jets in pool not working, frayed chair arms in fancy restaurants, bent up wall sconce (light) in room, fridge dented and rusty, ice machine in disrepair, and did I mention the mold and smell. Pool had mildew around edges and on lounges. They didn't tell us the casino was closed when we booked. We were just looking for a resort on the beach with a casino and a nice pool. They weren't willing to comp us anything for that; not even parking. Who would have thought we would have to pay $15/day to park the rental car when they were in the middle of nowhere with so much space. We were dissatisfied with the beach part also. We didn't swim there because of all the seaweed. Mostly dirt/rocks. Still, it was a nice place to sit and look out at the ocean. We didn't know in advance that we would have to park 1/4 mile from room. They had golf cart shuttles and they said all we had to do was call. They didn't say call and wait for a half hour. Totally sucks when it's raining. They also don't tell you that when you call for a shuttle, they would be rude. I bought first round of island drinks for our gang of 4 when we arrived. Because this cost $40 plus tip, it was the last round we had at their bar. Then we are given some grief by a cart driver about bringing a cooler to our room......afraid we might be bringing fairly priced drinks in. We were warned, \"don't let the manager see you.\" If only we could have found a manager!!!! Friends were double charged on their credit card, but ours was fine. By the way, you don't know until arrival that they put a $500 hold per room on your credit card. The only thing we saw that was well maintained was the lobby and the landscaping except the weed filled planter boxes that lined our balconies. Restaurant service was poor, but it seemed due to inappropriate training by management. New management could possibly save this resort for the future. Right now it seems like it is going out of business fast. .......and did I mention the mold....it's just not a very healthy place.

We travel the world, so maybe our expectations have been \"molded\" by other experiences, but our decision has been made to return. The RL category comes with butler service, and we had the BEST!! (Tony R, our butler assigned at checkin, was awesome and provided us with anything we mentioned, going so far as to bring a stepstool from his home for us to use for access to the room's jacuzzi and pool cabanas. Made reservations for us, researched and set up outside resort accessibility needs,anticipated our needs/wishes, followed up and followed thru on requests[even on his day off!]) Angel M, another butler who also managed the Red Level pool and cabanas, was also great! He made sure we had cabanas reserved for every day of our stay; and even got special permission to bring a cart to our door for pickup when it rained. Manny,bartender at Red Level pool, is also a \"great find\". He serviced our drink and snack needs, and provided help after his shift ended when he saw we needed it.

My main complaint was we did not get into our room i=until 6:30 PM!!! We were anxious to !, unpack and begin our vacation and were forced to \"loiter\" in the lounge for about 5 hours. Literally the most ridiculous check in ever!!! On our last day at this resort before going to a hotel in San Juan, we asked for a late check out and the girl on the phone said \"absolutely not When I explained we could not check in to our new hotel til 3 pm, she said \"oh well, not my problem\" and hung up. Then I found out with my MAS card I was allowed one anyway. So basically they can kill your first day and last day by checking you in late and checking you out early. It was a joke .Also, DO upgrade to the Red Level. It will entitle you to free breakfast buffet, the Red Level pool (ages 10 and up only), cocktails (wine and beer, soda & light snacks) early evenings in the Red Level Lounge, All nice perks. This resort is away from EVERYTHING other than the rainforest. Ok, so the grounds and the outdoors is very beautiful. The pools are a bit above average and clean. The Bali beds are awesome but you have to reserve them in advance. The room was disappointing. It wasn't horrible, but definitely less than I expected from this resort. A bit outdated, no fridge, no microwave. The A/C did work well, many resorts have crappy A/C, not this one though. Expect to do a lot of walking. There are golf carts but good luck getting a ride on one. We were downright ignored on many occasions when there was room for more riders. They didn't even bother to stop, sometimes they looked at us, and just kept going with no explanation. When we did manage to catch a ride, it seemed like they'd stop and just let others pile on when there was hardly room, but as I said, other times there would be on or 2 people on there and plenty of room for 6 more and they'd ignore us. So, basically don't count on a ride in the hot sun from the jerks driving the carts. The beach is ok, not much to it. The water is not clear enough to snorkel or anything. It is a bit rocky too. The breakfast buffet was not bad. It is a typical buffet of fruits, meats, cheeses, cereals, eggs, pastries, etc. GET THERE EARLY. The people are VULTURES. Buffet goers are rude, greedy and always running to get the food as if it is going to disappear. Stand your ground and be a jerk if you have to. They cut in front of you, reach over you and all kinds of stuff. This is no reflection on the resort, but rude people as a whole.Asian Bisto NAMI was AWFUL! Also get the MAS card, it entitles you to some discounts here and there I suppose.Service was pretty good, drinks were good, but the food was disgusting. There is no casino anymore. We found this out days after booking but just a few days before we were scheduled to depart. So we played down the road at another resort. Later into our trip we left Gran Melia and stayed in San Juan. Overall, not a bad place, but customer service is lacking. I will say that Angel who works in the RED LEVEL lounge was the best and has outstanding customer service.

We had a garden room, about 500 meters away from pool and reception, but the walk was nice and the room was very spacious. The balcony was not in a good condition and the room was not very clean. A pitty! I got a glass splinter in my foot, which was painfull, walking around the room. The room it self was nicely decorated, just not clean and the second day, we did get one towel (for a family of 4?!) It was again 4 the next day. The pool was gigantic and we really enjoyed it. The park and the main building were nice too. It is a bit of a shame, that the management is not working well, because this place could be a gem, I think. Breakfast was ok- join the Melia Club for free(best to register online at home) bring your club number and get 50% off the price for breakfast. You can not sit outside, which I love and it was pretty cold inside, so a light jacket is a good idea. The hotel is close to many attractions. We did a day trip to Culebra, which was great, visited El Yunquee rainforest, Luquillo and Sevens Seas Beach. You definitly need a car unless you plan to spend all the time in the resort. At the pool, there was a party atmosphere with a DJ in the afternoon (not sure if this was only because of Easter) and very loud music, which was fun, but one could also find more quiet places. If you like large pool with a bar in the pool, great landscape and are not too much into cleanness and do not mind a service between mediocre and incurious- it is a nice hotel.

The room was spacious and clean (we just got the Garden View Junior Suite. Could upgrade to Red Service but we didn't want to pay extra.) They have the biggest pool I've ever seen. And it was cleaned and beautiful too. The ocean was calm, but the beach was non existent. It was rocky and had a lot of shells which hurt my feet. However, my kids are more into the pool, so we did not care too much. (About 5 lights down on the main road, there is Luquillo beach, which is OK (much better than the one in front of the hotel). There arean't a lot of restaurants at the resorts, but the food was good and the prices were very reasonable. We spent a lot more at the other islands. Plus, we got $50 resort credit for food so in the end it wasn't that expensive. We tried to eat out one night, but the bill was the same as in the resort, and the food was bad. So we decided to eat at the resort for the rest of the trip. Services are genearlly nice. Except the services at the grill bar near the pool was extremely slow and the waters weren't very friendly.

This property is truly beautiful with a great beach, great pool, and very well taken care of grounds. The snorkeling right from the beach is easy and there are lots of fish and a reef (which is a decent swim out). The concierge department is utterly fantastic and helped connect me to the information I needed to have a great trip. The front desk was not that great - just average. A car is an absolute must if you stay at this property. Here is where the details come in. It is a 5 minute drive just to leave the property to do anything at all. It is at least a 15 minute drive to get to a decent restaurant. The beaches are 20 minutes away (aside from the one on property), the rainforest 20 minutes, San Juan 40 minutes, Fajardo 35 minutes, etc. So read between the lines and understand you will be in a car if you stay here. The restaurants on site are mediocre at best and typically expensive as they have a captive audience. It is $23 a person for breakfast brunch and the food is average at best. The lines for the omelets are long and the rest of the food got boring by day 2. To leave the hotel property is a 5 minute car ride just to get to the main road. Taxi's will add up quickly as there are not any great eating options until you hit the 15 minute mark driving from the hotel. We were there a week where it was 100% occupied and couldn't believe that the only lunch option was the pool bar/restaurant. They advertise that they have 5 restaurants on property but only one is ever open for breakfast and nothing but that one is open for lunch except for weekends - even when they were 100% full! Also, the tours are very expensive and a bit of a rip off. They have a dedicated tour operator and they are very pricey. We took our rental car and drove 20 minutes to the rain forest. It was free to get in and we spent two half days playing in the waterfalls, hiking, enjoying the scenery, etc. This is a US National Forest so it was totally safe and easy to navigate. Total cost of the day $0. The tour was running in the $70 range per person. Same with snorkeling. There is snorkeling everywhere on this island. So drive to a beach and play around. Cost $0. Tours ranged upwards to $115. Now we did do tours. We just didn't book through hotel. We booked direct and drove to the tour places. We drove to San Juan twice and played around for the day there. Lots to do in the old town and the food was great. Parking was easy but lots and lots of traffic so be prepared. All in all, Puerto Rico was a great place to take the family. Not sure we will stay at the same place again as we saw the things we wanted to on the Northeast part of the island. I would recommend the hotel for folks that are okay with getting around on their own. I wouldn't want to be stuck there all week without a car unless you are a beach/pool person or family and are okay to just play and relax in a chair and in the water all day.

Went on a bioluminescent kayak excursion one night and a catamaran snorkel trip on the Spread Eagle II the next day. Both were great but were about a 45 minute drive from the hotel. The area outside the hotel property is very depressed. We were upset to see dead dogs on the sides of the road and hungry, abandoned dogs wandering around looking for food and water. The staff at the hotel was very helpful we found that they did what they had to (maybe not as quickly as some people would like) but we really didn't wait for much. We found that even if you had been waiting in line for something and you finally were getting waited on, if their cell phones rang you waited while they took their personal calls.

They kept changing the time they were going to open, gave us a handwritten menu and then told us they didn't have the steak we ordered from their menu (who writes things on their menu that they don't have?).

The hotel staffs are not friendly especially those who works at the front desk. The checkout process is manually intensive and can take up to 45 minutes. The casino has been closed although the hotel website still mentions about the \"boutique casino\" on site. When we inquire about this at the front desk, the staff did not offer any apology and suggested that we take a cab for $25 to go to nearby Wyndham hotel for the casino.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Braunfels, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot totally the hotel's fault....but big improvement needed.\u201d", "Author": "zinniaqueen", "ReviewID": "UR127694562", "Content": "Okay, Okay if it had not rained maybe it would have been a slightly different story. We arrived on a Friday for one night prior to a cruise the next day so we were not on an all inclusive plan and I paid a reasonably inexpensive rate for the one night excluding taxes and food etc, so maybe I shouldn't complain too much. The rain came down and it kept coming after we arrived - the resort was inundated with water, the public areas were flooding, the golf course was under 6 inches of water, the golf carts could barely get through the ankle deep water to take guests to their rooms, the pool area shut down and everyone was moving to any dry public area or back to their rooms. I asked one of the staff if it rained like this often and he said yes, and considering it's on the side of the island where the rain forest is located, then I would assume that this was not an isolated event. Check in took forever as there were only 2 clerks, occasionally three to help and there was an obnoxious group of 5 people ahead of me demanding that their room be ready at noon when they arrived and not at 3:00pm when guest rooms are typically ready. First, the rooms were large and very nice for the most part and the air conditioning worked great - we didn't have a view of anything but the tops of some trees as we were on the 2nd floor and the balcony railings are concrete so you can't see through them and if you're short, almost not over them either. Our sink was plugged and my lamp by my side of the bed was out but the room had a refrigerator or so we thought. It was the kind of refrigerator that if you moved anything in it, like the snacks or little bottles of alcohol, it would trigger a charge to the room. That information was clearly stated on the front of the refrigerator, so basically you couldn't put anything of your own in the fridge without triggering a charge. If you wanted ice, you had to troop over to the lobby which was a bit of a hike for most rooms. Since we were not on an all inclusive plan and the resort is miles from a reasonable restaurant, we were a captive audience and the only restaurant open at 1:00pm during the rainstorm was the buffet at $18.00 per person. It was the most expensive buffet for the mediocre quality of food I could have imagined. We did have a car so later that day we made a trip to KFC and Walmart for dinner about 6 miles from the resort. We figured we were going to be eating fairly well on the cruise, so dieting this evening was the thing to do. The rain stopped probably around 430pm and everyone headed for the pool and the beach but by this time, the hotel had foolishly let much of the bar staff go home assuming the rain would not stop, so there was no bar open by the pool and the only bar available was in the lobby. It was three deep trying to get a weak tasting rum punch plus it was noisy and definitely an older Spring Break crowd which is more obnoxious than the college kids. I can't believe I said that! The staff who manned the valet parking were great, the vacation concierge was helpful as was most of the staff who was on duty. I just can't say much about the front desk clerks who spent their time walking back and forth to the back office and talking incessantly to the disgruntled guests. It took me 30 minutes to even talk to a check in agent and I was the only person in line. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful with lots of tropical plants blooming and the beach was nice though not huge. And the pool would have been perfect if there had just been a place to get a drink without going to the lobby for it. I don't usually pan a hotel and I like the Melia chain in Spain but I would first consider staying closer to town in the Condado beach area if you have to have the beach or the Spring break experience. I personally thought Old San Juan was lovely especially if you are just there one night and the beach and pool are not a big factor and I like the historic atmosphere of the Old Town and the Fort. Lots of nice shops and load of restaurants have bloomed in this old area which is constantly under improvement.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara Falls, ON", "Title": "\u201cLovely resort right on the ocean\u201d", "Author": "CanukTripper", "ReviewID": "UR127661636", "Content": "We came with friends to the Gran Melia at Coco Beach, and the whole atmosphere was wonderful.

The beds they show around the pool you have to rent, they are roped off. I was very surprised to see that. They show them in the brochure and you would think they would be included. The food was nothing spectacular and the prices outrageous. Not enough dining areas for that large of a property. One evening my dinner took over 1 hour to get and we had to inquire about it, I think she forgot. The cost $27.00 for 6 shrimp/a cup of rice...have a look. It tasted good and for me the portion was OK...but for my husband, this is an appetizer! One afternoon we ordered a family size pizza...(it wasn't really that big, my husband could have eaten all of it) and it was hard and didn't taste that great. One Hamburger and 2 fries, cost $25.00. All the guests we talked to were not impressed with the food at the resort and thought the prices were way to high as well. I would probably only recommend this hotel to golfers. I would also recommend renting a car so you can leave the property for dinner and the site seeing is easy to get to as well. The main road once you get out of the hotel has an outlet mall, Wal-Mart, McDonalds and several stores. This road also leads you to the Rain Forest and Old San Juan. Driving there was very easy...I didn't want to give up the car! :) Overall, Puerto Rico is a lovely destination and I would highly recommend it as a vacation destination. Old San Juan is so beautiful as well as the Rain Forest. There is lots to see and do in Puerto Rico and we always felt safe. I would love to go back and explore more of Puerto Rico.

This one fooled me with the fruit in a clear liquid which turned out to be water only, alongside paper cups. Well thank goodness I was a red level, felt bad for those who were not. If you stay red level you can get wine. There was no club, no casino, no nighttime entertainment. It was dead at this place. There weren't even shuttles to take you off the resort, so I had to rent a car and leave the resort to find fun. This took away from my vacation because I had to drive myself and worry about involvement in accidents and getting it back on time, etc. (The rental on site was out of cars so I had to use one offsite.) The bar closed early and from all 5 days there I saw a dj one time. So I think I can say there wasn't really a dj. The hallway/common area to the rooms wasn't kept very well. The dishes, glasses, etc. weren't pick up daily so I started placing it outside thinking it would be removed. Those items sat there for days.

Usually they are all inclusive but I was only needing a quick getaway for Spring Break and couldn't pass up the deal on cheapcaribbean.com The deal came with credits for their restaurants, spa and a room upgrade (which was non existent, but whatever). I went to the resort wanting pure relaxation and that's exactly what I got since there was nothing else to do. Thank goodness I enjoyed the pool b/c the beach was pretty much non existent. If you look at any of my other reviews you will see why I'm not impressed by this resort. 1. Resort Grounds- Gorgeous! Everywhere we went the grounds were very well kept! The pics on their website don't do enough justice. You will not be disappointed with how well everything looks. That includes the rooms and the restaurants as well. 2. Location- It's about 30mins away from the airport. Not a big deal. I've been to other places where the drive from the hotel is 1-2hrs away!!! 3. Rooms- Absolutely not worth it! It's barely a beach and there is so much seaweed that you don't even want to get in. Huge clusters of it attached to the beach floor so you can't even walk across in certain spots. I put my feet in just to say I got in the water but spent most of my time at the pool soaking up the sun. 4. Rooms- Very spaceous and very nice. Slight moldy smell in our room but in my friends' room next door it was nice and without smell. The smell wasn't over powering in our room so it didn't bother me much. The beds were very plush and nice but as soon as you got in it moved VERY easily, almost creaked as if it was going to all apart. Thank goodness I was only sleeping in it. Rooms were very clean but DO NOT leave any food anywhere! We left a few coke cans out one night and the next day I saw a baby roach. Thank goodness we were checking out that day. 5. Activities - Non existent for the most part. Aside from your daily workouts I didn't see anything being offered. Supposedly there were some activities on Thurs - Sat nights but we left on Thurs. And the karaoke and piano bar isn't exactly \"night life\". I didn't want to do much or be bothered so I was ok with the lack of things to do. Someone else may not appreciate it as much. You will definitely have to go on excursions for some fun. I also noticed the lack of water sports. Motorized or Non Motorized. There were a few kayaks you could snatch up if you wanted but again, not exciting. As four young ladies we had to find our own entertainment, set up our portable radio in the lounge and make our own party. Pretty sad huh? For the record, my friends said the gym and the spa were very nice! 6. Food - Pretty decent food. Comprable to most other resorts. I did not like how they didn't have many choices which I am used to. Other resorts give you at least 3 or more choices for each meal. (i.e. restaurants, beach bbq, bar/grill, buffet, etc.) Here you have ONE, maybe two choices! For breakfast their was a buffet. For lunch their was either the buffet or the wet bar. For dinner there was only ONE restaurant open. They alternated the few restaurants that they did have. Passion is not ran by the resort so even though it is on their resort it is deemed separate. Don't go hungry, you will be waiting FOREVER! It seems like everything is brought in 30min intervals. Sad. (p.s. the pizza you can order from Luigis is ok if you are starving or drunk) 7. Service - Staff was okay but could have been more available. I am used to having resort staff always being around to point you in the right direction, help, offer services, etc. There was a wait no matter what you were doing. Checking in, Checking out, waiting on a table, getting towels, at the bar to get a drink, room service, etc. I found it interesting that for someone who didn't have the all inclusive option that they wouldn't provide service for what I paid for. Case & Point, I had a drink spilled on me during dinner at Passion (which is not part of the resort) and b/c I didn't act nasty or act a donkey I didn't get ANY compensation. I had to ask for \"something\" and then Carlos the manager only gave a little 10% discount. Really? What if my outfit was satin or expensive? Thank god it was a black tube dress but it doesn't hurt to comp a $20 meal out of an $80 check. The manager didn't even come out to apologize until I asked for him. So in conclusion I liked my relaxing vacay but only b/c that is what I wanted from the beginning. If we were looking for more we would have been disappointed. I prob would not go back or recommend this resort to anyone who would like to travel with high expectations.

When I arrived on Monday around 4:30 PM, I tried to upgrade my room with the included voucher and there were no upgrades for anyone. We were told that we had several restaurants to choose from only the Italian restaurant was closed, the Cafe was closed, one restaurant didn't take the meal vouchers, so we were left with the Asia restaurant. We were told that we didn't have a reservation so we were left with some random menu choices that included sushi and a noodle bar to name a few. Once we were seated, which seemed like an imposition since I didn't have a reservation, it took me 20 minutes to get a tea and soda, another 30 for the sushi, and another 45 for the meal to come. The food wasn't bad but for 90 bucks, I would have expected better sushi. Today, I was in the cafe at 5 PM (which doesn't close until 6) and I Wanted to order the Paella.

His company hosted a conference that included spouses/guests. We decided to go a few days early and not by plan, won a great bid on Priceline for the Gran Melia. We were hoping to stay in San Juan but won Gran Melia for about $125 per night. After reading reviews here, we were both hesitant about our stay. Fortunately, we had no problems with our stay and enjoyed ourselves immensely. We did not upgrade to Red Level and did not feel that we missed out on anything (other than a bit odd that rooms had old-fashioned TV and no docking station for ipods, MP3 players..). I do highly recommend renting a car. We did so from Avis at the airport and for 5 days, paid less than $225 for rental and gas refill. There is no charge for parking if you rent from Avis (just don't rent from site at the hotel as it is a bit pricier). I would have been content at just the resort as I enjoy nothing but the sun and several good books while on vacation but my husband likes to see the sights as well. We went into San Juan for a day and that was enough. Traffic into and out of the city is horrible and we spent at least an hour getting into and out of San Juan. Definately drive to Farjado (less than 30 minute drive) and take the $4.50 R/T ferry to Culebra (just get there early enough to buy your ticket as we were the first to be told that ferry was sold out..very sad :( . No worries though as we bought tickets for next day!) Loquillo (about 10 minuete drive) is another great beach with good kiosk on the beach that serves beer, frozen drinks and food extremely cheap (empanadillas $1, beer was $1.50 and pina colada $3)! Right down the beach are the kioskos that are fantastic...they were so good that we went back the next night. I can't comment too much about the restaurants at Gran Melia. We did arrive late our first night (around 8 pm) and went to the Italian restaurant. We were seated right away without reservations - on a Saturday night. The food was good and I didn't think overpriced. Our meal included an appetizer each, a bottle of wine and our entrees and we didn't think $130 with tip was extreme at all. We pay much more at home for a meal like that and we don't live in a big city. The food during our conference stay was much like that of any banquet style setting. Staff at the resort was wonderful. We did not encounter any difficulty with anyone. I felt bad for the front desk people as they did not seem staffed accordingly and on a couple of occasions saw them getting abused by people with trivial complaints...like standing in line for 5 minutes to be taken care of...seriously? You stand in lines at McDonald's longer and don't complain. This is a resort. Realize that when you book! Of course you have to walk to get to places but if you can't stand the walk there are drivers constantly asking to take you someplace. Is it such a hardship on vacation to walk 5 minutes in a lush setting? We had no issues with our room or housekeeping. One day, they weren't there yet when we returned to our room. I called to request additional towels which were immediately delivered. I told them not to worry about cleaning our room that day. When we came back from dinner, our room was cleaned, turned down and our cooler had fresh ice in it! Pool service was fine as well as the outdoor restaurant. Again, this is a resort. Drink prices weren't outrageous (although my husband would say the beer prices were!). A frozen drink was about $8.50. We were in Miami Beach last year and paid $16!! We did buy beer and pop outside the resort and kept it in our room on ice. No one said anything to us as we walked through the resort with it. We were discreet about it but didn't have to hide it and our bags weren't searched as others have suggested. All in all, we had a great 8 days. I would definately recommend this resort. Rooms were clean, staff was friendly, and the grounds are absolutely beautiful. I would even have paid more than what we won on Priceline.

I didn't play, but I got the impression the greens are very nice. I think it's pricey... Friendly staff. Nice room, quite large, with sitting area. bring a snorkel and swim off the beach.. Lots of fish, marine life close to shore in shallow water. Negatives: Our room wasn't ready for a couple of hours. The food was not exceptional--really quite average. Most disappointing was the breakfasts. I can get bacon and eggs in the States. I would like exotic fruits and freshly baked bread/bagels/croissants, etc. Not at this resort... The resort is far from San Juan--about 40 mins. So if you want to go out in San Juan, it's too far for an evening. Many of the staff members don't speak english.

First the pros: the resort itself was beautiful. The grounds were well kept, the waterfront and pools were great. Even though their beach was not a traditional, white sand beach, it was still very peaceful and beautiful to walk along. It is not, however, for swimming. The overall look of the place was very nice. The restaurant Passion was very good and worth the price. The Mofongo dishes, fish and steaks were all delicious and the service was excellent. We did not try the Italian or Asian restaurants, since we live in NYC and have plenty of those which are some of the best in world, we thought we would stick to the local fare. The bellman/women and bartenders (other then the pool bartenders) were great as well and were always eager to help and give great service. Israel, that's his name, at the \"Ave Bar\" off the lobby was awesome. The breakfast buffet itself was very good, servers were great and the food was just fine. Now, before I explain the issues with Gran Melia, it should be noted that they are repetitive and have come up in several other reviews. So the people running the resort are either ignoring them or refuse to address the issues plaguing these bad reviews. Here are the cons of this resort, and I will begin with the breakfast. There is only one place to eat breakfast from 7a-11a. This is an ongoing theme for the resort, because it happens for lunch as well. So when the breakfast place, Cafe Soleil, fills up, a line forms, as it does everywhere at this resort and it concludes with people not making it in to eat either because of the food running out or no more space and then they close the doors. The only place to eat lunch is the pool bar, Wet Bar, that says it opens at 11a-6p, but twice while we were there (three days total) they did not start serving food until 12:30p because the staff hadn't shown up yet. This \"lunch\" place gets extremely bogged down with food and drinks orders as it is the only place to eat during the day for the ENTIRE resort and the only pool bar. It was up to 2 hours to wait for a turkey club sandwich around 1p in the afternoon. This was a huge issue, with no resolve in sight. The bartenders were inexperienced to handle large volume and mainly ignored half of the guests attempting to order anything. Next problem, the rooms. As it was mentioned in so many previous reviews, there are rooms with mold and extremely musty odors. The solution, unfortunately for guests, is to ask to see the room first, before saying yes, as we did and they will give you a room eventually free of mold and smell. The rooms themselves are very nice and spacious and on our third go around, we finally had a suite that we were able to stay in. DO NOT order Luigi's pizza by the way. We are from NYC, where great pizza is everywhere, but this is not pizza. It is cardboard with burnt cheese and ketchup on it and it was very expensive. Another issue which people thankfully spoke of in their reviews, is the checkout policies of the resort. We read these reviews, and listened to the advice of NOT using debit cards for the \"incidentals\" at the resort. Upon check in, they charge your card (make sure it's a credit card) $100 per day for incidentals. The huge problem with this is that they do not accept cash anywhere on the resort and most of the things (food and drink included) must get charged to your room, so when you exceed the $100 per day, as most of you will, the resort automatically puts another $100 per day hold on your card, which in our case (3 nights) came out to $600, and that was half way thru our trip. So be advised, if you use a debit card, you will lose your money and getting it back will much more difficult if you don't live in Puerto Rico. We actually somehow had $700 held on our card when we checked out and the front desk woman, Angelica, had no idea why we had so much money held on our card. Speaking of the front desk, they make you wait a good amount of time to check in/out or speak to them about anything. And they do not inform you of their policies unless you ask. Be aware of the daily \"charge\" for UNICEF as well. All in all we would NOT stay there again. Puerto Rico is beautiful and there are far more many places to stay for much cheaper prices. The Gran Melia is overpriced for what it is and although it is very pretty, looks can be deceiving.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grove, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cone of the best ever...\u201d", "Author": "Trish95", "ReviewID": "UR126500511", "Content": "I read all the reviews prior to booking this resort and was not real sure we were going to the right resort for our stay.

We found an unbelievable deal right on the Gran Meila website - only $140/night for a garden suite. The many negative reviews on here caused us a little pre-trip anxiety, but boy were we surprised when we got there. Upon arrival, we were immediately upgraded to a deluxe suite, complete with a mini kitchen, at no extra cost. This was great, as we were able to save money by buying groceries in town to make breakfast and lunch ourselves. That way, we could splurge for dinner at night. Our room was gorgeous - TWO flat screen televisions, beautiful accents, and very clean (not sure why people are complaining of getting filthy rooms when ours was immaculate). Very comfy beds. The bathroom toiletries were also very nice. The pool area is beautiful. Very clean, plenty of chairs, and nicely landscaped. Lots of fresh beach towels, too. My mom and I enjoyed the daily water aerobics at noon. Though the beach isn't much of a beach - more grassy than sandy - it was quiet and relaxing. The only restaurant we visited on site was Pasi\u00c3\u00b3n. It was delicious, but very overpriced. We traveled to Luquillo (about 15 minutes by car) for dinner the other nights - we highly recommend the Brass Cactus and Guava's. We did enjoy the little cafe on site in the Gran Melia's Market, which was VERY reasonably priced ($1 coffees and $2 cookies). The staff was VERY friendly - always asking us if there was anything we needed, were we enjoying our stay, etc. Some of the things we didn't like - it was annoying to walk around with the hospital-style Gran Meila bracelets, and the security guards were a little pushy when we walked back with groceries (apparently alcohol purchased off site is not allowed at the Gran Melia). The resort was remote, but we had a rental car and thus did not feel stranded. Bottom line, we got a great deal and were smart about saving money where we could (buying groceries instead of eating every meal out). For what we paid, we had a wonderful vacation at the Gran Meila and really can't complain. This isn't the St. Regis, so don't come expecting everything to be perfect.

My wife and I were assigned to this hotel on a one night NYOP stay from PL, We bid $90. Check-in was the evening of March 4 and we were assigned room 1607. Room Cost $90.00 Taxes and fees to PL $18.34 Parking $16.05 Resort Fee $13.39 Food $37.17 The room itself was gorgeous. Very spacious and well kept. The assigned room, overlooked the tennis courts and the parking lot, This was not ideal for an extended stay, but it was certainly adequate for our one night post cruise visit en route to the rain forest. The only problem we had was a minor ant problem near the desk. We suspect that one of the previous guests had eaten at the desk and that it had not been cleaned it off after departure. We called the front desk to report the ants and we were told that an exterminator would be sent up immediately. Front desk said that was all that they could do. Since it was late at night and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to sleep in a freshly exterminated room, we successfully dealt with the problem by moving our stuff away from the infested area for the evening. The grounds were beautiful\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6immaculately kept. My wife noticed the coarse sand on the beach. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me all that much. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swim. The beaches themselves were beautiful. The swimming pools were beautiful. The hotel and restaurant employees, in general, could not do enough for us. There are no nearby outside dining facilities. We tried to order a pizza at 8:30 (appx) Sunday night from Luigi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the room service provider. We were told that the wait would be an hour. Instead of waiting, we visited Tempo, the onsite Italian restaurant. We split a bowl of risotto. This was probably the best risotto either of us had ever tasted. Portion size was large enough so that a single bowl was enough to feed both of us. The following morning we each had a continental breakfast buffet. The food was of high quality and there was a generous selection of meats and cheeses available in addition to the more mundane cold items. Other posters have commented on the high price of dining. Free of charge membership in the Gran Melia Mas program provides a 10% discount at onsite restaurants and a 50% discount for breakfast. This helped a lot. So what is my complaint ? My wife did the check in with Monica (?), the front desk clerk on duty. Monica told us that our credit card would be charged $100 per night for incidentals. If we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend $100, we would be issued a refund in the morning. This was not a hold..it was a credit card charge. Monica also told us that we would be charged an additional 11%. My wife told Monica that we had already paid our taxes through PL. Monica told my wife and I that the 11% represented a resort fee which PL had partially paid but that we would be responsible for the difference. In the end we were charged $13.31 which is not out of line but it amounted to 14.48% of our room cost. Non-removable hospital style ID bracelets were affixed to our wrists at check-in. We were told that it was required to wear this bracelet at all times when on property. My wife saw a reference to this in the fine print and asked Monica about it. Monica told us that we would be charged $50 if the bracelet was not present. The business about charging the credit card $100 per night for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pre-paid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd incidentals had me upset enough so that I placed a call to a PL CSR while instructing the clerk to wait until I could resolve the situation. While I placed the PL call, Monica disappeared in to a backroom with our credit card. The PL CSR asked us if we had already checked in to the property. We were told that we had already checked in. I thought that this was weird since I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember checking in. I think that Monica ran our credit card when she disappeared into the back room. With the PL rep on the phone, we spoke with the front desk supervisor (whose name I did not copy down). The desk supervisor did a wonderful job. She explained to me that the $100 was indeed a hold and not a charge and that the resort fee usually amounted to 12-14% of room costs for most guests. She also told us that being caught without a bracelet would not result in a mandatory $50 charge. If someone were to ask us how we rate this facility, the breakdown would be as follows: Room quality\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..outstanding Hotel grounds\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6gorgeous Beach\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6gorgeous Restaurant quality and service\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6top notch Front desk staff\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6one bad apple Would we stay here again? My wife loved the room, the restaurant, and the grounds. She would go back in a heartbeat. As for myself\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not so sure. There may also be a more benign explanation for our troubles. The front desk clerk was not a native English speaker. The local culture also dictates that workers in a position of authority should have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the answers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an answer, you make it up as you go.

The resort is absolutely fantastic! The pictures on the resort's website do it zero justice. There are palm trees everywhere you turn. The beaches were a little shelly, but that won't stop you from pulling up a chair and staring into the perfect turquoise water. There are also chairs set up on a grassy ledge above the beach with an equal view. Big iguanas roam the resort and can be pretty entertaining. They must be used to the guests because people were going right up to them to take pictures and they didn't seem to be bothered at all. We were Red Level, and didn't utilize it much, though you do have access to a Red Level only pool (which we definitely accessed!), free internet access in the Red Level lounge, as well as free happy hour with Hors d'\u00c5\u201cuvre. You also get free breakfast at one of the restaurants. Your room will be farther from the main lodge part of the hotel, but you are closer to the Red Level pool and a more secluded section of the beach. Plus there are golf cart shuttles that will take you wherever you need to go. We think it is worth the upgrade. I have to say the one negative was seeing how rude people were to the wait staff. Granted, they are on \"Island Time\", but relax, have a drink and enjoy the sun. Go see Manuel and Gustavo at the Red Level pool bar. Ask for a \"No Pressure\" (strawberry daiquiri, pina colada, and blue curacao) and they'll take good care of you. Our room was extremely nice. It faced the garden, so more palm trees, marble tile floors throughout, high ceiling, and a comfy king size bed. Aside from it not being all-inclusive, we enjoyed the resort probably more than the Sandals La Toc in St Lucia where we had our honeymoon, which was simply amazing as well. We booked our trip through Mark T. at Tripguy.com. He did such a great job when we booked our honeymoon through him and we did not hesitate at all to go to him for our trip to PR.

I found none of them to be accurate and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. There were no bed bugs, mold, moldy odors or rooms in need of repair. As for comments about the distance of walking around the resort, they offer golf cart shuttles around so I don't know what more you could ask for. The service from the staff was excellent. There were over forty people in our party and all had very positive experiences at the resort. We each opted for the Red Level and I was very please with it features. I took breakfast daily at the resort and found the selection of food wide and very good. All of the other meals centered around catered events but the quality of the food was very good. Since the resort is located on the far eastern side of the island, a car is highly recommended if you choose to venture out. I brought my Garmin GPS and was able to navigate around flawlessly. The rainforest reserve is very close and can be navigated without tour guides. And, since we were not in a very touristy area, I was able to eat at several excellant restuarants in nearby Luquillo. And, the beaches on the far eastern side are nice. The hotel does not offer WiFi in the rooms, it is accessed via land line modem. However, WiFi is avaible at the pool and lobby areas. The public spaces are extremely nice. If having a Bali bed at the pool is important, reserve one before you leave. Should you rent a car, there is a daily parking fee and there is no where to park a car outside of the resort that is within walking distance.

Here are some notable items before I launch into the full description: Service: Mediocre, awful housekeeping (things moved/missing) Grounds: Beautiful but inconveniently large, 45 minutes from San Juan Beach: Not swimmable, ample seating available for sun bathing Pool: Gorgeous and enormous Food: Very tasty, great value Rooms: Large and nice, not modern or luxurious (except Red Level) Rent a Car - unless you are purposefully taking a \"resort vacation\" The hotel is very beautiful. It is on a very large lot that has several different types of hotels/properties on it. It takes about 10 minutes to get out of the hotel area and they do not have a shuttle (except for golf), so if you plan on leaving you'll need a car. They have golf carts that will come and pick you up from your room to take you where you need to go on the property (it's that big!). Our room was near the beach, about a third of a mile away from the lobby (they have signs that list distance away from main areas). The rooms were large and nice, however the ammenities are not luxurious or modern unless you upgrade to red level rooms. The service was mediocre, for a hotel with this star/user rating and price I expected better than average service, this is definitely below average in the service area. Be advised that when you check in you will be given wristbands to wear during your stay. I was pretty upset about that, but they said security is likely to stop persons who are on the hotel grounds without wristbands. Housekeeping is hit and miss. They often took our towels, but did not replace them. They will give you new glasses but not take the dirty ones. Our coffee was rarley refreshed. One day, when we returned to our room several things had been moved. I like to put my clothes in the closets and drawers and I place my products in the shower and counter when I arrive. I leave things out of the way, in a corner, so that housekeeping can easily clean around things and I always throw any trash in the trash can. There is no litter anywhere in the room, I do not leave things out of place (I'm a bit of a neat freak, even on vacation). One day when we returned, all of our things had been moved, and my expensive prescription conditioner (full bottle) was missing. I also brought a hand made Do Not Distrub sign with a fake pearl hanger and pearl accents, that was missing as well. They sent security up to take a report after I complained, which felt silly for conditioner (albeit irreplaceable conditioner) and an item with only sentimental value. During all of my hotel stays, I have never experienced my personal items being out of place, let alone missing. I was very distraught by it. The beach at the hotel is not swimmble, the sand is rough because there are tons of broken shells so you need shoes at the beach. There is a lot of kelp right at the shore. However, if you just like to lay out they do have a lot of lounge chairs, little tables, and hammocks. The pools are also very nice. The red level pool is small, but it did look very private. We used the gym, it had a good selection of cardio equipment, weight machines, and a large selection of low and high weight dumbbells. The hot tub is next to the gym. We did not visit the spa because, well resort spas are out of our budget. The casino at the hotel gets very packed on the weekends. Parking can be an issue, but the staff will give you a ride so you just have to flag someone down to give you a ride or pay for valet on busy nights. The casino is small but has a large variety of table games and slots (even penny slots). Beer, wine, and well drinks are complimentary while you play. The restaurants are very good and they are cheaper than the surrounding areas. If you sign up for the Melia club, which is free, you get half off of the breakfast buffet and 10% off at the restaurants when you show the card they give you.

We stayed at the Gran Melia for 5 days and 4 nights. Just got back tonight actually! We opted to not splurge on the red level service and still thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Upon arrival, we were about 2 hours early for check in and also requested a room closer to the lobby. We were told the room was not yet ready but we were free to leave our bags with the bellhop and they would call us when our room was ready. We wandered for all of 5 minutes when we received a call that our room was ready. We received a room in bungalow 15 which is right next to the main areas. However, when we got there - another guest was already checked into the room. A bit odd but we called reception and in a matter of minutes, we were picked up and shuttled off to another room in bungalow 16, also right next to the main areas. A little bit of a hiccup but the resort took care of the room change very quickly. Not a big deal. The room was very large, comfortable, and clean. The room did have a bit of a damp smell to it but not enough to really bother us at all - i think i only took note of it because it was mentioned in so many reviews. The dampness is a bit to be expected when you are in a humid area. We never had any issues with housekeeping, our room was refreshed every day. One day we asked the maid to come back at a later time since we still needed to be in our room and we still received our turndown service. Another day we put up the privacy sign and received two notices letting us know to call down to reception if we should need anything. After we left our room and took off the privacy sign, our room had been turned down when we returned - we didn't even need to call down for anything. The pool was great - never had a hard time finding a chair. We had lunch at the wet bar 3 times and never had an issue with slow service. our food took anywhere from 5-20 minutes to arrive. the one time it did take longer was when we ordered the paella (which was delicious btw). Also, the one time drink service was slow at the bar was on a friday when the resort became much more crowded. There was, however, not much of a wait on the pool bar side so there were other options of getting drinks quicker. since we were already in line at the restaurant side, we just decided to stay put. one great thing was that water was very readily accessible - it was available at the bar (self serve). as for the beach - it is rather rocky, we opted to spend most of our days sunning by the pool but we also did see a fair number of guests laying out by the beach. the gym was a decent size and very well maintained - machines are fairly new. there is also a pool at the gym which is part of the spa and is very peaceful and quiet. there are bali beds around this smaller pool that you can use for free. we had breakfast at cafe soleil every morning. the breakfast buffet offered a pretty decent spread - fresh fruits, yogurt, juices, breads, cold cuts, cheese, omelet station, and a buffet of hot foods. there was also another station where you could get pancakes and fried eggs. the waitstaff was great - quick and attentive. one day our coffee was poured a bit cold (colder than lukewarm) so we asked for fresh cups. the waitress brought back piping hot cups of coffee and also steamed our milk! we never waited to be seated and did not really have any issues with long lines in the restaurant. sometimes there was a wait to get pancakes/omelets but i wouldnt say longer than a few minutes. Pancakes were really good! we had dinner at nami twice. Compared to NYC sushi, it is just as expensive as a top sushi restaurant but lacking in the quality. The quality of the sushi was average, just a bit expensive for what it was. to be honest, i wasn't expecting amazing sushi in PR so it was OK with me - just a little bit sticker shocked for what i received. the nami roll was probably the best roll on the menu and we also tried the ribs that were pretty tasty. We tried to have dinner at Pasion one night and as another reviewer mentioned - we had a hard time receiving service. We sat down and were given menus. someone came by and filled our cups with water but did not offer to take a drink order. we waited about 15 minutes and finally flagged down someone running by to take our order. However, still no one came. we waited another 5 minutes with no one paying any attention to us so we just walked out. A bit disappointed as I read good reviews about the food there but after waiting so long just to get someone to take our order, the meal was already ruined before it began. What was strange was that a waitress had taken the orders of the two tables next to us but then skipped us and never came back. she didnt acknowledge our table at all. i would say that was the lowest point in the trip but it was only one incident with poor service. check out was a breeze - we had a 75$ room credit per day with expedia and it was applied at check out. we had one small charge on our bill that we did not recognize (< $5) and the hotel took it off, no problems. check out took all of 5 minutes. Overall, our stay was great - we went to relax and that is what we did. Everyone we encountered at the resort was extremely pleasant and helpful. Of course we did have a handful of isolated issues on the trip but nothing was so major to never want to return to the Gran Melia. Also - it helps to remind yourself that you are on vacation - things tend to move at a slower pace in the Caribbean. A few tips: - rent a car at the airport. Based on reviews, the cab ride to the resort from the airport can be close to $100. We rented from enterprise for $19/day! We had to pay a parking fee of $15/day at the gran melia but this was still cheaper than renting from the avis on site and also saved us a cab fare to and from the airport which would have been more than what we spent on our ENTIRE rental + parking. For 4 days, our rental was ~$90. Roads are not too difficult to navigate, especially with the help of iphones! PR drivers are a bit reckless but comparable to NYC drivers. they run a LOT of red lights and merge without using their signals. - there is a supermarket (amigo) right down the street once you get on to the main road from the hotel. you just take a left at PR3, and Amigo + Walgreens + Burger King are on the left at the next stop light. about a 3 minute drive. - if you are planning on visting el yunque, it's also very close. make sure to bring rain gear! we were unprepared and had to get ponchos at the visitor center (they ran out of adult sized ones and we had to get child sized ones which still fit OK). However by the time we made it to the parking lot of the trail we wanted to walk (big tree) it was pouring so hard you would barely see! we decided to abandon the trip and drove back to catch some sun at the resort. i read that if you go early, it tends to rain less in the AM. we were there around 1PM. bad idea! we didnt get a chance to go back. - we took a day trip to Old San Juan, about 40 minutes by car (also making the rental very worthwhile!). If you plan on taking highway 66 (and not PR3) MAKE SURE TO HAVE SMALL BILLS in CASH. they dont give any change (coins or bills) at the toll booths. Highway 66 is a bit faster than PR3 since there are no lights. Old San Juan is definitely worth the trip! amazing views from the two forts. - there is a restroom with a shower that is right by reception (and fully stocked with amenities). You can definitely opt for a later flight out of PR if you want one last full day of sun. i wish i had known this! You can leave your bags with the bellhop (or in your car if you have a rental), soak up the rays for a few hours, wash up in the lobby shower and then head on home. how convenient! - lines to check in at the airport looked long. we checked in using the computers in THE MARKET at the Gran Melia and printed our boarding passes there. saved us the wait at the airport! make sure you get your bags checked at the dept of agriculture stations in the airport before getting on the line to go through security! there really were no obvious signs in the airport letting us know this had to be done. - if you want to visit the biobay, book with Cpt Jeff and Cpt Charlie at bio island PR. they were awesome. this is the electric boat version of the tour instead of the kayak tour. much more relaxing and so much more informative since they are able to talk to you during the entire length of the tour. also much less strenuous.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "northport, n y", "Title": "\u201cHorrible horrible HORRIBLE service and management\u201d", "Author": "adriNorthport", "ReviewID": "UR125558225", "Content": "Let me begin by stating that I too wished that I had listened to previous reviews regarding poor service and absentee management. Although the resort is STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL the love affair ends there. The Red Level service is essentially non existent. You are receiving a room closer to the resort (.17 miles was our walk) and a private pool but FORGET about white glove butler service. The \"butlers\" are in the Red Level Lounge in the lobby and can only be found during certain hours. We tipped one $100 on day one and never saw him again. We had to handle all of our problems ourselves. The \"butlers\" do nothing for you and are all hype. The photo of the Red Level rooms on line is also false. The rooms are the same as the non-red level rooms. Ours was purple and yellow. The housekeeping staff is unbelievably inept. Do not expect a bath mat and towels and soap and toiletries on every day. You will get ONE of those things daily but never all at once.???????? I had to call EVERY day for towels. Where the heck was that butler????? lol ...The Red pool was lovely but do not expect it to be ready early. most days we had to wait until eleven for our bali bed and noon for bar service. Personally, I like my vacation to start around nine am but I'm funny that way!!!! Expect to wait 20 minutes for drinks and an hour for food despite the fact they bbq right there. Don't ask just be prepared to waste your time. EVERY day by the pool people were screaming and complaining. And i mean screaming. Breakfast was a joke. ONE woman making eggs for the whole resort. One day the only place open for lunch for the whole fully booked resort was the beach restaurant with about 12 tables. The wait was two hours.There was alot of screaming that day. We had to bribe an employee with $50 to get us food that day. There is a serious lack of management here. You NEVER see a manager. You do see many worker bees, mostly cleaning which is surprising. I should think the resort would rather provide service to the guest rather than sparkling bannisters. But all of this pales in comparison to what happened to my son one night. As we entered the lobby which is a maze I dropped my key and in a second he was lost. We kept circling each other both getting increasingly upset. I approached a security agent who took a description but wasn't too concerned. My son, who is 10, recalled that his grandparents were at the casino and ran there , outside of the hotel,crying. As he was taught he ran to an adult employee-the guard at the door -and told him he was lost and his grandparents were inside. The guard told him \" GET LOST\" and told him to get away from the casino. YES YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY. He then ran to the Red Level lounge where an employee recognized him and told him to calm down and stay put. They then found me. When I spoke with the manager on duty, who oddly enough was in charge of security, he basically yesed me to death.I explained I am a former prosecutor and that about a thousand horrible things could have happened to my son outside the hotel on the street his employee sent him to but he really did not care. I watched from a distance as another manager spoke to the casino employee for one minute and 21 seconds and sent him back to work. When I brought this situation up with management this week they said that my son was not lost, he was trying to get into the casino to play. SURE. Crying hysterically he wanted to play a little roulette. DISGUSTING. My son was upset all night and wanted to leave PR right away. I felt very unsafe there after this too. Perhaps its cultural, in PR they may not value and protect children as we do. But I dont know a person who would see a lost child and not help.Except at the Gran Melia. I would never return here. I've even cancelled a trip to their resort in the Dominican Republic in November. Do not trust your vacation to them.

My mother isn't a traveler and was very nervous about the trip but she enjoyed herself immensely (which is saying a lot). Like other reviewers, we too got the Red Level package (sort of by accident on our part) and loved that option. Aside from seeing the rain forest we never left the resort but had a fantastic time. I would definitely go back and recommend the restaurant Passions (get the red snapper and garlic butter sauce). Do yourself a favor and give every courtesy and respect to any one servicing you. If you get to know these staff members you will discover they are the most hospitable and lovely people in the world. Some of my friends were Angel and Joshua from the Red Level pool. People will come to know you by name and are genuine in every encounter. Joshua puts in extra touches to help you enjoy the luxuries that red level offers. Also, be sure to show some love to the bartender Gustavo, and you'll discover he is an amazing person. Pagan, our friend, is the most humble and friendly security person; he'll make sure you enjoy yourself. I even met people on my last day, like Felix, who made me regret ever having to leave. Finally, be sure to meet Israel at the Avenue Bar. I mean it most sincerely when I say ask for \"the best drink\" and that man will make the best you'll ever have. In summary, it was a lovely experience and I would most definitely go back. The staff makes you forget your worries and provides luxuries to ensure you have a nice time. The entire staff's meticulous detail to service, ground upkeep, and hospitality will make you saddened to leave. I can't wait to go back and live in that ocean breeze once more.

My one and only issue was that we were seated at a table that I do not believe had a server assigned so we asked a passing server to take our order 30 minutes after being seated. I cannot remember her name but she immediately apologized and took our order . Our food arrived and was worth the wait. We did not really use the butler service however we appreciate that it was available. The Jr. Suite Garden view was very nice and looked like pictured on the website. Jesus at the concierge desk is a Gem. He took the time to help my husband plan activities for us, like El yunque Rain Forest and Biobay excursion in Fajardo. He also made reservations for us on the night of our anniversary at a restaurant with great food and ambiance. Jesus printed out maps and directions to the coffee festival at Maricau where went and had a wonderful time.

The resort is beautiful and meticulously maintained. Our room (on the ground floor) faced the lovely garden and was spacious and comfortable. The expansive beach area was almost empty, and we loved having a pool that was for the exclusive use of Red Level guests. Bali beds in abundance around the pool and in the hotel lobby areas, a bar at the pool, and top-notch, attentive service are all highlights of this fabulous resort; the concierge not only accommodated our every need, but called to check whether everything was to our satisfaction. Angel is truly an angel - seek him out and let him suggest tips for enjoying the resort, the rain forest (a brief 10-15 minute's drive from the resort) The small gym is nice and has its own small, private pool. Not having internet access in our room was not a problem (my i-Phone worked in a pinch); it gave us time away from computers and e-mails, and we were always able to use the WiFi in and around the Red Level lounge and lobby areas when needed. The daily evening snack in the Red Level lounge -- with wine and beer at no additional fee -- was a delightful surprise. A note about costs: don't rent a car at the resort; it's three times the price of rentals from other providers who will pick you up to get your rental car.

It included one Dinner for two at either of the 2 restaurants in the hotel and the breakfast buffet for the days we were there. I actually bought the package before going on TripAdvisor and checking what the reviews were for this hotel. When I finally got around to verifying the reviews i must admit i was worried about the quality of our stay there. But after a beautiful weekend, I can say with confidence that i really don't understand the negative reviews some guests have given the hotel. First, let me address the check in... I read various reviews where guests complained about long waits to check in. We were attended to within 5 minutes of arriving there. The front desk attendant told us our room was not ready and it would take about 20 min. She advised us to take the time to take a look around the property, which we started to do, and less then 10 min. later we got a call that our room was ready and we could go and pick up our cards to the room. An assistant came and took our luggage and gave us a ride to the bungalow where we would be staying. Second, the surroundings were beautiful and well kept. I read some negative reviews on this and again I can't say the same. They have an enourmous pool, big enough that it doesn't feel crowded and you can find your own little nook to relax in. I read a revie about someone complaining about the water being cold.... Seriously???? I mean it's Puerto Rico, were the weather is warm all year around, nonscense! Third, the room. Ok, so it doesn't have a flat screen TV, so what??? The reception on the channels was good. And really who stays in they're room just to watch tv when you're on vacation? The room was really well kept and CLEAN! If anything that is something I as a guest I'm NOT willing to compromise on. The bed was absolutely comfortable and I had no problem sleeping. There was no NOISE to be bothered by. Now about the musty smell, I did notice a bit of the smell when we walked in the room but PR has a very warm and humid climate. I would advise that you open the glass doors that lead out into the \"balcon\" to let some fresh air in the room and you should be fine. Now as far as the restaurants go, there are 3 in the Hotel, one for italian food called Tempo, one for asian food called Nami, and one for latin cuisine called Passion. We had our complementary dinner at Tempo and enjoyed it thoroughly. Our waiter was super courteous and attentive to our needs and the food was good. Like i mentioned before our dinner came included in the package we brought, but just so you have an idea, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts came out to a total of about $93 (that's if we had had to pay for it :) The breafast buffet was also included in our package, but it runs for $22 per person. I thought the buffet was wonderful. No complaints here, they had a very ample selection to choose from. There were omlet stations where they would prepare your omelet righ there on the spot, they had a pancake station and so many endless things to choose from. Definately worth the money if you have to pay. There was a small line when we went on the first day... showed up around 10:00am but needless to say it moved really quickly, i would say it was around a 5 min. wait. On our second day we went a lot earlier..around 8am and found that if you want to avoid the crowds, this is the time to go. The Breakfast Buffet is available until 11 am so if you're not an early bird and don't mind it being a little crowded then there's no need to wake up early. We went to the casino on 2 ocassions, during the day there is less staff but it makes sense because there is also less traffic at that time but there was at least one attendant per game table. I mention this becuase I read a review where someone mentioned the casino was a joke. Again Seriously??? I mean it's not Las Vegas but it's perfectly fine for a hotel caino. And finally drinks, my boyfriend bought a 12oz Heineken at the market located off the side in the main lobby and it cost him $4.75.... he later asked for one at one of the bars located in the lobby and ended up paying $7.50 for an 8 oz. Heineken (Aluminum Can). He felt ripped off..jajajaja. So if you like to drink I would recommend that you buy one of the packages the hotel offers where they give you 4 beers Heinekens/ or some other brand, your choice of 4 sodas, 2 bottles of water and a bag of chips for around $27 - $28 bucks (can't remember if that included tax) so you shold ask. You can buy more than one package and if you buy 2 they give you the 3rd one free but keep in mind that even if you buy the 2 packages they will only give you one package PER DAY of your stay. What to do for fun outside the Hotel - If you want to have some fun then i recommend Haciendo Carabali, it's about a 10 min. drive from the Hotel and it's really easy to get there. You can do a 2hr. tour on ATV's through the woods, half way through the excursion they stop at a river where you can take a dip. If ATV's isn't the thing for you then you can do horse back riding.. they have 2 hr and 1 hr. tours the same goes for the ATV's if 2 hrs. is too much for you than you can do a 1 hr. tour. If you have small kids they will love the Go-Carts they have available there. There's also a restaurant on the premises if you work up an apetite after having gone on one of the excursions. Another place i would recommend you visit is Richie's Cafe, also a short ride from the Hotel. It's a restaurant that offers local cuisine as well as seafood. The View is BREATHTAKING.... so even if you don't make the trip to have dinner... go and buy some drinks and take in the view... absolutely amazing. So that's it, hope my review has been helpful in making your decision. I would definately return.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cKnow what to expect, and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed\u201d", "Author": "dianaf12", "ReviewID": "UR125255862", "Content": "After having read all the reviews and done plenty of research on this resort, I felt pretty informed upon arrival. It turned out I already knew of the downsides, which made it abundantly easy to fully appreciate all the upsides. Truly, if you go into this already knowing certain things, you can really have a wonderful stay at this hotel. What to expect: The mail pool area is large and beautiful, with something for mostly everyone (sports, music, swim up bar, whirl-pools, kid pools, bali beds, quieter areas, etc.). The Red Level pool is calmer and very relaxing. It claims to be adult only, but I always saw one or 2 kids there and the staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say anything. One thing I really liked is you can always find chairs at the pool or beach, unlike other resorts where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all reserved with towels by 9am. The grounds are stunning and very well maintained. I loved just strolling admiring the attraction, listening to the birds, sharing the space with all the various lizards. The beach is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I heard one guest describe it as lame, which might be a fair depiction for what one might falsely expect should be a beautiful Caribbean beach. Its lovely to look at (I could stare at any ocean for hours) and you can take some long, quiet, pretty walks down it; but, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swim in it. There is a TON of seawead, little to no movement in the water (since the waves break much farther out), and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not the kind of water you want to swim in. Naturally Gran Melia can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t control this, and I feel they did a great job of creating such a tropical oasis out of the grounds that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care much about the so-so beach. Location wise, the resort is not near anything. If you want to be able to walk to places or take a quick cab out, simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the place for you. My boyfriend and I had reserved 3 nights here then stayed elsewhere closer to San Juan so we could shop and go out, so we had anticipated and enjoyed the solitude of this resort during our stay. I thought the food and drinks were fabulous. There are plenty of options for breakfast, but it gets busier the later you go, so expect some serious lines at the omelet station if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a late riser. There are three restaurants for dinner (Asian, Italian, Puerto Rican) and we tried each and were happy with them all. The Hibachi at the Asian restaurant definitely stood out as one of our favorite meals of the trip. The main bar area (near the lobby) offers many yummy rum cocktails \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wish I could have tried them all. All the drinks I had were good though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially margaritas. The service was about average to me. We felt very well treated the whole time, no complaints, but it also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand out as being exceptional (not saying that in a bad way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience any above and beyond type of treatment). Rooms - we did the Red Level, so we had a gorgeous oceanfront bungalow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I loved it. Slept with the balcony door open every night to feel the breeze. Lots of bathroom amenities and the room was very spacious. I would advise anyone to do the Red Level. You pay a little more but get a better room, free breakfast, a 3 hour open bar (wine, beer, and champagne only) plus one hour of appetizers nightly, and access to the Red Level pool. To sum it up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a party, for a perfect beach, for an immense amount of activities, or for lots of nearby attractions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you might want to look elsewhere. But, this resort is wonderful if you want to stay somewhere beautiful, secluded and peaceful. The food is good. The drinks are good. The music is perfect and the sights are stunning. I would definitely recommend it. PS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you want to see a perfect beach, go to Flamenco. We booked an excursion through the hotel that included snorkeling then a few hours at Flamenco Beach on Culebra, plus boat transportation.

If that is the kind of service you guys give after calling yourself a 4 star resort then I am sorry, to say but I have had better experience with Best Western and at much cheaper rates. Last day when we were checking out , we had about $ 100 extra charges on our account. WE disputed those charges that very moment with the receptionist on duty at the resort and was resolved.

Well, I was wrong. I really should have valued the opinions of my fellow travelers more. Truly, as some of the more recent reviews indicate, Red Level Service is more hype than reality, the stay is marginal at best if you have high expectations, and I was embarrassed to admit to my husband that I, the wife with impeccable taste and all the answers, had led our family down the rocky road of travel disappointment, and paid good money to do it. At this point you have probably read it all before, but if my comments can make even one traveler more aware of what they might expect, then the time spent on typing this review is worth it. So, here goes: We made our reservation through American Express Travel. We received what I considered at the time of booking an excellent rate on a Red Level Ocean Front room with a jacuzzi on the terrace. Red Level check-in went pretty smoothly, with very little wait. (We arrived just after noon and told that the room was not ready, but they would put a rush on it. Fortunately, the room was ready shortly after we completed registration.) As noted, almost everything is a brief walk from the rooms, so we waited for the golf cart to transport us (and our luggage). While I did think the grounds and the exterior of the buildings were quite attractive, the first thing that greeted me when we opened the door was the smell of mold/mildew and the dampness of the room. Thank goodness for Febreze and Clorox Wipes. (I shouldn't have to say this about a resort.) I can't say that the interior of the bungalow looked worse than the pictures online, but it had somewhat of a tired feel, and nothing spoke of \"Red Level\" luxury. (Even one of the \"upgraded\" bath amenities had mildew on it. I admit that I hid it from my husband as the thought that someone would put it out for a Red Level guest was simply too much to bear.) The lunch on day one was a disaster. It took us a while to discover that there is only one option for lunch at the resort, which is the poolside Wet Bar & Grill. We waited two hours (no exaggeration) for fish and chips, buffalo wings and a quesadilla. The first two items came after a 75 minute wait, and my husband's item followed after another 30 minutes, and the guests around us were not faring much better. So, service here was beyond horrible. We finally left lunch to check out the beach and the pool. The reviews are correct when they tell you this is not a swimming beach. It made for a nice walk and cool pictures, but we knew we would have to find another beach to satisfy the tastes of our beach bum 11-year old. Breakfast was OK. Go early or prepare to wait in long lines with poorly stocked food stations. (The only reason I was able to tolerate the poor food quality and service at the breakfast buffet is because it was complimentary with Red Level booking.) The remainder of the trip was also tolerable, with long walks back and forth to the main building, most of the time without benefit of the golf cart or having golf carts pass right by you without picking you up or even the driver looking your way. Brights spots were the Asian Bistro and Tempo Italian Restaurant. The food was delicious and beautifully plated but would have been considered expensive, even at a resort, for the quality. As for the excursions, book as soon as possible. The ATV tour that we booked through Dragonfly was awesome and well worth the money. It was the highlight of our trip, along with our drive to Old San Juan. (We had a great lunch at Cafe Berlin.) Thank goodness we rented a car at the airport as we had to drive to the ATV site instead of taking transportation from the hotel. (FYI, we were able to park at the resort free because we rented from Avis. I'm not usually an Avis renter, but I picked up this tip from someone online. The resort does not charge parking for Avis renters, even if you get the car at the airport instead of renting at the Avis onsite.) So, all in all, I would say that Puerto Rico was a great place to visit, but we would not stay at the Gran Melia if we were to return. Perhaps the experience would be OK for honeymooners or new loves who are blind to anything but the person that they are with. It's a very romantic place for long walks and beautiful scenery. Unfortunately, I didn't have the benefit of being blinded to the flaws of this resort on this family vacation, which would have helped tremendously. As a Red Level guest, I'm sorry to be the bearer of this less than positive review.

As far as this resort is concerned you will basically get what you pay for. The prices are cheap but so is the service. One day they housekeeping completely skipped my room. The chairs on the porch had dirty arm rests and the balcony wass full of bird droppings. My main complaint: we booked our trip thru Expedia and received a $75 a night credit. I contacted the hotel and was told I can use that credit towards upgrading my room so i upgraded to the Oceanfront red level service for an extra $121 a night (after %25 discount for using my mas card) and lo and behold when it came to check out they did not let me use this credit. Additionally I definitely do not recommend the red level service. The main benefit you get would be the red level pool however the main pool is huge and you can find plenty of quiet spots. All the hype about these amazing butlers is a joke. I was never introduced to a butler. They never came over to us to offer us any services. We used the concierge from the hotel for our day trips and it was just fine(their directions are terrible use a gps). I called for the butler twice, the first time it was about 6pm and I was told that they were all on break and no one was available??? Haven't they heard of shifts? The next time I called was to have them pick me up from our room to help us check out. He was late in showing up and another bellhop that was passing by picked us up. I couldn't even tell you the butlers name because they never showed up. Red level also gives you access to free drinks (wine, beer,soda) big deal, not worth the extra $ in my opinion.

Not a pretty entry. Immediately see into the delivery area. Not a good first impression.. Staff: most are very friendly and helpful and know enough English to make themselves useful. The grounds: overgrown weeds in many areas (including room balconies). Grass is sparce as weeds have taken over. The trees and plants have thinned and appear to be underfed and in need of a professional horticulturist to come in and insure that the trees and plants are receiving the right nutrients at the right time. It just looks.... ignored with just enough care to keep things from dying. Rooms: well kept. The phone did blink. I ignored it. No big deal. Plenty of towns. Clean, etc.. However, in this day and age, it's time to get rid of the old style, analog televisions and move to HD flat screens. The buildings, however, need to be painted. They are, as everything else is, looking ignored. Food: well... the buffets for corporate stuff? Really, really really not that good. Really. I would love to spend two weeks teaching the staff how to prepare and season meals. They do not understand American taste and standards and everyone I spoke to agreed. The restaurants seems to dp much better, although a bit overseasoned and salty. Otherwise, the staff seemed to be friendly and attentive. Lots to be desired, but lots to appreciate, too. All in all, I've been to and stayed in resorts that put this one to shame, but there was just enough good about this that my trip wasn't ruined by anything and in some ways, my trip was pleasurable.

But, as a response to some of the complaints, here's what I would say...if you are a person who wants everything to happen immediately, Puerto Rico (most of the caribbean actually) is probably not the best destination for you. If you want to be in the middle of hustle and bustle, this is not the resort for you. Gran Melia by design is a quiet, beautiful resort. It sits off by itself on a peninsula so yes, it's definitely best to have a car. There is an Avis on site and the parking is very reasonable ($16 per day). In fact, ALL the prices are reasonable for a resort: rooms, food, and drinks. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and the service is top notch. The rooms are clean and very well appointed but they do get a bit humid (it's a tropical climate 10 minutes from a rain forrest - we're not talking rocket science here), just keep the air conditioner running and it's not a problem. The red level upgrade is definitely worth it, and when you add up the ammenties that red level affords (breakfast, evening hors d'oeurves and cocktails) the cost is very close to the standard room. The service that you get from the Red Level staff (especially Nilda in the lounge, Angel the butler, and Gus and Manny at the Red Level pool) is so great! They clearly take pride in their work and treat you like guests in their home. I really can't say enough about this resort, I would recommend it to anyone without hesitation.

The room smelt damp and over the next couple of days we realized it was v damp. Paper would curl and gel tablets stuck together. The air con was incredibly noisy but ineffective.

Upon check-in they asked us what credit card we'd like to put a hold on for incidentals, seeing as they don't let you pay with cash ANYWHERE in the hotel except the casino and gift shop, we asked what type of hold would be done and how much, as most of our spending $ was in cash. The front desk clerk told us they'd hold $100 / day and we could settle up with the other charges in cash at the end of the trip. NOT THE CASE! Our card was hit 3x before we even checked out! When we actually did go to check out, we were first met by the supervisor who told us we should have been told if we exceeded the $100 / day , whatever we went over would be added to our account, and held on our card with the other charges until the end of our trip...except that was a lie also! We put down a debit card...so it AUTOMATICALLY took out any overages immediately. Luckily my husband likes to check our bank account periodically, and noticed the charges, otherwise we'd have paid twice before leaving today (and yes I'm so mad I'm writing this the same day)! When the supervisor had nothing helpful to say, I asked to speak to the General Manager of the hotel. My husband and I work in the service industry as managers (I'm a shift manager, and he's a General Manager) and when someone asks for a GM...you find one...Immediately! Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Next we were met by the Front Desk Manager who re-itterated the SAME thing the supervisor said. Our problem isn't paying...its being lied to by an employee who should know his job before telling people incorrect information that screws with their money! Especially on vacation...and even more so on someones HONEYMOON! I then asked for a General Manager again...so someone else comes out... I feel its important to mention now, that another employee has now confirmed to me that the \"blonde guy in the suit\" I saw walking around, is in fact on the property AND the GM...the person who greets me is not blonde or in a black suit...he's the ROOMS Manager. Before I even begin the conversation, the smarmy look on his face infuriates me, so I ask for the GM again...and am told a 3rd time, he's not available or on the property. We are then informed that they don't really care how we feel bc they've already been paid. GREAT HOSPITALITY. On top of all that, they tax on top of making you pay for parking, and charge a daily resort fee (normal these days, but no one told to us/reminded us at arrival). The pool is unheated and you have to battle the birds for clean lounge chairs and any food you have near you. The restaurants alternate nights, so you have to plan accordingly, and make sure you have a reservation, you'll wait 15minutes anyway, but if you don't have one at all, you won't eat...the food is sub-par...sushi was the only thing worth eating, don't bother with room service or the pool bar...its also annoying they only have one place to eat for bkfst and lunch, no options... The one shining star at that resort...Richard the bartender! If you're unfortunate to have already booked your vacation, go hang with him and give him all your money!

This resort had everything I required, particularly because we went with the red level. The latter meant that we had an adult only pool (not many people using it either). Great pool, suitable for real swimming, with free bali beds beside it. The complimentary wine and appetizers in the evening was a nice touch. The first couple of mornings we ate breakfast in the cafe, but on our last morning realized that it was much better to have a continental breakfast in the Red Level lounge because the coffee was better. Both breakfast venues also complimentary. I thought this place was very good value. There are a lot of negative comments on this site regarding the service and staff. I agree there is room for improvement because a lot of times the ball got dropped. We never were offered a welcome cocktail while checking in (as advertised), and when we asked our \"butler\" how to reserve a bali bed, he said he would call our room right away with the number. That didn't happen either. In the bar the first night, I ordered some gumbo. It took a long time, but I wasn't concerned. A guest next to me started complaining loudly about the lateness of his meal. The next night, the bartender explained, when I ordered the same thing again, that this was room service so it would take a while. I said, no problem, but I would still like to order it. 45 minutes later I asked him how the gumbo was doing. At that point he jumped on the phone (which he hadn't done before) presumably to order it. I do think, though, that overall the complaints come from rude, spoiled people. If my peace at the pool was ruined, it was by tourists barking into their cell phones. Even though the literature clearly states that the evening appetizer hour consists of wine, there was still a woman acting disgusted that she couldn't get a gin and tonic. Coming out of our room one evening, I heard a guest upstairs shouting (presumably into the phone) that his ice was an hour late arriving. Why didn't he just get his own? Also, at the pool, a guest complained that his meal (which had to be trekked to him from the bar down the beach) was cold.

Picking up my luggage - bell service does that anyway. Coming to get me for breakfast? They run shuttles thru the resort about every 15-20 minutes for everyone. Plan to do LOTS of walking once you arrive. Our room was 1/4 mile (+) to the breakfast area, the shuttles run, but can be very sporadic. Your car is useless on the resort as it is all winding sidewalks. Night time lighting is abysmally inadequate - walkways are poorly lit - on the 'bright side' - it made the resort look cleaner.... Parking is $20 per day for self park. They charge $100/day on your credit card as soon as you arrive for incidentals. It will be credited back when you check out and settle your bill. The resort is expensive, the casino is full of OLD machines, the \"happening\" night club is not happening, the concierge team and check in staff are friendly, everyone else pretty much wishes you would go away. If you plan to stay on the resort and don't mind paying lots'o cash for mediocre food, you will be fine. We fell under the spell of the amazing promises and pictures on their website and we were so disappointed when we got there. We talked to several other guests who felt the same way we did. Lots of hype, not much heft.

It is extremely clean and actually just as breath-taken as the pictures. We stayed here for 5 Days for our 25th bday celebrations. Definitely not the type of lively resort we were expecting. It is about 30-40 mins from San Juan where basically everything happens so I would recommend renting a car for sure if you are an adventurer looking to see the real Puerto Rico. The hotel grounds, pool, lobby restaurant etc have the most relaxing and romantic vibe at night and the feeling of an oasis in the day. The staff is amazing and pleasant however slow. At first i thought this was just slow service of the hotel, however we soon realized that no one in Puerto Rico has any sense of urgency... meaning anywhere you go (even burger king) you will be waiting, thats just the culture. The resort is about 10-15 mins away from the Rainforest and a beautiful beach-town named Luquillo where you can meet the locals, have some drinks at a few of the bars, enjoy the beach and watch the surfers or go surfing. Again, we went to a restaurant in Luquillo and were waiting over 1 hr for our food. In comparison, the Gran Melia staff was great. Anything extra we needed in the rooms (towels, pillows, etc) where eventually delivered followed up by a pleasant call from the front desk ensuring we received what we asked for and were satisfied. Even after we checked-in and made it to our rooms we received a call asking if we were ok with the room! Check-In was easy, took just about 15-20 mins at most followed by being driven to our room via golf cart. The resort is that BIG, so you can get dropped off and picked up anywhere, or simply enjoy the walk exploring the grounds. You can call and ask for pick up or just walk out of your room and within 5 mins you will see a golf cart go by and they ALWAYS stop to ask if you need a ride anywhere. The hotel backs on to the ocean however its not much of a beach, hard sand, but still beautiful with an endless amount of beach beds and chairs to lay out. We stayed by the pool. The main pool is huuggggeee and in view of the beach so u get best of both worlds. There is an awesome pool bar that plays music all day and adds to the amazing atmosphere. There is also a Red-level pool strictly for adults along with a casino (small but funn). Wasn't a big fan of the italian restaurant, esthetically its gorgeous but the food is just ok and expensive. A side of potatoes meant 4 pieces of dry potatoes, and extra shrimp meant 3 pieces of shrimp for about $12. All in all its a great hotel if you want to be secluded and getaway from the world. If not, its still worth the stay just rent a car.

I was worried about our resort choice given the mixed reviews. The Gran Melia exceeded our expectations in several areas and was exactly as expected based on the poor reviews. The grounds are beautiful, the pools inviting, the beach clean. The beach does have boulders that define it, but they are easy to climb over and then we could walk along the water's edge. The common areas are relaxing, with cabanas, chaise lounges, comfortable couches. We had red level status, which does make a difference. Our room was spacious, very clean, had beautiful views of the ocean, and a comfortable bed. Red level guests also have access to a private pool and a happy hour lounge with good snacks. The red level lounge was closed when we arrived, and check-in took nearly 40 minutes, despite very few people in line. This pretty much defined the entire service experience at the resort ----- too few people to serve their guests. We ate at Nami, which was pretty good, especially the Nami roll. It was three times as expensive as sushi back home, but that's expected at a resort. The free breakfast is also good, with fruit, omlettes, pancakes, etc. We attempted a meal at Pasion, but we sat at a table for 40 minutes without drinks or an order being taken, so we just left. Our best meals were at the Loquillo Beach kiosks, so they are well worth the trip. As mentioned in other reviews, the room smelled musty and air conditioning units are very old. If you are sensitive to this because of allergies, you may want to consider another resort. Overall, this is a decent place to stay if you can afford the upgrade to red level. If you want a beautiful property and pools, Gran Melia delivers.

We were RedLevel guests and enjoyed the complimentary offerings. I give the hotel mostly a high rating for several reasons: - Cleanliness - Beautiful common areas and grounds - Good food - specifically the Asian fusion restaurant and the pool grill - Friendly staff On the other hand, there were other features about the hotel I didn't like as much. - I felt there was too much LCD screen advertising throughout the hotel lobby and grounds. Of course these were all featuring the hotel itself or it's other locations, but as someone who was vacationing I found it to be an eye sore. Also, I live and work near Times Square in NYC, so flashy advertisements while on vacation doesn't appeal to me very much. It took away from feeling fully relaxed in my opinion. - NO BEACH. I was VERY disappointed in the beach (or lack thereof). As others have posted, it is mostly rocky and very shallow in distance at many points. When we arrived for check-in, it was already very dark by the time we got to our ocean front room. Excited to see the beach the next morning, before breakfast we went down to explore it. We were SO disappointed! With the ocean on 3 quarters of the resort, is it too much to ask for a REAL beach?? If this is a must-have at your hotel choice, do not come to this hotel! -The hotel is pretty far away. We rented a car from the airport just for the needs of our itinerary. Little did we know, if you ever want to leave the Gran Melia, a car is a must! While it is close to the rain forest, we found it very far from the other points on the island we visited. Having a car, we tried not to let this bother us, but it's quite a drive even to the nearest highway. On late nights in other parts of the island, we found it cumbersome to make the drive back to Gran Melia. We made several visits to Old San Juan which averaged 40-45min.

We also enjoyed the Red Level pool and, by pure luck, got to spend the day in one of the cabanas. A couple of issues: The check-in process was unusually long. We waited about 2 hours before we got our room. We were told (after asking 3 times) that the delay was because they offered late check-out to the people in the room before us. I was also told the hotel had a full house. What hotel allows late check-out when all of the rooms are booked? Fortunately we were able to wait in the lounge and enjoy the free drinks. We were not too thrilled with leaving our luggage at the entrance, but in the end they were fine. Also, it seemed the resort was understaffed.

Do NOT stay here unless you get a really great package. Unfortunately we booked a non-refundable stay therefore even though we checked out a day early we couldn't get the last night back (and of course why would they go out of their way to accomodate us). A friend and I went for New Year's...Where should I begin? First of all, there is not much near the resort at all unless you have a rental car. Taxi to the hotel was about $70 without tip each way and around 45 minutes from the airport. There are only a few restaurants at the hotel and you are pretty much at their mercy. Every time we went to dinner we were rudely asked if we had reservations (which we did not) or we showed up at a restaurant only for it to be closed...I'm pretty sure no one walks off the street to this isolated place so why can't they seem to accomodate their own hotel guests? After waiting for a while to be seated service still did not improve. While the food was ok, the service was so slow. I ordered a martini and I had to keep asking the waittress to bring it and when she finally did it was undrinkable (and I'm not too picky in that regard). I wasn't asked what was wrong with it nor would I like something else and the drink I took two sips of showed up on the bill for around $14. The casino is SOOO SMALL. We gambled there every night and one night when it was a tiny bit more crowded they only had three or four tables open even though they had more tables, we were told they didn't have any more staff. Wouldn't they want to make as much money as they can? Also, you have to keep asking for the complimentary drinks that are supposed to come when you gamble...also note that they only give you wine or beer. Overall the staff doesn't care if you are enjoying your stay or not. I called the front desk for a wine opener and still had not received one the next day. I called several more times and finally an hour or so later after I had already shoved the cork down into the bottle did the corkscrew come. There is hardly any beach...those of you looking for a beach destination go somewhere else. We drove up to Bahia Resort which is the St. Regis and it looked beautiful. I would recommend renting a car unless you want to pay a lot for cabs. Loquillo beach is nothing to write home about, the kiosks are interesting but we didn't even stay on the beach five minutes. The rainforest was something to do so we hiked to the waterfall.....big let down if you've ever been to Hawaii. Also, we had a junior suite and even though the room was spacious and had marble it had an old box tv and smelled of mildew.

The rooms were big with a balcony for reading or taking in the sounds. The plants are nicely kept and the pool was amazing. 2.The resort is in a remote location so if you are planning not to eat there for 3 meals a day be prepared to drive 10-15 mins for food. Fortunately there is a great selection and the distance really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that big of a deal as long as you are aware of it. 3.We opted for the buffet breakfast and passed on lunch and dinner plans. Breakfast was generic, nothing special and the quality of food was a grade B at best. Nothing to rave about but good enough to get the day started. Since we did not lounge at the resort and ventured to El Yunque, Luquillo, and Fajardo, we knew we could grab food on the way back to the hotel. 4.Staff was all very friendly and helping. 5.There is a parking fee on top of a resort fee. We got a better deal calling the Resort directly versus any website! 6.The resort is located on a beach but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go in for two reasons.

Although the grounds are nicely kept there are no activities for the guests to partake in. The RECEPTION SERVICE was HORRIBLE! The wait for check-in in the evening with only two guests on the line in front of me was 35 minutes. My bill was incorrect and I was charged twice when I changed my credit card at check-out. The overall service was JUST AS BAD. We had a meal plan that NO waiter or host was familiar with and we spent every meal proving what our meal plan was. The poolside bar/restaurant was disgusting with birds everywhere and the waiters running around barely getting anything done. They really need to service the guests and walk around the poolside taking drink orders rather than asking a guest to wait on a 15-20 minute line just for a drink of water. The New Years Day buffet was uneventful. The salads and cheeses were not on ice and where wilted and melting by the time we ate at 2pm. The room service took over 25 minutes to make the order since they did not know what our meal plan covered and we still got charged for it with a room service charge and the tip included without anyone explaining that to us...we tippoed twice for cold food. The meal took over 1hr 20 minutes to reach the room. Although one or two of the waiters were personable - none were at the status of what is expected in a Gran Melia resort. At every meal we either had to request an item a second or third time or did not receive it at all. \"I'm sorry\" was a very common phrase. It seems as if turn-around is an issue with the hotel and is noticeable with the lack of service. Housekeeping was a MESS!! Literally, they never brought back a floor mat and I called every evening for a wash cloth. They never swept the floor and the bungalow entryway was extremely dirty. There was a smoker in the building who left ashes and cigarette buds every night and only the buds were picked-up and the floors never cleaned to take away the ash. The bed end cover and the decorative pillows were stained and yet they continued to place them on the beds. The seating areas in the lobby were just as bad with stains and I REFUSED to sit on them. The parking fee did not bother me, as all hotels except for motels charge you a fee, but I was charged twice for the self-parking. As well as charged for drinks during meals that were covered by our meal plan. I SUGGEST all guests CHECK THEIR BILLS before check-out. I would NOT recommend this resort to anyone.

However, the buildings (and some rooms) have visible mold, the pull out sofa that our daughters slept on was horrible (and after seeing cots sitting in the hallway for days we didn't dare ask for one...we were afraid they would be covered in bugs).

Here's my impressions: PROs 1. The people. Every person affiliated with the resort met me with a ready smile and a helping hand. And I mean EVERY. Fantastic, terrific people working at this resort, and really, working for you. 2. The facility. Beautiful, spacious, comfortable, swanky, private. From the lobby to the lounge areas to the pools to the beach, and everything in-between the facility is top-notch. 3. The bungalows. Attractive, comfortable, very upscale looking. Terrific showers, plush comfortable beds. What more could you ask for? IMHO, here's what: CONs 1. No complimentary wifi in the bungalows. C'mon already. I can get complimentary wifi at just about any McDonald's and Motel 6 on earth. But I can't get it at an upscale, world-class resort? Instead I have to pay $16+ per day for it? And there's not even wired Ethernet in the bungalows? Sorry, but no complimentary wifi and not even Ethernet is unacceptable in this day and age. 2. Self-parking is $16+/day. Really? C'mon, man. Do you really need this as a profit center? Yes, I know you can charge this, because we have no choice. But I'd prefer that you show a little more regard for your guests. 3. On-site prices are pretty extreme. Just because I can afford to pay $21 for a 'roni pizza or $16 for a tube of sunscreen doesn't mean I appreciate doing so. Again, show a bit more regard for your guests. Many airport vendors are now realizing the folly of gouging air travelers and have instituted \"same as retail\" pricing, as have many car rental companies. They, too, have captive audiences but they don't exploit them like they used to. It would be nice if this resort took the same approach. 4. Most people have iPods. This is because people's music tastes are varied. So then why do you blast music at your pools? When you this, everyone has to listen to whatever music you choose to play. Sometimes silence, or the ambient sounds of the world around, is nice. So don't think the entire world wants to listen to music 24/7. Walk around the pool and notice how many people have earbuds in their ears. That says something, if you're paying attention. 5. Ditto in the lobby/lounge areas. It's 6 days before Christmas and the music system is playing loud music (and not even Christmas music)...in the lounge areas! Again, we don't need to be bombarded and inundated with music or sounds during every waking hour. If we're in the lounge area we're probably reading, socializing, interacting with other people. Maybe soft background music would be ok, but loud pop music? Again, it's the lounge, not a nightclub. Treat it accordingly. 6. Not sure if this is the case in every bungalow, but ours had an old-fashioned picture-tube TV. Would be nice (though not essential, since we're not there to watch TV) to have more modern flat-screen TVs in the bungalows. 7. The tennis courts and basketball court are playable, but in need of some repairs. I realize the Cons are twice the number of the Pros, but that doesn't mean the resort was twice as negative as positive. Not at all. I will surely return, because the place and the people (especially the people!) are extraordinary. But I will put more advance thought and planning into my meal options, because the resort's prices are just not justifiable.

We only ate breakfast there so I cannot comment about lunch or dinner, but we all found breakfast to be quite forgettable. Breakfast is a buffet and wasn't particularly good. Most of the hot food was not hot and was picked at. The omelet stations were pretty good but whenever we seemed to be there, the lines were quite long. We actually did have lunch one day at the outdoor restaurant by the pool and the food and service was very good. The rooms were ok, but somewhat dated. Two of the nights we were there, the cleaning lady forgot to give us towels and we had to call to the front desk. Both times after we called, we got the towels almost immediately.

As a 2nd time traveler to PR, this was a Huge disappointment. There is nothing authentic about this hotel. It is 45 minutes from the airport. This could sound great if you end up in some super local spot, but you don't. You just end up a bit too far to really experience the island. Be prepared to feel very locked into the resort and their costs. Going out of the resort area is a task and bc you are in a remote location which is super expensive thus uber American sterotype, the locals in the area (rio grande) do not really care for you. On a good note, you are not too far from a couple of really cool island hops...Culebra Island and Vieques Island. There is nothing to see beyond San Juan west of the island. So, Old San Juan and East (island mentioned) are great routes. For a true love for the island, travel to Ponce....beautiful. This is south and east. As for the Gran Melia itself, I have stayed at a few Melia resorts and they have been quite lovely, this one is not. You are on a golf resort, so prepare to ride a cart to get to anything associated with the hotel and prepare to tip, tip tip and tip again. Drinks are $13. Small bottle sanpellagrino = $7.50. You are very locked to this resort. Have a car...that is $25 per day for parking btw. The rooms were clean and nice....not special or local feeling just clean. You could compare it to a Hilton stateside. Other things to keep in mind: $20 gym fee per day, $35 if you lose towel or room card, ice is a bit of a walk to get to, refrigerators are not allowed for personal use and you will be charged if anything is touched, you will be given a tour of the area via golf cart when you are there...have cash ready, magazines at gift shop are double priced and are several months old, bottled water (tap) $4, no bringing groceries in - you will be stopped by security and the will confiscate so keep it on the DL if you must. To summarize on the Gran Melia, I would never ever pay for this. If you must stay there due to a company paid trip, than great...it is a company trip so blah blah. Otherwise, you will feel like you are on a golf resort hotel anywhere US and once you leave you will not feel welcome just out of the gates. Oh and internet is $5 for every two minutes.

If you're looking for a great beach at the door step this is not the place. Luquillo Beach is about a 10 minute drive and is supposed to be very nice. Rt 3 is the main highway and had plenty of shopping plazas and places to eat. Some other folks in our group stayed at El Conquistador in Fajardo. They had a beautiful view but the Gran Melia definitely has a nicer facility. What I did like about the El Conquistador was the location. If you're not looking to spend a lot of time in San Juan and plan to spend more time on the beach or fishing, this is a better location. A $5 ferry ride gets you to Culebra which has powder sand beaches and excellent snorkelling. El Conquistador also has a private island called Palimino which is very nice and they have a free ferry for their guests. It is also close to several marinas which is something that I like since I will always fish multiple days on vacation. We fished with Captain Marcos Hanke. You can check him out at www.787fishing.com.

Until i went to the restroom. Their was hair all over the floor around the toilet and no soap just shampoo! So my husband tried to call the front desk to complain and request ammenities But of course with only one staff member at customer service no one answered the phone.

And an uncleaned room for 5 days as we were told that due to lay offs they were short staffed and that the suites on the ocean side were top priority! What the hell!! To top it all off they had no parking spaces available for paying guest! We had to park 10mins away in the condo area and had to walk back to the hotel in 100 degree weather and hope that someone will escort us back to our bungalow! Unfortunately we had to walk from there too. The power went out atleast 4 days we were there long before the hurricane and we were told abt the hurricane after it already arrived! Our room was so hot we had to go outside several times for relief! The beach looked NOTHING like the advertisement. The water was brown and full of seaweed. Their were sand fleas everywhere. We looked like we had some kind of disease after a 20min walk long the shore! Our legs were completely covered with flea bites needles to say we never went back to the Beach again!

It appears to be an upscale nice resort, but once you are there the staff is not helpful. We were charged for calling the front desk. This hotel does not even own their own parking lot. The company that does cares more about filling it up so there were a couple nights that we couldn't even park in the lot because it was full of people in the casino. Talk about customer service. To top it off, the parking charges were sporadic, some days we were charged others we weren't. The people on the golf carts never appeared to be around when you were carrying your stuff to your room after not being able to park in the hotel lot near the room. Also, they have sand flees. Don't plan on going to the beach you will come home looking like you have chicken pox. The other areas besides the main lobby and pool do not have the same grand appearance and looks completely different. It tries to be an upscale resort with the golf course but has no service and is lacking in consistency. Also, the dive shop listed on the website was very adequate, the people were very nice and professional. The guy that did the iron man was very personable and fun but the admin and the guy that we were in contact with also was gave us inaccurate info about visibility etc., which was not appreciated.

We booked one of the best rooms they have to offer, ocean front room with a hot tub on the balcony. Pictures looked amazing online and the place looked like it had a lot to offer. We did this all without looking up any reviews online...big mistake. When we checked in and were given a quick tour, the place looked amazing and seemed to have a lot to offer while we were not sight seeing. However, When we got into the room it wreaked of mold and mildew. We called the front desk to let them know, they said they would send someone over to freshen up the room. Thanks, but no thanks, I don't want to mask the moldy smell with air freshner and asked for another room. They were very responsive in getting us another room in a different building which was great, however this room smelled equally as bad and now it was almost 1am. We decided to stay the night since it was so late. Not one of our best ideas but we needed sleep from traveling. When we woke up and had sunlight in the room I was able to see the mold build up in the air conditioning vent. If the vent was that visible, I can only imagine what the entire AC unit looked like. I proceeded to the red level service desk and spoke with them about the situation. They offered me a new room, but at this point they were 0 for 2 and I just wanted to get out. They allowed me to cancel the rest of my reservation and charged me for only 1 night. We were guests for about 12 hours and still walked out with a $400.00 bill. I looked online at some other reviews and this mold issue appears to be going on for quite some time now, this is not a great revelation, I just did not do due diligence before booking. A few other bad notes about the resort, parking is $16 a day and was never mentioned until you pull into the place. They charger serv you for everything you do. If you fail to return a beach towel you are charged, if you lose a room key you are charged, if you loose the red level bracelet they make you wear you are charged, you cannot call a cab, you have to use there car service. Everything in this resort is a massive production, it takes about 10 minutes to park your car and just walk to your room. The plus side, the staff is very nice and friendly. The bell hops were hard working young guys and extremely friendly, the woman who helped me in the red level desk was very helpfu and nice. The problem with this resort had nothing to do with the staff, it is has to do with how the place is run from senior management/owners. Clearly the owners do not care for the wellbeing of there guests with black mold in ACunits. Black mold is unhealthy to breath in and I am surprised the health department has not stepped in.

The grounds are really amazing and beautiful, and the pool is well designed so it never feels crowded, and it's very kid-friendly. Those aspects get a 5 star rating from me. But the rooms are disappointing. The first room we were in had no bathtub (we're here for a week with a 5 year old who doesn't like showers), and they quickly switched us to the room next door that had a bathtub. So far so good. But this room smells mildewy. I thought the smell would go away over a day of A/C and being lived in, but it hasn't. The other problem is that they advertise these rooms as 'suites' but they're not suites at all. They are one long room, 2/3 taken up with beds, and 1/3 has a couch, small table and desk, and two chairs. Also a coffee maker with no filter. And curtains that don't quite close. And outside on the small balcony, two small plastic chairs (no cushions or anything of the sort) and a small plastic table. To me, this does not add up to a 'luxury suite,' as advertised. And it is very disconcerting given how nice the rest of the grounds are. For us this is a major problem, because we are here with our daughter who goes to sleep at 7. We always stay in suites when we travel, so we can close the bedroom door at 7 to let her sleep, but we can stay awake for a couple of hours with the lights on in the living space. I called the place I had made the reservation through (SaveOn Resorts) and they said they always have these rooms and if we want a different room we have to go through the hotel and pay the difference. Even though the word 'suite' seemed like false advertising, it seemed better to pay some more and move into a normal suite. But the front desk said none of the rooms have doors that close, they are all one big room unless you reserve 2 rooms with adjoining doors. So we're making the best of it, but it's disappointing.

A small town is just a 10 min or so drive away and I recommend making the drive if you'd like to buy wine, liquor, snacks or assorted sundries. Better yet, stop on your way in and stock up. Don't miss: The resort's large population of iguanas is fed at 10am every morning. *** I want to note that the hotel sends an email a few days following check-out requesting detailed feedback.

We have been to PR 6 times and this was our first time at this facility. It was easy to find off Hwy 3 and our check in went pretty well, especially considering it was the 3rd Monday in July, a holiday weekend. We arrived around 5:00pm and it took about 20min to get checked in and about 20min to get to our room. The place is very spread out and parking is minimal. From our room, it was 0.45 miles from where we parked, 0.25 miles from the pool, 0.2 miles from the restaurants, and 500 feet from the beach. They have golf carts ferrying people around, but it always seemed like there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one around when you needed it and requesting a ride from the front desk takes as long as walking. The distance away from everything was constantly an issue. We had a lot of trouble getting ice. It may have been because of the number of people there for the holiday, but it seems like you should plan your facilities around full capacity. The staff did realize the problem and were trying to help by putting out carts of ice to supplement the machines. The dining was great, though expensive. We ate at Pasi\u00c3\u00b3n, The Wet Pool Bar, and Tempo, with Pasi\u00c3\u00b3n being our favorite. One thing they could improve on is keeping a casual dining restaurant open into the evening. After a long day sightseeing in El Yunque, it would have been nice if there was a place to just grab a burger. Service was so-so. Once they brought my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meal 10 minutes before mine. We started the checkout process around 10:30am and we finally pulled away from the place at 12:15. The bulk of that time was spent in the checkout line. They had approximately 6 terminals, but only 3 employees working to check people out. If you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems with your bill, you could just drop one copy of the bill they slide under your door along with your room cards into a drop box. The problem was that we, along with the rest of the people in the line didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anything slipped under our door. All in all it was an ok stay. However, there were enough negative aspects to prevent us from returning. Puerto Rico has a lot of really nice resorts.

I rented three one bedroom \"time share\" units over 7 months before the trip and received a great rate at 1/3 of the going rate through Sol Melia's Vacation Club's own website. The signage on Hwy 3 in Puerto Rico, was very clear \"Coco Beach, Grand Melia\". However the signage to the resort is very poor from that point, keep on going to the end of the road to reach the Gran Melia resort. We rented two cars with GPS for the week. Vacation Club rentals have free parking. The vacation club rental units were beautiful and spacious. They included a jacuzzi and small kitchen. The grounds of the resort are beautiful and the rooms were cool and dry (great air conditioning). The negatives: the vacation club front desk was understaffed. They were very pleasant, but sometimes the wait was over 10 mins. The maid service was poor with inconsistant service (missing towels etc.) My unit had a jacuzzi and didn't work, no hot water for the tub, no light in the shower, no hair dryer and then the ceiling started to leak rain water onto our floors and bed. I complained and within the hour we were switched to a older unit, however it had a working jacuzzi, hot water and a light in the shower and a blow dryer, it also had a full frig., dishwasher and washer/dryer in the unit which was great. Suggestions: Vacation units should have the supplies necessary to use the items included like dishwashing soap, sponges, dishwasher soap and washer detergent. The units were missing a \"service requested\" or \"Do not disturb\" type door hanger, we needed to request them. Units with washer/dryers use laundry rooms, however many dryers were out of order.

We checked in Dec 12th and stayed for 9 days for our Honeymoon. We rented a car and arrived in the late evening. We did not have to wait in line. We were checked in quickly and someone helped us to our room. The room was AMAZING!!! We had a Jr suite with a garden view. It was low season so we didn't notice too many people around. The pool was HUGE! I don't remember ever seeing the swim up pool bar open, but we didn't stay around the resort too much during the day. The beach is so beautiful. It is not a swimming beach as it has a lot of rocks and it is thick with sea grass. But still very beautiful to look at. If you want a beach to lay on and swim in then you can easily go 15 mins down the road to one. There is not much close to the resort, so unless you plan on spending A TON of money eating at the resort and just laying around the pool I HIGHLY recommend renting a car. Parking is expensive though. There is a little bakery as you are driving in to the resort, I think it is called Coco's. They had good food. You aren't supposed to take food or drink on the property. The first few days though my husband was sick with a fever and so he had to stay in. I had a beach bag that I smuggled food into him. I got food from Coco's and there is a grocery store up the street that has a little lunch line where we were able to get a BIG plate of food for around $5. We would split those almost every day. We did upgrade to the royal service for our last night. This allowed us access to the adults only pool with a Bali bed (VERY NICE) and we had a beach view and a private Jacuzzi on the balcony. Both rooms were HUGE and AMAZING though. The royal service breakfast was really wonderful! And it was nice that they had the cocktail hour. We went and got Champagne to go and took it to dinner with us. We only ate dinner in one of the restaurants. It was good, but was no better than some other restaurants that we had found that were less expensive. I would HIGHLY recommend this resort! Especially in down season when it is not too busy.

We were definitely scared about what this trip would turn out to be. Upon check in, we opted to upgrade to Red Level and the couple next to us was yelling at another staff member about how horrible their stay was. I eavesdropped and learned it had little to do with the staff and more to do with the fact their travel agency claimed this was an all-inclusive resort. They also were upset that a hotel employee said a taxi would cost about $60 to San Juan and they were charged $85. Regarding the taxi service, we got a cab from the air port and paid $65. He gave us his business card and we called him to get us. This is a reasonable rate. It's about a 35 minute drive to San Juan and price of gas, as expected on an island, is a little higher than the price here in Chicago. It would be cheaper for you to rent a car ON SITE if you need to go anywhere, because daily parking is $16 or $20. The grounds were immaculate. The buildings are all gorgeous and frankly the price of food and drink was not high for a resort. If you are not expecting resort fees I can see it coming as a bit of a shock. $9 for a drink is normal. $16 for a burger is normal. This is, as they say, how it goes. The room was beautiful and for us, the upgrade to Red Level and ocean front was worth it. This allowed us to get away from the other guests. The staff was awesome, too. I never had a problem with them. Everyone was always very nice and accomodating. We ordered room service twice and got it delievered within 45 minutes - which is reasonable. It was always hot and it was worth it. We ate at Wet, Pasion, Cafe Soliel, and all were good. Red Level service was the only way to make this trip bearable and I suppose this is the reason I would never go back. As I stated before, we found the other guests to be brash and loud. I was annoyed with the people who demanded to be served like kings and queens by a staff who was very clearly over their attitude problems. They left trash everywhere, got a little too drunk, a little too loud, and a lot of kids were completely out of control. They complained incessantly about everything, including the price of food which they had ordered and was clearly marked. I have never witnessed so much complaining in my life and that caused my mood to decline. Red Level gives you a private pool with a guy on security detail who checks wristbands. Someone complained about that before, and I assume it's because they weren't paying for the upgrade because I'd probably be very ticked if they DIDN'T check. The drinks are watered down. I brought my own liquor in mini bottles to compensate and saved quite a bit of money over the course of 6 days. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable, and I was concerned about the air conditioning not working but upon arrival I can tell you what the problems really could be - PR has high humidity. Very high. Air conditioning units aren't going to eliminate everything. Could you still feel SOME of it? Yes, absolutely. But the room was cold. It did have a faint odor, but honestly... I have never been to a carribbean resort without some sea humidity effects with the exception of a highrise in Mexico. There is no beach to speak of, and I was disappointed that for many days we had no wind (the resort faces the leeward side of a peninsula) and the absence of waves sucked. This probably compounds the issue with people at the pool because there is nothing else really to do there. I never went into the main pool, but stayed in ours. Contrary to the signs, the pools do NOT close early and are, in fact, open 24 hours. You do get a pool card, and they will charge you for late pool towel return. But you really, really don't need a towel. It was hot enough to dry off very quickly and this time of the year it wasn't chilly even at night. Red Level's cocktail hour is beer, wine, soft drinks, water, and sangria. Sangria was awesome. You can get bottled water all day for free if you are RL. Breakfast is included and worth it, but don't be fooled by the separate dining. It seems if you are newly checked in, they seat you in separate rooms. However, after day two we were seated with the still out of control masses. Annoying, but no different than say a Denny's on a Saturday morning. Expect that. Paying for things could be tricky. As I said, we upgraded and paid $75 PP. In addition to that, you MUST pay a $100/night inccidental charge they will refund after you check out. It is charged all at once. 6 days, $600. If you don't have space on your card, you need to tell them. We saw MANY people who didn't and then started freaking out. The resort either charges things to your room or you pay with another card for purchases. We charged everything to our room and had no issues with our bill, probably because we noticed you must return pool towels by 6PM regardless of your swimming. The resort is very secure, and as I said, the only issues were with other guests. It wasn't everyone, but it was enough for us to give pause. It seems there are locals who come in on the weekend and get drunk and rowdy, and I could see problems happening from them clashing with other people for sure. Security was always around though. Lots of iguanas, lizards, PR tree frogs, toads, and birds. In the end, we spent way more money than I thought this would cost and it would have been in our best interest to go to another resort for more money, maybe in Fajardo and ferry over to an island off the main one. Rent a car for a day from Avis (no parking fee) and go to El Yunque. It was very pretty. We drove around the east end and up to Old San Juan (the driving wasn't worth it, nothing to see). We had our best meal in Old San Juan and it was wonderful to go there. Stay close to Columbus Square and be vigilent, we were close to an attempted mugging about 50 feet from the square on a side street.

I waited about an hour and five minutes from the end of the line to front desk. It amazes me that such a large resort has ONLY 3 employees working the front desk. **The private beach is inadequate so much that I went off the resort to a local beach (Unfortunately I can't remember the name of the beach). The gran Melia beach is lined with rocks and boulders and there are practically zero waves. I don't recall any swimmers whatsoever to give you an idea. This is no fault of the resort but if you're looking for a private beach -- LOOK ELSEWHERE. ** Lots of walking and the parking is a joke. If you rent a car, self parking is roughly $16 and valet is $21. I don't mind paying for parking since it seems that every resort in the area charges something similar. What I do have an issue with is if I'm a guest staying at the resort and there is NO available self parking and you are FORCED to valet. Pros: ** The main lobby is pretty awesome. Unfortunately they probably needed to spend a little less on the lobby and more on the rooms. The rooms are pretty spacious and probably per sq footage the best value of what I saw. The mini fridge was not stocked either which I didn't mind since I bought drinks at the local Walgreens. ** Red Level butler service. These guys are great and always more than willing to help you with whatever you need. The vast majority of my interaction with the staff was with the butler service. Tips that can help: ** Rent a car!!!! It cost me roughly $115 to rent a car for 5 days and I couldn't imagine being stuck on resort for my entire trip. I believe if you rent a car thru Avis the resort waives the parking -- I booked thru Enterprise so I wouldn't know. ** Red Level service -- there is almost ZERO difference in the rooms vs the standard room.

Yes is true you have to walk to get to the lobby, the pool and the restaurants, but please people dont be so lazy!!!!! is not even a 5 minute walk!!!!! and most of the time golf carts from the hotel are passing by to take you.

Also, there are 2 walgreens and a supermarket close to the hotel where you can buy some snacks and beverages so you dont have to buy at the usual hotel-expensive prices, but buy a little cooler or something because there is no fridge in the rooms.

I will let management know of their incompetence upon check-out. It's a shame that for a large hotel in a resort setting they treat the customer as if they're \"doing us a favor\". Older people and children had 4 and 5 hour waits from what we could hear.

The facility is beautiful and our rooms were clean, luxurious, and comfortable. It was exactly to our liking, though some might feel too far separated from town. The hotel is about 20 minutes east of town on the coast which was terrific for us. A car rental is your best bet unless you are one to stay at the facility or to only do tours. We like exploring at our own pace. We elected the Red Level Service which was well worth the extra money--it included breakfast each day, attentive service from the butler/pool staff and refreshments from 6-9 each evening. Here is is only real criticism of the stay. Red level service says it includes \"open bar\" with house brands. It DID NOT include liquor--they only served wine, beer and champagne. We ate at various restaurants on the island as well as two on-site. Both the Asian and Italian restaurants were exceptional. My compliments to our butlers Angel, Eddie, and Joshua who were outstanding. I must relay that the facility is quite large and golf carts are running through the facility constantly for a ride to your destination; walking between destinations is most common-- or you may call for a special ride such as loading your luggage. Drivers were all very courteous and helpful. Remember tipping and bring dollars. The casino is quite small. Parking is an extra expense unless you rent your car from the concierge at the hotel. Having an \"all adult\" pool included in the Red Level service is a real plus. I am not really a beach addict, but others said the beach area was a little rocky. Our pool was beautiful and we could reserve a cabana for the day if we chose. I would DEFINITELY return to the luxurious Gran Melia on future trips. Oops, forgot to mention the architectural beauty of the facility and the wonderful works of art throughout. Evenings, the hotel is exceptionally beautiful with candles lighting all the public areas, creating a romantic atmosphere--lots of ambiance. Just make sure the location is to your liking--if you want to walk to restaurants and clubs, this is probably not your best choice. Check-in and out was expeditious for us on Tuesdays.

My husband and I found this resort on price line (considered 5 starts). We checked in late on Sunday night, mentioned it was our honeymoon and asked if we could upgrade to an ocean view/front room. The women at the front desk agreed but said it would be an additional $75 (not including taxes etc etc) per night....we wanted to relax the first three days and then planned on going on day trips the rest of the week, so we upgraded for just 3 nights and then on Wednesday would downgrade to our original reserved room. All of the Ocean Front rooms are considered \"Red Level\" , so included in our upgrade was red level access which means 1. Free Breakfast every morning (they have everything at the Breakfast restaurant...omelets, pancakes bacon, muffins bagels you name it) 2. Access to one of the 5 butlers at the resort (the butlers can make you reservations, reserve private bungalows, draw a bath with rose petals and make towels out of swans, candles on your balcony...whatever). 3. Free Happy Hour 6-9 House Wine and Beer Only 4. access to the private pool with private bungalows, bar etc....no children allowed....This is totally worth it Just for the pool, room and Breakfast alone. While we were red level guests the service was really good.....and then we downgraded... BIG mistake! We packed up in advance so we could switch rooms quickly and go on our tour of the Rain forest we had planned ....We called at 11am to let them know our bags were ready to be moved at 12:15 still no sign of the bellman we called three more times...still no sign. Finally at 1:00 someone shows up to move our bags and we arrive to our new room...it was dirty ( I mean cob webs, dirt on the walls, bugs in the tub etc and had an overwhelming smell of mildew/mold. The couch was covered in black mold on one side. We called to switch rooms the front desk never called us back so we went back to the front desk told them we were late for our tour and we had a problem with the room. They said someone would come spray the room while we were gone and if that didn't fix the problem they would move us. We arrived back at the hotel around six. No one had sprayed our room or followed up on this. It took an hour and a half to get the head of housekeeping to come out and \"smell\" the room. He immediately agreed it was really bad and left to see what he could do. He came back and showed husband two other rooms options. All we wanted was a clean room that didn't smell like mildew...were not picky. Going back forth with the front desk getting the housekeeping supervisor out to the room to see for himself and then moving rooms again took 3 hours that night and 5 hours out of the entire day....I found this ridiculous. The Controller on duty called to verify the sequence of events (she has the story all wrong) and offered to comp our breakfast the next day and send us a bottle of champagne. My point is if you stay here, only stay as a red level guest or it's not worth it. I would also buy a few staples, beer, liquor and mixers, to go cups, at the liquor store down the street I cannot remember the name of the store, but it is at the light/across the street at the intersection at the end of the main street to get into Gran Melia next to Martinis (they only except cash but have good prices on liqueur) and snacks at Amiga (the Grocery about 5 minutes away). Because room service and all of the restaurants on this resort are extremely overpriced. You can walk around with drinks or pack a small cooler with a few drinks for the pool so you are not spending $150+ just on drinks everyday. I would also venture off a couple of nights for dinner and lunch off the resort. We went to Richie's about 10 minutes away in Rio Mar. This place is a little pricey but has an amazing view, great food and great drinks!! If you just want to grab a quick dinner or get something to go, I would go to the Kiosks about 10 minutes way from the hotel. There are about 30 Kiosks each with different types of food...from Pizza to authentic Puerto rico specialties.. as well as sit down restaurants and bars. The first time we went to the Kiosks it was during the day and it looked a little scary (because the majority of the Kiosks were closed) but after doing some research we learned that at night they open all the kiosks it's mixed with locals and tourists and all of the kiosk owners must be licensed to serve food...it was a much better experience. Many of the vendors take credit or cash. For a quick lunch check out La Familia Bakery 2. They have amazing desserts and fresh baked sandwiches. The Cuban and Tripleta Sandwiches are great they also have breakfast sandwiches with eggs and ham...sugar free desserts as well. We did eat at the Asian restaurant on the resort on our last night. The Sushi was really good and we got out of there with 2 drinks a few Sushi rolls for about $100. We only checked out the private pool during our stay I believe only red level is allowed at the private pool during the day. The private pool was great, but we met a lady that said her daughter would not get in the regular/main pool because it was filthy. I had never been to a casino, but we did try out the one on the resort, It's the type of casino you would spend an hour max of your time... it's pretty small they say drinks are on the house but it is nearly impossible to find the waitress (plus the drinks are pretty bad) and they only come around if you are spending lots of $$. I would again grab a drink from the bar and bring it in or make your own and bring it to the Casino. The Market is the little shop/bakery/coffee shop on the resort. I will say they have AMAZING Espresso and Coffee (I am a HUGE fan of starbucks and I thought there espresso was better at the Market). The Resort beach is nice, there are hammocks and lounge chairs set up along the beach, you have a lot of privacy...keep in mind though this is not a beach where you can swim out in the water because it is rocky and rough. We rented a car at Enterprise for our stay because we wanted to do things off of the resort....(there is nothing in walking distance of the resort) If you have a car rental make sure you budget for parking I think it's around $16 a day (do self park, valet is not worth it). If you don't rent a car, I believe they have have Avis rental on site so you may be able to to do daily rentals. Also make sure you allow yourself enough time to check out the day you leave. Check out is 12pm ...We left on Sunday and had to wait in an hour long line to check out. They leave a list of all your charges in your door the night before you leave. Take time in the morning to make sure you don't have any charges to dispute etc..because this could take even longer to check out. Overall the resort is beautiful, the decor is outstanding and it is really relaxing. The service definitely needs to improve, and food and drinks are overpriced ....I would recommend this resort if you can get a good deal on price line and upgrade to red level...if not I would look else where.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWe loved this place!!!\u201d", "Author": "admneely", "ReviewID": "UR114735347", "Content": "My wife and i had a great time here.

On reaching there the receptionist insisted on putting a wrist band on me and informed me that according to the agreement I signed, if I lose the band I would have to pay $50. The best was when I was told that if I did not return the pool towels before checkout I would be charged $35 per towel. The bell boys were also rude. The guards would make it a point to shine light on us at night in the pool to ensure that we had 'bands' on. I was told the Hot tub was part of the spa which closes at 6 pm - which defeats the purpose of a hot tub, who wants to go during the day in the heat. Overall a very annoying experience. And the main pool water was literally green all the time. The room phone had a print stating $2 per minute will be charged for dialing toll free numbers - someone should tell these guys the definition of a toll free number. Considering guests pay so much for a night, one would think complimentary wi-fi would be present, but no, of course not. After 3 days when I diligently returned everything and made it a point to look at my check out sheet - I had a charge of $70 for pool towels and two charges for drinks at a bar which I never went to.

I do not know even where to start. The grounds are beautiful and at night the whole place it lit up with soft trail lights, pool lighting and even candles.

The breakfast is to die for with every type of food you can imagine available. Any room/level of service would be great but if you are willing to spend a few extra bucks I would highly recommend upgrading to red level service. You get an ocean view room with jacuzzi on the balcony, free open bar for a couple of hours in pm, butler service, exclusive pool that is adult only and so much more. Eddie, Joshua and Angel were the butlers that made our trip go so well. They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.

They will charge your credit card (or you can pay in cash) a $100 a day for incidentals (meals, excursions, etc...anything you get you just charge to the room). If you do not use the amount held they refund it back. We had no issues with our bill and check out was a breeze. The other thing is you should know that the ocean around the hotel is beautiful but due to a lot of seaweed growth it is not the best for swimming. However, you have clear ocean views from the pools which are spectacular and you can rent snorkeling gear and kayaks. The water is caribbean blue and you can go out in some places but water shoes should be worn. All in all it was the best vacation we have had and I can't wait to go there again.

We have been thoroughly disappointed. The main part of the resort is actually very nice. Nice main building and the main pool is pretty nice as well. We came over Memorial Day weekend and it was jammed packed with locals celebrating the holiday. All those people made for a very dirty pool that was never cleaned up after the fact. We had a royal service room which was not worth the money. The only thing it got us was free breakfast each morning, which was great. The food is really not good and is ridiculously overpriced. I would say you'll spend about $70-$90 on food (and thats with a free breakfast). You have virtually no options for outside food venues as the resort is isolated. We brought tons of food with us (b/c of our toddler) and even that didn't cushion the monetary blow we took to pay for gross food. There are NO microwaves or fridges in the room so its virtually impossible to eat anything for meals aside from the hotel food. Now, onto the room. The room itself, at face value, is nice. However as soon as you enter the room you can't escape the smell of mildew. And the humidity. O.M.G, the humidity. Now you would expect it outside, but in the room as well WITH AC blasting?! What do you get when you combine these 2 forces? A sticky, yet cold place to sleep. Not so conducive for comfort OR allergies.

Oh, and also, there is no swimmable beach. You have a beautiful coastline with inaccessible public swimming. That was probably my single biggest disappointment. I can swim in a pool at home for free. The staff is really awful. They are unknowledgable and make mistakes constantly. While I understand that PR is Spanish-speaking, you would think working in hospitality at the kind of resort GM \"claims\" to be, you should be able to converse with people a little bit easier when they screw up your dinner reservation.

I booked our reservations on a 3rd party site, so when I called the hotel to confirm (which was unnecessary), I learned that we would still have to pay the resort fee - because it isn't included in the fee that you pay on priceline, expedia or orbitz. We stayed at the Gran Melia for 9 days and 8 nights! I called ahead to make sure of what would happen at check in and I read on one of the reviews that there was a charge to your card for incidentals. I inquired as to what would happen if we didn't have money on the card to cover incidentals and I was told that we could leave cash at the front for the incidentals, but if we only left the minimum ($100); that our account would be closed - meaning you can't charge anything to the room. This was perfectly okay with me, especially after reading about all of the issues that guests have had on their bill at the check out. I also liked the fact that nothing could be charged to the room, because then every charge would have to be approved by me before payment was made....it worked out very well for us. By the way, the hotel doesn't accept cash as a form of payment, so everything has to be paid with a debit or credit card. This is good to know, especially if you were going to give them a card for incidentals - you may not have funds available after the $100 per day incidental charge and having to pay for things with that same card. So, we gave them $300 cash at check in and used the card to pay for everything. Next, I strongly suggest that you sigh up for a MAS rewards card before you arrive. You don't need the actual card, but you need a printout of the temporary card or the card because it will save you quite a bit on the breakfast buffet. There were 2 of us and we went to breakfast and the bill before the MAS card discount $44. (I can't remember if that was before the tax and gratuity or after, but $44 none the less) and after the MAS card discount which also earns you points the total after tax was$23.54. I thought this price was extremely reasonable with the spread and the cooked to order omelets. We never did eat at any other restaurant on the property because we rented a car. You definitely need a rental car at this property because after you get on the road that the resort is on, it is a 3.9 mile drive to the resort and we met a couple that was going to walk, but even the locals suggested against that. We rented the car from Enterprise and paid around $120 for the week for a compact car. Now, this was extremely reasonable, but remember that there is a charge of $15. per day before tax for self parking. Including this charge, we paid $250 for the week for the car and parking, but that was still incredibly reasonable since the cost per person of a shuttle to and from the hotel from the airport was between $64-$72 per person each way. Then we would have been trapped at the hotel and forced to overpay for the food that may have been mediocre. We wanted to experience local puerto riccan food and without the car, that wouldn't have happened. Gas is sold in liters in PR, so it was $.99 a liter - about $3.78 a gallon, we filled up once the whole week and returned the car. Thanks to having the vehicle, we were able to go down to the Luquillo beach kiosks to eat and relax on the beach several days. There are 60 different kiosks there and about 45 of them were open. We ate at La Parilla twice, the food is excellent, but beware there are no refills on the soft drinks. It may sound ridiculous, but 1 soda was like $2.75 so if 2 of you have a refill and are unaware, the bill is going up quickly. The next place that we loved we El Jeffe - it's a burger place that also has amazing Pina Coloda's, for probably the best price on the island $3 without rum and $5 for the alcoholic version. Jesus, the concierge at Gram Melia suggested trying the kiosks and we were so glad that we did. The resort is on a beach, but it isn't the best beach in PR. However, making the 10 minute trip to Luquillo is definitely worth it. The beach had amazing waves and was consistent - you could walk out and have sure footing. It was great. There is a great bakery \"Coco Sweet\" that is at the beginning of that drive down to the hotel and they have some amazing donuts. They also serve lunch around 1 and make sandwiches when they aren't serving lunch. We didn't upgrade our room to any of the special services levels, and I was very concerned after reading reviews, but our room was perfect. It was clean, the shower was clean and everything was perfect. The \"chambermaid\" as they were called, came everyday and did an amazing job of keeping the room clean. Our linen was clean and everything was awesome in this aspect. I would be curious to know what villa or bungalow the people that had dirty rooms stayed in. We stayed in building 2. We were also close enough to things that we didn't need the shuttle service for everything. We met a couple that paid $900. for 3 days in building number 16. This did include access to the private pool, but we didn't need that. The pool at it's peak only had 20 people in it, so it was never busy. Check in and checkout was a breeze, neither took more than 10 minutes, so I was thrilled with that and the service that we received was impeccable. The shuttles may take a little bit to arrive (5 minutes) if you call for one, but they do come and they are very friendly. The casino was quiet during the week and busy during the weekend, the main waitress was horrible. She only came around to offer drinks about once an hour. This didn't matter to me (I don't drink at all) but the premise behind serving continuous drinks at a casino is to get people to be loose with their money. They should fire her and hire one of the other 2 ladies that worked the casino, they did a much better job. They kept the drinks coming and people were gambling into the wee hours of the night. They were kicking people out at 3 when they closed. We will go back to this resort in the future since we had such a positive experience at this resort!!!", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cParadise\u201d", "Author": "MrsSharer", "ReviewID": "UR110714275", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Melia for our honeymoon in May. I've been to several all-inclusive resorts in Mexico so I wasn't sure what to expect. We purchased the red level package, which I highly recommend. The service was impeccable. All we had to do is ask and whatever we wanted was delivered or done immediately. The grounds are amazing and the resort is immaculately groomed. This is a great place to just sit back and relax. There is no night life, so if you are looking to party you will want to pick another resort. The food is on par with most four star restaurants with the price of five star. We used the 20% discount card that comes with the red level service and the prices were more doable. Don't forget to present the card, they will not automatically give you the discount. With the red level you get free beer and wine from 6-9 in the red level lounge, which prevented us from ordering alcohol at the restaurants and greatly reduced our bills. You cannot use cash at this resort, everything must be charged to your room. Drinks are very expensive here. On our way to the resort we had our driver stop at a local grocery store which sells liquor. We had a small soft side cooler which we used to bring liquor and mixers to the pool each day to help with the alcohol cost. Of course, we bought some drinks from the bar too and no one ever said anything to us about doing this. Both pools are beautiful, and if the main pool got too busy, we just had our butler set up a bali bed at the private adult only pool where it was always quite and relaxing. You must do the bali beds, if you make reservations with your butler they will make it up for you and decorate it with flowers and it really makes you feel special. The beach was very pretty, but not much for swimming. There is no surf because the waves break at a reef prior to reaching the beach. Honestly, we never missed getting beach time because the rest of the resort was so beautiful. We took the excursion on the catamaran and went snorkeling. We went to a white sand beach with crystal blue water and visited one of the most memorable reefs I've ever seen. This is a must do. If you want to go to Old San Juan, rent a car from at the resort. It was $50 versus a $180 cab ride and the roads are navigable. Just beware that there aren't many street signs once you leave the highway. The resort will provide you with maps and suggestions. There is also a local restaurant called Ritchies that will provide a complemantary car to pick you up if you want to dine off site, just ask your butler to arrange it. The rooms were above average, but not stunning. The bed was very comfortable and our chambermaid cleaned twice a day and provided turn down service. Overall, I was very pleased. We stayed 6 days and our bill from food and alcohol was $900 not including tips, even with being a bit frugal. We felt like this was worth the money with the quality of food and drinks. Suggestions: tip well (it is worth the service you get), use all the amenities available to you to get the most for your money, leave the resort for at least on excursion, try the Puerto Rican restaurant (Passion) and order something you've never tried, and get to know your butlers beacuse they will go above and beyond if you are personable.

The distance from point A to point B isn't bad. Maybe those people don't like to take a 3 minute walk. I don't know. But they do have staff riding around to give you a ride on their golf carts. So for those of you who think walking for 3 minutes is too much, there ya go! This resort is honestly at the end of a pretty shady road lol the locals love parking on the side of the road all throughout Puerto Rico for whatever reason, and on the road leading to the resort, it's no differnt; besides them coming out of the bushes with machetes; again, for whatever reason. DO go into Old San Juan. La Barrachina is delicious. I recomment the crab cakes and pina colada. Golfing at the resort is $140! Another $40 to rent clubs. Looking at the golf club and Trump's other investments, you feel sorry for him. They're really bad investments. But the land is beautiful! Just sorely occupied. The food is okay. It's hard to give compliments having been at their ME by Melia in Cancun. That knocked this place out of the water.

But we were treated graciously at every turn by staff and guests alike. From the lobby onwards, the property is just breathtakingly gorgeous. Our room was huge and well appointed. The food at Pasion was delicious -- a shade pricey but I expected that. The pool alone is worth the visit. I was so very sad to leave that little bubble of peace. I didn't get to go to the spa, but even just being on the property made my stress melt away. It is for sure not a budget stay. The breakfast was quite expensive -- that was the only part I thought was over priced. But seriously, I had a two year old cranky boy with me and didn't catch flack for it from anyone at any time.

The room was huge but my complain is the sheets, the room is like 5 star but the sheets are terrible!! Nice towels and soaps, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash smells good.

The way the shower was installed made it impossible to use without flooding half the room.

Really, the only thing wrong with this hotel at all is the over-priced crappy food. Here's the real deal: Hotel: Check-in and check-out were a breeze, except for one thing. When we first checked in and got to our room, our key didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. But that was easily solved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we picked up the courtesy phone in our building and called the front desk. Within 5 minutes, an employee arrived and let us in. They then made us new keys and slid them under the door so we had them the next morning. No problem. The grounds were absolutely beautiful. Lots of iguanas too! The shuttles were usually pretty timely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most of the time we called them, and by the time we walked outside, one was waiting to pick us up. You can also flag them down. Many drivers ask people walking if they need a ride. But our building wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that far from the main lobby anyway. Hotel advice: 1. Get the Mas card before you arrive. This is a frequent stay card for the hotel similar to a frequent flyer card with the airlines. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c go to http://www.solmelia.com/mas-rewards/mas.htm, and click Register Now. They will mail you the card. If you have that card, you can get 2 for 1 breakfast at the buffet breakfast place, Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Soleil. You can also get a small discount at the other restaurants, but more on those later. 2. Rent a car. Rent a car. Rent a car. I cannot stress this enough. If you do not rent a car, you will be resigned to eating every single meal at the expensive (and not very good) restaurants at the hotel. There are tons of meal options outside of the hotel. Plus then you can drive to other attractions and beaches. Parking is $16/day. You can reserve a rental car ahead of time online, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite cheap. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way more expensive if you wait and do it from the hotel. Just use Expedia or Kayak.com or something, and pick the least expensive option. We rented from Dollar and had no problems. 3. If you plan on getting Royal Service, do so ahead of time when you are booking. We were planning to do the upgrade when we got to the hotel, but we were unable to because the hotel was fully booked and there were no upgrades available. But we later realized that we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really sure if the Royal Service upgrade is really worth the $50 per person per day charge anyway. Our room was just fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were actually in one of the RS buildings but did not have an ocean view room. That was just fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just step outside and walk 2 steps and there is the ocean. Hotel Restaurants: Pasion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Although this restaurant is on the hotel grounds, Pasion is not actually part of the hotel like the other ones. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owned and operated separately. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept the Mas card there. This place has authentic Puerto Rican food, which was pretty good. However the service absolutely sucked. Nami \u00e2\u20ac\u201c In contrast to Pasion, this Asian restaurant had excellent service and crappy food. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Soleil \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This is the buffet style restaurant. While we were there, there was a convention in town, so it was never open for dinner unfortunately. The breakfast there was pretty good, as buffets go. They had a waffle/pancake station, omelette station, bacon/sausage/eggs/potatoes, bread/pastries/fruit/cereal. The breakfast price includes coffee and orange juice. Remember to use your Mas card here for 2 for 1 breakfast. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Royal Service, your breakfast is free. Puerto Rico in general: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ok to drink the water. We drank tap water all week and were absolutely fine. Pretty much everybody speaks English, but obviously the preferred language is Spanish. There are fast food restaurants practically on every block \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially Burger King, McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Subway, and KFC. These are all very close to the hotel, in Luquillo. If you plan to drive there, be aware that Puerto Ricans do not believe in using turn signals. If you are used to driving in a large metro area, you will do just fine. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting it to be leisurely and scenic, you will be disappointed. They drive pretty aggressively, and as long as you conform to that driving style, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do fine. As for the scenery, our hotel is not in that great of an area. In fact, the surrounding area is pretty run down. There are some scary looking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153restaurants\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the side of the road, and every building/ house in the area has bars on the windows. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really what we experienced in most parts of Puerto Rico that we drove to, with the exception of Old San Juan. Things we did: Camuy Caves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c If you have a rental car, this is a highly suggested attraction to drive to. The drive is long, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the other side of the island \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think it took us over 2 hours to get there, and when we got there, THE CAVE WAS CLOSED. We were so mad and disappointed. Sometimes they close it due to cave flooding. But while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out that way, you can always go to the nearby Arecibo Observatory, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a total wasted trip. Arecibo Observatory \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest radio telescope. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite impressive to see, and they have a visitor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s center you can walk around in. This telescope was featured in the movie Contact. We had a very yummy pina colada here at the little shack on the hike up to the observatory. Foodie Tour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We did the Flavors of San Juan Foodie Lunch Tour. While we were glad we did the tour, we were slightly disappointed in it. We felt it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the money. But we did get to sample foods we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have otherwise known about, and we got an American\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of how it is to live in PR. There are other food tours there that may be better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c google them. Segway Tour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This was one of the highlights of our trip! We booked through Segway Tours of Puerto Rico, and did the Fortifications tour. This tour was worth every penny ($84 pp). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so fun to ride Segways, the scenery was amazing, the obstacles were fun (done in Old San Juan), and it included a tour of El Morro (a must-do!). You catch the tour at the pier where the cruise ships doc. So, so fun. Vieques \u00e2\u20ac\u201c If you can, I highly suggest a side trip for a couple of days to the island of Vieques. We flew Cape Air in a 6-seater Cessna plane to get there. Vieques has a much different feel than PR. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small pristine island with great beaches and breezy island open-air bars and restaurants. But the best thing on Vieques \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something I am very thankful to have done in my lifetime \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is swimming and kayaking in the Bioluminescent Bay. Also known as Mosquito Bay, this is the best and brightest place in the world to see the glowing water. Google it, and DO IT. It is the experience of a lifetime. Luquillo Beach / kiosks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Luquillo Beach is actually quite nice, and a very short drive from the hotel (10 min?). They have full facilities there, which you pay like $2 per person for. Showers, lockers, bathrooms, etc. You can rent beach chairs and umbrellas as well. Snorkeling there was undesirable (no fish), but the beach scenery is beautiful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c white sand, palm trees, blue water. Reminded me of Hawaii. There are a ton of tiny restaurants they call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kiosks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd right along the side of the road, near the beach. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very odd, because every single one of them had the same food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all fried stuff. The food was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ok\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6most of it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day when we were there. But you should experience it at least once. Old San Juan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Take a drive to Old San Juan one day and just walk around. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much like the French Quarter in New Orleans with the wrought iron balconies and cobblestone streets. And the forts are there to add to the scenery, as well as the ocean. They have some really good restaurants around there. One of our best meals was at Old Harbor Brewery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a steakhouse in the heart of Old San Juan. El Yunque Rainforest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Drive to the rain forest. This is a must-do, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to do because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite close to the hotel. Visit the Visitor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Center there, and take the scenic drive up the mountain, through the rainforest. Stop and take a short hike if you want. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VERY scenic, and you can do as little or as much as you want to. You could spend an hour there or you could spend all day there.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Langley", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "babyzena", "ReviewID": "UR104246980", "Content": "I had read the reviews on this resort prior to our arrival and I must say I was shocked at all the negative responses given, now that I have been there.

A bit pricey at Tempo and Nami as well as Pasion but worth the value. If you like large cheeseburgers and fries, salads, wraps and overall good food for the price, then Cafe Soleiol and the Wet Bar by the Lagoon Pool are the places to go. What resort can you go to and get a large cheeseburger and hefty amount of fries for $14.00. Not bad for both eh? The service at the resort is wonderful, the conceriege to talk to is Jesus! He is truly a gentleman who enjoys his job. He can make all your dinner reservations and any other requests you might need happen! We had Ricardo as our bellman who took us to our room and insisted on carrying all the luggage to the room. He was very kind and friendly to us and throughtout our vacation at the resort he was there if we needed anything. We stayed in a Deluxe Gardenview Suite that was very spacious with a King Bed, large living area and balcony. The bathroom was huge with an updated roman theme look. Very nice and pleasureable to stay in. Renting a car is not the way to go in Puerto Rico! It is easier to take a taxi to where you need to go to visit or tour. Our tourista taxi driver Harry was the man for the job. He took my wife and I around Old San Juan for a tour as well as dropping us off for a 5-hour break to do some shopping and tour Old San Juan. The Fort at El Morro as well as San Cristobal is definently a place to tour and visit. The museum was nice as well, alot of history to be seen explored and seen in Old San Juan.

A roundtrip ride to and from the airport is $71 per person, a compact car is about $150. Also, any trips that you will want to take, either to the El Yunque Rainforest, La Cuelbra, or downtown to Old San Juan is at least $35 per person. I took a trip last year to Old San Juan using their tour service Dragon Fly and although I enjoyed it, it starts at 8:30 am, and there is a lot of extra walking and touring that may not be of interest, if you just want to shop and see the city. PR, is pretty easy to navigate, traffic wasn't too bad, and we didn't have to use much gas. Put in your GPS Calle 3 @ 955, because the Hotel address may not show up on your GPS. But in any case, once you get on Calle 3, its about a 20 minute drive, then you will see the sign to the resort. Stop by one of the local grocery stores and pick up some liquor, snacks and drinks, it will easily save you TONS of money. Our room was beautiful, clean and comfortable. We didn't smell any mold or mildew. There is no carpet in the room, so for me, it added to the cleanliness. Just be sure to flip over the cards in the bathroom and night stand if you want clean sheets amd towels every day. If you can, try going in the early part of the week, we stayed Monday-Saturday and Mon through Wed, we basically shared the resort with just a few people. We practically had the beach to ourselves. Make sure you get a MAS card as soon as you arrive. It will get you two for one breakfast and 10% off at the restraunts Tempo and Nami but NOT the Puerto Rican restraunt Pasion. Again, if you have a car, you may be able to find some better food off the resort. The food was just OK, not spectacular. Especially lunch, you are better off driving ten minutes to Burger King to get a Whopper for $2.99 then spending $14 on an average cheeseburger by the pool. The dinner portions were large, but not really worth the price. Gratuity is automatically charged to your bill. Service is very slow, but hey, you are supposed to be relaxing and no need to be in a rush. And honestly, if you are worried about money, you can get away with eating a big breakfast at the buffet, and then eating a decent sized dinner as well. So if you don't plan on playing golf, there is absolutely nothing to do on the resort except for sitting by the pool, sitting by the beach, eating a drinking and going to the Casino. THATS IT! There are no water sports, the beach is extremely rocky, you will defintely need water shoes if you plan on going any where near the beach. Everything that you can do is off the resort, so again, rent a car! We enjoyed doing absolutely nothing, so it was fine for us, we didn't go anywhere except for an occasional off resort lunch. We didn't want to be bothered, and I liked the fact that there wasn't people around telling us what we could and couldn't do like at some other resorts. There is also a spa there, which has a private pool and hot tub that you can use if you book a massage. My boyfriend said it was little pricey because he felt that the accomodations were below his standard. It was my first massage, so I didn't know what to expect, but I absolutely enjoyed it. And after all of the walking we did just on the resort, a massage was needed! The Casino was very small, not busy, but we did win a couple hundred playing black jack. However beware, they do not offer comps!! So if you lose a lot of money, don't expect a restruant voucher! I also wouldn't reccomend the resort for children, again because there is nothing to do except go to the pool and feed iguanas. Also, on the Friday night we were there, there was a man with a very high powered telescope. If you see him, check him out. He showed us some beautiful shots of the moon, and we even got to see Saturn! All in all it was a great trip. The resort was beautiful and well kept. It is very romantic. I would stay here again. but not for 5 days, I would defeintely stay just for a few days of relaxation and stay somewhere else maybe at the Wyndam at Rio Mar (where I stayed last year) its not as nice as Gran Melia, but the beach is better, a little busier, and more things to do.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nesconset, New York", "Title": "\u201coverall great place, rent a car if you go.\u201d", "Author": "jason75", "ReviewID": "UR103657199", "Content": "My review pretty much mirrors most of the others already posted. Beautiful resort. Immaculate grounds keeping. It is Secluded. Rent a car and eat in town, about 10 minutes drive. Be sure to get directions to the Gran Melia from the hotel itself as the directions we got from rental car place were not accurate. Its a 30 minute drive and was fairly simple. Hotel is about 15 mins from El Yunque, 35 mins from Fajardo, the town where the bio bay tours are and also ferries to Culebra and Vieques. Luquillo Beach is about 15 mins away, it was a beautiful beach, easy to find, bathrooms and food kiosks. We ate at Antojitos and Richies cafe in town. Both were clean, charming and food was good. They are both on the same road off the main hwy and are about 12 mins. from resort. Also worth eating at is Coco Sweet which is 5 mins from the resort. The pastries were fresh and delicious. We had local food for lunch at Coco Sweet and it was also very good. Great prices too. The restaurant prices were very high. 3$ per soda adds up, 7-8$ for alcoholic bevg. We ate a few meals there. 70$ and up easily for family of 4. We brought water, gatorade, snacks etc to leave in the room and bring to the pool etc. You will be charged for almost everything there. Parking, refrigerator usage in room (25$ for the entire stay.) etc. You can get trolley service to and from your room for those who do not wish to walk. You can swim in the water at the beach, it's great snorkeling, but is not your typical beach. A word of advice, the ferries to Culebra and Vieques have priority boarding for local residents.

We figured Puerto Rico was a perfect weekend getaway from Boston, due to the short direct flight. We booked this trip on Monday, were PR bound on Thursday, and the Gran Melia provided us with EXACTLY what we were looking for for the weekend. The Resort: The resort is gorgeous and very well kept. Yes, it is a little bit secluded... but for a 3 day trip I had no intentions of leaving the resort anyways :-). I spent most of the trip on the beach at the resort (while the pool is lovely, it gets a bit noisy). There are plenty of secluded areas on the beach that we usually felt like we were the only ones there. Also, the mountain looming as the backdrop made the resort feel particularly exotic (many times while walking on the beach I really felt like I was in Hawaii). Upon reading some of the negative reviews before going, I was a bit nervous... but i have to say that I didn't encounter any of these issues while there. I found the beach gorgeous, the food appropriately priced for a Caribbean resort, the grounds clean and updated, and the location perfect. For what you pay (I think we paid around $180/night), I would definitely recommend the Gran Melia. The Food: Yes, the food is \"pricey,\" but it is no more expensive that any other resort in the Caribbean. SIGN UP FOR THE MAS SOLIA CARD! This gets you 50% off breakfast (making the total for 2 for a hot breakfast $18) and 10% other places on the resort. I would the breakfast to be exemplary.

I did often find myself ignored by hotel staff (except at breakfast). But, this wasn't a huge deal for me... because I was on vacation, so who cares if I had to wait a few minutes for my drink :-) All in all, I would definitely recommend the Gran Melia.

One can only be impressed with the breathtaking beauty of the facility itself. The scenery around the immediate property is beautiful and certainly conducive to relaxation and the feeling of getting away from from everyday cares. In general, the staff were very friendly and accommodating and very responsive to the needs of the guests. We were never disappointed in the answers to our inquiries and the fulfilling of our needs. There are a variety of restaurants on the property. Most of them are very pricey. We ate at several of the restaurants and particularly the Asian restaurants was a real treat. One evening we dined at the hibachi table and was truly entertained by the chef and the quality of the food was exquisite. The breakfast buffet at the Cafe Soleil was excellent. They offered very fresh fruit and omelets, pancakes and waffles cooked to order. The negative comment we have about the food was the small pool side eatery ( Wet Pool Bar & Grill) that was extremely pricey and the quality of the food was poor. Drinks at the bar were very expensive (approximately $10 a drink). This high drink prices tends to put a damper on your pool side partying. The pool accommodations and other outdoor facilities was very relaxing and very appealing to the eye.

Upon arrival we were supposed to have a bottle of champagne and strawberries. There were neither in the room. We called management and after two hours we finally received it. It was around 11:30PM when we arrived and there was also no room service available. Two days later we waited one hour in the vacation club to speak with someone regarding renting a car, we then went back to the room and tried calling the vacation club / front desk and were constantly getting no answers and or dropped off. The guy at the Avis desk was handling the paperwork and washing the cars and delivering to the customers!! After 3 hours of badgering, we finally got a car and were able to go visit San Juan. The next night we ate at Passion, the Caribbean restaurant. My wife bit into something as hard as a rock in her rice and beans and was so disgusted she had to be excuse herself from the table. My lobster was completely overcooked and had the texture of a rubber tire. We tried to explain the problem to the server, who was offering no type of remorse or suggestions so we asked for a manager. The manager/head chef came out in the middle of the restaurant and threw her hands out and yelled \"Whats your problem!\" We explained the issue and she yelled at us explaining my wife ate a caper or olive!! Then the server had the nerve to bring us a check for our two glasses of wine. To top everything off we had arranged for a shuttle home with dragon fly the final day at 5:00 AM for a 7:30 flight at the airport in San Juan. No shuttle showed and at 5:20 we scurried to the front desk to find out what happened. Finally at 5:40 we were placed on another shuttle van and barely made it in time for our flight!! If you have any problems and try to go to the front desk, the manage will tell you that Avis, Passions, or even Dragon Fly are outside companies in which they have no control over. They provide 0 accountability for anything on the resort that goes wrong and gave us no compensation or even apology for the way we were treated. The room and resort was beautiful and well kept, but if you're looking for good service, forget about it! Even at restaurants and bars we were constantly waiting to be served.

We spoke to some people that stayed for 5 nights there, and the one thing they said about the Gran Melia was that there wasn't any activities after the 2nd or 3rd day. The beach isn't that great, no snorkeling, and it's quite a drive to go anywhere else. I would highly recommend staying for at most 2 nights before a cruise, or as part of your travels through Puerto Rico. It is a big resort, and walking to your suite is a workout. They are more than happy to give you a ride on the golf carts. Just stop at the front lobby or call them from your room for a pick-up. I read some reviews about the mildew smell in the rooms. Yes most of the rooms have that, if not all. I don't think you can avoid that because of the location of the resort. When I traveled to Costa Rica, every hotel we stayed at had the same smell.

(the hotel food was very blah). No Wi-fi in the rooms, which for the price of the rooms was a major let down. The ugly - While the hotel pool was nice, the beach at this resort was pathetic.

There were plently of guests during our stay, but we were always able to find our own private place on the beach/hammock/lounge chairs, it sometimes felt like we were the only ones there. I highly recommend the Red Level accomodations, full buffet breakfast, private pool, bali beds included, free internet access, unlimited beer, wine and champange from 6:00 pm until 9:00 pm, they will actually give six packs to go...

We didn't eat in any of the 3 fancy restaurants for dinner, we went to live in our bathing suits and that's what we did. We also bought our own vodka with us from home and snacks, it wasn't a problem at all. They sell alcohol and snacks at the gift shop, so I don't understand why other people are saying it's against resort policy, the price of alcohol in the gift shop is very expensive. The resort is very big, they have golf carts that you can call and be picked up at your room, or you can just flag one down to get from point a to point b. The staff was very courteous, clean cut and well groomed, it looks like someone inspects them daily. Iguana's run free, watch your drink's, they like rum...

You really need a car unless you are happy to just chill in a resort. If you drive from the airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c head for Fajardo (East along the Route26 which changes into the toll road Route 66. Go all the way to the end of the toll road ($1.50) and you come to traffic lights and a T-junction, go right towards Fajardo. You are now on Route 3. The Gran Melia is quite well signed, off to the left after a few miles (2?). It takes around 30mins if no traffic jams. Join the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMAS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 loyalty Club before you go for 2-for-1 breakfasts (continental $12, full $17) and 10% off restaurant meals. Also I had a free bottle of champagne since it was my birthday (another MAS club thing, but you have to ask for it). Also as a MAS member you can more easily get a late check out for free. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMAS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 desk in the lobby also has very good tourist information. They have copied sets of detailed driving instructions to a variety of places to go and are very helpful. There was a $15 + tax charge for parking (why?). I booked through Priceline so got a good price for my room BUT when we checked out there was an additional $12 per night. We asked and it was something to do with Priceline only paying part of the 23% tax, so the hotel had to get it from us! Apparently they are in negotiation with Priceline to sort this out. If I had known in advance that would have been fine, but I was not please as it added nearly $100 to our stay! Rooms were nice, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work out why everyone complained about how far away from Reception the rooms were \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do they never walk anywhere? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice stroll, say 0.15 mile (5 minutes) or golf carts come along often. The toiletries were very nice and if you need extra coffee I just left a note for the maid to always leave 4 coffees and 6 creamer packs. I put a few little items in the mini-bar and our maid left them there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some cheese and chocolate and small milk cartons. Beds very comfortable. Free wi-fi in reception and restaurant/public areas. Very few beach umbrellas but plenty of shade under palm trees. Towels can be supplied form a hut near the pool or Reception. There is an Amigo supermarket nearby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like a small Walmart, also a Walgreens and a Burger King. Turn left on Route 3 head, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at Marker 28km. Nice day out is drive to Fajardo (30min drive turn left on R3). Get the passenger ferry to Culebra ($2 one way) ferries are at 0900, 1300 and 1900 return at 1300 and 1700, so a great day out is go on the 0900 and return on the 1700. There is a parking lot near the ferry terminal for $5.25 per day. The Ferry is signed from Route 3. Allow plenty of time to allow for rush-hour traffic (we left at 0750). 1hr 10mins on the ferry to get to Culebra, you arrive at the main town called Dewey. Lots of mini-buses to beaches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good one is Flamenco Beach - $3 each way or $5 return. There are toilets (very basic) and kiosks with snack food just off the beach. A beach umbrella + 2 sun-beds are $25 for the day. Azure sea, soft sand right into the sea. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Kiosks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are a set of eating places ranging from restaurant quality (No 2) to snack shacks. At No 2 our bill was $65 for 2 beers and 2 entrees, slow service. We liked No 36 best nice food, good size portions, reasonable price ($40 for 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees), good service. We also ate at the Ceviche hut (No 38 Peruvian) which was quite nice. The beach behind them is NOT good, it is full of litter and debris. You can drive to Old San Juan about 30 minutes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are a few parking garages but you might also get a spot on the street. We also had a day trip to Ponce, which was a very charming old Spanish town \u00e2\u20ac\u201c around 1hr45min on fast roads through interesting countryside. There is a tourist trolley ($2) and some interesting buildings like the 1883 Fire Station (which is also a tourist information centre), a Cathedral and the Armstrong-Poventud Residence ($3 admission) just off the main square. Also ask directions to the board-walk which had snack shacks. Nice trip. The El Yunque Rainforest was a good trip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c take a picnic. Its about a 20 min drive. If you have a National Park card, take it for free admission to the orientation centre which was worth a visit.

If I'd paid full price, I'd be angry and disappointed. The resort is very pretty, but they nickel and dime you. Nothing is complimentary except the toiletries in your room. If you go here you will need a car. The cost of a day trip to San Juan was $55/person. There were 5 in our party so we opted for a car. I should have called Avis rather than go through the desk at the hotel. They only had a mini-van. I rented it for one day then called Avis and got a smaller car sent to me. There is no wi-fi in the rooms and it will cost you $10 for every 15 minutes you use their lobby computer. The food is expensive at the resort, but nearby there is a very good bakery called Coco Sweet. We also found a grocery store, Ralph's, where we bought some food and drinks to have in our room. Warning: This was against resort policy and we smuggled it in. I thought this was a bit ridiculous. They seemed to want to get every penny out of us that they could. The pool is beautiful, but there are not enough umbrellas. You can rent one of the pretty \"bali beds\" they show on their site for a start of $35/day. So if you don't want to burn get an umbrella early or put up the cash for the shade. I've never had to buy shade before. The beach is pretty, but it is pebbly so don't expect a sandy white beach. However, the water is warm and lovely. You will need a car to get to the nicer beaches north of the resort. Our room was very nice and big. I really liked the patios. It would have been nice to have more than two chairs for it though since there were three in our room. We did have a few issues. Our safe was very touchy and we had to hold it tightly shut to get it to lock. One night I woke to the toilet overflowing onto our bathroom floor. I called and was told they were having problems with the pipes \"did I want someone to come and mop the floor?\" \"umm. Yeah\". They came, but our toilet did not work again until the next afternoon. No apologies offered and nothing in the way of can we make that up to you. Not even a free drink. Nothing here is offered complimentary. A few days later the toilet backed up again and at least then they fixed it quickly. We ate at two restaurants. Pasion, the Puerto Rican restaurant was good. They aren't part of the hotel though. Tempo, the Italian restaurant was not so good. After that we rented our car and we went to the kioscos down on Luquilla Beach. Those were great! I think I still would have let all of this go, but on the last day when I went to check out there was a long line and only one person at the desk. Everyone was having problems with their bills. Several people showed me that they'd been double billed for their rooms. Others had charges from restaurants they'd never been too. It was frustrating and I finally grabbed a bell boy and asked for help. He was great. He went into action and got everyone's room number and bills. We made it out of there with only 5 minutes to spare before we'd miss the shuttle to the airport. I recommend that you check your bill the night before you leave to avoid this mess in the morning. Be careful with your room charges and if you have a flair card double check to make sure they always applied the discounts. They often \"forget\". I didn't use the spa because it was out of my budget. I also didn't opt for the tour of Sol Melia which gives you some perks because I didn't want to waste my time looking at condos. Overall, I got a great package price. I like to travel and I think Puerto Rico was wonderful. I think next time I'll stay in San Juan. Gran Melia is the place for you if you've got a big budget and want to stay in a resort and relax.

The room was very nice and spacious, and though housekeeping was spotty and came at different times every day, they cleaned the room very well.

The resort seems catered for the U.S. traveler seeking a resort experience, and they do a good job of creating a family-friendly atmosphere. During spring break, there was a reasonable mix of college students, families and retirees and the hotel seemed to accommodate all quite comfortably. The large and excellent pool with wet bar is right by the beach, making it easy to swim in the ocean and return to lounge around by the pool afterwards. The golf course is magnificently maintained, and if heading there for golf you won't be disappointed. Views of the El Yunque national rainforest, often shrouded in mist, from the golf course add to the visual appeal. The breakfast buffet at the Cafe Sol had a good selection of everything, just like a Hilton or Sheraton, including a chef to do omelettes etc. Otherwise the restaurants were a bit underwhelming, and the bar and live music scene divey to say the least. Ask for dinner recommendations out of the resort if you can. Staff during my stay were impeccably polite and very friendly. I agree with other reviewers that this is an overpriced resort experience (I had a 50% off deal), but if that's what you're after you won't be disappointed. It has all the gym, tennis court, pool, spa etc. vacation stuff that a resort visitor wants. Not sure about child minding though.

On Sat night, March 5th, 11pm, we heard a huge disturbance coming from the room next door. We called security but nothing changed. At 3 am, we heard the disturbance come outside. Someone slammed into our front door and was demanding we open our door. We looked through the peephole. It was a shirtless man, drinking and smoking and cursing. We called security again. A man came and was actually \"handling\" the situation outside demanding we open our door our door. It did not stop, but they were loud and arguing. My daughter (who is 3) was crying and scared. My husband, who is a very big guy, would not open the door. He speaks Spanish and was listening to a whole bunch of men fighting outside. We asked security to call police (which WE should have done) They never did. They could have easily had a weapon. It finally subsided around 4 am. NO one from the hotel called to make sure we were okay. We went to the front desk and after hours of asking for management, a girl who stated she was an assistant manager, offered us free breakfast and told us the \"guests\" left. We found out they had NOT and that they rented the room for the evening to \"party\". OH MY GOD... we finally got hold of management and they told us they would move our room, but that \"handled it perfectly\". (They said the \"police would take too long if they called them\". I kid you not) We emailed the hotel manager days after and he was in complete denial. No apology, saying they handled it perfectly and they offered us a free 2 night stay. Trust me, I am a travel writer- do NOT go to this hotel. Security breaches are everywhere. It is a huge complex and we had also heard of men outside the rooms, waiting to rob, etc.. try the Wyndham instead.

My husband and I stayed here for 6 days for our honeymoon during the first week of March 2011. We booked our trip through a travel website which also arranged our transportation to/from the airport. The transportation company was awesome and non-affiliated with the hotel (it was not Dragonfly). Here are our observation from the our experience\u00e2\u20ac\u201d 1. Check-in took about an hour, the front desk agent claimed his computer was down yet others were checked-in without problem. 2. Upon check in, the resort requires for a $100 deposit per night for incidentals on your credit card. This is not stated anywhere on their website nor were we advised prior to our arrival. 3. Upon check-in we were instructed to advise the bellman of our room number (note check-in desk is about 5 feet from the bellman desk yet somehow the 2 desks do not communicate), which we did and requested our luggage be delivered to our room immediately. After waiting 2 hours I called for a status on our luggage delivery and only then did our luggage arrive to our room. 4. Upon check-in no information was provided to us regarding the resort such as you can call the front desk to request a shuttle pick up from your room -- our room was a hike (about a 1-2 city blocks from the entrance). On our last day I request a shuttle to be sent to our room to pick up our luggage, the operation told me to carry my luggage to the walkway and wave down a shuttle for assistance, I had been at the resort long enough to know that the shuttles do not stop for anyone unless you call the front desk! Just another example of the POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! 5. Since it was our honeymoon we were suppose to receive the honeymoon amenity upon arrival (a fruit basket in our room). I called the front desk and was transferred 5 times (to different departments) as they all claimed to have no idea what I was talking about. We never received the honeymoon amenity during our stay. 6. We choose this resort since the website stated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are non-motorized water sports for a nominal fee such as kayaking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and since it was a beachfront property thus it would be swimmable beach. DO NOT BE MISTAKEN \u00e2\u20ac\u201c THE PROPERTY DOES NOT OFFER KAYAKING, SNORKLING OR SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN. They taped off all access to the beach and HIGHLY DISCOURAGE kayaking, snorkeling and swimming. The option to rent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-motorized water sports for a nominal fee such as kayaking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was discontinued two years prior to our arrival yet the website has not been updated with accurate information. 7. We rented a car from Avis but booked online rather than going to the resort Avis desk and save about 40% . Also we had free parking. We took a taxi to the outlets (about 15 miles away for a cost or $70 round trip vs the $50 per day to rent a car). 8. The mixed drinks at the Avenue Bar were about $12/each; the mojito was horrible! Never had another during our stay. Were disappointed to learn the other resort bar with a beach view closed at 6pm. 9. The two restaurants (Nami and Tempo) on the resort were never opened at the same time, only one was open per a night. DON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT TEMPO--- the food was horrible! This food makes Italian chain restaurant look like a 5 star restaurants. The food at Tempo tasted like crap, arrived cold, waited about 30-45 minutes for our food to arrive, was expensive and made us sick that night. My husband had pasta and I had the lamb chops, it was just a waste of money we were both still hungry after our meal. 10. Room service was $3 fee plus 20% gratuity included. 11. We stayed in the Gardenview Junior Suite. The suite was nice but no information/booklet about the resort was in our room. The only binder provided was the room service menu. The rooms are cleaned daily but the TP was never filled and on the third day the maid took the last of our TP and we had to call for more. In summary, we would never recommend this resort to anyone.

But here are a few tips that I want to share with others planning their vacation. My husband and I stayed here for 6 days and it was also during the Puerto Rico Open. 1. There is only one shuttle allowed to pick guests up from the airport and take them to the resort. The shuttle is Dragonfly. They charge $35 each way ($70 roundtrip to the airport). This is unless you decide to rent a car. You could take a taxi but they are very expensive. 2. Make sure you rent a car from Avis (either from the airport or from the Avis desk at the resort). Avis is the only free parking allowed at the resort otherwise it is $15 per day. And you will want a car to see other parts of Puerto Rico. And to get to the main road, the resort is a good 1-2 miles. Also, go online to get the best rate for the car - the resort's location is RG9. I include this because we couldn't find the location without the rep's help at the desk. We were able to get a car for $20+ cheaper online than the price the rep quoted us. 3. Upon check in, the resort asks for a $100 deposit per night for incidentals on your credit card. This is not written anywhere but it is in other reviews and we were asked. We told them we didn't have $600 to put a hold on a card so that they wouldn't do it. And they just held $100 for the entire stay and told us that we couldn't charge anything to our suite which was fine with us since we planned to sightsee and eat food outside of the resort. Let me also clarify that the deposit is used for any charges made towards the room - the shuttle, drinks at the bar, snacks at the market, meals, etc. so if you plan to stay at the resort the entire time then pay the deposit. 4. Make sure you sign up for MAS Rewards before you arrive so that you can take advantage of the benefits - buy one, get one free breakfast buffet at Cafe Soleil (regular $18 each), 10% off dinner at Nami and Tempo (two restaurants at the resort), and points for your stay. The other restaurant on site is Pasion which has caribbean cuisine. The food was out of this world -we had the whole red snapper stuffed with lobster and the churrasco mofungo. Do not order the pizza. 5. We stayed in the Gardenview Junior Suite. The suite was nice and very clean. But it smelled moldy for a majority of our stay. We read this in a review so we expected it. The rooms are cleaned daily but the smell lingered. 6. There is a shuttle (large golf cart) that will take you to your room from the lobby. They will also pick you up from your room when you call which is a great service because some rooms are 1/4-1/2 mile to the main building. However, with the pick up from the room (on weekends), make sure you call at least 10 minutes before you are ready to leave. The guys are more than happy to take you anywhere on the property including the Avis parking lot. Overall, we had a fantastic time, the resort is amazing and has everything you could ever ask for.

The resort is absolutely stunning. The rooms are nice, the pool is fantastic. The facilities overall are wonderful. Don't visit the casino. If you're from the US you won't get the same type of experience you'd expect back home. Let me be clear. I do not care what the rules are in a casino as long as they're consistent. The main game I play in a casino is blackjack. I stood and watched for about 15 minutes before sitting down. In this particular casino, the dealer does not take their second card until everybody has either hit or stayed and is done with their additional betting (double downs, splits, etc). While I was standing behind watching, a local puerto rican got blackjack. He was immediately paid 1 1/2 times his bet which is standard. His cards were removed and play continued to the next seat. The dealer was showing a face card (a jack if I remember correctly). The dealer proceeded to get an ace and therefore a blackjack. The player who also got blackjack did not have to give their money back. I thought this was great. You could get blackjack and get paid without having to purchase insurance. I sat down and about 4 hands into it the exact same thing happened to me, but with one major difference. I DID NOT GET PAID. I immediately called over the pit boss. She told me that maybe the other player had asked for even money. I asked her why I was not offered insurance or even money. She told me the dealer does not have to do that. I told her that I saw the other player get 1 1/2 times his bet, therefore not receiving even money anyways. I asked that they get a video review to clear this up. She refused to do that. I got up with my remaining chips and walked over to the casino manager. He informed me basically what the pit boss had said. I asked why the dealers did not have to be consistent. He informed me that he only has 3 dealers. When there are a lot of guests at the resort (there were this week due to my company being there) they will contract out for more dealers. He told me that those dealers do not have to follow the same guidelines because they do not actually work for him. I told him that if they're going to be working in his casino there needs to be consistency. He told me this isn't the US and they don't have to follow the same rules.

First, the hotel and grounds were beautiful. Our room was nice and I found the advise of others on Tripadvisor to be completely accurate. The pool is great and also the beach is wide and inviting. The people at the hotel are very helpful and friendly. However, whatever you want during your stay you had better already have. The resort is very remote and at least 30 minutes from any store or supplies besides Walgreens which is only 15 minutes away. We were there for a meeting and we were completely disappointed in the food provided for the association dinners. I had stomach upset after every event. However, the one meal we ate a resort restaurant was very good. The bar tenders were also good at making interesting cocktails. Others with our group said that they had had difficulties ranging from broken phones, being bitten by fire ants around the property, rooms not being ready or cleaned regularly, and restaurants being booked ahead of time so getting food at the resort for some was a challenge. The only issue I personally had was that the concierge did not want us to leave the resort and I had to argue with him to give me directions to a restaurant in Fajardo. He repeatedly told me how much better the hotel restaurants would be. I had called ahead to the concierge twice before my arrival and they promised to send me information on off site restaurants for a business dinner but never did. The business center did not have a working printer for me to print invitations and 5 minutes online at their center costs $5 which is outrageous. There was no one to help with any issues in the business center. But by far the worst thing was that there was no wifi in the rooms and you had to purchase a data cord for $15 (they were out the first day we were there) or pay $15 a day for wifi in the bar and beach area---crazy!! The hotel also makes you wear these arm bands---for no reason I ever figured out--that are uncomfortable and ugly and they tell you when you check in that if you do not return your towel cards they give you that they will charge you $30 per towel card upon your departure if you do not return the card...... I felt the food was overpriced and that they should have offered somewhere to have a light breakfast without the $18 for a continental breakfast. They did have a coffee bar in the Market shop thankfully. They will not allow you to bring in food or water or supplies---they want every penny of yours going to the resort.

We had a rental car which made traveling to the rainforest, Luquillo kiosks, and Fajardo for our bio bay tour easy. In El Yunque, we hiked Big Tree Trail to La Mina falls, it was nice, too hard to get in the water at the waterfall though, and kind of crowded, but a nice hike- not too hard about 45 min each way. We packed some snacks to eat on the boulders at the basin of La Mina, that was nice. Definitely take the toll road 66 from the airport to the hotel, it saves about 40 minutes vs. just taking highway 3 the whole way. The hotel beach had gray gravel/pebbles on it instead of white sand, but it was still beautiful and peaceful, and you could walk for quite a while if you enjoy walking on the beach. We tried Seven Seas beach and Luquillo beaches, they were alright- nothing like other Carribean island's beaches though, our favorite beach off the resort was Isla Verde in San Juan- it had the prettiest sand and water, with plenty of places to eat on the beach. It felt a little like Miami or Destin though, ha ha. But the Gran Melia beach is perfect for privacy and seclusion, so Isla Verde was a nice change. I loved how open the hotel was, so we could find a private hammock or chairs on a part of the beach no one else was on, to feel secluded. The pool was large, but it was pretty crowded on the weekend. The bali beds around the pool are sometimes free and sometimes $15, $30 or even $60. Depending on the occupancy of the hotel, I thought that was silly. Our room was a garden suite in building 10, it had a king bed and was extremely clean. Tastefully decorated and very spacious. Housekeeping came every morning and cleaned well. I am allergic to mold and mentioned that at check in so perhaps they made sure our room had no history of mold. It was a wonderful room. Check in was a breeze, about 10 minutes, however we waited until just before checkout deadline of noon to get in the checkout line... and that was long, took about 40 minutes. Everything was correct on our bill except one mini bar charge which they promptly adjusted. We did go to the grocery store nearby and stocked up on a few drinks and snacks, put them in an insulated lunch bag we'd brought and refilled with ice. That saved us a lot of beach/pool drink charges, but still, the bartenders were super nice & their drinks were delicious & priced fairly. The pool bar was lovely and had good burgers and a great childrens menu for a quick lowpriced snack, but the quesedilla and nachos had really small portions. The drinks were great. The asian restaraunt was yummy, romantic setting. We did hear the puerto rican one wasn't good & terrible service. We enjoyed our breakfast each morning, it was $16 for full hot/cold buffet w/ waffles, omelets, etc, or $12 for just fruit & breads. With our free MAS reward card, we got a breakfast free everyday which really saved $! We loved going into Luquillo for lunch/dinner at the kiosks (#2 was our favorite, #9 was good but took 2 hours to get food once we were seated- literally), in downtown Luquillo- King Seafood was outstanding and we heard Pasta and Pueblo was delicious but it was too crowded when we got there without reservations- it only has about 6 tables. We loved Gran Melia.

The coffee and muffins at the hotel store was bad coffee and dry rolls.( coffee and rolls averaged for family of four 10 here vs 80 dollars at buffet) We generally ate at the buffet for lunch and dinner. It was our best option because it offered all kids of foods my kids liked, including soups and salads, pasta, cooked vegetables and meats, lunch meats and cheese and a whole desert station with cakes, canollis and ice cream sundaes. We loved the beach and the pool. I really enjoyed the large pool and the fact that it never felt crowded. The beach was very very nice, beautiful and gentle water and gorgeous palm lined beach. Always plenty of space it sometimes felt like we were the only ones there. Our room was nice and big, although they said it was a suite it really didn't feel like a suite because it was one large room with a couch at one end. The bathroom was nice, tiled and clean. But bring your own shampoo and conditioner because the hotels brand was awful! The other things I didn't like was wearing a wristband for our entire stay. That way I guess people could tell you were guests at the hotel. I also felt food prices were high We loved the beach! We brought our own snorkel and mask and the kids used them constantly.

We arrived at the hotel before a busy Holiday weekend and walked into an unorganized chaotic check-in experience. First of all, no one is there to greet you or guide you to the designated area to start the check in line. Confusion started to arise and the front desk staff tried to skp over us because we were not in the correct line. The woman at the front desk was completely rude and not helpful at all! First she accused me of lieing and \"cutting\" in line, which was far from the truth! Then she acted like we were bothering her, when all we wanted was for her to do her JOB! I forget her name, but I remember she was the tallest woman with very long hair. KEEP AWAY IF YOU CAN!!! None of the employees really know what they are talking about. Once we got our keys, we went to our room which had a musty mold-like aroma that was not appealing and the bathroom looked like it had not been cleaned properly! We called the front desk to complain, and they agreed to switch our rooms. We went to the 2nd room and it had the same smell, only worse. Finally, we went to a second floor unit that did not smell as bad. Although we may have gotten rid of the smell, that was not the end of it! The safe was broke, the remote didn't work, and there was fungus on the patio. At that point, we were so exhausted from schleping our luggage around that we agreed to deal with the less then satisfactory room. As much as we wanted to try and enjoy ourselves, things just continued to get worse. We spent one day at the pool, and that was not relaxing at all! They had loud music playing that made me feel like I was in Cancun for spring break for college. On the second day we did a snorkeling excursion, which was excellent!! Make sure you have your own vehicle though! We saved $40 per person just from driving ourselves to the marina! After returning from a long day of drinking and being in the sun, we were unable to get in our room. All of our keys had deactivated and we had to walk alllllll the way back to the front desk to get a new set. Once back in the room (no explanation was given as to why our keys deactivated), we attempted to take showers but had no hot water. I called the front desk and they said someone was working on it but they didn't know when it would be fixed and that I could not shower anywhere else. We spent our third day in Old San Juan which was the best day by far! Once again, we returned to our room and the keys did not work. At this point, we were irate! It was late, we just wanted to get in our room and go to bed. After getting new keys made, again, we entered our room to find 2 keys, that both worked, slid under the door. Who would slid room keys under the door, and why? We finally spoke to security who informed us that housekeeping could not get in the room, so they had to change the keys (without informing us), and they left the 2 new keys under the door, which is against hotel policy. Let's just say we were thrilled that it was our last night. Overrall, if I had paid the full rate to stay at this hotel, I would have been more mad that I already am. This is not a 4 start resort. The Service can be compared to what you would get at a Motel 6 on the side of an interstate. Most of the staff are rude and make no attempt to make your stay enjoyable. If you do decide to stay here, make sure you rent a car BEFORE you get to the resort. If not, you'll be stranded and forced to deal with this horribly managed resort.

We have stayed in other all inclusive resorts in Cuba and Dominican Republic and had both good and bad experiences. We had also read many of the reviews of the Gran Melia. Although this is not an all inclusive resort, we were able to book a meal plan and found that eliminated any concerns about the cost of food and beverages that other reviews had been unhappy about. To begin the resort property is very welcoming and well kept. The main building is beautiful with lots of sitting areas, gardens and ponds. The main bar and restaurants were all in this building. We found ourselves hanging out here every night playing cards and having drinks before dinner. It was a great place to meet a few of the other guests and there was always either a dj or live music. Our experience with the staff and their level of customer service was excellent. Our check in/out, food service, and room cleaning staff were all very kind and helpful. Any questions or concerns were addressed and everyone was very polite. As with all our holidays we seek out great food and drink experiences and we were very impressed with the two restaurants, Nami and Tempo. The Cafe Soleil buffet was perfect for breakfast, lots of choices and everything was fresh and tasty. We often ate at the poolside grill for lunch which was always very busy, but the key is to relax and not be in a rush. We understood that the beach is not a white sand beach like Cuba, but we still enjoyed it as a place to lounge and walked it everyday. Lots of birds, fish, shells and crabs made it interesting. Otherwise we did spend lots of time in and around the pool. In general, because of the size of the resort it never felt crowded. And although the pool was the popular place for guest (and this is a family resort) there was always a bali bed or lounge chair to be found. We had a garden view junior suite that was at the far end of the resort. We enjoyed the walk and there was always golf carts passing to offer us a ride. The room was comfortable, very quiet and nicely decorated. We read a number of reviews that complained about the mold smell. We found there was a slight mold smell when you first stepped into the room, but it never lingered or was strong. We also recall this at other Caribbean resorts and understand the humidity can cause this. We both slept so well the entire week. The bed was very comfortable and the building was really quiet. We all had massages at the YHI spa. We had heard the cost of the services was high and we requested a price list for services when we arrived. We did agree that the services are expensive, however we decided to treat ourselves and we all really enjoyed our massages and the staff were excellent. We opted to rent a car from Avis (on site) and do our own sight seeing rather than the tours with the resort tour company. The car rental was $68/day, plus insurance. We drove to El Yunque rain forest and hiked for a day. The rain forest is very close and easy to get to and the park entrance fee is only $4/person. We really enjoyed our day. The rain forest is a popular spot for visitors, so expect to see many people on the trails and rest spots. After we finished at the rain forest we had heard from staff that Loquillo Beach was close by and a really nice public beach. We drove to it and spent the rest of the day there. It was worth the couple of wrong turns and tight parking spot. It is a beautiful and surprisingly quiet public beach. We had a lot of fun in the waves, walking the perfect sand and napping in the sun. So for the cost of the car rental and park entrance fee we had a full day of fun within 15 minutes of the resort. We took the car for the second day and drove into Old San Juan. This area of the city is very beautiful - cobblestone streets, brightly coloured buildings and lots of shops and cafes. It was bustling with tourists and we felt very safe and found it really easy to navigate, definitely worth the trip. As for other recommendations, we found the internet access and phone service expensive. There we a number of guests with laptops and cell phones and we didn't take the time to look into what would be least expensive. We discreetly packed into the resorts drinks and snacks. The resort is isolated and the cost to purchase on the resort can be expensive, and the selection is limited.

There appeared to be 8-10 rooms per villa, so it wasnt busy or tight. The bed was very comfortable. The shower was adequate. You had the option of riding on golf carts if you didnt want to walk around (since it IS a big sprawling property). The location of the resort was about 40-45 minutes east of San Juan. It felt secluded and far from the busy and active life of a city. We had a car so it was easy to get in and out and about in PR.

We traveled to the Gran Melia in February of 2011 with our infant daughter. When we arrived and attempted to check in we were told the room we reserved was not available. Nothing we said or did (including showing a printed reservation receipt) was able to accomplish getting an upgraded room. The manager told us the best she could do was give us a garden view room with a kitchenette. The room we then checked into had numerous issues. The air conditioning was stuck at 65, the iron was missing, there was no tv remote, the microwave did not work, and the dishes were still dirty from the last time they were used. It took 4 hours to get an iron, 2 days to get a remote, the microwave and dishes were never addressed by management. After two nights we insisted to be moved to a different room. Issues in the next room: Air conditioning stuck at 64 (our daughters feet were blue one morning she was so cold), close proximity to the hotel bar (at night you could hear loud bass music), and there was no hot water in the bathroom sink. We were then moved (after another day wasted complaining to the manager) to a villa. The villa was a fantastic room however we did not have hot water in the shower. Food: Unless you make a reservation two days in advance you will not get a table until 10pm. Even when we did make a reservation for 7:30pm and then when we arrived the hostess told us our reservation was for 6pm and that our table was given away. At the restaurants we did eat at (Cafe Soleil and Pasion) we thought they were overpriced for below average tasting food. Pool: The pool is great but loud music is blasted throughout the day so there is no peace and quiet. One day there was a band that played loud obnoxious music on bongo drums. Service: The service at this hotel is awful and some of the worst I've ever been subjected to. The front line employees at the front desk and in the red level lounge attempt to brush you off by explaining that they will call you when the issue is resolved or have a manager call you. No call is ever made and when you go back to check on the issue the next shift has no clue what you are talking about.

The service is ABSYMAL! I am my last night of my stay here at the resort. Upon making reservation, I called the hotel to make a request for adjoining room or atleast a room near each other 2 weeks prior to arrival date. We checked in around midnight, you guesses it rooms were in the opposite ends of the resort. The lady that checked us in ( by the way the check in took almost 45 mins) asked to check back in morning around check out time to see what was available. The front desk clerk whispered something to the front desk manager and the answer was there were no available room. Okay, we went about enjoying the resort. The next morning, someone was changing room, so my sister and I ran to the front desk to change the room, again lots of whispering, sorry no rooms available to switch. We asked her what happened to room in bldg 14 that someone was switching from, oh sorry I see it now, just have to talk to my manager and will call you, go enjoy your day. So we actually did. Around 3 pm we called the resort to make sure that the room was changed and that our bags were moved. We were put on hold for a long time, clerk said that the manger will call us back in 15 mins, 2 hrs went by no call. We called back, same routine this went on till we got back into the resort at around 10pm. stood in line again at the front desk to see if our room was changed, first response I don't know anything about a room change. We got angry she then checked the computer, oh yes I see you have been moved to this room, Great finally! has our bags been delivered to the room? The espouse oh I don't know you have to tAlk to the front desk manager. So we waited, finally she is ready to talk to us. we explained what we have had to been through to just change a room. Melissa the manager initially said she was aware that we were calling every hour to talk to her. She checked to makesure that we were swited over. We asked to her to comp as for all the headaches. She dissappered into the back office for 15 mins and came out offered us free breakfast for both rooms. Great, give it to me writing since you won't be here at check out. We did not want to go through the hassel of dealing with fixing the bill on Checkout. Melissa says okay and disappears to back Office again, to write that our Bk was comped. She didn't comeout. Went back to the front desk clerk to find out what happened to Melissa? Clerk informed her that we were STILL waiting! She came out 20 mins later. With NO note! She apparently didnt have a form. Huh? So in other words, she lied to our face and ean of to hide, hoping that we will get sick of waiting. Up until this point we didn't raise our voice, except to be heard over he loud Music. At this point after she lied and hid I got angry and asked her how she could lie and what kind of service was that. She walked away b/c she couldnt work with us. All along we Had been asking for the Manger on duty, who kept coming out of he back office and running back in. When she walks away we finally got the manager on duty to comeout. Hmm! WhT can I say about Mr. Israel Cordero? He is a smoth talker, who wrote on back of his business card that our breakfast was comped and that he will call us to see what else he can do. Never did.

We stayed at the resort Feb. 13-20th as part of an electrical industry \"conference\" which arranged the entire trip as an \"All Inclusive\" vacation for the participants but the resort is normally not an All Inclusive resort. Rooms: We were very happy with the rooms and found them to be very clean, beds were comfortable, bathrooms were clean, plenty of towels, towels changed often, sheets clean, etc. Experienced a lack of adequate warm/hot water on the last night and hope we have enough for morning showers. Grounds/Beach: The gardens near the accomodations are quite nice and a crew can be seen daily tending to gardening chores. We have seen better/lush gardens at other resorts. The \"beach\" is not a term I would give to the waterfront. There is no sandy beach anywhere! If you are expecting to find a wide beach with loads of fine sand where you can walk around in bare feet and walk out into the ocean freely, this is NOT the place for you. The entire beach front has very little sand and has lots of broken rocks and seashells which make walking barefoot VERY uncomfortable. This extends out into the water (try walking without experiencing painful sensations!) where after about 8-12 feet out, the entire floor is covered in seaweed and grasses which make for uncomfortable walking. I nearly stepped on a sea urchin which was hidden by the grasses (although the kids thought it was pretty neat when I showed them!). Water was nice and warm however and there are virtually no waves as there are offshore reefs no too far out. Needless to say, the kids did not enjoy the beach where they normally spend hours of the day frolicking (hard to do when you are worried about cutting your feet on the sharp rocks/shells...which my daughter managed to do!). Wait staff/service: Without doubt one of the worst service anywhere. There is a serious lack of training at the Buffet restaurant but the service was much better at the A la Carte restaurants. The staff of any resort set the tone for the holiday (to a degree anyway) and we have been to many resorts where the staff seem genuinely happy in their jobs and sincere in their wanting to please the guests. The bar staff at these other resorts are happy, smiling and laughing and bantering with the guests. NOT HERE! Here the staff avoid eye contact so they can mill about and keep pretending to be too busy to serve you. We had to ask for the same thing (i.e. a cup for the pot of tea or milk for coffee/tea) several times before it was ever brought out. I don't think they know of the concept of \"clearing dishes\" off a table promptly and replacing cutlery if they take it away as part of the clearing process. There were 2-3 people who seemed to shine above te rest (and the got nice tips as a result) but by and large I would say their is a big training problem where the basic expectations have not been instilled in the staff (go to the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana and you will see smiling/laughing/happy people). The service at the non-buffet restaurants was much better. Food quality: The buffet had decent enough variety but the quality/taste was severely lacking (IMO). Taste of the various dishes served each night (fish/chicken/beef (aweful)/pork) was of different flavours but not flavourful. Beef was always overdone (makes on suspect that they \"re-used\" the meat?). Salads/greens were very good. Desserts were of good variety and quite good generally. House reds (wines) were very decent and the beer was always cold. The Al la carte restaurants are extremely good and no one should have any complaints about food quality and variety...and the prices reflect this...not a cheap place to eat/drink. Although I did not play golf, many people commented that both courses were of very high quality. I would never return to this resort and would dissuade anyone from choosing this place for any holiday.

We stayed last year at Rio Mar - Wyndham and were hoping when we booked 4 stars unnamed with Hotwire it would be Wyndham, which was real nice ... but for $99/night (+ tax/fees =$25 Feb 5 to 11) we ended up at the Gran Melia. It was a pleasant surprise. True ... it is kind of out of the way down a long entrance road off Rt 3 in Rio Grande ...but is a very pretty drive past Trump Golf Course and fountains. I guess driving literally a couple of more minutes when you are on vacation with mostly no time schedule is enough for other reviewers to complain about ...Get A Grip! stay in San Juan or Miami. Now I can afford to pay full price to know exactly where I am staying, or write a \"marvelous review\" about staying at the St Regis(where I paid about $1000/night full rack rate) ,... but what challenge is that? I am a \"value guy\" (others say cheap, funny after the bust them off, then ask for details ... go figure!) so ... I am a big fan of Hotwire, when they show 4 star,on beach, R=resort, casino, golf,gym 90% approval ... only 2 options- Wyndham or Gran Melia.... cannot go wrong with either. The resort itself is beautiful. Appears to be well maintained and staff are busy bees trimming, cleaning, shining and so on. Granted it is not brand spanking new, but I didn't think it looked worn. Here are some opinions: GROUNDS/LOBBY - Beautiful ... lots of openess, statues, marble, beautiful landscape with ponds and fountains. Check in desk was friendly and fast, service good. Casino - small not crowded - went in Superbowl Sunday to place $10 bet at Sports Book, betting opened half hour before game time, so we left - Not Vegas! ROOMS - resort rooms are separate 2 story villas with about 8 rooms per building, very spread out forming semi circle opposite end from lobby and restaurant. Lots of walking at this resort because it is so big, but you can get a ride from golf carts. Resort charges for parking ($15 + tax per day) ...they all do so non issue. No need here for valet parking(extra $6/day) because where you park is closer to rooms.The room itself was big and beautiful, king bed and large sitting area with couch, deck with rain forest view and small glimpse of ocean. Bathroom nice! only complaint when A/C on fan runs non-stop is noisy. POOL/BEACH - Hugh main pool, small spa pool, and Royal Service pool. Main pool only has 3 umbrellas for shade, get there early. It was quite slow mid week Feb 8-9 so they let us use cabanas free, usually charge about $50. Beach is OK in spots, it goes a long way around resort plenty of private areas. Not great for swimming kind of rocky but you can make most of it. If you want great beach day have to search out beaches and drive (like 7 Seas). RESTAURANTS/BARS - join Melia MAS program and get # by phone, get 50% off breakfast and 10% other food. Breakfast buffet was fine ($17 hot or $12 cold) good geal with 50%. Also got coffee and muffins from Market, it was OK. Had lunch a few times at Beach Bar/Restaurant, nice view, convenient, decent food, slightly \"resort pricy\" Did not eat dinner at resort. Lots of great places in Luquillo ... Ceviche Hut, Ay Bonita!, El Jefe Burger at kiosks that take a left back on Route 3 (read write ups) .. Pasta y Pueblo in Luquillo near La Pared Beach is awesome (closed Mon & Tues need resevation), Boardriders on La Pared is great Rum Shack beach joint. In Fajardo near marinas, Tacsa Ole great views - good Tapas. SUMMARY - great resort. If you are looking for Club Med type entainment ... this aint it... some stuff; Zumba, nice gym,some music in bar. The staff are real nice people, generally when you work in hospitality you have to be nice. Check pricing on Hotel.com or Hotwire(unnamed) can be a real deal. They have \"Royal Service\" that you pay a big chunk for ... included are breakfast, happy hour, and private pool ... you can be judge, but hard to do if you have never been there ... not worth it in my thrifty eye! Check out Rain Forest nearby, Bio Bay is awesome, snorkel in fun with KPR - Miniboats. Remember that the locals love their pardise and get out to beaches on stuff on weekends, avoid beaches and kiosks on weekends. Definitely get a car. CAN'T GO WRONG AT GRAN MELIA or WYNDHAM ... great area of PR to be in. Lastly, when reading reviews, those from Northeast (mostly NY and NJ) tend to be nit picky about stupid stuff (a bunch of cosmopolitan wantabees) ... while reviewers from Western Canada and Mid West USA are easy to please ... you be the judge ...

Gran Melia Golf Resort is simply amazing. From its manicured grounds, to perfectly clean pools, to its stellar restaurants, and fantastic January weather, The Gran Melia did not disappoint. Yes it was all that and more. Do not believe the negative reviews. I would recommend the royal service (now red service) level. We had an oceanfront room w/king bed, jacuzzi on the patio and a wonderful sitting area and bathroom. The room was perfect everyday with turn down service every night. This level of stay warrants the few extra bucks compared to the regular rooms. Our butler/concierge took care of our every need like we had any to request. The restaurants we visited were excellent. The asian restaurant was very entertaining and the food was perfect. The Italian restaurant was my favorite. Tempo is very upscale and the service impeccable. My wife and I both had filet mignon, salads, veggies, and creme brulet for desert. The filet mignon was seriously the best I ever had and my wife said the same. I am a big steak eater and visited many a steak house stateside and non compared to Tempo's flavor and tenderness. Well worth the price. The nightlife is lacking a little but we made our own good time at the Avenue Bar. The drinks were strong and came on a steady pace. It was just the atmosphere my wife and I like. The Cafe Solei we ventured to every morning for a buffet style breakfast. a little pricey but was very good. The wet pool bar and grill was also very good. try the blackened chicken sandwich. Now to two things that personally made my stay special. The Trump International Golf Club and my concierge mr Angel Melendez. Trump is what it should be. A world class golf club that is flawless in everyway. I just loved playing on the courses which are very challenging. Mr. Melendez took care of everything for us. He went out of his way to make sure every whim we had was exceeded. He would get us lunch by the private pool. He would reserve bali beds for us daily. He would escort us everywhere, and best of all he described everything perfectly and never once steered us incorrectly. His honesty and charm will carry him far at this particular resort. I feel so strong about Mr. Melendez's charactor I am personally going to contact his superior and recommend him for advancement. Without Angel our stay would have not been the same.

Also learned that 2 other couples we were traveling with had similar issues with their rooms - some worse than ours. \"Adult\" pool was very nice and the main grounds are truly beautiful both during the day and perhaps even more so at night. You could definitely call Gran Melia a romantic place. Enjoyed the pina coladas and other drinks & eats at the pool throughout the day.

Very nice servers, but undoubtedly slow and forgetful (as in, \"would you like dessert tonight?\" \"Sure, we'd like to see a menu\", and 20 minutes later he brings the check and asks if we'd be interested in any dessert again... Italian = Also very good and the service was EXCELLENT. Asian Fusion = We heard from others that the service was terrible in every way, despite the food tasting very good. Spa treatment was good for most people we spoke with, though I wasn't impressed with the one I received. My wife and I had a couples massage and the room was too cold for us.

So let's get the negatives out of the way...The service is definitely slow, but I attribute some of that to rural island living...This isn't the mainland USA. The ground room was musty, so we immediately changed to a second level room, which was fine. The dining was very average, but our expectations weren't very high. And the billing was a bit of a nightmare. We had a lot of people in our group who had issues with the mini bar, and we were double charged for my mother n law's room. On the positive side, the staff were all extremely friendly. The pool is beautiful, and it was perfect for chilling out before and after our wedding. Buying beer/drinks at the pool is expensive, but you can also buy beer from the hotel market and save yourself a lot of money. They technically do not allow outside drinks, but as long as you don't rub in their faces, they seemed to be pretty cool about it. (don't drag a huge cooler out to the pool. pack your drinks in a back pack or something less conspicuous) The location is decent...I think...Luquillo beach is nearby, as are the kiosks and the rain forest. The kiosks are great. I've read reports that they're expensive, but the entrees range from $15-$25. And there is plenty of inexpensive street food. Not fancy atmosphere, but everything I had was fantastic...(highly recommend the Ceviche Hut, the ceviche and the grilled snapper) and the drinks are really inexpensive! Fajardo is a short drive. And from there you can do the Bio Bay (which was great), or a ferry over to Culebra (very beautiful). Whatever you do, either rent a car or find the number for a local Taxi. The shuttle service, Dragon Fly, is out of control expensive, and the hotel staff isn't allowed to help you find a local taxi. I rented from Avis at the airport, and Melia let me park in the hotel lot. But the rules seem to change from person to person, so I wouldn't ask. Just tell the guy at the gate (on your way out) that you're renting from Avis, and you shouldn't have any problem. Having a car will save you money by allowing you to leave the resort for meals or drinking...and it basically cuts the cost of any excursions in half. For example, the bio bay tour was $40 with your own transportation, but $89 through Dragon Fly. Taxi's to and from the airport are $65 for up to 6 people. I think the Melia shuttle is $30/person each way. Taxi's will stop at stores or whatever so you can pick up boos, snacks, food or whatever (my buddy had to buy a belt) to sneak into the hotel...no problem....They're very cool! Overall, we had a nice experience. My wife and I agreed on 3 1/2 out of 5. But we were also on a group rate of $200 (including fees, tips, etc) I'm sure our expectations would have been greater if we were paying full price.

We read the reviews on Trip advisor last night and had the best laugh, a highlight to our vacation so far. We are experienced travlers and thought with the Trump International golf course here at the hotel that it would be a safe bet! Boy were we wrong. The service was slower than slow, there is no service to the \"Red level Royal Service\", and the beach is narrow with seaweed. The grounds and lobby area are beautiful but that is the highlight to the hotel. The pool bar area was blasting offensive and foul Hip Hop music which could not be escaped. This was also the only place to eat by the pool/beach and was disgusting, mostly fried, burgers looked ok, but nothing to appeal to the experinced pallet. The dining...if you could call it that was overpriced and fair at best. We ordered a grilled shrimp cocktail from room service and received a hot plate of grilled shrimp...what part of that constitutes a \"shrimp cocktail\"? Grilled and chilled was expected. Also beware the restaurants switch being open, so only one choice pernight. We paid for a jr. suite ocean view, which is spacious but not very clean. On the third night my friend came \"home\" to an unmaid room and the previous night was subjected to a broken toilet. On an absurd note, they throw away all partially used hotel soap and products in your room everyday. I would use my bar of soap once and gone! I can think of 100 ways to put that money to better use at the NOT so Grand Melia. We tried to rent a car her from Avis and waited 2 hours! Not kidding. When the guy finally showed up he left all the keys to the cars at the other hotel and had to drive back and get them. We did get the car for $34.99 from $75.00 which for us ended up being a score, just unneccesarily inconvient. What made our trip great: Captain Ron (787) 429-8080.

As many have stated, the outside grounds, pools, and buildings are lovely. However, our room could have used a fresh coat of paint and some new throw pillows and such. The room was pretty clean, didn't really have an odor but the vents could have used some scrubbing and we had no problems whatsoever with daily services. Everyone we came in contact with from the front desk personnel to the guys driving the carts (they always stopped and asked us if we wanted a ride), to the security people were very friendly and helpful. We did find the buffet (we only got the cold buffet for $12) to be pretty good but we found Coco's Sweet Bakery at the intersection of Coco Blvd and Hwy 3 to have a great ham and egg breakfast as well as pastries and coffee. We only ate dinner at the resort the first night there at the Italian restaurant and it was good, about the same as what we would pay for a good restaurant here in our area. We tried one local place that had ok food but I questioned the fact that salad dressings appeared to stay out on the tables without refrigeration. The Old Harbor Brewery food was good and the Japanese place in OSJ was ok. Definitely rent a car so that you aren't tied to the resort. There wasn't much going on as far as entertainment in the evenings and we didn't upgrade to RS so we didn't have access to those services. If you rent a car from Avis at the airport, you will be charged a parking fee if you park in the guest area but if there is space available at the Avis Rent A Car site at the hotel, you won't be charged. You have to make sure that you do not fill out the sheet to put in your window that shows you are parking in the guest lot. We ended up parking in the lot cause the Avis lot was full most of the time. It was $16 a day. Some people have commented on having to wear the bands that show you are a guest. Our band was blue, we saw red ones, white ones, silver and then the string ones. If you leave the property, you can cut yours off but keep it and when you come back, ask for a new one to wear. If you lose it, then they might charge you for another. They explained it to us so there was not a problem for us. We got a new one every day. We had no problems bringing in bottled water, sodas, and snacks. We put it in our backpack and just entered. They are trying to keep people from coming in with coolers and foods that need a fridge. We asked and they told us sure as long as it was a reasonable amount. We took the tour to the Rainforest through Dragonfly Tours at the hotel. It was alright but I think I would try a different tour company if we went again. We wanted to go to Guanitica, in the SW corner of PR but we were afraid to venture that far away in the little car we rented. We really couldn't find anyone who had knowledge of that area or a tour there. We did go into Old San Juan on Sunday and got into a big mess with traffic while trying to leave. It took us 2 hours to go 1 mile. If you go into Old San Juan, make sure you park south of Constitution Drive, not up near the forts. There are many little streets that feed into that one road and the people believe that if there is an empty space between your car and the one in front of you that it belongs to them! We did return to OSJ on Wed and it was easier to get around. The forts are worth seeing as well as the old churches. Be aware of your belongings and I suggest a tight grip on your purses and wallets for men in front pockets, not rear ones. The streets are very narrow and crowded with people. Prime pick pocket opportunities. Street signs do not exist in OSJ, the street names are on the corner buildings and are not easy to see. Most maps do not have all the streets on them but we finally found a good one available at some of the businesses like Starbucks, free of charge. We left this morning and our bill was placed outside our door during the night. We had no problems checking out, the charges were correct. If you have the money to spend on the golf, like to gamble and can afford to or just want to get away from everything for a few days, the resort would be ideal. We had the opportunity to visit here on short notice and enjoyed our stay. We just like to sight see and spent alot of time on the road getting from one place to another (and getting lost!)

In this connection, the housekeeping staff sometimes even seems to be intimidated by the \"Anglo\" guests, something I would attribute to the language barrier. The grounds are beautiful and scrupulously maintained. As the name of this hotel indicates, it is in a perfect location if you play golf, with a large golf course next door. To do just about anything else in Puerto Rico from the Gran Melia, it is advisable to rent a car. The fare in the hotel's restaurants is good, but overpriced; there is a large selection of restaurants in nearby Luquillo and Fajardo. El Yunque National Park (a rainforest) and the bathing beach at Luquillo are within half an hour's driving distance from the hotel; the hotel's own beach is good only for sunning oneself and walking, and you will need sandals to do the latter. The hotel is self contained, or all-inclusive if you please, with a casino, a small store, a spa, large lounges, billiard tables, a small playground for kids, and a swimming pool with Bali beds surrounding it. The swimming pool does not have a lifeguard; if the hotel has one defect, this would be it in my opinion. In sum, Gran Melia is a good spot to go to play golf or to stay if you want to get away from the winter snow.

The included breakfast nearly pays for the cost of the upgrade, plus there are added perks such as the cocktail hour and private adults only pool. You can also rent the bali beds at the pool for the entire stay at no cost. We also upgraded to the beach front room, which has a jacuzzi on the balcony. There is no swimming (or lounging) beach at this hotel. The shoreline is a bit rocky but can make for a nice stroll along the beach in your flip flops. We ate at the Puerto Rican restaurant which was very good. The service is slow but I've found that is to be expected when you are on an island. Cafe Soleil has a great breakfast spread with absolutely anything you can imagine. The hotel is right next to the incredible Trump International golf course. The course is in incredible condition and is challenging for both scratch and novice golfers. We rented a car which I would highly recommend. We took a side trip to the Rain Forest, to Fajardo for the Bio Bay Kayak excursion (which I highly recommend) and also to Luquillo for the delicious restaurants (they call them \"kiosks\") that are there.

Yes, it is pricey; but I have a MAS (hotel points) gold card which got one free breakfast with a paid breakfast. The first night we ate in the Japanese restaurant. We had been travelling and were starved, so they could have fed us cardboard and we would have eaten it. Actually the food was good; but portions were a bit small. Our room was wonderful - we are vacation club members and had an awesome suite. Housekeeping was very good. The people at the hotel - both staff and guests - were soooooo friendly. Another thing I noticed - no one was hawking anything to us. We could walk the beach and it was so private. We did rent a car - made the reservation prior to the trip - at the hotel (Avis). This allowed us to get out and sightsee at our leisure as well as to eat evening meals elsewhere. About the beach - I considered it to be \"natural\". White sand has not been brought in as the hotels in Mexico have done. Bring a pair of cheap water shoes and walk along the beach. It was a lot of fun looking for shells. The YHI spa is very nice. I had a massage one afternoon and because I was there near closing, they extended an invitation to use the facilities the next day.

When my Mom tried calling about no housekeeping, she was transferred to many different people and one lady in particular stood out by questioning my Mom about it... something like \"Are you sure?\" WHAT?! It was so ridiculous that we went to the front desk to complain. Other minor issues would be the lack of nightlife, small maintenance issues (broken lightbulb, broken remote, etc.), outrageous parking fees (ours was about $12 a day), lack of beach, cold (read UNHEATED) pool, and super expensive onsite restaurants. Now for the good things! The resort is gorgeous! The design is very japanese in places. Rooms are spacious and well decorated. An in-room safe was a plus. The bed was comfortable. The pool was nice to lay by with comfy lounge chairs and cabanas that I could sleep in all day! The grounds were well kept. The walk to our bungalow (11) wasn't that bad. Though the resort was big, it was easy to get around. The casino was small but there was plenty of entertainment. Bottom line I recommend staying somewhere else where you can spend less and probably receive better quality of service! The location isn't that bad if you have a car to bring you to some of the kiosks for your meals. There's a bakery called Coco's on the corner of the main road that serves good breakfast food.

Our favorite things about this resort were the rooms, which were beautifully designed, very clean, a good size, quiet and had their own balcony. Also, the rooms are very close to the beach.

While the young staff is earnest and looking to please, management appears to be ineffectual and devoid of imagination. Specifically, an atmosphere of disorganization seems to pervade every aspect of the place. First the food. Because it is located in a remote spot there are no real options for food except for their very overpriced restaurants. The food is good, but the service is abysmal and amateurish. In a land where coffee is a big deal we were never able to get a cup of post dinner coffee. In addition they make it sound like the restaurants offer elegant dining except they don't enforce the dress code so I was sitting next to a guy wearing an undershirt and shorts. Also, because there are no restaurants that cater more for the younger crowd (Johnny Rockets?) dinner at two spots were frequently interrupted by loud children and management said nothing to the parents. While there is a pool bar and restaurant the food is very expensive. The buffet breakfast is $23 for \"hot\" and $16 for \"cold\". Since my eggs and sausage were cold and greasy I asked the waiter if i could be charged at the lower price. When you get the final bill you will find that you have spent over $1,000 on food and drinks over a 4 day stay. Second, the facilities. The grounds are well kept and attractive. The rooms are nicely designed but the beds and pillows were terrible. There are no organized events for children - not that it is billed as a family resort- but I noticed some kids trying to play touch football on a small patch of grass. Oh yes they can get an airbrushed tattoo for $7 (my wife did get one). Music blasted across the pool area that included one or two rap songs with lyrics bordering on the X rated. Location: Very remote. Going to Old San Juan takes about 45 minutes and about $160 round trip for three people. In the midst of all this i was being urged to join the \"Gran Melia Vacation Club\".

It is ultimately the SERVICE that makes the resort, the attitude of the people that run the place. And this was the WORST service we have ever experienced in any Melia, really not the Melia we know. We have been at the Melia Cancun, the Melia from Punta Cana, and even the Melia from Torremolinos, Spain. The service was the distinguishing factor in all of them, impeccable. But this one, Puerto Rico was a disaster. Housekeeping: I think the root of the problem is the manager, Brenda, a woman that was so arrogant, so rude and belligerent in treating my husband and me, who were guests at the resort, we can only imagine how she treats the employees. Employees that are bullied like that will obviously in turn not do their jobs! So, our room was not cleaned one day, we went to an excursion the entire day and instead of returning to a clean room with fresh towels and made beds to rest a little, take showers and go to dinner, we came to a dirty room! When we called, Brenda instead asked: \"Did you call for service?\". She was blaming us for the room not getting cleaned! Another day, they cleaned the rooms, but didn't put fresh towels, like the cleaning lady was suddenly called away in the middle of her work and didn't finish the bathroom. They sent us the \"manager\" of the housekeeping who was apologetic and very sheepish, embarrassed, mortified poor man. It was this bully Brenda that was clearly abusing everyone. After we returned from dinner, they had cleaned the room and made cute towel animals; but we would rather not get anything cute and just plain regular service when appropriate. Room Service: Our room never had a room service list or a book or binder with any of the hotel amenities, no spa booklet, and no resort restaurant guide. I didn't use the spa because I never got a list of the services and prices! When you are on vacation with your family, time is essential and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to waste your time trying to get information. We called room service to get two mojitos, and got this Brenda woman again. She said: \"Room service is only for wine and beer\". My husband called the bar man who said he could prepare the mojitos and have room service personnel bring them. We called this Brenda again to tell her to send the personnel to pick up the mojitos, and again she said: \"No, you can't get mojitos through room service; you have to go down to the bar yourself.\" So there was this tug of war between Brenda and the bar man, not my problem to deal with. I told Brenda \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You know, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the guest, I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be calling several people to get a drink, deal with getting me the mojitos, but she refused to do so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Again, we have been at several Melia resorts and have always called for a late night drink to have on the balcony after our boys go to sleep, no problem. On the contrary, in Melia Cancun the room service staff actually made us a special drink he invented, with delicious cream rum, and brought them to our room late at night. This is the first time I ever heard that room service does not bring you a drink! The next night, two engineers came to fix several lights and the AC that was not working properly and we told them about the mojito incident. They were stunned, and made no comment about this Brenda, the kind of silence that shows that she's a problem there. 10 minutes after they left we got a call from the bar man who said \"I'm in charge here; I'm sending you two mojitos with the engineers\". And so they did and we tipped them handsomely, and of course paid for the drinks and the service, which was never an issue. But this was an individual doing his \"service\", not the attitude of the resort as it should be. Again, I think this Brenda was the poison apple in the entire system, poisoning the moral and attitude of the staff and the people and there's a tug of war with her and other workers and the guests pay the price. Brenda and her horrible attitude is killing the natural service mind of the employees, killing the resort and the image of Melia. Pool and Jacuzzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: With respect to the rest of the service, the pool was not heated and neither were the jacuzzi's. So if you go in winter, it is only about 75F and the water was freezing. We would have loved to use the stunning pool and jacuzzi's but what good are they if they are freezing cold? In Punta Cana they heated the pool, even though it was summer hot. In our room the Jacuzzi water never came out hot enough, only lukewarm, so we couldn't use that one either. We were tired of calling for things, so we just decided to get out of there, and did every kind of excursion available. Pasion Restaurant: We booked a 9pm dinner at the resort gourmet Puerto Rican restaurant, Pasion. They sat us down on time, gave us water and menus. 25 minutes later, we had not been served, no bread, no waitress. We flagged the waitress down, and my husband asked to get us another waiter, several were just walking around, but this waitress said: \"No, I'll take care of you when I'm done with this other table.\" Usually, you take care of the guests within 5 to 10 minutes, max, at least have someone come and bring bread, tell you about the menu, bring a wine list. So, 5 minutes later, we stood up and walked out. Again, ridiculous lack of service, in such a beautiful place. Again, either the chef does not know how to manage a restaurant and insists on doing it herself or putting her incompetent cronies in charge. Again, belligerent Puerto Rican women, the male waiters were too sheepish to take the initiative and start taking our orders, they are afraid of the rude and pushy women. We went to the Italian restaurant at the resort and they immediately served us and acknowledged that several other guests had issues with Pasion, which is not Melia-owned but a concession. The problem is that we wouldn't know that since the restaurant is in the resort, so all ill-will goes to the Melia! Even if Melia allows non-resort restaurants, they should monitor that the service is up to standard, but it appears that whoever is in charge of this Melia is in La La land about service. Or, worse, they gave power to the Brenda woman who is an unprofessional, obviously uneducated in resort and hotel hospitality, disaster. Whatever it was, it negatively impacted my vacation. Pricing v. Value: Furthermore, although the Italian restaurant was good, and so was the buffet breakfast, they were very expensive for the level of service and quality of the food. We obviously expect to pay extra when we go on vacation, but we also expect that paying $35 for a plate of penne pasta must come along with gourmet taste, service and ambiance. Living in LA and having Las Vegas really close, we are used to top of the line restaurants and for that price you should be served like a king. A $22 breakfast buffet should include much more than your standard eggs, omelets, and cut fruit. At least it does in the other Melia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and resorts we have been to all over the Caribbean, Europe, South America, and even China. Overall: I would not go back to this place, Melia Puerto Rico. If it wasn't for having our own rented Jeep and taking excursions they would have totally ruined our experience. We simply used the resort for sleeping, again the pool was freezing and the jacuzzi's unheated. So, whatever beauty there was, was totally superficial; a total disappointment. I would recommend people stay in Isla Verde, in San Juan, it sounds like those hotels are better, at least you have more to do walking distance, you can escape if the service is poor, but fellow excursion guests stated they liked the service at the various resorts in Isla Verde.

We renewed our wedding vows in the outdoor wedding chapel at sunset, and couldn't have asked for a more serene and beautiful setting. We enjoyed 2 restaurants for dinners (a little pricey), and had lunch by the pool. Since we upgraded to the nicer oceanfront rooms our breakfast was included. The rooms were spacious and very nicely decorated and we had a Jacuzzi on our balcony outside that we enjoyed in the evenings- overlooking the ocean you can't ask for anything more than that. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to assist us with anything that we needed. My only recommendation would be to get the bar staff to interact more with the patrons in the bar. The hotel hired a radio station to entertain those staying at the hotel but unfortunately there was no dancing. You could really relax and enjoy the resort at a slow pace- Island time. Your vacation is what you make of it. You can go anticipating having a good time and make it happen, or you can go and complain during your entire stay and have a bad time.

Since we planned on sight seeing the first two nights we stayed in a regular room, but then upgraded the last three nights to the Royal Service. We travel to the Caribbean at least once per year, and the only smell we found was the tropical smell you find on the island. Nothing unpleasant. Although our regular room was nice, and the check in went smoothly, it was worth it to do the royal service. The check-in was great, you receive complimentary breakfast buffet (a nice selection of made to order pancakes, omelets, eggs, etc..along with cereals, fruits and bakery items. It was filling enough that we were able to just snack for lunch. You receive complimentary wine or beer from 6-9pm. So we would stop in to have a before dinner drink. Regarding the restaurant: We went to the Italian restaurant at the resort even though we are not pasta lovers. They have a nice selection of choices on their menu. My husband had a steak $32 that was really good, and I had Sea Bass for $27. I eat seafood out quit often, yet I found this was one of the best seafood meals I ever had. I liked it so much we went back the night before we left. We thought the prices we actually very reasonable for the quality of food and service we received. We live in medium sized city in Wisconsin and these meals would cost us more in a nice restaurant by our home. We eat earlier so we had no problem getting seating. And when you are in the Royal Service, and you are sitting by the pool, you can just request the Service Manager to make you a reservation. They will assist you with anything you need while you are sun bathing. Also the bar in RS makes the best drinks. The Bali beds are also complimentary in RS. On your first day you can request a particular bed to be reserved for the time you are staying at the resort. They will make sure a clean sheet and towels are laid out each morning for your arrival. These beds cost $35 rent if you are not in the RS area. Also you get rid of the orange band, and get a nicer looking white string type rope for a band to indicate you are in RS. We did not find the walk from the car to the room, or from the room to any of the facility anything bad. The grounds are nice to walk around and enjoy the sun. The fitness room was nice and clean. It provides treadmills, a few machines and some weights. It you want to use the sauna and steam room, you would have to pay a fee approx of $30 per day. Otherwise it is free with a spa service. We found the prices for the spa treatments to be expensive. Regarding Parking: It is customary to be charged a parking fee at the majority of hotels near us from $15-$25 per day. So we took the advice of a previous reviewer and rented an Avis car at the airport. The resort allows you to park free with an Avis car rental. Since we rented it at the airport and not at the resort, we emailed them prior to arriving to get an email confirmation that they would waive the fee - we had no problems. Location: Make sure you have driving directions with you when you arrive. We relied on the rental company to supply the directions, and that was a poor decision. They had us drive the back roads when took us 3 hrs to get from the airport to the resort during rush hour. The traffic can get really bad, so try to avoid driving during their rush hour times. We would highly recommend a car. In the long run it will save you money, cause the airport shuttles are pricey and then sight seeing transportation is also costly. If you have a car, it is an easy drive to the rain forest and it is free to enter. The forts also only have a minimal charge to enter if you have your own transportation.. Checkout was also easy. They provide you with a breakdown of all your charges and deliver the summary the morning of your departure. Since all charges at the resort are charged to your room, keep an inventory of what you are spending. We were not receiving receipts when we charged any items, but we were able to recall all of our charges. The only complication was when we were in the RS area, our charges came up under code numbers and so it was a little more difficult to confirm. But the check-out clerk was extremely nice to assist. So just give yourself amble time to review. We had no problems with tips as many of the reviewers indicated. We added our tip to the bill and that was all we were charged. If you don't want to be charged an International Transaction Fee on your charge card bill, I would suggest looking into a Credit Union credit card due to the majority of them do not charge this fee. We would highly recommend this resort. We only have a few negative comments...The pool to the swim up bar was cold, so we did not get to enjoy as much as we thought we would. This probably saved us a lot of money. And the bar tender was not very friendly. All other employees were excellent so this was no big deal. ...We would not suggest ordering the bar area pizza. We ordered pizza while we sat in the bar area to watch one of the football games and it was the worst pizza that we ever had. We weren't even being picky. And we don't even mind frozen cheap pizza. But this was not edible....and the last thing is RS should consider making their lounge \"adults only\" during the happy hour time. We did not find it comfortable to sit around and have a couple drinks with kids running around and watching childrens shows on tv. They also would take up the computers just to hit the keys while the parents would be having their drinks. It was not bad..just inconvenient.

The room was alright and clean, however, I understand the \"musty smell\" some reviewers spoke of...likely due to the tropical location and the high humidity as well as a closed room with no air movement...once you turned the air on and had some movement in and out of the room it was gone. I noticed that some people had small efficiency type rooms but some did not, but they were charged the same rates. The mini bar charges you the minute the door opens...so don't accidentally touch it. The staff is very friendly and kind and ready to assist you any way they can. We visited the casino and we found it to be fair, but they are not busy so they sometimes aren't paying attention and clear the tables quickly mssing your winning number/card etc. But if you won and they aren't sure they call up watch the camera and pay you fairly. The pool is huge and beautiful...but colder than you'd expect. They also offer a 1ft kid's pool which is nice for the little ones, as well as 2ft areas in the 5ft pool (which has a pool bar). The beach is not really what you'd expect either...they get a lot of high tide so they have large boulders surrounding the property between the hotel and the beach. It is nice for a stroll but not to lounge. They have hermit crabs on the beach and some side walking crabs which are really cool to see. The biggest problem I had with this resort was the restaurant prices. They advertise 5 restaurants, but in reality they have the Wet Bar & Grill that offers burgers (kids $6, adult $11 both same size but adult has lettuce, tomato, onion, and mushrooms), chicken finger $7, hot dog $7, wings $9 and beer $4, mixed drinks $9. A very similar menu is found at the Avenue Bar however the prices are about $5 more on all of the same food items the Wet Bar offers! Pasion is a restaurant on the hotel grounds offering local cuisine at a hefty price as well. The food is good but not extravagent...I wouldn't rave about it. Plan on spending atleast $120 there. Nami Asian Bistro has excellent food at somewhat reasonable prices, compared to the other choices. This also ranges $20-40 per person. A sushi roll is $9. Hiabchi is $25-40. The other choice is Tempo which offers Italian cuisine, however I didn't experience this restaurant myself. A colleague went and said the food was good ranged in price $25-50 per plate but portions were on the smaller side. The funny thing is some people were offered a \"meal plan\" for $91/person but others weren't, and it apparently incuded unlimited drinks from 12pm-12am. I wasn't fortunate enough to be made aware of this secret meal plan. There are a lot of inconsistencies. They have a large sign at the entrance that warns of not bringing in outside coolers or food. You basically have to pay ridiculously high prices or smuggle food in. Your best bet is to rent a car and travel to some of the local places outside the resort. They have great food at great prices. Old San Juan was gorgeous and I'd have to recommend the Old Harbor Brewery. It's a restaurant/microbrewery that has great food! Prices are reasonable as well...dinner $75. The Bacardi Distillery is nice to see as well and it's free. The rum to buy in their store is about $10-12...awesome prices! I heard the rainforest was nice as well. I also heard great raves about Flamingo Beach.

The entire resort was absolutely stunning as far as the physical appearances go, The staff was efficient, friendly and helpful. the rooms reminded me of Italian villas. now for the cons and they were major: I choose a hotel for location, cleanliness and comfort. The Gran Melia's location was great if you had a car which we did. However, if you didn't then you were limited to the resort and had to pay their outrageous prices for everything! There were several restaurants but one was closed the nights we were there and there was usually an hour wait @ the ones that were open. If you ordered food from the bar you had to pay a room service fee even if you ate at the bar. We ate at the Cafe and the buffet meal was only average in quality but cost over $26pp. Daily parking was provided for a fee of $17per day and was located a very long, long way from your room. Golf cart service was offered checking in and out which was nice since the rooms were so far away. you'd never find your room without this service. The physical grounds were well kept. The wedding chapel was stunning and would be a beautiful place to have a wedding. The main problem I had with this hotel and it was a major problem was the fact that Gran Melia put us in a moldy, musty room knowing that it had mold issues. Both my traveling buddy and I have stayed in many hotels around the world and have never woken up ill the next morning because of a moldy room. This was a first. The bathroom ceiling had mold, the bathroom floors were so dirty that I wore my beach sandals everywhere, even in the shower. When we complained, the hotel sent over a person to spray the room with a freshner! We complained again and were offered another room which was also musty but not moldy. Upon contacting the front desk we were told that the service dept had previously noted the mold. I question why the hotel would put their customers in a \"known\" moldy room. This is not the service I have come to expect from Sol Melia as other Sol Melia hotels where I've stayed have been really good experiences. Unfortunately this hotel places more emphasis on its physical appearance than it's basics. The hotel location, the physical buildings and appearances were top notch, but renting moldy, musty rooms to guests is shameful.

Actually, it is 3.5 miles from the little \"town\" of Rio Grande, and take about 10 minutes to get out to Highway 3. Food is expensive (what do you expect from a 4 star resort). Continental breakfast $16... Limitted food selection (only 2 or 3 restaurants are opened during slow weekdays, not the 7 as advertised). Parking is $15 a day. The ground is spacious, and there are frequent shuttles from your room to the main lobby (where casino, restaurant, large pool, etc). The website is misleading - there is no scuba diving on premise. If enough guests want to learn to scuba, they will send an instructor in the pool to teach you. If you want to dive in the ocean, nearest dive shop is Fajardo (15 to 30 minutes away). In slow season, it is hard to find a dive boat that goes out daily, and you might have to drive to Humacao (50 min to 1 hr). Afternoon and night dives are rare in slow seasons. Rio Grand has little to offer except local cuisines, Subway, etc. The local supermarket (1 block east of CocoBeach Dr on Hwy 3 on the north side) has a variety of local food in a buffet style at dirt cheap price - better than you'll find in the restaurants if you do not mind styrofoam and plastic forks. For REAL local flavor, there are about 40 \"Kioshes\" on Luquillo beach, about 5 miles west of CocoBeach Dr. on Hwy 3 on the ocean side. Here you will find all kind of pastries, fried fish, and the local favorite - land crabs or juezes - in rice, in pastries, and stew. The Kioshes are packed with cars on weekends, and only a few are opened on weekdays. I did not swim in the ocean much, the waves were very large, and the water murky from the wave actions. My guess is with seasonal wind changes, you will find the water much more pleasant when the waves are calmer. The beaches are sheltered from the large waves from natural rocky reefs - so you don't have to worry about the large waves. They have a policy of no cooler or food in the rooms, so you'll have to sneak it in. They have a 24 hour guard to keep food and coolers out. Drinks are permitted across the guards, though. The casino has reasonable odd at the slots (probably 60 to 80% return), so you can have reasonable fun. The staff are friendly and courteous. I do not see Kayak rental, but they suppose to have snorkel rental at the beach. There are several pools (one at the beach, one by the gym/spa, and one huge one at the lobby). The pools are large enough for laps (20m except the gym site). The movies are like 15 bucks on the TV, if you lift a bottle out of the wine refrigerator in the room, you will be charged even if you put it back (duh, what if you refilled it with water?). Rough distances - to airport and Isla Verde blvd beach - 30 min or 15 mile. Old San Juan, 25 mile or 45 to 60 min. Dorado 30 mile, 45 to 60 min. Luquillo beach, 8 mile, 10 min.

We had booked the resort through Expedia and chose this resort because it was a 4 star resort with a golf course at a very good rate ($130 / night). After reading some of the reviews we were concerned but over the years we have learned to take these reviews with a grain of salt as no hotel with a 4 star rating could be as bad as some people claim. We arrived in San Juan via cruise ship and after negotiating with a tour company we made a deal that gave us a bus tour of Old San Juan and then a lift to the airport ($25/person) were we could rent a vehicle. We were only staying in Puerto Rico for three nights and decided it was not worth renting a vehicle and chose to take a taxi to the resort (government rate of $35 / person). The reviews were accurate in that it took about 45 minutes to reach the resort and it is off the beaten path, however it is not that far from local restaurants and stores and yes you would need a vehicle to reach them from the resort. Our first view of the resort was impressive with fountains and pools everywhere and a dramatic, ancient Greek inspired, open air structure. We were greeted by bell boys that unload our luggage and gave us a warm welcome. Upon arriving at the front desk we were quickly checked in and immediately offered an upgrade to the Royal Service (RS). It turns out that the Royal Service was not clearly explained to us at the front desk nor at the Royal Service desk, so we knew we were getting a better room and some perks but were not exactly sure what. It would have been better if they had given us a brochure of what we would receive rather than us having to continually ask what was included with the Royal Service. We also found it confusing as some of the staff did not seem to know what was included and we ended up not getting some of the services. We thought the Royal Service upgrade was worth it in the end. We drink lots of water and would have had to go to a store and buy a case if the resort had not offered it for free. The free breakfast was worth it as well and it was nice to sit on the balcony or in the balcony hot tub and listen to and watch the wave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in. It was $125 per day which brought our room cost up to $250, if we had paid full price for the room it would not have been within our budget. The resort complex is quite large and spread out, all the rooms are a short to medium leisurely walk from the lobby and they do have a cart that will pick you up if you have problems walking or are just feeling lazy. The grounds are beautifully manicured with plenty of lush grass a shrubbery. The beach is large and easy to walk but the sand it hard packed and you would require a lounge chair to spend any time on it. There is a rock barrier between the beach and the ocean that you must climb over in order to reach the water. The ocean is kept at bay with a reef which keeps the waves to a minimum and allows you to swim comfortably in the ocean but sadly there is quite a bit of seaweed which makes the experience less comfortable. The public pool is very big and beautiful while the RS private pool is smaller and less spectacular. There are no hot tubs, the public pool does have two areas that provide a hot tub experience with water jets, and benches but the water is the same temperature as the main pool. We found the pool water to be cool and the ocean was much warmer to swim in. Our room was quite large and elegantly decorated. We had a king size bed and still had plenty of room to wander around in. There was a flat screen TV and game consol. The fridge was fully stocked but be warned, it works on a censor and if you remove a bottle it will automatically charge your room for it even if you put the bottle back. There was an iron and ironing board and an umbrella in case you wanted to go out in the rain or visit the nearby rainforest. The bath room had a very large full size walk-in shower with orange scented styling products. There was a large balcony with a hot tub and great view of the beach and ocean. There was a slight musty smell but it quickly disappeared, we have stayed at other seaside resorts and experienced this there as well, we think it is just the humidity that gets trapped and stales the air. Once the air circulates everything seems okay. They do offer excursions to the most popular attractions. We chose a tour of the Juan Diego Falls, El Yunque National Rain Forest (approx. $60 each) as it was only 15 minutes from the resort and was well worth the money as our tour guide Juan really knew his stuff and was very entertaining. We chose the tour that took us to a waterfall that we had to hike down a two mile trail. The Juan Diego Falls was wonderful and we went for a swim, the water was cold but bearable and refreshing. The waters rejuvenated us which made the two mile hike back up the mountain much easier. We had planned to go golfing as there is Trump International Golf Course right next to the resort but they were closed the two days we were there due to maintainance. Yes we would go back if we could get the same deal. We went during the off season and had the resort nearly to ourselves as we estimate there were less than 150 guests at the time.

The room was nice looking, modern except for the CRT TV. Everything was very clean, no bugs, & the bath products were decent. Housekeeping did an excellent job and provided turn-down service as well. Having read the reviews about how expensive the food was, we brought snacks along with us. The royal service took care of the breakfast (would have been $40-$50 before tip otherwise for 2 drinks, 2 \"entrees\" and 2 sides otherwise). Breakfast was at Cafe Solei (we also had lunch there once) - was ok at best - def not worth the $ if we had paid for it. We had hibachi at Nami, which was tasty and not out of line for Japanese restaurant prices. We tried the pizza at the bar and it was super expensive and not good. $27 for a medium looking cardboard crust pizza that was awful and tilted!!!! 17% mandatory tip for all the cheese to one side is not good. We agree w/ the reviews about the drinks not having any alcohol - they don't. It looked to be between half and 1 shot per drink. Def do not stay here if drinking is important. Also, we did get a rental car since as other reviews indicated, you can't get anywhere otherwise without doing expensive tours. It's definitely worthwhile to go places with your own transportation, just watch out for the locals who don't know how to stay in their own lanes (most of them)!

The beach is not a swimming beach, but is just fine for strolling and/or cooling off in. Very similar to beaches in Italy.

The grounds are immaculate and breathtaking. The Lobby is so beautifully furnished, it's stunning. The weekend breakfast buffet at Cafe Soliel is AWESOME for 22 bucks per person.

The WI FI is expensive abt 15 dollars per day. bring an ethernet cable. Parking is 16 dollars per day. Avis parking is even father away, dont bother.

They charge 45 dollars per day for the poolside beds (annoying, no one was using them). There is no hot tub, just a whirlpool. So that's a bummer at night. The pool is 24 hours. Our room smelled of mold. We instantly got it changed without a problem. They are super prompt with requests for toiletries/towels for the rooms. The Bungalows are a lined up along the resort about .35 miles (I ran along the grounds all over to the ownership villas etc at 7AM and LOVED IT), BUT for those that dont exercise, there are golf carts picking you up and dropping you off at your whim, like valet service.

BUT there are chairs tables everywhere that face the ocean. Get up early and see the sunrise over the Atlantic. The beach is less than 8 minutes (with traffic, and lights) up the road in Luquillo, and its great. The rooms were cleaned daily without concern. The air conditioner was a pain in the butt. It comes on no matter how many times you turn it off, the room was FREEZING all the time. And its terrible for sinuses, something is going on with the air quality in those rooms. There are no screens so open the patio door just enough to warn the marble titled floors and close it. The tiny biting gnats are the worst things on earth. You never see them but they are fast and go for the kill 5 times per landing on your skin. So dont think other hotels are better etc, we went to a Hilton Golf Resort just to be nosey, and I almost cried in disgust. The grass is not greener, especially not for the prices we paid. The staff was courteous, and helpful, and happy. The gym is nice too, BUT there are no towels so that was annoying.

After traveling about 3 hrs by car and arriving at the hotel we spent at least 10 minutes trying to find a self parking spot. Apparently they had a convention going on. I've stayed at other hotels that offer valet parking at the same rate of self parking when their self parking lot is full but not this one. Once the checkin was completed we were taken by a cart to our room. As I opened the door I smelled a strong cigarrete odor in the bedroom. I asked the cart driver/luggage assistant if this was a smoking room but he mentioned that all rooms were non smoking. One quick scan of the room and I noticed a cigarette but in a small dish on a nightstand next to a half empty water bottle (from the mini bar) and a fully dressed bed with clear signs that someone had \"slept\" on. One quick glance at the bathroom and there were some trash in a bag on top of the toilet. The cart driver tried to convince me that the room was not serviced before my arrival by mistake but that was clearly not the case. Definetly one staff member had used it for his \"leisure\". After calling the front desk twice to get a room change we were moved to a different room within the same building. The first time I called the front desk the phone kept ringing without no one answering. Once I entered the second room assigned I quickly smelled mold but I expected it to go away as soon as I turned on the AC. We were all already tired from the long trip and my kids wanted to go to bed so we decided to stay in that room (1018). We still had to wait for maintenance to set up the sofa bed and for extra towels since the room had only 3 of them. The door lock did not work and some one saying he was from housekeeping opened our door around 10:00pm but we had not called housekeeping. He said he was notifying maintenance to have someone fix the lock. No one came during our stay to fix the door. The problem was actually the strike plate which was not at the correct height. Next day we went to the breakfast buffet. Paid full price for the hot buffet 2 adults, 1 children at half price and one free children. At the end of breakfast the tab was $60 believe it or not. Lunch by the pool was another $55 for chicken strips, hot dog, cheese burger and sodas. Way too expensive for regular food.

I was aware it wasn't all inclusive and I budgeted accordingly. In general I don't see what everyone has been complaining about recently. The hotel grounds were gorgeous. Everything was clean and none of the landscaping was overgrown or dead. The reviews of the beach are correct. Rockier than most, and the waves are pretty much. However, if you walk over to around where the Royal Service area is you can find a nice area that is wading acceptable. With watershoes mind you. My room was very nice and clean. It did have a musty odor but I found nothing to show that it was for lack of cleanliness or mold. I believe that is a product of the area. I was in the Dominican Republic in May and our room there had the same smell. The airconditioner worked well and I was fortunate to be in a bungalow right across from the spa. I could see where people in other bungalows would be annoyed with the walk. I also had an extra minifridge brought to my room so I could bring food back when I left the resort. It is a $25 flat fee and well worth it. But, keep in mind it is a MINI fridge. Nothing really big, leftover boxes, will fit. I ate at 2 restruants while there: Passion and the Wet Bar by the pool. The wet back is equivalent price wise, to like an Applebees. Passion was $60 for an appetizer, dinner, desert, mixed drink, and a tip. I ordered room service 2x. Food was great. Including the pizza another reviewer claimed was horrible. Was a full size too. They do automatically add tip and there is a deliverly charge so it won't be necessarily cheaper than eating at one of the restraunts. The resort itself is off the beaten path. If you are wanting to mosey about or eat off the resort then I would highly recommend getting a rent. And, book online before you leaven through Avis and pick up the vehicle at the resort. This way you can avoid parking in tinbucktwo by using Avis's parking lot near the entrance! I got a car for 1 day and wished I had gotten it for 2. I tried to get excursions but transportation was an issue. So, again, plan ahead. If you want to eat locally, do excursions, and have the option to leave the resort the get a rental. If you plan on staying at the resort prepare the buget accordingly for taxis you might have to take, the extra money you will have to spend to get any excursion to come to you, and for the resort food. Speaking of excursions the rain forest is a must!!! I also booked the Monkey Island tour, but unfortunately the waters were too rough to actually do it. Even so the guides, Keisha and Bob, were very helpful to me throughout my whole trip experience to Puerto Rico and I really appreciated it! Old San Juan is also a must. Suggestion here too... It is about 30 min from the hotel. If you pay for transportation through Dragonfly (onsite transportation) I would make contact with them when you land, tell them you want them to take your luggae to the resort, and then get a taxi to take you to old San Juan. I did this when I arrived and it was great! Taxis from the airport to Old San Juan are $19 each way; flat rates and Dragonfly was very accomodating. The day I departed I checked my luggage in early, then left the airport again and taxied over to Old San Juan for things I missed. All in all I had a great time. It rained every day but that is typical for the Carribean. I did alot of research before leaving and it helped me out a lot. I have read some reviews where people have had long check out times. I checked out at 8am so I could get to the airport by 9 to head over to Old San Juan. My flight wasn't till 3. I I was back at the airport by 1:30pm and had plenty of time. BUT.. if I had gone on schedule I would have been checking out with everyone else at the resort. Call the front desk and ask them how may people are checking out on your check out date. That will give you some kind of gage as to how long it might take. If you are okay leaving early that might help your wait times. :>) Don't even OPEN your minifridge. It is electronically monitored and you will get billed even if you don't take anything out. Just avoid it. I didn't get billed b/c I didn't open it, but I have heard of people whom have. Just a heads up. Overall I had a great time. I wish I could have stayed longer, and other than needing to get a rental for more than 1 day, I have no complaints.

Then as I approached the front desk I was informed of a policy to hold $100 per night for as a deposit in addition to the rental fee. After much arguing they agreed to get only $100 deposit and off we went to the room. As we open the door on bungalow 3 we were hit with an overpowering smell of mold and mildew. Then I asked the bellman if all rooms smell like that and he said no and proceeded to open the sliding glass door as if he was implying that we were going to accept the conditions of the room. At that point we were so disappointed that we decided to check out and as we walked back to the front area we could not missed the poor conditions of the tennis court. Certainly they granted and respected our decision of leaving but this was a mess that cost me the lost of an entire day of my vacation. It is clear that the hotel needs renovations or they need to do a better job at maintaining it. As we were checking out there was another couple complaining also about the conditions of the room.

There are only two choices in restaurants for lunch both with very slow service waiting for ever for your food again no refills on drinks and wait forever for the check for 5 days in a row. Then only two restuarants for dinner when they are open are very expensive and have a limited menu. If you want to eat anywhere else you need to rent a car and drive far thru bad areas to get there. The cabs are $80 round trip to get anywhere. Also the hotel is constantly trying to get you to take there time share tour the whole week they were hounding us and we finally gave in so they would leave us alone. The resort does not except cash at any restaurants or bars. Room service pizza was horrible. We were so excited to leave we went 5 hrs early to the airport just to finally eat some good food. We were never so excited for fast food before. When we went to check out no one offered us any compensation nor did anyone even ask us how our stay was. Apparently they dont care.

As a couple with a two year old we weren't planning on anything too adventurous-just a relaxing vacation. I am a clean freak so I was worried with some of the reviews I had read about the mold or uncleanliness. I am happy to say the resort was spotless. The grounds were perfectly manicured and the rooms were cleaned to perfection. My only complaint as far as cleanliness would be that the beach area needs to be maintained as well as the other parts of the resort. We stayed under the trees on the little strip of beach, if it were raked it would have been so much more enjoyable esp with a two yr old. As for the rocks on the beach they weren't as bad as it was stated in some of the reviews. If you have been to most beaches in Europe these are hardly a comparison. The resaurants are very pricey and the food is mediocre. We had pretty good food at the Asian place and the cafe. The Italian restaurant was ok and so was Pasion but beware if you are on the meal plan Pasion is the only place that isn't included and it's expensive-we learned the hard way. Another complaint is the communication between the resort and the customers. We were told so many different things when it came to whats included with our deluxe meal plan. We went to the front desk time after time asking more questions. First we were told every restaurant was included then we went to Pasion and spent over 115 dollars to find out it wasnt covered under the meal plan. Then Antonette at the front told us she would try to reverse some of the charges because we absolutly didnt know and she never did a thing. Also, do not listen to the pool bar and grill staff when they tell you your drinks are included under the plan. We got zero bills for two days then someone finally told us that our drinks weren't included and charged us per drink from those days to our room. What a joke! The drinks(vodka and soda) were $9. Wow its like being in Manhatten but in the middle of Puerto Rico. One last super important detail-----DO NOT TIP IN CASH!!!!! Even though we crossed out the tip on the bill when we were billed for our meals and drinks we were still charged what the hotel wanted us to leave as tip. They will tell you that you can just cross out the tip line on the ck and leave cash but do not listen. We payed for tips at the time of the bill( 20% )and were forced upon check out to pay for tips that the staff automatically charges to your room knowing you will have no choice but to pay for it. The girl at the desk told me she couldn''t take it off because she had no proof we left tip. Another problem with communication favoring the resort. Let me just sum it all up-the resort is wonderful and clean. It is so pretty and the staff is very friendly. The restaurants are priced too high for the quality. Make sure you buy a meal plan and demand a printout before you start using it. Try to get it before vacation so you have it with you. The tips are charged to your room for every meal and beverage whether you cross it out and pay cash or not. Finally, the communication with the resort and the customers suck! Overall we had fun and spent an extra 250+ after the purchase of the meal plan. Allow yourselves over an hour for checkout because your bill will be a disaster and whatever you prepay like the shuttle have proof that you payed or else! Also the towels are added to your bill so make sure they minus that $70 out!

The grounds were gorgeous, the pool felt like bath water, housekeeping came promptly every morning at 10am, and so did a little kitten who somehow found me (i love animals). There were peacocks, iguanas, hermit crabs, and cranes, and i felt like I was truly in a tropical place :) the room was drop dead gorgeous, the beds were extremely comfortable, and it was VERY spacious! my mother has a wyndham timeshare and my place was better than hers! I didn't want to go home and I'm planning a girls trip with me and my daughter in december. there are things there for kids to do, but i only saw a handful of them. the only downfall is that the food is a bit pricey so we only ate on the resort a few times, but we found these FANTASTIC hole in the wall restaurants that had AMAZING food! me and the hubby both were stuffed beyond means for $12 or less at these places.. we only spent $500 on food and a little souvenir shopping. there are PLENTY of things to do. theres malls like crazy, old san juan, the bioiluminescent bay, kayaking, a rainforest, horseback riding and a LOT more. there is a dragonfly on the resort that organizes the trips for you, but if you do a little research you can organize these things for a LOT less. the kayak trip for the bio-bay with dragonfly?? $199 a person and included dinner. We did it ourselves for $45 a person and went to the hole in the wall! spent half of what it would have cost for one person. the beach?? ehh.. not really a beach of you're an eastern or western shore person, but the pool was outstanding.. the wet bar had live music a few times we were there, and they were actually pretty good.. theres just SO much on the resort that I feel like i can write a small novel.. i love love love the gran melia!!", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cStay in San Juan\u201d", "Author": "acana3", "ReviewID": "UR77861287", "Content": "We arrived at the Melia on a Monday around 3pm; the front desk was empty so our check-in was quick. Checkout was quick as well. Lobby area was well kept and looked like the typical spacious Mexican Riviera resorts. The room was very nice, impeccable and clean, we loved it. No weird odors whatsoever or noise. It was a garden view with a look over the Yunque Ntn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122l Forest, a pleasure to look out when you wake up in the morning. Headed to the pool\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6total disappointment. It looked like a Crocodile swamp down in Florida, green, murky, not clean or inviting at all. Somebody next to us was playing her own music on her IPod dock, which first seemed odd and a bit ghetto turned out to be nicer than the music they were streaming from the pool bar. The beach is not nice here; we did not go in the water. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep the pool sparkling and clean. The hotel prices are way too much, almost intrusive, I would say. We ordered coffee for two the first morning: $14 that did not include anything. You can get a continental bkfast at a Mandarin Oriental for that price. There is only a $25 pp Buffet for breakfast. I personally hate buffets. And I also hate having only one option. Except for when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m at an all-inclusive hotel. So my strongest recommendation, if you need to stay here, get a car rental, so that you can have the freedom to go out and explore otherwise you will feel stuck. I mean really, what do you do in a hotel in the Caribbean if the pool is not clean and the beach is awful? Do you just eat the entire time? The problem with this hotel is the location and facilities.

You absolutely MUST get a rental car if you are going to stay at Gran Melia, otherwise you will be stranded with not much to do and restaurants with astronomical prices. The walk from the highway to the hotel is not one a normal person would reasonably want to make every day. It's about 10 minutes driving over the speed limit. They won't let you take a big cooler into your room, fridges are available for a fee. We went shopping for breakfast items in the local supermarket, and stored them in smaller containers on ice, which is readily available outside your room. DON'T book any trips through the hotel, such as the bio bay kayak trip, it will cost you at least twice as much. Instead just keep your eyes open when you drive around, there are numbers posted advertising different trips all over, or look at the ads in the magazine in your room. Staff is very nice and friendly. The beach is gorgeous, and the pool is huge. Don't freak out when you see your final bill, they put some charges on ours that didn't belong there but took it off right away when we went to check out. A word about parking-- you have to pay some ridiculous rate per day for it. If you rent a car from AVIS you won't have to.

Basically you have to stand in line at the FRONT desk to exchange your towel cards and not in a pool cabana. You essentially can wait a while if someone is checking out or is having an issue with their room, just to get two towels - $35 each towel if you don't return the cards, watch out for that one.

ANIMAL LOVERS BEWARE: Puerto Rico has a VERY VERY VERY BIG PROBLEM WITH STRAY DOGS AND CATS. They are all over the island and it is just heartbreaking to see so many animals either sick, starving, dead in the road/just hit by a car and just plain plain poor health. At the food kioskos in Luquillo, the stray animals can wander in and out of the restaraunts, not very sanitary IMO that you can serve food and skinny, dirty dogs and cats are sharing your eating place. As an animal lover this was a HUGE turn off to the entire country, one that obviously has not addressed it's soaring homeless animal population. The island itself is beautiful but every beach traveled you can see these poor animals suffereing, it's just unreal to me. Even on the the islands of Culebra and Vieques there were strays.

To further understand our feedback and underlying bias, a short description of us would include: we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both in our late twenties / early thirties; we prefer quiet pool/beach settings; we enjoy mixing activities (e.g. cultural, sports, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bum time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd); we enjoy combining high end perks with low cost opportunities. The key characteristics supporting our recommendation to stay at the Gran Melia are as follows: a) Reservations personnel: I planned the honeymoon as a surprise for my wife and worked with Angeritza De la Cruz towards finding the best setup for our characteristics and available budget. We spoke several times on the phone and she was also readily available over email. We ended up booking 6 nights on their Royal Service oceanfront suite and 1 night on their Ocean front garden villa. The Gran Melia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accommodation denominations may be confusing in that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a suite setting means no ocean view, whereas in the villa setting there is only one option (i.e. ocean view with direct beach access). b) Royal service: my reservations included the Royal Service package which I strongly recommended getting if you can. Firstly, you avoid the crowded check-in area and use a separate area with significantly less traffic. Secondly, you get access to a 24 hour private pool (sufficiently large) with several luxurious beds (I lack the technical term but essentially they are comfy queen size beds with comfy cushions which are covered by a nice wooden structure that include a light for evening/night reading). The same pool also has a bar with staff that is very friendly and also makes sure that the pool isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mistakenly used by non royal service patrons (note: should you prefer a noisier pool you are welcome to go to the main pool also). Thirdly, you get access to the happy hour every day in a reserved area from 6 to 9pm where free drinks are served. Fourthly, you get free internet access during the royal service office working hours. Lastly, you get the buffet breakfast (valued at $22 per person) which is really worth having (ample selection of fruits, pastries, english breakfast, bagels, omelets, etc). c) Attentive staff: we were very impressed with the service provided by the staff in general. In particular our butler Mr. Angel Melendez and the head of the change-over staff Ms. Maria del Mar. Their dedication and attention made our stay the more memorable! The little things make all the difference\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 at first we stayed in room 2023 which was next to the private pool (and further away from the main pool area/lobby), and Angel helped us with the timely trolley rides to and from our room (e.g. picking up ice; picking us up at the AVIS car park; etc). Angel also helped play up the surprise for my wife when we moved from the suite to the villa :) Then Maria was equally impressive in arranging for nice towel setups (e.g. swans, hearts, etc) on our bed, as well as readying a bubble bath for us. There was another service personnel whom we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interact as often but who was equally very nice. I believe his name was Pablo (?). d) Location: the resort is just off a main road (i.e. 3) which in turn provides close access to the El Yunque rain forest, to the Luquillo beach, to the Fajardo beaches and kayaking, and within 1 hour drive from San Juan (e.g. airport, old San Juan, etc). e) Facilities: my wife made daily use of the gym and enjoyed it very much. The grounds in general are very well taken care of and the scenery is memorable. f) Rooms: both the ocean suite and the villa we stayed at were of outstanding quality. They both include a free safe. Truth be told that the amenities in the villa are really nice (e.g. bulgari shampoo/conditioner/etc, nespresso, private pool, large jacuzzi, a fridge you can use other than the one stocked with hotel sodas/etc, etc). As with everything, there are factors that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as positive and that need to be taken into account in your decision to stay at Gran Melia. As previously please refer to the characteristics I shared on our potential bias to better understand what we are trying to convey: a) Pricy restaurants: thanks to other reviews here (and thus our commitment in typing out our own review) we avoided the pricy restaurant trap (and thus reflecting our bias of not spending $25 to $50 per person per meal). The cheaper restaurant is the pool side Wet grill bar which indeed provides meals at $10 to $20 per person, but it is only open until 6pm. I strongly recommend renting a car to enable flexibility and access to nearby restaurants. b) Pricy supermarket: it is outrageous that the local supermarket charges the prices that it does on food, and even worse for its medications. Again, with a car you can easily access two large supermarkets (i.e. Ralph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Amigo) and Walgreens, which are within 10-15 minutes drive. c) Pricy car parking: as compared to other places the car parking fee ($17 a day I believe) isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad. However, if you do it right you can rent the car from AVIS onsite and get parking for free! Their parking lot is within 5 minutes walk from the main lobby and if you have royal service you can even call ahead of time for a pick up. Another bonus of renting onsite is that the prices are considerably cheaper than those charged at the airport rental services. Alas, you will have to cough up $35.71 per person each way for your shuttle service from Dragonfly (a tourism operator with a desk at Gran Melia. If you do use the Dragonfly shuttle be sure to take into account their SLOW operations, as our 2pm departure only left by 2.40pm). Finally, remember that you can book your AVIS ahead of time by using the code RG9 on the AVIS website and thus ensure that you get the model you prefer. d) Pricy tourism operator: I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to the quality of the tours provided by Dragonfly but I can certainly attest to them being overpriced. You are better off renting a car and contacting directly the tour operators to get better pricing. For the El Yunque forest for instance, you only need to pay $4 per person to visit the visitor center, and the hiking trails themselves are for free! Similarly a trip to old San Juan takes about 1 hour and you can either park for free at the Capitol (we found a spot that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assigned to any officials) or you can use a $4 a day parking lot (be sure to ask which one it is, as some of them charge $20 a day). Dragonfly will charge you a fortune for that same old San Juan trip. e) Rocky beach: the beach hugging the Gran Melia resort isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really for bathing as it has way too many rocks. However, once again, with a car you can easily access Luquillo beach which is a 10 minute drive and offers plenty of beach and comfortable bathing. Be sure to park next to the food kiosks as the parking is for free. Also, the food on the second kiosk nearest to the under passing is quite good. f) Noisy main pool: on our last day we noticed a greater number of people by the main pool and indeed they had hired an entertainer that was blasting music poolside. We found this inconvenient and were thankful that we had our royal service access to the private quiet pool. Having spoken with a friend of ours who is from Puerto Rico she conveyed that the 2nd and 3rd week of August are when the locals go on holiday. However I guess that would reflect itself in other resorts as well, thus your only chance would be to avoid that period or get yourself the access to the private pool. We hope this lengthy review is helpful! Other reviews here were extremely helpful in planning our perfect honeymoon in Puerto Rico while staying at the Gran Melia. Last but not least, if you enjoy hiking with a more wilderness experience (i.e. unlike El Yunque, which is beautiful, but paved) do consider doing the Toro Negro ziplining full day adventure! (http://www.acampapr.com/). Our guide, Raymond, not only knew what he was doing (i.e. safety first) but also shared his knowledge about the forest and provided us with a traditional Puerto Rican lunch. The downside is that you have to leave Gran Melia around 5.30am to arrive on time to Plaza de Las Americas for the pick up\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Well worth it though!", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat for relaxing but not with kids!\u201d", "Author": "PatsyPat", "ReviewID": "UR75768601", "Content": "I went in April for about a week and it was indeed a breathtaking 1st impression! It's open air set-up is very calming and beautiful... a place for relaxing or for empty nesters! I went with my hubby, a 9y.o. & a 14 y.o. and although they enjoyed the pool and the beach, they certainly lacked age-appropriate activities; especially considering the pricey rates. The rooms are beautiful...absoloutely Gorgeous and quite spacious but they lack fridges and microwaves and I later found out that the reason for that is because they don't allow any food from outside! NONE....No deliveries, no groceries (like juices for the kids, sanwiches etc.) That's a big no no for my family. We like to order out and have deliveries and also have juice in a fridge for when we wake up in the morning, and trust me, with what they chage for a glass of juice there, you can have a full cooked to order breakfast anywhere! I'm a big spender when I travel but I don't believe in giving away my money for nothing! Not me. The hotel is a bit tricky to find if you're driving yourself there for the first time. From the main road to the actual hotel is a whole other road trip ! ! ! I dreaded every time I had to leave and return to the hotel whever I went sightseeing (or anywhere for that matter) because it was such a looooooooooooong drive into and out of the resort, I hated that! It was quite a drive! Overall, it was beautiful and relaxing but I wouldn't go back again until I'm retired and just want trip where I want to lay back and read a book feeling the breeze from the sea. That's really what the hotel is good for. The casino is fairly SMALL. They did have a great restaurant there that I decided to try and it was actually quite good....actually it was GREAT! Pasi\u00c3\u00b3n por el Fog\u00c3\u00b3n (I think that was the name) I had steak, tostones rellenos, and a few other items and ALL were absoloutely AWESOME!!! My kids are more into less formal dining and maybe mac and chz and stuff like that, so my husband and I dined alone but then was that looooooooooong trip out of the hotel to take them out to a great chicken place that was on the main road!!! Oh yeah, there's also a bakery that you'll see as you dive into and out of the hotel, right on the corner, just before you turn into the main road (when you're leaving the hotel) and their \"pan soba'o\" is DELICIOUS! So hot and delicious that we had to buy some to bring back but it was so good we ate it on the flight back! (For those who don't know, pan soba'o is the name of a Puerto Rican bread that is usually eaten warm and has a mild semi sweet taste when you eat it...it's really good!) I say the hotel is beautiful but would I stay there again, probably not! For a comparable price, I guess next time I'd probably drive a lil'bit more to the \"El Conquistador\" which has alot more to offer their guests! I just didn't realize that until we were a day or two away from leaving! Oh yeah, it's pretty easy to get to El Yunque from there and with a good map or GPS, you should do ok getting around to other attractions!", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pembroke Pines, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to stay... Had a great time!! Read below\u201d", "Author": "FamRossy", "ReviewID": "UR75453239", "Content": "I will be completely honest with this review as I gathered information from previous reviews that were helpful. The HOTEL, beautiful, landscaping , location, setup, very tropical. CHECK In process- waited in line 1 hour in the heat (no ceiling fans) but i have experienced the same in other 5 star resort in Dominican Republic too!! STAFF---LOVED THEM!!! from funny to friendly, every employee went above and beyond to help. FOOD: by a previous review I went prepared and had a suitcase full of food ( in my group, we had 5 rooms and 6 kids total) snacks and drinks were needed . So I brought all of that since someone had advised coolers and bags weren't allowed in. Yet during our whole stay we saw people walking from the parking lot with grocery bags and beach cools... Hotel food prices.. Expensive. But two of our three nights there we opted to eat at restaurants in the hotel, Passions (Puertorican cuisine) and Tempo (Italian) Both restaurants were excellent. ROOM locations: YES be prepared to WALK. They have golf carts you can take by standing in the front lobby to your villa. Half the time we opted to walk because it was too hot to wait ( it was good exercise) But for our 70 yr parents it was a bit difficult and tiring to get around. Room did have a moldy odor, so I brought room spray. POOL : Perfect.. great music, nice bar, big and spacious. Beach: Pretty to look at but too many rocks and coral. My recommendations: For BREAKFAST and LUNCH eat at Sweet Coco Bakery, located on the main road that leads into hotel. Average breakfast price $3-$5 per person for a huge sandwich., compared to the hotel buffet that is $26 per person. For Dinner: hotel prices average about $20-$25 per person, about the same you would spend elsewhere like in Old San Juan. Drive around. Luquillo beach is about 10 minutes away, Old San Juan / Condado 30 minutes, El Yunque Rainforest 10 minutes. Outlet Mall 10 min. Or just stay around the hotel pool.. and relax. Additional tips: PARENTS: DO NOT waste money on the AirBrushed Tattoos : about $8-10 each and they IMMEDIATELY come off, even though the guy says 3-5 days... I paid for one on each of my nieces and nephews and by the next day they were ALL GONE.. Drinks: Pina Coladas $ 7 without alcohol $ 8 with.. so drink Beers they are cheaper. CASINO: needs updating . SPA: Not bad, I treated myself to a deeptissue massage, and it felt GREAT! OHHH PARKING: Yes only one parking lot, not enough for when the hotel is full over a weekend and if they have an event going on. Someone else recommended renting your vehicle at the airport from AVIS, which also has a rental desk at the Hotel. You can park in there lot and avoid paying the $16 hotel parking fee...

They suggested we go to the pool while we wait, and so we locked up our luggage and changed into our bathing suits. The pool was awesome. HUGE! We did spend most of our time in the shallow baby pool section, and it was just as beautiful. Our daughter had a blast. When it was finally time to head to our room, we were once again greeted by another friendly staff member named Angel. We were convinced he really was an \"Angel\". He made sure everything was perfect for us our entire stay. He followed up with us daily to see if we needed anything, and made sure things were going good. His customer service was excellent, and he really went above and beyond. It was hard to say goodbye to Angel- our new friend. We wish to thank him over and over for such a memorable trip! The room was worth the wait! It was gorgeous! The view of the beach was stunning! It exceeded our expectations! The beach is naturally beautiful- untouched. Kind of seaweedy, shelly, and has lots of hermit crabs. We went in the water,but did not go to far out. Seeing that the seaweed wouldn't let you! Not too many people went to the beach, so it was like our own private beach for the week. Our daughter loved it! Her face was priceless seeing the beach for the first time. The only complaint we had was we hoped there would have been more variety for lunch and dinner choices. Only a certain restaurant is open for that specific night. If you didn't make reservations for that restaurant- you had to get room service. Restaurants are not kid friendly. But still managed to get chicken fingers and fries! \"Nami\", the japanese restaurant was our favorite- I got my husband to try sushi, and now he loves it!

We rented from Avis at the airport (per other reviews), and it worked out great. Didn't have to pay the $20 daily parking fee at the resort. But the Avis parking lot was an extra 5 mins away. We were here for 5 days/ 4 nights, per a saveonresorts.com special. It was only $300 all together! So after reading about other reviews on upgrading to the Royal Service, we did. It was an extra $150 per day, per room. We got an ocean view room, with a jacuzzi on the balcony. As well as the RS adults only pool, which we had to ourselves for the first 2 days! The bartender Richard was fantastic. He recommended Kiokos #2 and #9, both phenomenol! We also had free bottled water all day long from the RS lounge. And happy hour from 6p-9p in the RS lounge daily. I had champagne mostly, and it was $8.50 a pop when I had one at the bar! So we all got pretty liquored up at the lounge area. Angelica is an angel, she is the sweetest and most professional. And remembers your drinks as well as exceptional service. Our friend was absolutely goo-goo over her, and if you ever have the pleasure of meeting her, you'll know why. The Martini Bar across the hall is fun too. Illuminada was the best, making up drinks and chatting away! Her pomegranate mojito with brandy-infused cherries on the bottom were the bomb. The 90 min presentation was done in precisely 90 mins. We said no, they said thanks have a nice day. It was amazing, I guess they met their quota already. Anyhoo, yay for us! The spa was a loss for them. I walked in with my husband, and the receptionist girl was helping another couple sign in and when they went to fill out their paperwork, she didn't even glance at us. I went around to the front of the counter and sort of hovered, since she looked soooo busy on her computer. Then while looking at the flyings I mentioned it'd be nice if they had a price list somewhere. She grabbed a piece of paper and handed it my way, without looking, without any acknowledgement or even a smile. She must have thought better of it, because she then said \"here, this should help\". I walked out and said not too quietly, that if this place had better service, they may have some more customers. And never looked back. Too bad, I'm a real spa-lover, but I will not waste my hard earned money on bad customer service. That was my only bad experience, everyone else everywhere was just the nicest. I smiled and said 'hi' to everyone, and they all responded happily, even the ones who didn't initate a greeting. My friend did get rejected from the African-American Angel butler when he tried to get a ride from the gym to the RS pool. He said they butler just said flat out 'no' and drove off! He was very cordial to us every other time. Not sure what was going on there... But my friend was totally peeved because he gets to the pool and see's the butler chatting it up with a girl at the bar there! You must go to eat at the Kioskos and the ones I mentioned before. They were amazing! The steaks 'Churrascos' at #2 are awesome. And the fried whole red snapper and kan kan pork chops at #9 are out of this world! We only dined at Pasion on the resort. Even then the food was just ok, nothing compared to the kioskos. But be ready to spend at least $100 per meal. All in all, I would love to come back. The mosquitos here were friendly, and I did get bit a couple of times, but nothing compared to Tennacitta, MX (Punta Serena Villas & Spa). Altho, I was much more diligent with the bug spray this time around as well :)", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cMediocre at Best\u201d", "Author": "GemsVacations", "ReviewID": "UR68819101", "Content": "If you're planning on booking because of a marketing offer going on, be prepared. My family and I stayed here for 4 nights. The vacation package offered last night free. Since we didn't pay regular prices, we were offered a hotel room on the edge of the grounds, with stained everything. Our first room reeked of mold and mildew so much that my 6 year old daughter walked in immediately asking me \"what's that smell mommy?\". When I asked for a different room, the snobby concierge made it seem like I was just looking for a room closer to the center of the resort. We were moved to a room in the same building. This room had less stains on the sofa and on the decorative sheets & pillows and we weren't overwhelmed by the stench overpowering the other room. Having already spent $65 on government subsidized taxi service and being told how much we'd loose if we left early, we decided to chance it. We were invited to sit with a vacation club representative who's boss confirmed that our bad room experience was the result of having booked a marketing sale package and used this to motivate us into financing a $25,000 vacation club membership that would guarantee us top of the line accommodations by the same people. Vaacation club members stay at the other end of the hotel. The philosophy governing the Gran Melia in PR is elitist to say the least, reminiscent of all the condescending attitudes of the old world. Sounds ridiculous but believe me, this is what it is. As far as meals go, here's the nitty gritty: If you spend $25 or less on your dinner, you'll be hungry within an hour or two. Spend $30+ and you'll make it to the next meal of the day. Nami had great food and the Wet Pool Bar was descent. Cafe Soleil was a joke.

A beautiful Spanish-esque fountain on a circular drive led me to believe this was going to be a very special hotel. And, maybe, if you're on your honeymoon or want to hole away in your room it would be, but for me it was a disappointment. The property is an open air type resort. Which may be great in December or January, but when I'm standing in a 45 minute line (and it wasn't even THAT long!) to get checked in, dripping with sweat because the humidity is so high, it's NOT. By the time I get checked in, it's dark, and I mean DARK. So dark I wished I had a flashlight. They hand you a map, like they do at the Gaylord resorts, and at that point I wished I had a compass too. I dragged my luggage to my room - no golf cart shuttle to be found to take me there - and walking to my room I wished I had a flashlight. It felt like camping and I was trying to find the latrines. They have low lights placed every 20' or so and I'd have to put all my luggage down and lean down to check my map to see where I was and where I needed to go next. I was plesantly surprised to find a nice, large room. Very comfortable, clean and tasteful. Bathroom was nice (note - had a nice deep tub but the stopper wouldn't stay in so it was useless), tv channel selection was terrible (supposedly had Showtime but never could find it). Ate dinner in Pasion, which was a joke. I had heard how \"fabulous\" this restaurant was and I guess I had high expectations. They weren't even close to being met. When I was sat, the snotty waiter basically ignored me for the first 10 minutes or so to spend his time on a 4 top next to me that was drinking up a storm (who drinks margaritas in Puerto Rico?). I guess he thought he'd get a bigger tip from them than me. Big mistake, HUGE! I waited tables for 20 years and have been known to leave obnoxiously large tips (25-40%...sometimes more). For me, 20% is a minimum. This guy? I left him 15% and wished I hadn't left that. He was arrogant and came across that he was doing me a favor by waiting on me. I ordered mofongo with conch and 10-15 minutes later he comes by to tell me they don't have conch. Really? You didn't know this 10-15 minutes ago when you SHOULD have turned my order in?? Beds were just ok as far as comfort. The sheet kept coming off, which is annoying. The morning I left I knew why they had so many umbrellas behind the front desk (I saw them on that 45 minute check in)...it rains and if you have to leave your room, you'll get wet! If you're coming to PR for business, stay at another hotel. If you're coming for romance and staying in your room, this hotel would be fine...but if that's the case why stay in PR anyway, why not just go to the Intercon O'Hare and stay there?

My boyfriend and I, both 22, recently spent 6 days at this resort and were both severely disappointed with our stay. For one thing, the resort is located at the end of a five mile drive way, surrounded by a golf course on one side and a sad excuse for a beach on the other. We took this vacation hoping to relax and feel safe at a resort, while still experiencing the culture of Puerto Rico. This is not something that can happen at this resort. In fact, the only thing the resort does offer is the experience of feeling robbed. There are three restaurants at the resort: Tempo, Nami, and Passion. Only two are ever open at one time and you better not want dinner before six, because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not open. You get one lunchtime option (which closes at three) of an overpriced bar and grill (By overpriced I mean seven dollar hotdogs with nothing but ketchup and mustard. Fries not included). And one breakfast choice of a place they label a caf\u00c3\u00a9 but is in actuality an overpriced buffet. It is twenty-three dollars for an overcooked, tasteless breakfast that I served to myself. Tell me how on this earth can anyone make breakfast sausage tasteless?? In fact, all the food at this resort is bland and overcooked. I would really like to know how these restaurants manage to have any stars awarded to them. I can literally find better food at a Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The next major problem with this place is that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do at night here. If you did not bring a car (which would cost you sixteen dollars a night to keep here) and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay for the sixty dollar cab ride to leave the driveway, then the only option you have left is to sit in your room and watch television. What a horrendously boring time.. Oh and if you do decide to stay here for some reason then pray you get an upstairs room, because the floors eco- badly. Other Short Notes: the hotel is esthetically beautiful, but that is the one and only positive. The beach is covered in debris and the water is nothing but seaweed. The dragonfly tours were great, but you better have some luck because all the tours that are worth the money have a minimum of four people that need to go or too bad for you.

My friends and I stayed for the weekend and arrived on a friday! We waited in a line to check in for over an hour! We were aggrivated by this! I had read reviews that stated the same thing, so I wasn't completely surprised by this! But I was not happy about it either way!! We were told that they were going to charge us an extra $100/day for \"incidentals\" and whateve we didn't use would be returned to us!! So we were surprised by that! We initially booked a double room and were told that \"they were all given away the day before.\" So our reservation was for no reason. They gave us what was left! And no one in our party got the room they reserved. We finally recieved our keys and were taken to our bungalow!! We were told that if we needed a ride during our stay to another location on the resort, to just call and someone would come get us! When we did this, they told us to just come outside and wait! There was no door to door upon request service, just go outside and wait!! Parking on the resort was horrible!! There is a very small parking lot for this resort and we had to park over 200 yards from our bungalow! The resort has cars you can rent for a 24-hour period!! My friend rented a Toyata Yaris for $85 tax and fees included! We rented from the airport for $113 for the weekend! I was totally surprised by how much they were charging for such a small car! And by the way, parking is $20/day and $24/day if you valet!! Now the rooms! One friend's room was changed midway through our stay because there was a mildew smell coming from the room and her clothes in her bag was soaked!! Another room's air conditioning didn't work properly, an engineer was called 4 times over the weekend! My room's air wouldn't shut off, it stayed 69 degrees in my room the entire time! The towels and extra sheets are housed in a closet outside of the bungalows. They aren't kept in a laundry room or anything, so they smelled like the outside air! The beds are nice and comfy but the resort is inconsistent at best! Dining on the resort is nice, but extremely expensive!! I ate at Passion the first night and 1 appetizer, 2 drinks and 2 entrees was $90! We didn't expect that it would be that much, but we vowed to never eat on the resort again! Friends told me that the breakfast buffet was $23/person for hot food and $16 for just fruit!! Room service stops at 11 on resort, but you can get a box lunch for $10! Basically, the food and drinks are expensive on the resort so beware! The pool area is the best thing going on the resort!! It is just like the pictures on the website! Just gorgeous and huge!! They have little cabanas that you can rent for a price at the pool area and they have a bar that you can get drinks and food! However, in order to get a towel for the pool, you have to use a towel card that you are given at check-in! However, if you don't return the towels, you can be charged $30 on check-out! So be careful and return the towels!! The beach is virtually nonexistent!! No one uses it! There is coral at the shoreline and you can hurt yourself, so no one really uses it!! It didn't look like I expected from Puerto Rico! The staff and service was great!! Everyone was friendly and eager to please! This was one of the best things about the resort! All in all, this was an ok resort, but if I go to Puerto Rico again, I will not stay here! For the money that we paid, I'd rather stay in San Juan and not so far out of the city! The Gran Melia is like 30-40 min outside San Juan!! So beware!

Still I'm a believer that we need to find out on our own whether this place is worth it or not. Well let me tell you is not worth it at all. The place is beautiful don't get me wrong, but that's it. First of all, let me start with the room. The room is spacious, you get a bed, a small living room and a porch. The rooms are so outdated, the outside could use new paint or pressure washing. The housekeeper did a good job cleaning the rooms, but everytime she swept the room the dirt she collected was thrown on the hallway. I'm not kidding, this drove my husband crazy, everytime we came to the room and he saw the dirty stairs and hallway I had to listen to him. We rented the $25.00 small fridge - Beware - it's not a fridge, is a cooler. If you put something cold it will keep it cold, but if you put something hot it will not cool the drink for you. Everything is expensive at the hotel. We went to Sam's and bought water, beer and gatorade. To our surprise they have a guard at the entrance and he told us we couldn't bring the stuff to our room, not permitted. He said he will get fired if he allowed us to bring the drinks to our room. Well we empty one luggage, came back to the car and put the drinks inside the luggage and the guard couldn't stop us because the drinks were not visible and they are not allowed to look inside your bags. We felt like we were in a communist place - we had to hide everything - in all it was a bad experience. The only restaurant we went to eat was at Nami (Japanesse), with a Puerto Rican cook :) still the food was good, but expensive. We went to the bakery at the end of the road for breakfast, really cheap. We didn't mind eating at the places by the streets so we save money and enjoy authentic Puerto Rican food. The pool at the hotel is very large and nice, with a swim up bar. The Hotel does not, I repeat does not have a beach. What they call a beach is nothing but dirty, nasty and smelly water. We went by one day to see it and that was enough. If you want to go to a nice beach go to Culebra Island. The only way to get there is by ferry. The fee is $4.50 roundtrip and the trip is about 1 hour and 30 minutes each way. The ferry is really nice and it does provide air conditioning. The town is not that nice but the beach is worth it. The hotel charge $20.00 a day for parking, this is not fair to the people that stays at the hotel. Is ok to charge the parking fee if you only come to play at the Casino, but they never should charge the people that stay at the hotel, it is crazy. To top that off, after you park you need to walk and walk to your room. If you are a golf person, you will enjoy this place. The golf course is huge. I'm not a golfer but I was impressed at how big the golf course is. My husband's brother in law played twice, he said it was nice and fun. The location of this place is crazy. Is so far from San Juan - 45 minutes to 1 hour drive to San Juan - depending on traffic. We never made it to San Juan, that's how far the hotel is. My friend and her husband stayed at the Sheraton in San Juan last February and she said they were walking distance to San Juan and that the Hotel was really nice. We have stayed at the Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas and Paradissus Palma Real in Punta Cana (which belongs to the Gran Melia Hotel chain) and we never had problems of any kind. In conclusion is your choice on whether to go to the Gran Melia Puerto Rico Hotel or not, but you have been warned about how horrible this place is.

I suppose I should start by saying that I've never stayed at a resort before, but in my opinion it wasn't even a good as a basic hotel. If you don't plan on spending all of your time at the resort, this probably isn't the place to spend your vacation. The place was fairly deserted being the off-season. However, they still felt it necessary to put us in the farthest bungalow possible. Bungalows are not accessible by car and we were a 10 minute walk from the car, each way.... 2 to 3 times per day. It got old very quickly. You *could* call for a golf cart to take you to and fro if you don't mind waiting 45 minutes every time you need to be shuttled. And if you want to go anywhere, be prepared to spend 10 minutes just getting to the main road. The air conditioning in our room did not even come close to removing the humidity out of the air and as a result every piece of clothing we brought was damp by the time we left....even the ones that never made it out of the suitcase.

You may be thinking \"Where the heck is it?!\" Before I went, my wife and I couldn't find an actual address for it, or figure out exactly where it was from Google maps. Ignore the Gran Melia website and where Google thinks the resort is, use this map instead (with good directions from SJU airport): http://tinyurl.com/3xesn39. Gran Melia and Sol Melia (the vacation club) are right next to each other. As you are following these directions, you will see a pretty big Gran Melia billboard on the right hand side of the road before the exit to the left. You'll also see a \"Super Gigante\" supermarket on the right just before the turn, and there is a bakery on the corner that has some great desserts. 2. Before you go, pick up \"Puerto Rico day by day,\" a book from Frommer's. This has an excellent overview of many of the awesome things you can do in Puerto Rico, and some pretty good maps for getting around, especially in Old San Juan. 3. If you're going to stay at this resort, you will need a rental car to get around. DON'T BOTHER GETTING THE RENTAL CAR FROM THE RESORT, instead reserve a car online and pick it up from the airport when you get in. I used Budget rent-a-car, and regretted it. On the one hand, we knew ahead of time that things move more slowly in Puerto Rico, so I was ready to wait in some lines, but on the other hand my wife and I waited for quite a while for the shuttle from the airport (which picks you up just outside from the baggage claim area) to take us to the rental place, and then we waited OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF while one person behind the counter (very slowly) helped all of the people in front of us. Also, they never answer their phones. Get a rental car, but avoid Budget. Other tips for the rental car: a. Don't assume that your TOM TOM GPS will work here in Puerto Rico. I brought mine and it was useless everywhere except near the coast. I ended up using my iPhone for directions everywhere, which worked pretty well (I had a great signal almost everwhere we went). If you don't have an iPhone, it's worth paying for the GPS addition to your rental car. b. I consider myself VERY LUCKY to have not gotten into a car accident in Puerto Rico...those people do not drive safely AT ALL. Nearly every vehicle you see has damage from car accidents. I saw one guy driving backwards the wrong way on the freeway at about 40 mph to get back to an off-ramp that he had missed. No one uses blinkers. If you get a rental car and you don't buy the extra insurance so that you are completely free of liability in the event of an accident, you are nuts! c. Budget rentals (and probably all of the others) come with an easypass sticker in the window so that you can breeze through toll booths. Traffic moves pretty fast through the toll booths, I recommend just bringing a bunch of quarters and dollar bills with you and not even using the easypass (you get charged per day that you use it AND per use...not worth it). d. When you inspect the car upon pickup, make sure to mark EVERY LITTLE SCRATCH. I didn't have any accidents, but if I did I would have been very glad that I was meticulous during my inspection. e. If you have USAA insurance, go through the USAA website to rent your car...you get certain perks, like unlimited mileage. 4. Gran Melia vs. Sol Melia - Stay at the Sol Melia Vacation Club, not the Gran Melia Resort. Why? Because at Gran Melia you don't get a kitchenette, and they actually prevent you from bringing outside food into your room, so you are forced to either travel to eat, or pay lots of money for their not-so-good food (so I heard...we didn't actually try it). Also, people who stay at Gran Melia have to have $16/day to park their cars, but Sol Melia people park for free. Also, you get access to some ammenities (VIP room, etc) that Gran Melia people don't. So save a lot of money on this stuff by staying at Sol Melia. 5. People complain about the beach here, that it's too rocky and what-not. In truth, it's not the \"white sandy\" beach that you see on Caribbean postcards, and you won't swim in the water here, but if you want to hang out on beach chairs as the sun sets in a tropical setting, this is the place. If you get a rental car, it's not much of a drive to the post card beaches. 6. Things you must do while you're here: a. BIO BAY TOUR. I highly recommend the tour to Mosquito Bay in Vieques...yes it's a bit of a trek, and yes it's a little expensive, but it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Here is the website for the company we used, which was awesome http://eastwindcats.com/. In one evening you'll take a catamaran to Vieques, a taxi (van) to a restaurant, eat good Puerto Rican food, a VERY BUMPY bus ride to the bio bay, a pontoon to the middle of the bay, you swim in the water (AWESOME, but be aware that it is the ocean..one girl got stung by a jellyfish, no big deal), and then they take you back. They have a military discount of 10% b. Visit Old San Juan c. Visit El Junque d. Take a drive down the eastern side of the island down route 3, stopping at beautiful beaches that you see along the way. Go all the way down to Yabucoa and see some of the Colonial architecture there. Plan on getting lost, because the streets are a little difficult to navigate in Yabucoa. Then, if you are a good driver, purchased the top-notch rental insurance, and are not weak-hearted, drive back north through the rainforest on PR-191...ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Twisted roads, and some of the steepest driveways in existence. Again, people drive crazy, so you'll have to be very careful. I highly recommend a Puerto Rico Vacation, and I highly recommend Gran Melia (but moreso Sol Melia)", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place.\u201d", "Author": "frny1", "ReviewID": "UR63505526", "Content": "My Family and I had a wonderful time at the hotel.

We read previous reviews and our experience was consistent with many of those who found this facility lacking in many respects. Staff: Unlike some other reviewers, we found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Food: We dined at the Italian and Puerto Rican restaurants and found the food to be less than mediocre with service delayed more than 2 hours at the Puerto Rican restaurant because of a large wedding party (not ours) and a kitchen that was in disarray (chef yelling at staff). On the other hand, the food at the wedding dinner was outstanding - tasty and beautifully presented so they can do it. The pool snack bar has decent food - including a pretty good salad and burger - at fairly reasonable prices and the market has great lattes.... We did not try breakfast because of the outrageous price. Facilities/grounds: The grounds and common area are attractive but nothing remarkable. The fitness center is very well equipped and the pool is okay but noisy and there is a distinct lack of umbrellas...probably, as at least one reviewer has already noted, because of the desire to rent the cabanas.... The beach is not the best and the nearhore zone is shallow with grass but still fun to wade and you can swim if you just walk out a bit....just be careful of the current.... Kayaks rent at $28/hour!!!!. Unless you are into golf or like to play tennis when it is hot there is really not much to do at the resort. However, visit El Yunque and old San Juan...both great places.... Miscellaneous: You really need to rent a car unless you are there to do nothing or play golf. The hotel posted security to keep guests from bringing in food and coolers...a very bad decision on their part given the lack of reasonable dining options and the remote location of the resort and the absence of easy to find restaurants even in Luquillo....

I am so glad i went through with booking this hotel and did not listen to the reviews. If you are like me, you like luxurious accommodations. Having stayed at many nice caribbean hotels i would rate this on the higher end as far as luxury and cleanliness. The service was above average, which the reviews that i read stated as being some of the worst service. Traveling with my boyfriend whenever a worker saw us taking pics they would stop what they were doing to offer to take one of the two of us. also, it rained a few times and on one occasion a worker gave us his umbrella to use to get back to our room. I cant imagine what people were talking about when it comes to the rooms not being cleaned. ours was cleaned everyday with fresh towels while we were at breakfast. Also, some people said the resort was too big and spread out. I guess these people have not been to many resorts of this size, but it was one of the smaller lay outs that i have stayed at. From the lobby you can see the pool and from the pool you can see the ocean. they do have golf carts going around to drop you off places but i cannot imagine the purpose unless you have special physical needs. Yes the food can be pricey, but it was not anything more than i expected. i am picky when it comes to quality of food and i have to say i enjoyed everything i ate. the pool was not crowded ever, we had our pick of umbrellas and loungers everyday. no need to reserve at 6 am like other resorts i have been to. the beach was fine for us. just enough to splash around in but because of the rocks and reef a few feet out it was difficult to swim around too much or walk the beach. location- far enough from san juan that you feel you are on a secluded island but close enough that you can get to old san juan for the day. it was also a short drive to the rain forest. the reviews i read before booking were so harsh and i could not disagree more. i guess people's expectations differ. i am just glad i went with this property for my stay in PR.

The spring break season was soooo crowded... making it difficult to get a spot at the pool. The customer service was excellent and the staff was really friendly and helpful, when needed. There is so much to do in PR, we found renting a car through enterprise on the computer was much better than the one provided at the hotel...much better rates and just easier & friendlier overall. Same, with the tours...we found better tours by calling the places in the brochures. The rain forest is really close by...it is a must! The biobay tour was amazing in luquillo...enchanted island eco tours was the best (if you are worried about the kayaking at night factor...this group was the most organized and safe...the guides were excellent and fun! this is the ONLY bio bay group I would go with after seeing all of them in action)! The worst part of the hotel is the FOOD. Everything was surprisingly American, the breakfast was your usual danish and eggs...but nothing special, no latin flavor. Ritchies restaurant does shuttle service to and from the resort which was good, but renting a car and really going in to PR is the way to go: hit the kioskos (close to hotel), Palmer bakery (near el yunque), and King's Seafood (luquillo).

We were initially floored by the beauty of the main building and even our room, but almost off the bat we noticed a bunch of problems with the room. Our toilet flusher handle was broken, meaning the toilet flushed, but the handle itself had cracked and was missing a piece. This is something room service should have noticed immediately and had repaired before we even checked in, but clearly, they are not concerned with details. Though we called and told them that the toilet handle was broken shortly after checking in, no one came until we called a second time that evening, when the toilet flusher broke entirely and a repairman had to be sent to the room. The minibar was not full at check-in either, something that also should have been done before we got into the room. We had a beautiful balcony outside our room, with crappy plastic chairs on it, and I mean crappy in both the literal and figurative senses. There are these small black birds everywhere in the resort--everywhere--and while this could enhance the overall tropical experience, the fact that EVERYTHING is covered in a layer of bird [--] really takes away from it. We stepped out on the balcony all of once, only to step back in since the bird droppings were everywhere. The pool is phenomenally gorgeous and huge, but again, bird [--]everywhere. Choosing which lounge chair to sit on means selecting the one with the fewest white streaks on the brown fabric. This is clearly a major issue at the resort, and if the owners cared about guest experience, they would have people on staff whose sole purpose is to go around wiping down the various surfaces where the droppings accumulate. While this seems silly, it is either that or find a way to get rid of the birds. Personally, I think that hiring [--] wipers would be easier. The pool table, which is right near the pool, is covered in tears in the felt. More hilariously, it is positioned directly between two pillars so that at certain angles, you cannot extend your cue and cannot take certain shots. The resort is bordered by what could be a beautiful beach, only it is entirely not maintained (no exaggeration), so there is seaweed piled up the entire length of the beach. It is also quite rocky. Only my husband was brave enough to wade in. Also, there is no section prepared for bathers, either roped off in the water or with a lifeguard present, so swimming is entirely at your own risk. Overall, our impression was that this must have been phenomenally beautiful when it first opened, but since that time, it appears that no maintenance has been done, so everything is just slightly decrepit, dirty, damaged, etc. Given the cost of rooms here and the fact that they are trying to sell this place as a timeshare property, I was shocked at the low level of maintenance. Basically, if you can get a good deal on your stay, go ahead, but certainly don't pay full price. The staff was helpful throughout our stay. Just don't bother to book any excursions through Dragonfly (a company that has a desk in the lobby), they are hundreds of dollars more than other companies.

The pool is great. The views are amazing. The rooms are comfortable, spacious and clean. The cons: The staff seem very poorly trained and/or managed. There was a 25 minute wait to check in. We arrived at about 4 p.m. and our room was not ready until after 5:30. We got a cell phone call saying our room was ready. There was not a soul working the reception desk when we went to get our key cards. The woman in front of me had waited for 25 minutes--I had about a 20 minute wait. The concierge would come by and say that someone should probably be coming at any minute and would offer us water. It was all very strange. The staff were friendly and polite but did not seem to be able to help you. While waiting to check in the receptionist told us we could leave our bags with someone but it took forever to find someone. Later when we went to reclaim them and could not find anyone working in that area, the response was, \"I think that guy on the golf cart over there might know about it\". On our second day our room was not cleaned until about 4:30 p.m. We were overcharged for parking even after talking to three parking attendants and the front desk. Eventually it was cleared up and the charge refunded but it took a lot of time and effort. My reservation was bungled as well and once again, was cleared up but it took about 3 e-mails and 3 phone calls. Even at a modest motel, the staff has general information but here, each person had no knowledge of the hotel beyond his/her position. They did not know who to direct you to for help. THey were often unable to help you themselves. The concierge was well intentioned, walking around offering water to the people who were standing in line to check in but didn't seem to know how to find any receptionists to help. Even a roadside motel does not leave the front desk unoccupied for periods of up to 30 minutes. I wasn't at all angry, just mystified that such a nice looking place would be so poorly run. I can't imagine that they get any return business. The parking fee seemed excessive too--it's a huge property with tons of land. I'm willing to pay to park in crowded city centers but it seemed ridiculous to pay $16.00/day to park on this huge property. Even trying to find a tea bag was a fiasco. The concierge didn't know, didn't know who to direct you to. Three girls in the restaurant seemed perplexed by this request. I hope they get some sort of management or training in place as this could be a really nice place.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant surprise, and a private escape\u201d", "Author": "Dichie55", "ReviewID": "UR60484162", "Content": "When deciding to book a trip to Puerto Rico, we obviously based our trip on the initial value, ease of travel, and amenities. First, no customs from the U.S. is amazing. Second, This hotel pins you just outside the busy city life of San Juan, amidst a perfect paradise, and has every amenity that you could wish for in a resort. It is breathtaking as you approach the hotel grounds. Do note that walking is plentiful and even trips from the room to the pools, or rooms to bar/casino/lobby/restaurants can be a bit of work. I ABSOLUTELY insist that you rent a car if you are staying here and plan on doing any of the excursions outside of the hotel. Third, The Royal Service is worth EVERY PENNY! They treated us much better, and it added the few extras that proved to be the total difference-maker in our trip (Such as the beachfront room with a jacuzzi on the balcony). The private pool for Royal Service is great, but not to take away from the enormous pool for the general public. Lastly, to all that can make the trip.....fly the $60 prop planes to Culebra Island, and Zoni beach. Flamenco beach is worth seeing...but Zoni is the hidden gem. Get ready for this hotel to get much more crowded. Trump has the J.W. Marriot going up right next door and will likely add 2-3 times more people on the beaches that were comfortable, at best.

If you do a little research beforehand, you'll have the right expectations going in. We did so and were very pleased with the resort and our stay. We were fortunate to exchange our timeshare from another excellent provider and stay at this resort. Hotel, hotel villas and the timeshare units are all on the same property. The timeshare accommodations were outstanding. Ocean front room on 3rd floor. Pretty room, large, comfortable, trendy, marble floors and bath, granite kitchen counter. Kitchen area a bit smaller than other full kitchen timeshares, but completely sufficient and nice (although kitchen utensils - knives in partic - need to be replaced). Beautiful bath. (No wireless in room though, only 1 hardline...no charge to use it. Wireless avail poolside and central areas). Check in and out for timeshare was great on service and information, but there was a bit of a wait/line. Once you got there was great - Luis in particular was great help and very accommodating. Plusses: - Large resort /grounds- plenty of space for everyone. If you like to be around people, plenty of pool seating. If you like a quite, private area where you can be alone and read or whatever, there are ample opportunities (with shade or sun) - loved this aspect of the resort. (Some other reviewers complained of distance to walk to things - we did not have bad experience in this regard. Struck me that if we were staying in San Juan hotel, which we have before, we would not have nearly the expanse of grounds or opportunity for some degree of privacy/distance from other guests). - Very nice lobby, bar areas - all open air. (No issues with mosquitos, flies, etc). - Sunrise or sunset views - from different points on the grounds. A fellow guest spoke of getting up early and walking beach to eastern edge of resort to watch the sunrise. Sunset was visible right from the shore along poolside or otherwise. - Serene natural beach/foliage - it's true that there is no soft sand beach and no real waves. The ocean area here is different. It is naturally as it should be - and likely has an important ecosystem relationship with the rainforest nearby. There are palm trees, pines and other trees growing right up to the shore in some places, and providing nice natural shade areas - you can pull up a chaise and not even need an umbrella. There are iguanas around the property and beach from time to time - fun to look at, especially for the kids - and they don't bother anyone. And birds too. Anyone who cares about the environment will appreciate the natural beauty and serenity here. Amazing too how clean the grounds were considering size of the property. No trash washed up on the beach, etc. (There are a couple of nice beaches down in Luquillo/Fajardo areas and can enjoy the beach scene there). - Nice spot for younger teenagers - there were quite a few of them at the resort with their families, and they found each other and \"hung out\" - safely within the grounds of the resort. On one hand, would have been quite boring for teens on their own because the resort is a bit out of the way, but because there were so many there turned out to be a blast - they all seemed to meet up (it was Spring Break week, so may have been more teens than normal due to this). Lots of families with young children also, and other demographics. Worked well for all. - Proximity to El Yunque rainforest. Great excursion, and free. La Mina Falls trail to swimming in pond at the bottom of falls, or hike up to El Yunque peak above the clouds. - Proximity to Fajardo and ferries/planes to Vieques or Culebra islands. Minuses - Hard pillows for sleeping. Not sure if true for all rooms, but true for ours. Other - Can't comment on the food at restaurants except breakfast. Got the buffet. $16 for cold foods and $23 for all in buffet - decent, nothing spectacular, not as bad as some of the reviews sounded. Not out of line with other resorts of this level. Resort must be listening and improving the offering. Also, hotel gift shop offered ham & cheese croissants and muffins, yogurt and a few other items. Did not eat lunch or dinner at the resort - kids did and said was ok. There is a small local place down Rte 3 - just near the intersection where you turn left for Rio Mar resort - called Don Pepe's. Great local food there - eat in or take out. Also down at Luquillo at the Kiosks - some local folks recommended Kiosk #60 - the last one on the far end - and it was \"the best\". Go for lunch and order among these \"frituras\": Rellenos de Papa (potato stuffed with a ground beef filling), Empanadillas (pastry filled with meat , chicken, or shrimp), Acapuria con Carne (green banana mash stuffed with ground beef filling), bacalaitos (cod fish fritter),...and yellow rice and beans. All are outstanding. Careful - the kiosks can get jam packed on weekend evenings...avoid them then). - Nightlife - not much to speak of at the hotel or nearby - at least on weeknights - and San Juan is quite a distance away. Gran Melia has decent DJ music at pool, lobby bar and lounge and does have live music of various types nightly - but it's not a big party scene, if you're looking for that.

The positives: 1) Great weather 2) Spacious rooms 3) Pretty lobby area The negatives: 1) Food: I think the best way to sum it up was the response we got from the concierge when we asked which hotel restaurant he would recommended: \"None of them.\" In brief, the restaurants had limited menus of mediocre quality ingredients and WAY overpriced (and I am a New Yorker used to hefty prices). Service was slow and the staff was disinterested, also taking down the experience. And, to add insult to injury, even the tropical drinks were a DISAPPOINTMENT (boxed mixes; cheap liquor). 2) Service: The staff was friendly, but gave the distinct impression that they (a) didn't want to be there and (b) beyond doing the minimum to meet job requirements, didn't care what your experience was/what happened to you. Examples: we were excited to book the bioluminesence bay trip. When we went to inquire, we were told not enough people had signed up, but ours would be the first name on the list and they would call us if more people signed up. The next day, we went to check and were told the trip was sold out. And no, we weren't on the list. She didn't know what happened; said sorry with a \"too bad\" attitude; and that was her customer service. Another day we had to call to get standard room clean when no one came by 4:30pm. At the restaurants, they would tell you there was an hour and a 1/2 wait for a table despite several empty tables in view; when we went back to inquire an hour later with the same tables empty, she said \"I guess\" she could seat us. I imagine that people with reservations didn't show, but her lack of attention to the list/management of tables was so standard for GM. 3) Lack of ammenities; lounge chairs at pool were lower standard than your typical chairs; they had a strict towel rental policy (which were not always available), which seemed cheap for a resort.

The common areas were beautiful. We enjoyed our stay. All the staff we interacted with were welcoming and friendly. We rented from the on-site Avis car agency so we didn't have to pay for parking. That saved us $15/day. The Avis rental desk at the resort was very slow. Virtually every time we passed by, there was a line. Their computer was down both times we went to the desk. The service was friendly but frazzled. People do need to know that the Avis lot is a little bit of a walk (but not too bad...maybe .2 miles from the lobby?) but it is not that much farther than the hotel parking lot. The resort is quite spread out and at night it is not well lit. Depending on where your room is, you could be walking over 1/4 mile to get from your room to the restaurants/pool/etc. There are golf cart drivers frequenting the area to give rides to resort guests, but they aren't always around when you want a ride. Families with young children may want to bring a lightweight stroller just to get around the resort! Our stroller came in handy with our younger son, who got tired of walking several times. As a side note, the stroller also came in handy in Old San Juan. A large stroller would be a pain to navigate down the streets of Old San Juan, but a portable/small stroller would be fine. The pool area was excellent! There are 4 pools at the resort. One is a separate kiddie pool for babies - maybe 1' deep. Another is the main resort pool, which is a huge pool shaped like an amoeba. Within the huge pool, there are several parts that are very shallow - families can take their pick from at least 3 different areas of the pool that are shallow (anywhere from 12 inches or so up to 3 feet deep). There is no water slide, and there are no hot tubs or jacuzzis in the pool area - only jetted sections of the pool. There is a 3rd pool which is for Royal Service guests only and is strictly for adults. Finally there is a pool at the spa (I did not try the spa). The resort has some Bali Beds by the pool which are very nice but cost $50 to rent all day. There are iguanas all over the resort grounds, including the pool area. One of the photos in the attached link is of an iguana by my pool chair. We ate at the Cafe Soleil every day for breakfast. They only have buffet breakfasts available - no breakfast menu. Since we had the Royal Service upgrade, we had complimentary continental breakfast. For an extra $7 per person, we could add hot breakfast items. Dining options at the resort are fairly limited. The pool bar is open only till 6 pm - it serves sandwiches, burgers, and salads. There is an Asian restaurant, an Italian restaurant, and a native Puerto Rican restaurant, but I never saw all 3 of them open at the same time. The room itself was comfortable and spacious. It had a separate sitting area. We had a Royal Service room which was in one of the closer buildings to the main resort area. The room decor and overall feel was nice...marble vanities, nice bedding. The maid needed constant reminding to stock our room with 4 towels, since we are a family of 4. I had to call for extra towels more than once. Another downside was that the rooms do not have fridges other than the hotel mini-bar refrigerators. There are no microwaves in the room either. The mini-bar refrigerator is not intended to be used to store guests' personal items, and if you remove their mini-bar items to make room for your things, you will be charged for the mini-bar items even if they are not consumed. I had been forewarned about this from reading reviews online, so I avoided the entire issue by bringing a portable cooler and using that to store our drinks during our vacation. There are a few central ice machines located around the resort. It would have been nice to have an ice machine in each building; as it was I had to walk maybe 1/8 of a mile to get ice each time we needed it. It wasn't far, but at night the resort is poorly lit. I brought my own ethernet cable and was very glad I did, because otherwise I would have had to pay $15 at the desk to rent one. Their wireless service was extremely slow. Families who stay at the Gran Melia should know that there is a beach but it is very rocky and there is a lot of seaweed. The good news is that nice beaches are very close. Luquillo Beach is 15 minutes away, and Seven Seas Beach (in Fajardo) is 20-25 minutes away. We went to Seven Seas beach and it was gorgeous. For some reason though it seems there were no public services although it was a public beach...there were no lifeguards even though there were lifeguard stands, there was no running water in the bathrooms (so the toilets wouldn't flush), and there was barely any toilet paper. The Gran Melia resort's shuttle service leaves something to be desired - the van they use has no working seat belts so I had no way of securing my children's car seats, and the guy who picked us up at San Juan airport drove like a maniac.", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New york", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel Resort\u201d", "Author": "latinag67", "ReviewID": "UR59019134", "Content": "This was our second time at the Gran Melia PR enjoyed our stay both times.

The restuarants are very over priced, however the service was much better then the housekeeping department... Selection disappointing in relation to how big the resort is.... Chlorine system in pools seemed to consist of large buckets of same placed in the bottom and once you finished a dip you had to get a shower.... It is a big resort and the Donald Trump Golf Course (as per hubby) was excellent... I know that is where I had my most favorite meal which was reasonably priced...

While it is not the Ritz Carlton, it was a very nice resort with all that we needed for a short vacation to PR in February with our two young daughters (ages 6 and 9). We loved the bungalows and the fact you are not located right on top of the pool. The pool was expansive and clean, but we never used it. We spent our day at the tiny beach which was perfect for our girls who are not strong swimmers. There were lots of shells and it was very calm. (If you are looking for great expanse of beach with crashing waves, this is not the beach for you!). The outdoor cafe for lunch and drinks was good and affordable. The restaurants for dinner were excellent and priced for what one would expect at a resort ($25-30 entrees). They were accommodating with our children and offered selections tailored for them. We were surprised at how good the Asian and the Italian restaurants were. The lobby and bars were pretty and the complex very pleasant. We found the staff all helpful and friendly. The only thing we did not like was breakfast. For the four of us it was $60; it was always cold, the service poor and just not very tasty. The last two days when we had a rental car we went to a bakery at the end of the road and had donuts and coffee for $11! If you rent a car you can easily get to the rainforest or Old San Juan which was a great day trip. The other piece of advice someone gave us upon our check in (because the hotel doesn't tell you this) is book your dinners either when you make the reservation or when you just get there. You can always cancel, but otherwise you might find you can't get a table until 9:30pm. This is especially true on weekends. Our only \"bad\" experience was upon checkout. It was pouring rain and it took the bellman 45 minutes to get us with our luggage and the front desk was rude every time we called for an update. Other than that, the overall experience was excellent and affordable and we would definitely go back again. Oh, and don't pay for the $15 internet cable until you are sure you need it.

As many reviewers have said, YOU MUST RENT A CAR! We found it invaluable as the food/entertainment options at the resort are very limited. We found the staff to be friendly and so kind! We were 4 in a room - and the maids made up our sofa bed neatly and left extra towels daily. We were approached only once by the condo sales pitch team and even after we agreed to go on the tour (for a free spa services, which we received promptly ) - they were very hesitant to take us through the presentation and not pushy at all. However, we were single girls, and I suspect they would rather target couples. As others have said, the casino and nightlife are nil - but the resort itself is very beautiful and relaxing. The Spa was top notch; beautiful, clean and very luxurious with steam, sauna and whirlpools etc - and very affordable as were given coupons from our bellman and the concierge. I would say my biggest disappointment was the food. We found the restaurant choices to be pretty awful. There was Asian, Italian and allegedly a Puerto Rican restaurant (but the 5 days we were there, including a weekend, it never appeared open). The food was about $23 an entree but for being in a resort - it was expected. We heard there was only buffet options for breakfast and lunch (about $29) so we never did that. We went to the bakery down the street for coffee (but the only breakfast takeway options were donuts!) and ate at Don Pepes, several of the Kioskos and seafood restaurants in Luquillo. Overall, I was disappointed. ALOT of fried food, mashed fried plantains and fried fish. Being on an island, I was hoping for fresh fruit and fresh veggies - but I can say with 100% honestly - I did not eat one piece of fresh fruit or vegetable while there (I snagged a mealy apple from the spa - the only place I saw fruit at the Melia).

We recently stayed here (wife and twin 5 year olds) on Valentines day weekend 2010 and I was disappointed. Although I have raved about Gran Melia to others before and here on Tripadvisor, I have to say this time around it was different. My room had a play pen in it that I never requested and the view I had of the lagoon was less than desirable. The pot holder outside my balcony had zero plants in it and the grounds out the window were shabby. The pool was packed and although I was fortunate to find some chairs for me and family there were NO TOWELS for anyone available. The attendant simply had a sign at counter reading sorry no towels. When asked he had no idea of when, if at all, they would have more. The bar and servers do not supply receipts for sales and charges by pool and like to over charge at check out. Request to see anything you signed at check out. I AM ASSUMING that due to shortened staff and economy issues everyone is dealing with, they were well short of staff and not ready for the valentines day rush. Since I checked in very late I probably got one of the less desirable rooms. The couch was stained and old along with older tv sets. I got this via priceline and payed about 40% less than standard rate so it was a good value nontheless. Passion restaurant with Chef Mrylta (my favorite in PR for three years now) was not up to par as-well. Again lack of staff for the crowd. My usual favorite plate, Cheviche was simply simple and blan. But shouldn't they know that in PR valentines is a big deal and be ready? Passion had my reservation an hour later than I requested and host at restaurant was MIA for 10 minutes at entering. They were busy, ofcourse BUT again at those prices hire extra hands and make my $200 dinner for two worth it. Still love you Passion but this was my least favorite visit.

Since my husband and I were traveling with our 15 and 10 year olds, we needed breakfast in the morning and it would have easily cost $50 per day for that. The pool was great and they have a quiet pool for adults. The beach is beautiful to look at but not suitable for swimming. They had a water sports hut, but I never saw any attendants and the beach doesn't lend itself well to water sports. Too much seaweed to snorkel and the bottom is rocky. We took a day trip with East Wind to Culebra for snorkeling and to enjoy the fabulous Flamenco beach. You can check out their ad in the Puerto Rico travel magazines. That was one of the highlights of our week. My husband really enjoyed the golf club adjacent to the resort, he played 3 times (my 10 year old also played). It's not cheap $160 for 18 holes, $30 less after 1pm- but golf isn't an inexpensive game. We ate at Pasion once, which was very good-try the crab soup tostones and don't forget the flan.

We also had dinner at Tempo which was quite poor, we are used to delicious Italian food on Long Island so we should have known better but we just felt like having a dish of pasta that night. You need a car to really appreciate this part of the island. We went to the kiosks at Loquillo beach for dinner one night (Parillo #2) which was fantastic and reasonable. We also ate at Richie's one night which was very expensive and just okay. Go in to Old San Juan and eat at Cafe Puerto Rico, one of the guests recommeded it to us and it was a great meal ( and under $100 for all of us whereas Pasion was $200. . Gran Melia doesn't offer anywhere to grab a quick bite or a cup of coffee so if you don't have a car you'll have to bring your wallet.

I traveled with my wife and 2 boys ( 15 & 12).The Royal service upgrade is good for the breakfast buffet, which will easily carry one thru dinner. The happy hour and appetizers were not as adverised and really is for adults only.You are offered no appetizers except peanuits in a dish,and the only drinks are beer,wine and champaigne. The rooms offered in Royal Service are in the 17 - 20 units are much larger and are very comfortable. The are really no activities for teens except a small vidoe game room. The on site restaurants are over rated and expensive. I read several reviews and utilize this information to my advantage, You will definitly need to rent a car at the airport. The Gran Melia is 2 miles off Rte 3 and once there you are secluded. I had read that you need to pay for parking every night at $16.50/ night. I was able to come and go as I pleased and really only got charged one night out of five. I think this is dependant upon the security gaurd and this is not monitoried very closely.Local eateries in Laquillo beach are LaPrilla and King Seafood, both serve excellent food and are priced accordingly. ( $125.00 for four with drinks& tip). A must see is the El Yunken rainforest, Old San Juan, Laquillo beach and if snorkilng is desired pay the $74.00/person for the East Island Excursion. This was fun, relaxed,and took you to 2 great snorkling areas. The crew was very amusing, lunch was fulfilling and the drinks flowed like water if you were so inclined. The Gran Melia is a fine resort for couples, the pool is great, but the beach is rocky and the ocean water is not suitable for snorkling.If you are traveling with teenagers you will need to venture out everyday to keep them occupied.

The resort, is breathtaking. The staff was very friendly and always there to pick us up from our room. We had an oceanfront villa suite and the view/sunsets were gorgeous! The resort is large and it was very hot so walking to our parked car was a hassle so we would call the frontdesk to send a member of the staff to pick us up. The pool, we will never forget. It was the best, the swim up bar was a great bonus feature to the magnifecent pool. The resort dining was expensive, rent a car (from the airport is cheaper) and drive to the local places for food. After the 1st day we ate out everyday and found inexpensive dining spots for breakfast/lunch/dinner. Absolute must eat out \"La Parilla\" kiosk at Luquillo Beach and for the best pina coladas go to luquillo beach and see Ed, the beach is 5 minutes from the resort. The resort beach is not ideal for swimming, more for viewing purposes only. Also visit Lolitas mexican restaurant (pass luquillo beach).We met the best tour guide ever Louie Robles (from the states and fluent in english) who was very trustworthy and friendly.

You of course want to stay in the newer ones that are closer to the beach. The staff is great and they have lots of activities from yoga to live music on some nights. The casino is small and not incredibly exciting but it is there. I recommend also the lounge beds on the beach which are quite comfortable. There are a number of things in the area to do from visiting the rain forest to seeing the glowing algea at night. There are also outlets and tons of Golf courses in the area. There is also a JW marriot being built next door which will be completed in 2011. This may crowd the beach and golf course potentially.

We did our best to eat local food each day, but did have one meal at the Italian restaurant at the hotel. It was very good, as was the service. We stayed in a bungalow room, which was very nice, although the AC was kind of loud at night and there was no view. We spent our last 1/2 day (Wednesday morning) sitting in the water at the hotel's beach. We had one stretch of the beach to ourselves, with the exception of a lone iguana and an older couple who wandered our way, but didn't stay long. It was very relaxing. And you can see a lot in this area for very little money. The most expensive thing we did (other than buying a very big coconut mask) was the bioluminescent bay tour for $45 a person. Kayaking Puerto Rico did a great job. Their staff was big enough and very, very nice and attentive. Bring extra bug spray of your own, though. Even though they give it out at the beginning and halfway through the mangrove part of the trek, the bugs in the evening are everywhere. El Yunque rainforest is very inexpensive and there are places to eat when you get there. I'd get the map off the internet and skip the welcome center next time. I wish we'd had much more time to explore the rainforest. We only had 1/2 day. We did not have time to hike to the observation tower at the top. Loquillo Beach is beautiful and has very soft sand.

When the waiter finally showed up after I was almost finished with the meal he commented that the meat was too well done and gave us one complimentary dessert. There signature Mojito was just awful.

Central to sights, not far from SJ or beaches, Trump Golf around the corner, other courses nearby, great lay out of facilities around the grounds, always a place to suit your mood (close to or far from other people, water, music, ... ) friendly staff, super rooms, rapid service, choice of rstaurants, nice gym with -amongst other machines and weights- at least 4 running/treadmills, on grounds Avis car rental. So this is a great place to wind down and re-energize at a reasonable price. Certainly in January and away from the weekends, when the crowds seem to be elsewhere or nowhere at all. Of course there are also some opportunities for improvement. One of which is arriving. We got in at SJ Airport and found a Hotel Shuttle that would not take us along because of reservation issue we did not understand. Strange way to say hello.... In the hotel we were checked in rapdily and very effectively and booked in room with ocean view, where we had reserved gardenview. Getting in the great and spacious room (not taking the royal servcie, as we did not see the real value of the extra service), there were some technical details (slide-doorhandles, leaking faucets, ...) that were quickly taken care of. However with peace and quiet untill at least 8 in the morning as one of the natural expectations for anyone being here, early morning traffic by all the grounds staff in gasoline powered carts cloud easily be improved by changing to electric carts all round. Prevents waking up guests at 6AM too. It should be noted that the hotel location, while situated on 'the beach' does not offer the opportunity to actually swim in the sea. You can of course wade in a little way. The lagoon is not deep enough for a proper swim and there is no real surf. Which confines guests to one of the poosl. Which have a great lay out and enough surface to accomodate for everybodies pleasure. However, the continuous music at the Wet Bar can be annoying. The DJ-ing qualities of the bartenders explains why they are tending bar. And the choice of tracks, apart from taste, seems to be too small to tide over more than a 1 day stay. The Mojito's make up for a lot of this little detail though ;-) Try the Razzmojito! The restaurants (Passion is relaxed and for local food, Tiempo is positioned as more upscale and serves Italian, while opposite Mani serves Oriental - and then there is of course the breakfast restaurant and the poolside lunch place) are all good enough, however not special. As Europeans we are always suprised by teh sheer size of the portions. At home one dish would do us (approx 50 year old active adults), for a day, even when sharing. And one remark with regard to design: We would advise the hotel management to re evaluate the lighting in all of the restaurants. In Tiempo we could not read the menu. Adding a few spots to the single point central lighting rthat is now in place would already do the trick. Of course this is a hotel, so restaurants are not the prime offering. However a few points could be made: When in Tiempo try the Melanzane (egg plant) appetizer. Delicious! We went on to order the Rombo. expecting Turbot (Rombo is Italian for Turbot). The fish we were served was actually Halibut and overdone. So that was a bit of a let-down. In Mani the rolls are great. The rest of the dishes are average and again too large in terms of portion size. Passion we would not reccomend. Mostly because of the very average service we got there. A commendation goes to the fact that there are good French, Italian and other European wines on the wine list as well as New World ones. So in all, we would reccomend this location to anyone who, as we did, wants to relax after too much 'all work no play' and does not want to spend fortunes. The rest of PR and SJ is close by enough to get away. Which we would reccomend as well in order to get some alternatives to eating in the hotels restaurants alone. Try Luquillo beach (20-30 minutes from the hotel) for swimming in a real surf. Old SJ's SoFo provides for a great choice of restaurants, as do some of the surrounding smaller places. Have fun here!

Luckily, I was at a great hotel. I took my 83 year old mother-in-law to the Gran Melia in Puerto Rico for a combo b-day/xmas gift. She does not have a passport, so I was limited to PR and the USVI. I specifically chose PR due to the medical facilities in San Juan. I was thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just in case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when I booked the trip, but my concern became a reality on the third day of our trip. We left on Thursday, Jan 7 and had a nice plane ride from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare to San Juan. By the time we arrived in San Juan and were driven to the Gran Melia, it was about 4 pm. After a smooth check in, we had a delicious dinner at the Nami restaurant, admired the grounds and made an early night of it. Friday we camped out by the pool, ate at Tempo and hit a shopping mall in the evening. Saturday, was gorgeous. The perfect day. We spent the afternoon by the pool and beach, eating at Nami again. After dinner, we relaxed in the room, \"packing up\" for the our Sunday flight home. Unfortunately, my mother-in-law woke up at 1 am and was sick as a dog. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bore you with the details but she was later diagnosed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153having a gastrointestinal virus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I asked if it was something she could have eaten. They said absolutely not. (Besides, we ate the same food, drank the same water etc. so I knew it wasn't that, anyway...) One doctor said she probably started contracted it before we even left. It's just one of those things.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, she lost a lot of fluid within a short 2 hour period. I went to the front desk, which was staffed with young girls who seemed genuinely sympathetic to our situation. One had the foresight to alert the head of security, Miguel Rodriguez Benabe, who got a doctor to our room within an hour. Bottom line, I decided an ambulance was needed. I didn't want to take any chances. She needed to be hydrated and FAST. The manager called an ambulance for me. The hotel sent a friendly, young guard named Gonzolas in a Gran Melia hotel van containing our luggage to the hospital with me. Gonzolas stayed by my side the whole time, helping me translate her medical bkgd, talking to my trip insurance carrier on the phone for me, keeping in touch with the hotel etc. We missed our flight so, so my trip insurance company faxed 16 pages of forms to the hospital - some for me to fill out & some for the doctors. The hotel guard was a lifesaver, interpreting for me. Plus, he took me out to get something to eat and help me get a charger for my phone which was going dead from all the battery time being used on \"emergency\" calls. When mom got released from the hospital, the hotel van transported her back to the hotel. Miguel himself lifted her out of the van and into a wheelchair to get to our same suite. They had it spotlessly clean and delivered everything I needed (7up, gatorade etc) in a coolers with ice. She slept all night after midnight and was better in the morning. We were able to make our flight home. Another manager, Luis Rivera Gomez was involved in helping orchestrate a smooth transition such as working with staff to help me arrange new land and air transport. The management even sent hotel security staff to get mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pills at the local Walgreens for us! I was blown away by the willingness to help and go the extra mile for us. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this for two reasons. One is to outline how fantastic the staff of Gran Melia are at handling difficult situations. Second, is to remind everyone that sometimes the staff might be assisting folks (like us) in true emergency situations, so you should cut any hotel staff some slack on any service-related issues. There may be a valid reason for a missed turn-down service, for example. Ironically, my mother-in-law STILL had a good time (hospital visit aside) and enjoyed the warm sun, palm trees and gorgeous ocean. Attached are some pictures I took with my cell phone. I still have to get my camera pictures developed. Warning: They aren't your \"normal\" vacation pictures! I want to thank the staff of the Gran Melia for helping me salvage my trip and getting us out of Puerto Rico safely. I want to thank you for your reponsiveness and professionalism during a very stressful situation.

We talked with a different front desk representative and she was making it sound as though we were lying about the 3rd person. Thankfully we had the printed out receipt we originally received from the other front desk lady who took it off) 4-we stayed in room 1605 and everynight our room was very musty. Our bedding clothes and everything else was very musty. I asked the front desk on our 3rd day there to either move us to a different room or send someone out to see if the AC was working correctly. The front desk told us they would send a housekeeper to our room to switch out our bedding. We waited 4 hours and no one ever came. 5-the food at Tempo and the breakfast place (cant remember the name) was VERY expensive. The breakfast joint cost us $25pp!~ 6-the spa services were very expensive. We did a couples 50 minute massage and thought it was $140 total, it was actually $140pp and ours started 10 minutes late so we only received 40 minutes of our $300 service! 7-the casino closes at 1am vs being open 24 hours which I thought was a bid odd so they usually kick you out of the casino between 1-2am 8-we really didnt enjoy the loooong entry drive everytime we entered back into the hotel Now here are a few things that we did like about our stay there: 1-they had daily free activities that you can do (etc, yoga, pilates, bingo) 2-We had a car rental so the location of this resort did not bother us.

The resort is located about 1/2 hour from San Juan Airport and is in a remote location. This was not an issue for us because we did not have a rental car for the week and had decided beforehand that we were going to stay at the resort the entire time. The grounds and buildings were beautiful! We reserved a Beachfront room with Royal Service. Check-in was easy with no wait and a mostly helpful staff. We were immediately carted to our room by a friendly staffer. Our room was an end unit overlooking the beach and water. Room was large and comfortable , but not luxurious. Bathroom and shower were sufficient. The beach was nice to look at with numerous palm trees and had beach chairs strewn all over, but was not ideal for laying out or swimming. The Royal Service pool was just a few steps from our room and, for us, was the best part of the resort. It is an adult only, huge pool, and has great Bali beds available and also bar service. Lunch could be ordered from the room service menu and was just average. We did this each day. Our bartender was attentive and fun! We had the complimentary continental breakfasts and it was sufficient for our needs. We were always seated fast and there was enough 'cold' choices to be satisfied (we were comped two free 'hot' breakfasts, but it was not good except for the omlet station). We ate at every restruant and never had a bad meal. Our favorite was Nami and our least favorite was Pasion. Each place had great, fast sevice and excellent food. Yes, it is not cheap...but this is resort fine dining, not some kiosk on the side of the road. We also took part of Grand Melia's New Year's Eve party (comped as part of our package $100 each!)...LONG line to enter the ballroom and everyone was dressed to kill! The food was very good and the drinks were weak and expensive ($10 per). They had a 14 piece Merengie band blasting out Latin music and the dance floor was crowded. Loud, but good. Sounds good so far, right? Here's why I gave this resort only 3 stars...for the money ($500+ per night) I would have expected nicer much rooms. The Royal Service basically gave us the private pool and the lounge (which had two computers for emailing and a tv with free beer and wine for happy hour!) The other services (airport transportation, pillow menu, newspaper, hot tub set up, and especially concierge and butler service) were non existant. Also, this resort (at least when we were there) definitely catered to the Spanish speaking Euros and Latin America crowd vs. the U.S. guests. I know, I know...Puerto Rico is a Spanish speaking island and the resort is owned by a Spanish corporation, but there seemed to be some bias towards the sparse American crowd (I would guess the guests were 3/4 Spanish speaking). For example, the entire New Year's Eve party music and dialoge was in Spanish. One evening, as we were walking back to our room, a resort cart passed right by us and then stopped to ask the couple 10 yards ahead of us (non-American) if they needed a ride!?!? We felt out of place, but made the most of it. So, despite the beautiful grounds and good food, the rooms lacked enough for me not to give more than a 3 star rating to the Grand Melia. ...BTW...the best part of the trip was renting a car for one day to take an early morning hike to El Yunque rainforest...VERY close to the resort and well worth the trip...Fantastic!!", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cIt's all a matter of preference\u201d", "Author": "cnc123", "ReviewID": "UR53191167", "Content": "I read numerous reviews of this hotel myself before arriving.

For some, this location would truly have it all. It all comes down to a matter of preference. I traveled with my husband along with many others for a conference--therefore I cannot comment on the cost other than would I be willing to pay the cost to stay here myself. The answer however would be yes and no. Yes, because based on the published price of the hotel it would be well worth it. No because the property does not offer what my family and I would be looking for. I'll address some of the negative comments that I recall from previous posts. #1--check-in. It was a breeze, and we were greeted by friendly staff. So those who have had bad experiences with that just happened to catch them at a bad time I would say. #2--housekeeping. I'd describe it as: random and sporadic. We had turn down service only 2 of the 4 nights we were there. No washcloths were replaced in the room twice. We had no hairdryer the first night (I called to request one and received it about 15 minutes later), there were random toiletries (no more shampoo one night, a different brand one day, no extra soap the next day), and our bathroom door was locked when we arrived in our room. All small, inconsequential items--just puzzling. #3--the beach. I've read the beach described as rocky. Not really an accurate description. The beach is actually a coral and sand beach--there are many large pieces of coral scattered about (I'd estimate it to be half sand/half coral chunks--not finely washed small pieces). Not a good beach for taking the kids to play. But beautiful to view and stroll along (with shoes.) Again, just a matter of preference and what you're there for. I read previous reviews about a musty smell in the room. I will concur with that--but it went away (or we got used to it) by the second night. Pool area is beautiful. Property is remote from any other areas/restaurants. It takes 7 minutes to drive to it after turning off the main road. Property offers very little excitement after dark, other than sitting at the bar and listening to the band. Once again, all a matter of preference.

Basically. it seems like there are no seasoned fully trained people who work there. nobody is walking around with apparent seniority . there are smaller hotels where there are people walking around all the time inspecting and acting like they love the place. That does not happen here. At all which explains a lot. Seems like a lot of less than motivated people doing their jobs to the best they want to or need to.

RS includes the cold breakfast buffet. get there early as you may have to wait for table otherwise. Again, the people taking names dont seem to care about waits or hussling. Food at the hotel is between bad and fine. Always on the higher side of cost. You must have a car. We did.

The main attraction is the pool as the beach area is pretty to look at, but not one you would play in too much. The restaurants were excellent especially the new Puerto Rican one. However, if you are looking for nightlife, the hotel is very quiet in the evening. They do have a small casino, but 1/2 the machines were broken and there is not much to do except sit in the lounges. They also promised planned activities, complete with a calendar, but I only saw one or two in 4 days that I was there. The water sports hut was never manned although the equipment sat by the beach.

We generally found all of the staff helpful. People seem to complain that the place is pricey but compared to many other places we have been this was a real find. We stayed Monday thru Monday and checking in on a weekend is likely a very different experience. the resort was very quiet when we arrived and stayed that way until saturday when there were weddings and a convention and checking in then was likely a hassle. We golfed four days out of seven at the nearby Trump course which was gorgeous. the only negative I had is that there are \"noseeum on the beach \" those miniscule little biting things . Didn't get warned about them and the first morning at dawn I walked on the beach and itched for days. I avoided the beach the rest of the trip. Room was lovely with Jacuzzi on balcony.

All the bellman I encountered bent over backwards to be courteous and as accommodating as possible. Dario was so nice he even gave me his private cell phone number to call him if I needed anything or any help. The head of security, Israel also was a true gentlemen and oversees a great staff of security personnel. When we arrived, our bags were swept away and taken to our unit. The bellman (Dario) walked us to the front desk and we were greeted with cold water. After reading many of the reviews on this page, I tried very hard to be non biased! Waiting for a receptionist, even though the place was empty was not expected at a well appointed resort like this. The receptionist seemed a little tenacious with her attitude towards me as a guest... as though she was doing me a favor for checking me in! She immediately asked for an imprint of my card of $100.00 per day, even though my trip was fully paid for! I asked why and she stated for incidentals, I then said that there will be no incidentals and that I was nervous to give an imprint because I read of other guests on this site complaining of getting unauthorized charges. I also stated that I was shocked that there were so many negative reviews of the resort on many websites. She then stated that I could give a $100.00 deposit but I would need to come to the front desk to have my keys re-keyed. At this point I asked for a manager who seemed to have the same attitude as the receptionist. In our conversation she told me that on average 5 out of 100 people are not satisfied at the end of there stay. 5% seems to be a bit high for unsatisfied clients at a resort. Now I understand why they were less than 50% unoccupied. We arrived to our room, which by the way was absolutely gorgeous and appointed like I never have seen before. The only problem was it smelled like a mildew problem. If you must stay at this resort I recommend a car as it is about a 10 minute ride to just get out of this secluded property. (I never saw a taxi) I am glad we had a car since there restaurants seemed to be a bit pricey $23.00 for a breakfast buffet that was less than average. The pool was breathtakingly beautiful, however service at the pool bar, was by far the poorest that I have ever experienced at any resort I have ever been at, and I have been practically on every Island in the Caribbean! There is no reason for a guest to wait over 10 minutes to be served especially with two bartenders and no one else at the bar! A good percentage of the other workers at this resort could not speak or understand a word of English! Having a pool table at the pool was nice, if only they had working pool sticks to compliment it. Getting a cork screw to open a bottle of wine, took well over an hour even with two phone calls to remind them that I needed one. The maids did a fair job of cleaning as my feet always looked black after walking in my room barefoot for 10 minutes. Towels were nice and ample. The soaps, shampoo and other toiletries were of high quality. The internet worked, but the signal by wireless and by cable was very weak. A dial up would have been faster. The beach or should I say the lack of sand was very disappointing. Definitely bring water shoes as the stones and rocks will make you feet sore. The Casino was a real joke, through out our stay 50% of the machines had signs on them stating they were out of order. One $10.00 Black Jack table, one roulette table were open. No craps tables and one entrance seal/locked which made me nervous because of the incident many years ago where people died in a fire in a casino in Puerto Rico because of locked exits! Be prepared to pay over $16.00 a day for parking as a guest, which is a total ripoff. The hotel does this to discourage you from going off property. If the Hotel was more service oriented, had reasonable prices for food and a half decent Casino, there would be no reason to go off site! This is the first time after my first day at a resort that I could not wait to leave the premises to eat, gamble and use a public beach that had sand!. In closing, management's lack of management at this hotel/resort has a lot to learn to run a successful profit making business. Gran Melia, if your reading this, you need to put the customer/guest first and do a much better job of pampering your guests/clientel instead of robbing them blind! I would never come back to this resort let alone this Island. No one wants to speak English, even the Police!

The rate in early December was reasonable. But it has forgotten the central purpose of what a hotel should be: attention to basics (or is it that the standards go down with the price...?). Two days in a row, our room was not made when we arrived back from a long day`s touring, late in the evening. The first night, we had to wait a half hour before someone came to make the bed and change the towels. It was only on the third day that someone actually cleaned the room and bathroom. The bathtub didn't drain properly, the electrical outlet in the bathroom was dead, the thermostat was ''frozen'' (in every sense of the word) at 63 degrees resulting in the patio doors dripping with condensation -- the alternate option to shivering was to turn it off and swelter. The coffeemaker in the room produced cold coffee which in itself was tasteless anyway. What really rubbed us was that repeatedly, when we registered complaints about the unmade room, we were told it was our fault because we had left the ``Do not Disturb`` sign on, while in fact we hadn't even been provided with one in the first place. We ate at the on-site Italian restaurant once, where waiters did swan dances around the room but had to be asked three times for a roll and brought the wine after we had been served. The table was not dressed (no candles, no flowers, no under-plate for the bowl of pasta, etc..) all of this echoing the overall impression that this hotel is big on flash but low on class and service. Ultimately, our bill was reduced by $80+, the outlet and bathtub were repaired and the coffeemaker was replaced, which we appreciated, but we had to become very cranky in order to get attention. As an added thought: the hotel is located some distance from San Juan and most other tourist sites and there is virtually no public transportation outside of urban centres so that a rented car is necessary, but be prepared to pay $17.00 per day for parking at the hotel even though the property sits on acres and acres of land. By contrast, parking in downtown San Juan is inexpensive (about .75 cent per hour). The young chap at the hotel who fixed our flat tire with a smile was the best part of the experience and we were happy to tip him generously.

Rep.) so I went here as part of my collection program (free exchange), but the second time I went, I had to use the hotel facilities, not the resort. My experience before and after (using my resort exchange) was really great. But the hotel has some problems. First, the good stuff. The hotel is just beautiful, great finishes and textures everywhere. The pool is amazing but gets a little cold in \"winter\" (Caribbean winter). You can enjoy walking (if you travel with small children it might be wise to ask for a room near the lobby) due to the gardens. The bar/lounge is very relaxing and comfy, except during \"shows\". Now, the regular stuff. The restaurants are quite nice, I do recommend Oriental restaurant, but the others are not a good value, don't take me wrong it is not just the total cost (easily $100 for 2 adults), is that you might be expecting a little more for your money or at least a cost of $80 (not including alcoholic beverages). On the other side I bet they do this for you to buy the \"all inclusive\" package, that is only worthwhile if you drink alcoholic beverages (premium included). If you are using \"all-inclusive\" option you will find it a better value ($130 per day-person). The barmen and waiters do expect some gratuity (and these people are great). Let me end with the bad stuff. The front desk is slower than usual. With an empty front desk, expect to wait at least 5 minutes, with people around more than 20 (they do offer some free water/juice but who cares, I want to go to my room!). The front desk manager is a little on the rough side and I expected better service (The resort people are totally different). Also, I don't know why but they charge $50 per day if you want to use the cabanas around the pool (I can partially accept that in high season but with the hotel half full, come on!). Albeit, once paid for the cabanas and its totally worth it (the resort includes the use of the cabanas). The location requires you to rent a car is FAR from everything. To go eat outside my guess is at least 15 minutes to a BK, longer for better restaurants. If you have felt that I am in love with the resort part, you are not mistaken. Just let me be clear it is not the best business (as always), but their system is different than the typical time-share and I love their system and the two resorts I've been to.

A bit more expensive than what I typically would spend on a 5 day vacation like this (I enjoy going all-inclusive), but the resort and service was fantastic. I'd say 95% of the time I felt as though I got what I paid for. I was there for a friends committment ceremony so didn't have a choice with choosing the location, but enjoyed the resort thoroughly. It was a good 30 minutes from the airport and probably 40-45 from Old San Juan. We rented a car which was nice to have....almost necessary if staying there very long and want to get off the resort to do anything. Check-in was fairly smooth....it was early evening so no others at the front desk checking in at that time so that part was quick. However it started to rain once we got there so there was some confusion among the valet guys and the bellman who take you to the room so we had to wait a bit to get a cart/van to take us there. We had a gardenview room (no royal service) and while our villa was a ways from the main lobby (villa 800), the room was absolutely amazing! An in-room fridge would have been nice since the only one there was stocked (and sensored) so we left it alone, but the room/bathroom itself was large, nicely decorated, very clean, cool and our king bed was extremely comfortable. I thought the cleaning and service staff around the resort was extremely friendly. Everyone driving by on golf carts always said hello when passing if they weren't stopping and asking you if you'd like a ride. The pool is amazing....loved the built in layout beds which allow you to be half submerged in the pool. The beach left a lot to be desired though....barely any beach there really. But we relaxed one day on the beach chairs (on the grass) near the beach and could still listen to the ocean waves crashing so we managed. Also waded in the water one day and while the bottom of the ocean is a little rocky, you could find some sandy areas to stand in for a while and cool off. We went off the resort to a public beach to find a more 'picturesque' beach which was nice during the afternoon (during the week) because was almost entirely secluded. I did get bit up a ton though by mesquito's or whatever the little gnats were that were around the grounds. And it seemed within the wedding party half of us were bitten up and others weren't. So I think it just might depended if you're more prone to getting bit but until you know...strongly advice the use of some bug spray. I had a few swell up into huge welts on my legs that were rather miserable at times. We ate at Nami (Asian Bistro) and Tempo (Italian Resturant) and found them both to be very delicious and reasonably priced. I really think the food around the resort was very good and not priced too badly. It's not cheap by any means....but reasonable for that type of resort. I think some of the drinks were overpriced....but no different than if you're out downtown in a big city. Expect to pay roughly $8-12 for a mixed drink or martini. Even though we were paying a hefty price I always thought they seemed relatively strong at least. We used the pool one night and even had a little \"party\" gathering with some beer we brought in ourselves with a few of the other wedding guests and never had anyone tell us we weren't allowed to do that or that we were being too loud...so that part was nice. I had read reviews about being \"nickled and dimed\" with additional room charges so anytime I charged something to our room, I made sure to ask for a receipt so I could remember everything charged. My suggestion would be to just use your credit card instead (it will eventually go on there anyways). I only charged drinks probably 3 different times but the bills are a bit difficult to review as every individual thing was seperated out on the bill. Meaning if your drink bill at one of the bars was $24, you'd see that charge plus the $3 tip you left. Also note: we did not tip housekeeping staff (not on purpose either), thought about it on the 2nd day but never did end up leaving anything and noticed when checking out, we were charged $3 a day for housekeeping so in my opinion, that's probably good enough. Whether those individuals actually see that money is probably another story though. Also were charged $15 for bellman service (I'm assuming that was for when we checked in and bags were taken to our room). I thought that was rather unnecessary as of course we tipped them ourselves up front. But then I thought about how many times were were given rides around the resort in golf carts and just decided to leave well enough alone. After reviewing our bill, didn't see anything on there that we didn't charge so was happy I didn't have to haggle upon checkout. We were there for a short stay (3 full days, 2 travel days) but were still able to do some great sighseeing. We enjoyed going into Old San Juan...seeing the historical sights, walking around and grabbing a bite of \"authentic\" Puerto Rican cuisine. Also went up to the rainforest and hiked to the waterfall that you can swim in. Good 30 minute hike but the waterfall was amazing and while the water was extremely cool to get it....found it refreshing and would have felt like we missed out on something had we not gotten in the water! Overall really enjoyed Puerto Rico and would love to go back. I'd go back to Gran Melia possibly to stay a few nights if relaxation is what you're looking for....but probably stay a few nights closer to San Juan to be a little closer to the action. Overall Gran Melia is a gorgeous resort....maybe a bit on the expensive side, however for the price I do think you get what you pay for in quality and service. So don't be afraid to stay there at all....even if on a bit of a budget.

We had dinner at Richie's offsite and it was excellent. Entrees range from $15-$40. They provide a shuttle and will pick you up and bring you back to the resort. Make sure to return your towels every day or they will charge you $30 per towel. Also check your bill with the front desk frequently. Almost all of us were overcharged for something along the way. Towels, extra drinks, double charged for spa treatments and one person's entire bill was charged twice on their credit card. It seems as though this was done on purpose as I'm sure not everyone checks their bill as closely and they hope to get away with it. When we asked them to remove the incorrect charges they did so without hesitation.

I suppose I would recommend this hotel but make sure they were aware of these issues", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cA Truly Fantastic Resort!\u201d", "Author": "NYTraveler57_9", "ReviewID": "UR49455988", "Content": "We stayed at this resort for 4 days and 3 nights to get away and unwind from our hectic life. While some say this resort is remote, since it is 30 minutes from San Juan, we found the seclusion perfect to relax from the hustle and bustle of the city. We could have stayed closer to the city but that's a personal choice and the distance in no way detracts from the amenities of this wonderful hotel. The grounds are absolutely stunning and well maintained. Wild life included chamelons, iguanas and various large and small waterfowl which made the walk from our room to the main building seem like a nature tour. The staff were simply amazing, catering to our every whim and need. We stayed in the junior suite by the adult only pool and were pampered by our personal butlers, Angel C and Angel M. Simply put, they took care of our every need from reserving poolside palapas to arranging for transportation for day trips to making reservations at the various restaurants. Angel M was particularly adept at getting things done and making things happen sometimes before we even finished verbalizing our request. He arranged a beautiful anniversary dinner reservation at Tempo, the resort's Italian restaurant, fixing us up with a wonderfully attentive waiter Joel who made the night particularly memorable with his excellent service and meal and wine suggestions. The resort has a large central pool with a wondefully convenient swim up bar and grill. We spent most of our time at the adults only pool which is smaller but more secluded. Rich, the poolside bartender kept us happy with a panopoly of special drinks, one better than the next. He was extraordinarily attentive and jovial. In short, the staff was incredible and in my various world travels, I can honestly say I have never been so admirably served and attended to. In four days we became so friendly with the staff we disparaged leaving them. Rich quipped he was not sure I was still breathing because I was so relaxed and asleep each morning on our palapa by the pool. The spa was beautifully appointed and we had a \"couples massage\" that was simultaneously relaxing and sensual. Once again the staff was extremely accomodating. The three restaurants , Italian, Asian fusion and Puerto Rican venues were all fantastic and the prices were reasonable from our reference point of inhabitants of New York. Every night there was a free open bar Happy hour from 6 to 7 pm. The casino was moderately sized but quite functional and we fortunately were able to win back some of our vacation expenses at the slot machine and black jack tables. We took only one side trip to old San Juan. Rental cars were available on site but the resort offers an evening shuttle from 7 to midnight. We took a cab to go in earlier and were in Old San Jan in 30 minutes. While some reviews say this resort is somewhat remote, it was a nice contrast returning to its peacefulness and solitude after a bustling day in San Juan. In summary , we loved the Gran Melia and would return there in a New York minute. The rooms were spacious and well appointed, the staff including Angel M, Angel C, Rich the bartender and Joel the waiter were beyond amazing and the restaurants were fantastic. If you want to get away and spend a relaxing, peaceful, pampered vacation, THIS IS THE PLACE TO DO IT!", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Staff\u201d", "Author": "Crkt", "ReviewID": "UR49360885", "Content": "I will try to keep this as postive as possible but this resort has some problems. First off the staff was absolutely incredible. From arrival, check-in/out, bartenders, and butlers were all top notch. Friendly, professional and willing to do whatever it took to make our stay wonderful. Many of them thanked us for spending the time and money in the dour economy and hoped we would return. We upgraded to an ocean front for an added charge and upon moving in found the room to have a musty or moldy smell. My wife and I are both very sensitive to this problem so returned to the front desk the next day to request a move. It was granted but before we packed our things I suggested we check it out first. Whew! It was terrible. Much worse than the first one. So we went back to request another room. This was granted later in the day and we were moved one building over and upstairs. This room was much better although my wife could smell the odor in the bathroom. The room was very comfortable with a large bath, bedroom and sitting room. There was also a patio with a jacuzzi but we didn't spend much time there due to the mosquitoes. Ouch. The resort is very, very isolated. We bought R/T transfers with our vacation package so unless you rent a car (the resort will charge you $25/day parking) you are stuck with the resort. However, that being said, with a very large pool and a somewhat more quaint butler service pool, four restaurants and enough bars available, one really doesn't need to leave. The food service was very good for both breakfast and dinner but ask about Richies. They'll come to get you in a van and drop you off after dinner. Absolutely awesome food. The owner even bought our table a round of drinks. Cool. Richard, the bartender at the BS pool along with Angel M and Angel C were incredible. In most cases you didn't need to ask for anything, they seemed to know and were more than willing to go out of there way. All three were a great asset to the resort. This was at the smaller quieter pool compared to the large and noisier pool for kids. There seemed to always be a lot of noise around the grounds as the groundskeepers stayed busy, plus a new JW Marriott's is going up just behind the Gran Melia. In short, would we go here again? No. Although I was led to believe this was a new resort, it is an old Paradisius with a new name although it is in fairly good condition. But the mold problems require immediate attention or they won't have a very good occupancy rate. I could deal with it being isolated but like to go to a close by store to pick up a few essentials ie, beer and snacks. You can't do that there. The beach is very narrow with brown sand, unlike the wide, white sand beaches of Condado, and the water has lots of sea grass so you can't see what's in the water. Also, if you decide to taxi in towards the city you'll need about $60/person each way into Old San Juan.

Our balcony had an amazing jacuzzi on it that our butler had ready to go for us, complete with bubbles, candles, wine... you name it, and when we would request it he would have a fairy-tale setting ready for us to enter into after coming back from dinner. Simply paradise... We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the \"palapas\" next to the private pool (access to this pool came with the special butler service) and chose one between the pool and beach. We spent the week lounging in our palapa with the ocean on one side and the pool on the other... with fresh fruit and drinks delivered to our own personal, romantic, comfortable bed... We were there every day from right after breakfast through to the late afternoon and enjoyed every single second... I want to have a palapa in my backyard now! Bottom line, pay extra for the butler service. You will be taken special care of with special private pool access and palapa, butler service to prepare your romantic jacuzzi tub, and you will be waited on hand and foot. The spa services were also VERY nice - at least my massage, manicure and pedicure were very, very well done. A little pricey, but very well done.

I have been to other 5 star resorts and sadly it didn't live up to the others. We were at the hotel for a family wedding I felt my main issue with the hotel was how shady the business staff was. After checking in and having to wait 3 hours for our room, come to find out we were all offered Royal Service upgrade at different prices. Some people were offered as high as $200 per day and other couples received it for $75 per day (for the same exact service). When confronted on this fact, they could not answer us as to why this was happening. Upon reviewing our final bill we were automatically charged for bellman service at check in and again at check out (no one once offered to pick up our bags), my husband and I were never informed that tips would automatically be added to our bar bills when we were already tipping (very well might I add) the bartendars. After reviewing the receipts that I signed, the automatically added tips were not on there. Long story short they weren't honest with us. As far as value goes....no one goes to a five star resort is looking for value we know this. But if you want us to pay for 5 star, give us 5 star. The rooms were so-so, definitely did not live up to the Excellence Cancun. Food was served cold or extremely dried out. The service was mediocre at best. We went to the Puerto Rican restaurant for dinner and my cousin had to wait for her steak for 45 min after everyone's food had come out and not even offered an apology. However, I did find that I liked that restaurant the best as far as food quality is concerned. The grounds and view were beautiful and kept very clean. As far as service goes, for the most part people were friendly and helpful, again with the exception of the business staff. I must say the wedding and reception was ABSOLUTELY beautiful and very well done. To wrap up, would I go here again? Absolutely not.

It is quite possible that other travelers are not comfotable with Five Star Resorts and pricing or they just expect something for nothing. Let me just assure you that this place was incredible.

We booked a Royal Service Ocean View room and when we checked in, It was not available, they put us in a private villa WOW.

As far as the resturants they were terrific with the exception of the Carabbean which later I found out was a consession facilty not operated by the Hotel (I wound skip this one service is slow and food bland) The others are just great and prices are normal for a resort like this.

We reserved a deluxe ocean front suite to celebrate my birthday. At our arrival the room that was given to us had a tunberable of mold (which I discovered, it was all around the bathroom ceiling) and was quiet uncomfortable to breath. My son is very allergic, and we could not remain in the room. We immediately complained to the front desk Manager and was told that another room would be provided, however we had to wait to be cleaned up. After lunch, another room was given to us, only to discover in the evening, when my husband turned up the air conditioner that the system started to make a strange noise, and was not working properly. The noise kept my husband up most of the night. My 7 year old and I were able to sleep out of exhaustion of long flight and delay in getting another room. Next day ,we went to the front desk about the matter and were told that the only room available was a Villa (which seemed odd based on our observation that the hotel was pratically empty during our arrival and at breakfast). After seeing the Villa which was nicely furnitured and appealing, we were promised a rate of $850 a night which we agreed. However, at check out 9 days later, we discovered that was not the case. We had pre paid the total of 10 days for an ocean suite via orbitz ,and could not get them on the phone to help us with this issue. The Hotel Manager told us that the $850 was on top of the rates already paid via Orbitz for an ocean suite, which is absolutely ridiculous. I was not in a PRESIDENTIAL Penthouse . In other words, they trick us into getting a Villa and paying a price of almost $1,500 a day, especially after all the aggravation we went through with previous rooms. When we continue to check the bill, we realized that there were charges for water sports, which my 6 year old could not have ever used. The charges were placed by the Children's Club babysitter, and meals that my son, told me he did not have. Also, don't touch the items on top of the desk in the Villas, which they told us were complement of the hotel, whatever we ate or drink from that tray were all in our bill, down to the peanuts!!! Another thing that we were not told about is the distance of this hotel from downtown and Airport. The hotel provides no shuttle services to any area outside the premises. Prepare to spend a minimum of US$85 on a cab ride to downtown (45 to 50 min ride). Hotel is totally isolated, and the 3 restaurants in the premises, leave much to be desired. One is japonese, therefore, if that is not your type of food, you would have to wait hours to be served on the only so called \"gourmet\" eatery in the hotel. My husband got so annoyed with the time the waiter was taking to get him a drink, that he got up and went to the bar to get his own. The food again after almost 2hrs wait for 3 dishes ordered ,came lukewarm, and it was nothing to brag about. This hotel will never see us again......Stay way from the beach, unless you don't mind to swim in a pool of seedweed . We went mid May - which is probably low season for the hotel, and still had to wait for everything, room service, meals. The only positive was the weather, which was nice and warm and gave us reason to go to the pool, since the beach, neither one of us cared for. My son, made a friend there and that helped him past the time. We ended up renting a car to avoid having to eat on the same restaurant and deal with the extreme slow service every night. The Marriot hotel and the the local restaurant on the top of the hill became our lunch & dinner hang out. Avoid the Ritz Italian restaurant in downtown, overpriced and the food was not at the level one would expect from this hotel. There was absolutely alomost zero entertainment during the evening, aside from the casino which was also very empty compare to other Caribbean islands we have visited.

The resort is kind of out of the way, so you will definitely need a car, otherwise you may feel trapped in the resort. It does take 30-40 minutes to drive to Old San Juan. As far as the hotel itself is concerned, I would give it four stars. We had fun staying there. The pool area and the grounds are very nice, but the beach is very rocky. They do have a number of overpriced restaurants in the resorts. We only tried the breakfast buffet once, which was very nice. I also tried the burger at their poolside grill and I must say that it was probably the worst burger I have ever had. The meat was very tough. I was afraid to ask what it was. For the most part, we tried to find local restaurants that people had recommended on the web. So, if you have a car, I would recommend doing this. I did not experience some of the negatives that people had reported here, but I did have some minor issues. They do hold a daily charge on your credit card that you can charge against around the resort. This was not too bad, but based on what I had read here, it seems that they pull the amount out of the air, since it seems to be different for different people. On Sunday around 11 AM, they were out of towels for the pool and they kept saying that they would have more in 30 minutes. There is no excuse for this, since the hotel was barely half full.

The first impression was \"WOW\"! This hotel was beautiful and the grounds and gardens are so well kept. The ocean is beautiful and the view is amazing. Our room was very nice. We got a royal service jujior suite with a huge spa tub with jets on the balcony. The view was ocean front and it was spectacular!! The firsat day we relaxed and enjoyed some time by the huge pool and ate at the swim up bar which was resonable and the food was good. The drinks are small and overpriced, but that was expected. The first night we were still excited by everything new and had dinner in 1 of 2 restaurants open. The food was not that good and it was soooo expensive. But we had planned on one nice dinner out for our honeymoon. The next day we had seen everything at the resort, yes it was relaxing, but after you've seen everything it gets a little boring. There is NOTHING to do at this resort at night. There is only the lobby bar (which is pretty) or the Casino (where no one was winning anything) We tried to play and the machines seemed like they didn't give anything back at all!!! The cafe and the swim up bar/restaurant all close at around 5:30pm. These restaurants are the only place with resonably priced food. After that you only have 2 restraurant choices that change each night for food. They basically force you to have to spend that money for not so good food. Almost everyone was complaining about the food!! They do this beause there is not any other way to get food unless you rent a car for the entire time you're there which is minimum $70 a day. The resort is so far away from anything in walking distance. This brings me to my next point: The hotel should offer some sort of shuttle into town or something for entertainment, but they don't. I thought I would be okay with just hanging around the resort, but my husband and I were bored out of our mind. We joked around about being hostages in the resort. I am really torn about writing this review because the resort itself is gorgeous and the people were really helpful (Manuel and Mark at the concierge desk were fantastic). But there isn't any form of entertainment in this hotel short of a lobby bar and casino. If your not on any sort of budget then this resort is for you. Food cost wouldn't be a problem and renting a car for the days wouldn't be an issue. For people on a budget and trying to get the most for your money then find another hotel closer into town (San Juan) where taxi rides are feasible (taxi ride to this resort one way is about $60) Puerto Rico itself is a beautiful place and we wished we had gotten a hotel closer to old San Juan and enjoyed more of the island.

We rented a car at the airport - MUCH cheaper than at the hotel and allowed us to venture out to do things like hike in the rainforest, kayak at night and horseback ride on our own. You can do all of this through the hotel for 2-3x the actual cost, so renting a car is definitely a $$ saver. The downside is that the hotel charges you $16/day for parking. We were aware of this ahead of time and still saved $$.. Watch for hidden fees, don't touch the mini bar, the hor bar items at breakfast are NOT included, and the onsite restaurants are overpriced and not all that great.

The room bathroom and pool were fabulous but the good things end there. It began with a dirty room, smelling of mold which was black and visible on the air vents. The hallways were unkempt and the room was also not swept with dust bunnies rolling around the floor. When we asked for a different room we were told that a group was coming in two days and they couldn't move us. The hotel was only at 10% capacity when we arrived. Upon arrival we had asked for an upgrade and were refused. Basically they refused everything I asked for the entire trip. I had purchased this trip 10 months prior through Back To The Caribbean and had bought 6 nights. When I made the reservation, it had been reduced to 4 nights, but alas they said I could purchase additional nights for $50. Everything you want or need has a price tag attached and the customer is never right. Housekeeping had to be called everyday to get the items they forgot to leave in the room, like towels washcloths and bath mat. Even though they profess to be green and ask to re-use towels by hanging, they disregarded this and took all the towels every day. Guests are not permitted to bring food from off premises though most of the people staying there did. The restaurants and bar prices were double for the value received. Do not open the fridge in the room because when you do, if you lift something out of it, they charge you for it even if it is not consumed. Michael the bell captain was instrumental in getting us a spare fridge for our room for no charge when it usually costs $25/day. As far as customer service goes, he was the only one on the property who was the least bit helpful and courteous. I did make a mistake and charge a tiny cup of coffee to the room. $2.41. Upon checkout this bill turned into $9.58. Though they had my signed receipt for the coffee they also had a separate receipt for coffee and a sandwich with no signature that had been charged to the room as well. When I told them it was not mine, they said it didn't matter because it was charged to my room so I had to pay for it. Causing a scene at the desk about this did get me a manager who generally was just a figment of anyone's imagination who finally removed the charge from my tab. The usual time share speech was also a challenge. Most guests received $150 off their bill. They gave me nothing for my two hours. They said because I had purchased a discounted room rate that I was not entitled to a gift because the lower price room was my gift. UNBELIEVABLE. After speaking to 5 people, including showing them the letter saying I would get the gift, I still was told too bad. No gift. They had previously said if I had a letter indicating such, it would be granted. NOT! The lobby bar even at 50% capacity had bartenders who took twenty minutes to ask what they could get us. No smile, no thank you, no \"are you having a good time?\", just.. \"room number?\" Don't waste your vacation time on this poor hotel that doesn't care about it's guests, and only wants your wallet.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta,GA", "Title": "\u201cA lil' slice of Heaven\u201d", "Author": "TerryTy", "ReviewID": "UR45489121", "Content": "My wife and I visited the Gran Melia in Puerto Rico for our 3rd year anniversary. I will keep this as brief as possible, but give good insight by doing a Good and Bad list. Good: marble floors in the bungalows and the main lobby, surrounded by the ocean and less than a 5 minute walk from the beach. We had a garden view, but we could look off our balcony or out the front door and the ocean, so paying for ocean view would have been a waste, the restaurants at the resort are top notch. We had the best Shrimp Alfredo we have ever had at Passion. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, the landscaping is breath-taking, the resort pool is also awesome. Luquillo also has awesome food. Old San Juan is also very cool. We didn't experience the nightlife, due to not being comfortable with the highway signs at night, but will do so next time. A rental car is a must! Drive around to become acclimated more quickly than we did, but by the end of our stay we were fairly comfortable. Bad:during days when the resort is full, parking is very, very, very,very scarce. Tends to rain between 12-3 daily, so hit the pool and the beach at the resort early to be sure you won't be rained out. Drivers generally are very aggressive and have little regard for traffic rules or road courtesy. Beware of gnats on the beach if you are an early riser. I captured some pics of the sunrise over the ocean, but I suffered over 30 bites that still itch after 6 days! Lastly, our room stayed cold(you can't turn it off), so my camcorder and camera would often fog up once taken outside, so allowed 15-30 minutes for your camera equipment to get ready.

The bed was comfy. Our only issue (and it was MINOR) was with housekeeping. We had issues on a few days with getting restocked with toiletries, towels, hand towels, and I think there is a washcloth shortage there (we kept getting hand towels when we asked for washcloths). When we called, they were very responsive on getting us what we needed and had housekeeping there within 5 minutes of calling. I can't comment on the restaurants because we dined at local places (and cheated- BK is EVERYWHERE and a frosty just hit the spot in the humidity). We had no issues with parking (we had an Avis car that we got from the airport but we just said \"Avis\" and they let us in- no fees!) and had a small soft sided cooler that we didn't get questioned on- maybe because it looked more like a tote than a cooler. There was two different areas of beach, neither of them I'd swim off of, but it was nice to wander and see all the little hermit crabs, shells, etc. If you aren't on the main \"beach\" part though, beware of sand fleas and pick up some bug spray. (My legs look like I got attacked by a swarm of mosquitoes and it's almost a week later- and they ITCH!) Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful. We had a bungalow towards the front of the resort so we did not have far to walk, but we were always getting offered rides on the golf carts. We enjoyed our morning coffee watching the iguanas, little lizards, egrets and other wild life, and if you're driving down the road to the hotel at night, watch out for crabs crossing the street! Overall, there was nothing that wasn't fixed to our satisfaction or was totally terrible or worth complaining about. I read everything here and wasn't sure what I was in for, but did know in advance that the food was going to be expensive, they were going to hold money on my card, and that I'd probably have to pay for parking. I travel often for business and pay $25 in Cleveland at the hotel, so I don't think paying for parking is unusual or unheard of. As many others have said- rent a car, it's worth it to have wheels. Just watch out for traffic- it's not like on the mainland at all! Police drive around with their lights on and no sirens, there are a few street names, mostly numbers, and getting good directions is a challenge- \"go down about 6-7 lights, drive by where there's only trees, you'll drive over the road that goes bump bump bump, and you'll see it.\" LOL! And, watch out for the occasional stray dog, cat or chicken in the road... and people trying to sell you water or panhandle. They are brave souls for sure! Other stuff: Coco Sweet at the entrance of the resort road had good pastries and breakfast sandwiches, and very reasonable prices too- pastries were $1, same for juice. We enjoyed a few meals at the kiosks in Luquillo- El Jefe Burger Shack had great burgers, excellent service, and cheap beer! Their cheese sauce is DELISH. We also dined at La Parilla for a nice dinner- their flank steak is incredible with the beans and rice, and my boyfriend really enjoyed his lobster. Fina China on 3 was decent quick Chinese food- no won ton or egg rolls though- it came with fries instead (they were good, just a peculiar combo with fried rice- to me anyway, and they'll even give you fries at Taco Bell) Enjoy the different fruit shakes that you can find just about anywhere- mango, guava, passion fruit, etc. The Camuy caves are pretty cool to check out- it's about a 2 hour ride from the hotel. Other reviews said to call ahead- we tried but got no answer. We were fortunate that they were open. If you can make it to Culebra to check out Flamenco Beach, it's worth the ferry ride (only about 1 hour, 15 min), and at $4.50 round trip, it was very economical. There are little kiosks there too with food that is reasonably priced- some sandwiches, but a lot of fruity frozen drinks, empanadas, pinchos, etc. Take your sunscreen for sure, and it's worth it to rent a chair and umbrella. The rainforest was amazingly beautiful, count on getting rained on- a poncho or umbrella is a good idea. There are a few stores over by Luquillo that specialize in local art- everything from homemade candles and jewelry to beautiful masks- The Carribean Trading Company and Coqui International.

The staff could not be more welcoming, warm, friendly, and accomodating!! We upgraded to the Royal Package upon check-in and we are so glad we did! We had a beautiful, clean, bongalo complete with private pool, balcony with a jacuzzi, continental breakfast, a Butler, and ocean view for the duration of our stay. Our Butler was Angel and we affectionately called him our \"Guardian Angel\". He could not do enough for us and he made sure everyone who serviced us or our room did five star work! We will never forget how attentive he was to our needs and he went above and beyond EVERY day. Insist on Angel if you want the ideal Butler who knows how to make you feel special. The food is quite good but the MUST \"go to\" restaurant is Nami for the Criollo sushi - YUM! We are sushi fans and Nami's sushi was in our top 3 of best ever! On our anniversary we were given complimentary champagne with our dinner as a surprise. Our room was beautiful and our view of the sunsets were breathtaking. We could hear the coquis in all directions. The night sky had so many stars! Iguanas walk the grounds and cranes stroll by the beach! We had fish swim right up to us in the shallow water circling our feet and tickling our toes. The private pool was heaven and our bartender Ricardo made delicious drinks: from the Passion Fruit Mojito to the Puerto Rican Original Pina Colada! There were so many wonderful staff that I hope I can remember them all: Jose, Tony, Glorimar, Madeline, and so many more! Sorry for forgetting anyone! :) An area to see if you go is El Yunque rainforest to swim in the fresh waterfall. If you go to Vieques Island BRING YOUR CAR otherwise you will not have much time to see the beaches on the southside of the island - they are the MOST beautiful. The ferry is so cheap but about an 1 hour ride. Our best time in PR was at the hotel itself - dancing salsa, eating great food, lounging in our cabana, swimming in our private pool, sipping champagne in the jacuzzi while watching the sunset, and enjoying cool tropical drinks with friendly people at the bars. The only things I would say were somewhat negative was paying for daily parking - I never had to do that before. The beach is ok - compared to the others like Hobos in Isabela. It is just ok but still a lovely and relaxing place for ocean lovers. What bothered us most were guests who just seemed to WANT to complain about anything and everything they could as if just to hear themselves talk or whine!! But I guess that just goes to show that money can buy many things except love, happiness, and class. Do yourself a favor visit this hotel. Experience the people of Puerto Rico first-hand.

My husband and I returned from the hotel on Sept. 5, after a wonderful stay, celebrating our anniversary. The grounds and gardens are immaculate, the pools are lovely, the food was exceptional (more about that later), our oceanfront room was gorgeous, and I am hard-pressed to find anything negative about the hotel.

Now, about the food. The morning breakfast at Cafe Soleil was excellent, with any and everything you could possibly want from fresh fruit, to eggs and bacon, to salmon, to a variety of juices and coffee. We ate dinner at the Italian restaurant, called Tempo on the first night, and I had a wonderful risotto dish, while my husband enjoyed the red snapper. But far and away the best meal ever was had at Pasion, a genuine Puerto Rican restaurant on the Gran Melia property, but separately run by Chef Myrta Perez.

We made sure to actually READ OTHER REVIEWS before we booked the trip, so we knew what to expect. Here goes a few FYI's: - Yes, the hotel books a deposit for incidentals. We paid $100 per day, which is reasonable in my mind. - Parking was $16 per day, which we didn't end up paying for some reason; they never asked for our valet slips. - We did NOT upgrade, we had a regular old Joe Schmoe garden view bungalow and it was perfectly fine. In fact, we met a couple who upgraded and saw their room - only difference besides being 20 feet closer to the beach? A flat screen TV. They didn't even use the Royal Service pool because it was way too quiet for them. - We booked a rental car ahead of time (again, weren't charged for parking) and we had NO problems, not even once, exiting and entering the hotel. The \"guards\" waved and barely said a word. - You most certainly can use your credit card at the bars and restaurants at the resort. You have the option to charge to your room, or use your card. - The \"long, desolate, scary, dark, isolated\" walk from the main lobby to the bungalows is probably 1/4 mile at most. It's extremely well lit and there's people walking to and fro constantly. Not to mention, about one golf cart per minute driving by, asking if you need a ride. - If the food's too expensive for your taste at the hotel (we didn't want to spend on every meal), venture off the resort and hit up a fast food place.. there's KFC, Burger King, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, McDonalds, you name it - just like home. ** Things that I would recommend doing while there: - El Yunque Rainforest. And don't pay a dime. We drove our rental all the way through and did our own self guided \"tour\" for free. We got some awesome pictures in front of waterfalls. Don't get swindled unless you need a tour guide and can't do it on your own. - Old San Juan. It's about a 25 minute drive up the highway but so worth it. There's some awesome old forts, and you can take the ferry to the Bacardi Distillery. Cool little bars and restaurants too, and a pretty commercialized area. - Eat at Coco Sweets bakery at the end of the resort road. $2 for the best ham and cheese sandwich you've ever had in your life. - Also check out El Verde bar/restaurant right near the resort.

We wanted to go to somewhere special. When we booked through a discount online vacation company were promised 10 days/ 9nights of pampering and fun from this 5 star resort. When we arrived the resort was beautiful and tropical looking. It's a sprawling resort. If you don't ask for a bungalow/ room near the main building you need to walk quite a bit. We didn't mind the pleasant walk. We also noticed there were many families w/ young children. We are not against kids at all (we have 2 ourselves), we are just saying that if you are expecting a \"couple's only\" resort- you have picked the wrong resort. There is a main building that houses the check-in desk, several restaurants, a shop, large lounge areas with several bars. The main building is surrounded by several smaller buildings/ bungalos, pools, beach and beautifully manicured grounds. One of the highlights of our trip was watching the (several) beautiful iguanas walking around the resort and sunning themselves during the day. They are completely harmless and are very tame creatures. We were able to get pretty close to some of them. Our standard garden style room was larger than we expected- king sized bed, sliders leading to a little patio, larger than normal bathroom and beautiful marble everywhere. As we were unpacking our nightmare began. Our room was without hand and wash towels, no hangers, the tv/ cable was broken and we were missing a coffee maker-coffee items were there on the table. We called the front desk and asked for a supervisor. We explained what was missing and broken. She assurred us that she would take care of immediately. She offered to give us a computer cable free of charge for the trouble we had. The price for renting a cable was only $7.00. Looking back, for what we went though it wasn't worth the free cable! While waiting for someone to take care of our missing/ broken items we went to the beach. The main beach was crowed with families so we walked to an area of the beach that wasn't as crowded but still part of the resort. There were plenty of lounge chairs. However, we were speechless. There was trash/ broken glass every where, a tire tread and plastic cooler sticking out of the sand. When we went back to our room we were greeted by several resort staff asking what was missing/ broken. We told them what was heeded. Someone looked at our tv and said that it was the cable box. So he took it . Someone else came back with a coffee maker however it was broken. Someone else came with several beach towels instead of wash/ hand towels. Someone else came with 3 hangers- that's all they had! You ask why did it take that many people to take care of our issues? We had wondered the same. By late night we were still missing several items and there was no coffee for the morning. That morning I (again) called the front desk, maintenance, and housekeeping asking for our missing/ broken items. We only recieved a working coffee maker and more than enough beach towels. I don't know if they just didn't understand what hand/ wash clothes are or if they just didn't have any to give. Several days and calls later, we gave up asking. We were here for a vacation, we were not going to take time asking (pointlessly) for our items. We were going to do the best with what we had. One of the mornings we were awakened by our fire alarm going off requesting us to leave our room. When we left we saw other guests standing around and asking each other \"whats going on?\". Several minutes pasted the alarm was still sounding and there was not one Gran Melia staff or security person came to address it or to check for our safety. After 30 minutes went by we all decided to go back in our room. Gran Melia staff didn't care or check for our safety so it must have been a false alarm. We were never given an explanation. Each day we kept going to the beach but was very cautious where we walked. As long as we had a lounge chair and our books we were happy. Our meals were nothing fantastic for the price we paid. All the waite staff was always pleasant and helpful. We tried all the restaurants. For breakfast there is only one restaurant open. If you didn't have a vacation deal (we did) which has breakfast free, guests paid $22.00/ PP buffett style. Average dinner meals for two w/ two appetizers, two main meals and non- alcoholic drinks were over $100.00 not including tip. We didn't have any desserts since the main meal was nothing to write home about. For lunch we ate at the grill near the pool. There was one other restuarant if guests wanted to eat in. Lunch for 2 w/out alcoholic drinks and dessert averaged $20 without tip. The restuarant that we were not impressed with and only went once was the Asian restaurant. The chef cooks in front of the guests (which was fun for the kids) and the dishes were all the same but with a choice of meat/ fish. Just before leaving for our plane we were still missing wash/ hand towels- but still had plenty of beach towels! We only had 3 hangers for the two of us, our tv worked but we couldn't watch movies because they took our broken cable box! We have never had such poor service. For issues as simple as ours we couldn't understand why there was not one Gran Melia person or supervisior that could just take the reins and resolve our issues.

The cons to the trip where that the distance between our suite and the lobby was more than a 1/4 mile. While they offer shuttle service 24 hours a day, the shuttles were nowhere to be found. We had to rush out for check out at 12 pm, lugging our luggage for the 1/4 mile. The food is extremely expensive, a burger for $16???? Parking for $15.00. They do put a $150 hold on your card so be prepared. My suggestion would be to bring in food to the suite or visit local restaurants rather than pay the expensive food.

The Gran Melia really blew us away once we arrived. It's a gorgeous resort. Very spacious with lots of privacy, the rooms are huge weather its a RS room or a regular room.

Our entire stay was perfect! We only had one bad experience with our room on the first day we arrived. After taking a short nap we discovered our room was filled with water from a leak in the ceiling. We called the front desk immediately after almost breaking my neck on the floor, they claimed a plumber was on the way but never showed up. We waited 30 minutes and finally decided to make a huge stink. We were unable to reach the bathroom or door because the puddle kept getting larger. Extremely slippery on marble floors. Thank goodness they upgraded our room to the Royal Service with beach front view to make up for the inconvenience. I thought the 30 min wait was ridiculous on their part. Being part of the RS you can take advantage of the happy hour from 6-7 @ the Avenue Bar,free contential breakfast, however, if you want anything \"HOT\" its $7 pp. We definitely enjoyed the perks of the RS. Cons: $16 a day parking fee, dirty main pool, $150 a day hold on your credit card, coco beach is not really a beach, no fridge in the room..just a mini-bar, ice machine was far from the rooms, avoid the Melia Vaction Club presentation, they should incorporate bar service out by the beach.

Upon my arrival, I had to wait 20 minutes on line to check in. My 4-year old daughter was getting restless. The hotel is beautiful. There was always sweet smell of candles in the main lobby area. On that same night, I got really upset when none of the bartenders in the main lobby area would ask me what I wanted to drink. I was waiting there for about 10-15 minutes trying to get their attention; it was like I was invisible. I understand they were very busy, but if someone is standing at the bar, it would have been nice for 1 of the 4 bartenders to ask, \"What would you like sir?\" I got upset and went to my room. There were moving a little slow too. Don't get me wrong this is a really nice hotel. It's their House Keeping Service that is of very poor quality. Let me give you a couple of examples: (1) We had to call for House Keeping to clean the room and make up the beds on all 3 days ( we were there for only 4 nights) I was there. On 2 days of our call, we were suprised that it was alreay going on 5:30PM in the evening at House Keeping did not arrive. (2) House Keeping ran out of clean towels. (3) On my last night, I called for an extra blanket and sheets, I had to wait almost an hour and a half for those items. When they finally came, they only brought the sheets and not the blanket. I ask the gentleman where is the blanket, he said they did have any available. What a mess for a supposedly 5-star hotel. The travel agent told me when I was booking that the Gran Melia is a 5-Star. This is certainly not a 5-star hotel. I would rate it has a possible 3 and half. If this was a 5-star, they would not have had any of these horrible house keeping issues or service. (4) A day after I check out of the hotel, I called House Keeping about my weight training gloves I had left in our room somewhere. They took my number and said they would send someone to find them and then they would give me a call. At this point, I have already left Puerto Rico and back at home in NY, and have yet to hear from House Keeping. After all, they had a lot of issues. I guess they kept my gloves as a souvenir. I guess they got me back for the everyday reminders for House Keeping to clean our room and make-up our beds (lol).", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio Grande", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon gift\u201d", "Author": "Honeymoongift", "ReviewID": "UR35861945", "Content": "July 24,2009 Was the worst experience for my daughter and husband.

I originally had the pleasure of staying at the Gran Melia in Cancun several years ago and was so impressed by the resort, that I have decided to stay at different Melia's across the country. I have been to four different Melia resorts so far, including Gran Melia in Panama, and by far the Gran Melia in Puerto Rico has been the worst experience ever. I have told all my friends and family not to stay there and am in the process of writing a formal complaint letter to the Corporate offices and upper management. From the moment we arrived, we were checked into a room that was dirty, and charged for all the items in the minibar, just for merely opening the fridge and taking a look. The pre-arranged, pre-paid!! hotel-sponsored airport transportation (Dragonfly) was an hour late for our transportation back to the airport once we checked out, almost making us miss the flight back, and on top of all that, the hotel makes you leave a $150/day deposit to cover \"incidentals\". We proceeded to pay cash for our expenses upon check out and the hotel still processed the hold on our credit card!! Unbelievable. The staff is very apologetic for \"any inconveniences\" we may have had, but very dismissive as well and no-one accepts responsibility for their errors. This experience has been the worst ever and as such I will not be traveling back to Puerto Rico.

We were very impressed with the staff, grounds (complete with iguanas and hammocks - very tropical), decor, lighting, etc. The difference is in the details. Hard to find a flaw anywhere!! The rooms are very nice, clean, spacious, and have the most comfortable beds ever. The housekeeping staff was, well I almost hate to say it but they were prefect. Hotel staff drive around the grounds all day on golf carts and will pick you up along the path and take you where you need to go. Everyone is quite friendly and helpful. Especially Mark in the RS Concierge lounge! We were so relaxed and spoiled here and enjoyed the resort so much that we never even went to the rain forest! Whoops! Important tip: Upgrade to Royal Service!! This was SO worth the extra money. Mainly, you get your own lounge with internet so you don't have to wait for all the kids in the main lobby to get off the computers, you get breakfast each morning, bathrobes, free drinks from 6-9pm at the bar, and MOST importantly (okay, along with the free drinks), you get use of the exclusive pool that is clean, quiet, adult only(!), has it's own bar, and has free Bali beds!! CONS(?): I had to work hard to come up with any \"cons\". It really was a superb stay! 1. If you do not have a car, you will be 'stuck' eating in the expensive hotel restaurants and not being able to sight see very easily. The car rental place within the Melia charges much higher rates than if you rent in Fajardo or San Juan but is quite convenient. 2. Unlike the in-room coffee, the coffee they serve at the Cafe is horrible. Tastes charred like Starbucks. We started bringing our in-room coffee to breakfast with us! 3. There is very little nightlife. There is a bar there that has a DJ (and bar lounge beds :), but not really any dancing to speak of, and no nightclub at all. 4. Since they sell timeshares (oops, not timeshares - Vacation Club), most staff you engage in conversation will eventually ask you to go to one of the meetings. They say it takes 90 minutes but count on twice that. 5. The beach/ocean is rocky but honestly we did not care at all since the pool was so lovely and we had already done our beach activities elsewhere in Puerto Rico. 6. Although the main lagoon pool is very pretty and has the submersed chaise lounges and swim-up bar, it was loud with children and (after July 4 weekend anyway) was disgustingly dirty. We opted for the adult only pool which was wonderful. PS. PapiHenry's review suggest that those of us that did have a good experience may not have been to a nice resort in Punta Cana.

The resort was absolutely beautiful, and we found everyone on the staff, from the bellmen, the front desk, housekeeping, and parking valets to be extremely friendly and accomodating. Our room was spotless upon check in and housekeeping kept it that way during our entire stay. Angel and Richard at the Royal Service pool were fantastic. The resort is a very easy drive from the airport (about 30 minutes) on a modern highway. Renting a car at the airport is definitely advised, as the resort sits by itself a considerable distance off the main highway. However, there is a large road sign right before the exit which points you in the right direction. Several beautiful beaches are within a 15 minute drive, and many excellent local restaurants are nearby as well. There is a beautiful golf course on the grounds. The resort has a number of pools: the very large main pool has a swim up bar and a good poolside restaurant. The prices are what one would expect to pay at a beach side resort. The adults only Royal Service pool has wonderful cabanas that you can reserve for a day or your entire stay, as well as a personalized \"butler\" (Angel) and a very likeable bartender (Richard). There is a pool attached to the spa, as well as other pools adjacent to each block of rooms. We did not use the Spa services while we were there, but I did use the workout room on several occasions. It is extremely well equipped with modern equipment. In addition to the pool side restaurant, there are 4 restaurants on site, as well as room service. We found the food to be decent, but not memorable. However, since we spent most of our time exploring the island, we were seldom at the resort at meal time. As I said above, there are numerous excellent local restaurants in the towns of Rio Grande (where the resort is located), Luquillo (15 minutes away), and Fajardo (avbout 30 minutes away). In addition, there is a wonderful fresh bakery at the turnoff to go to the resort. It is truly one of the best bakeries I have ever encountered. Best of all, they bake all day.

After a lot of research I picked this place because: 1.It was off the beaten path. (so if you complain about no nightlife or excitement, next time do some research as it is clearly not a party spot) 2. The accomodations and the pool. (if you were interested in a nice swimming beach see 1) We rented from enteprise went without a hitch, My GPS was acting funny but it worked well. (previous tip is true they give great directions) it's about 30 minutes max to the hotel from the rental company (take route 66 and pay the 1.50!- you save a few headaches on RTE3) Check in was flawless, about 10 minutes, I asked for my upgrade as I am a melia member, none were satisfactory for walking distance so we kept the orginal room. We were taken to the room quickly and were at the pool in no time. We did hit the store and brought back food. Mind you we were RESPECTFUL of the fact that they did not want us flaunting the fact we ad food and beer so we kept it in a beach bag. We came back the room was musty. We went to Luisa and asked to have it fixed, and by the time we finished dinner we came back in and the room still was not up to par, and the refrig was not working. I asked for my upgrade and was given another room. My wife packed up and I headed over to the room to check it out and there was the bellman with the new refrig and on the phone as the room was a pigstye! The manager called me direct and aplogized immediatley, yes I was a bit upset but within 1/2 hour we were moved into a beach front Royal Suite room. ( Mind you I did not ask for this, just a new room for my family) It was a wonderful room, we received all the amenities that the room called for, breakfast,jacuzzi on the patio and 3 hour happy our at the avenue bar. They truly went out of their way. The rest of the week we enjoyed food at all the restaraunts and also saw the sights.

The food is no more than20-30 per plate, lunch-10 bucks for burger and fries thats about right? 2. Rent a Car 3. I paid for parking 2 days as a couple guards hassled me, just pick up the ticket and wave to them and drive out. 4. Your on vacation yes they put a 200 hold on your card. oh well! 5. On a rainy day we went on the tour as my wife and I have considered a vacation property, we were treated well (lunh and drinks) and received quite the bonus in Melia Money which helped. 6. The people are wonderful, your on their island, just relax. If you are looking for a wild time, don't go there. I spent 4 months working over 100 plus hours per week. I needed the peace and tranqulity of this place. Its not yet a 5 star, but well on it's way! I will recommend this to friends and family and will consider heading back next year.

I am of course happy to illustrate with examples. Firstly, the staff is not polite. Nicole at the front counter would simply ignore point blank questions time and again,and seemed extremely distracted by some paper work and the telephone. Secondly, they issue you a 'towel card' which you must use to exchange for a beach towel. I am not thrilled about this concept in general, particularly at a \"4-star\" hotel, but I suppose if crime is a problem, then preventive measures such as this must be enacted. The receptionist brusquely informed me that I could get the towels at the pool, however, when I reached the pool, there wasn't actually anyone with towels. After circumnavigating the pool entirely I was able to ask the bartender who informed me that the towel master went off duty at 5pm, and so I had to return to the reception desk (I'm not lazy, but it is a bit of an unpleasant trek when in beach attire), where I waited in line for 20 minutes and was finally issued a beach towel, after which point my evening swim became a pitch dark night time float. Next-up, there are stern warning signs indicating that \"NO OUTSIDE FOOD OR DRINK IS ALLOWED\" etc. Presumably this is nothing more than an extortionary business practice meant to drive guests to the myriad of hotels which all look very much like they are from the Orange County mall. I was a bit afraid to even bring my bottle of water in as I wanted to avoid an antagonistic conversation with one of the many disheveled security guards loping about. Speaking of extortion, the parking situation is nothing more than insulting. You pay x hundreds of dollars for a room to pass the evening, only to find a surprise bonus $15 parking fee. Worse yet, the gate-keepers of the parking lot seemed to have a difficult time understanding that I would be coming and going several times throughout the evening, and every time I passed their way, I had to have a 5-minute conversation about what I was doing. These gentleman were also far from polite. Poor business practices aside here are some other things you can look forward to. The less than satisfactory: 1. Stained bed sheets 2. Mosquitos in your room (I had several, one tore into me like Cerebus himself for all 6 hours I was able to sleep) 3. Exposed and scary / cruddy looking circuit box in the room 4. Weird muddy looking marks in the bath tub. 5. The beach past the water line is very seaweedy, the corresponding slime which many ocean-critters call home. In the 3 minutes I was in the water, i almost stepped on what I think was a sting ray (although to be fair, mine is an untrained eye, and I got only the briefest of glimpses as it flitted away) which immediately predicated my return to dry land. 6. The hotel seemed to be entirely abandoned. My best estimate would be that of the however many hundred rooms they have, perhaps 10-20 were occupied. It was a bit eerie. 7. The have a good looking excercise room with totally respectable equipment. I started to use the stepper thing and turned on the television, but all of the channels were fuzz, and got bored rather quickly and gave up. 8. The majority of the people in the area, both at the beach and using hotel facilities (including the pool) seemed to be not guests but local residents. 9. No free internet, on top of all of the other money they have seen fit to remove from your possession, they want 10 dollars a day to use their wireless. The good: 1.The pool is pretty nice, its quite warm and largish, although very shallow (never more than 5.7 I think) 2. The air conditioning in the room works rather well 3. They provide you with a copy of the paper in the morning (Although I would prefer the Times to their selection The Wall Street Journal) although this morning when I checked out at 9am, they didn't have any.

With that in mind, check -in was quick and painless. We arrived on a late flight, so we were the only guests at the time. The casino did not serve food, and room service had stopped being served due to the late hour, so they offered to send a box lunch to our room for $10. It never arrived, oh well. We looked forward to breakfast. We had a garden view room with a nice balcony. The room was large, clean, and had a wonderful bed. The bathroom was large also. We did not even open the bar since we knew that removing any item for even a short length of time would result in it being charged to our room. There is a sticker on the bar that indicates this, so no one should be surprised when they receive their bill. I enjoyed walking from our room to the pool and bar and restaurant areas, but older people or handicapped persons may not like this aspect of the resort. The walkways are very busy with laundry carts, room service buggies and golf carts full of guests being driven to and fro. Our room was not close to any of the above, so we ended up walking quite a bit to get to the car park to leave. We enjoyed swimming in the large pool, and had no trouble finding chairs with an umbrella. We used the swim-up bar once, and charged the costs to our room rather than carrying money around in our swim suits. The jacuzzi areas located within the pool are not hot, but the same temperature as the pool itself. I'm not sure why they have these areas. We had rented a car at the airport in San Juan, so we traveled outside of the resort for our meals. We tried Coco Sweets, the small pastry shop at the turn off to the Gran Melia that many of the TripAdvisors contributors had recommended. They have a large assortment of pastries and donuts, and also sell plate lunches, and sandwiches and cold drinks. I tried a Cubano sandwich, and found it quite tasty and a good buy for about $5.00. The plate lunches had traditional Puerto Rican food, and would be a good alternative to spending a lot of money at the restaurants at the hotel. We also tried the restaurant Tierra Madre that is on Carr. 3 very close to the resort, and although the service was friendly and quick, I found the food not so good. Several of the other guests mentioned to us that they had been picked up and driven to Richie's Restaurant, so we decided to try this on our own since we had a car. This is where I tried mofongo, and my husband had the skirt steak. The food was expensive and we were not impressed. The view was very pretty though, which is why I think people like this restaurant. Parking became very crowded at the hotel on Thursday and Friday, and there was an increase in the number of guests. We were able to grab a parking space every evening, but just barely, and people were beginning to double park. My recommendation is to definitely rent a car if you are traveling to the Gran Melia. You will be bored out of your skull without one, and will pay a fortune for food. The construction at the JW Marriott was sporadic due to the rain we received off and on all week. The sound of the construction can be heard from the rooms at the Gran Melia, but it did not bother us to any great extent. We kept our doors closed and the air conditioning running at all times and were not bothered with any excessive noise from it. The grounds at the Gran Melia are beautiful and well kept. We saw many iguanas, birds, ducks and lizards scurrying around. In addition, there are all sorts of beautiful plants and flowers. Bougainvillas of all colors are planted everywhere, along with plumeria, oleanders, and plants I was unfamiliar with. It was lovely! I chose the Gran Melia based on it's location in Rio Grande. We planned on visiting El Yunque, the beach at Luquillo, the town of Fajardo and driving to the Caribbean side of the island to check out those beaches also. The Gran Melia was a great base of operations for all of these.

The ONLY place that was some what reasonable to eat at on this resort was the pool bar which had hamburgers and salads for around $9-12 the food was good but drinks were pretty expensive. We had rented a car thanks to a previous reccomendation on this site we saw and it was the best decision we made! If you go to this resort you NEED to rent a car, unless you want to spend $20 a plate even on a small breakfast! It was easy to get around much like in the States so that wasnt a problem! The pool was beautiful but we sadly had bad weather the entire time we were there. I think we had one sunny day and the rest rained almost the enitre day. We heard many different times were the rainy season but I suggest not going in May! The service was pretty unfriendly. We had a couple problems and it was hard to find help. We stayed in the villas which were AMAZING but we had a very odd room! It made very loud banging sounds in the vents and pipes waking us up repeatedly throughout the night the entire stay. We didnt complain but we heard of a couple (in the room next to us) got moved due to the loud banging. To use the phone to call out of the resort costs money i believe $1 which wasnt too bad. When we went to use the voucher they had lost our previous tab so we told them what was on it and they took it so we didnt think there was a problem. When we went to check out though we realized first they hadnt taken off the voucher, and second we had an extra $20 charge we know we didnt have. We went to the front desk and told them even giving them proof that we were offered the $50 voucher they said they would have someone call which never happened. When my friend called them she tried for over an hour and they wouldnt give us the voucher back! We are college students who couldnt afford much but we still made sure to be generous and tiped the maid and the bell boys and the servers but in the end got screwed over by the resort.

If you are young like the three of us I wouldnt suggest this resort. There werent any activities focused on our age group at all and there just simply werent enough to do unless you had a car to leave the resort (the age to rent a car in puerto rico was 21 not 25 like in the states).

I noticed that roughly $75.00 that I left on the night stand was missing. I assumed that they thought that it was a tip, but reported it anyway. We were told to fill out a report, but to no avail. a couple of days later, when my wife went to take her Navigator out of the safe, the safe wouldn't open. We realized that we essentially reset the combination, then it opened. The $1,000.00 in cash that she left inside her Navigator case was GONE!!!!! we once again filled out a report, and were told that their insurance company would cover the loss. Since we were still going to venture out to the beautiful island of Puerto Rico, we were told by the head of security that we should stop back at the resort before going to the airport, and they would take care of the problem. They also told us that someone would be contacting us in a few days, but this never happened. When we went out of our way to return to the resort, Security tried to discourage us from reporting the incident to the police, telling us that it would take about 5 hours for the police to show up. We decided to gas up the rental car, and get dinner. Within a half hour their security department called our cell phone, and reprimanded us for not being there. I decided to drive to the local police department, and file the report there. The officer on duty was not at all surprised to hear of our theft, as he said that it has happened before.

Compared to other resorts we have been to, this was on par. The weather was warm and it only rained twice in our 5 night stay. The leg up that this resort has is that the lobby and grounds are very well maintained, comfortably spaced, clean and beautiful. The grounds are spacious, with areas to stop and sit, and there are palapas and hammocks hidden all over the resort; we spent many afternoons finding a secluded spot to lounge and read or play cards. It was a bit of a walk getting around, and the shuttles were scarce, but there are shady rest spots all around and I don't mind a short walk. The walkways had many maps & signs that indicated distances, and there were unique lizards and birds everywhere, as well. I never felt like I was crowded, except during peak pool times by the pool bar or in the chaises directly by the pool (as could be expected). The focal point of the resort is the pool, as the beach is rocky and not swimmable. I was slightly disappointed in the pool, as other resorts I have been to had more than 1large pool, especially considering there are children at the resort. Unfortunately, the cool nights harkened a soak in a whirlpool since the pool is 24hours - but alas, there wasn't a jacuzzi to be found. Even during the day the pool temp wasn't always comfortable, unless you had been sitting in the sun for a while. All this being said, it was a beautiful pool, they obviously spent a lot of time on the landscaping, and it definitely beat the below 0 temps back home. Back to the beach - it was still nice to wade in if you had swim shoes, and actually further up from the main part of the beach there were beautiful fish. The Rooms - Very nice and not at all outdated. I am a bit of a germaphobe and was alarmed by some unsightly stains in our bathroom, but they were immediately cleaned once we brought it to their attention. We also received several follow-up calls to ensure that we were satisfied with their work. I also had to call because our tub wasn't draining - it turns out - user error - the drains are push button and if you don't push up all the way you will run into this problem. We only ate at the pool bar restaurant, as the others on site were out of our price range and we prefer to sample local fare. Our experiences with that restaurant was good service, but rather pricey. I second(third?) the recommendation to go to CoCo Sweets. Wonderful food, very reasonably priced, great to pick up some beverages to bring back to your room. The Fitness center was adequate, but not exceptional, the cardio machines were really loud. One in our party got a massage, that was nearly twice of what you'd normally pay, but she thoroughly enjoyed it, very relaxing, perfect pampering, it was the highlight of her trip. A few in our party passed some time in the casinos, and won some cash on the slots. Drinks in the lobby bar were extremely expensive, and a couple of the nights we were there the lobby turned into a sad excuse for a nightclub. One night, there were kids running around without their parents in the mix of this soiree, that was a major turnoff for me, but this was just one of the nights, so maybe a fluke? There also seemed to constantly be children on the 2 PCs in the lobby, so the free internet access was not really all that accessible. IMHO, unless $$$$$ is no object, rent a car so you can enjoy the local sights, and you aren't tied to the resort. I personally would have gotten bored of the resort itself if I wasn't out visiting El Yunque, etc. Overall, it is a beautiful resort, tastefully decorated, and I would recommend it for a nice base while you're visiting PR, especially if you can catch a good deal on your stay.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLuxury but very expensive\u201d", "Author": "gdiet", "ReviewID": "UR30314133", "Content": "We stayed here recently it was booked in a hurry as we were supposed to go to Mexico and had to cancel due to the swine flu outbreak.

There are exceptions to this of course but it was just a general feeling I got. I'm Irish so we don't have that tipping culture so mayb that's why I was uncomfortable with it. Dinners at the hotel are outrageously expensive compared to what it is to eat outside the resort. There is also an upselling process going on particularly in the Puerto Rico restaurant.

However, because it was so large, there were plenty of romantic secluded areas. Plus I found the staff to be a wealth of information about other local beaches which were very nice. They were also very helpful about sightseeing excursions either guided or unguided. However, there are four things that you should be warned about: (1) The hotel holds $200 on your credit card for incidentals even if you've prepaid for the room. Then the goal seems to be to do everything possible to keep the $200. I think this cheapens them. (2) Rent a car from the airport. The ride to the hotel is expensive ($60-80 one way!). That alone is worth the $16 daily parking fee. Not to mention the distance from the hotel to the highway -- more than 3 miles. Getting a cab just to the highway can be quite expensive. (3) Eat at the resort only if you are prepared for a limited menu and sticker shock. I wasn't impressed with the food offerings or the prices. Breakfast was especially overpriced. (4) Don't use anything in the armoire if you aren't prepared to pay for it. I removed the scented diffuser only to be billed $45. Let's just run through that one again, $45 for scented oil -- that I couldn't take with me! At least I could drink the other items in the minibar! The staff told me the minibar items are on a sensor which automatically bills your room if you remove any item for more than 5 seconds. Again, I think this cheapens them. I would suggest they at least have a price list for the minibar items. My only complaint was that I had to ask repeatedly for face cloths. They kept bringing hand towels. We did the 90 minute -- or I should say 3 hour (did someone say no pressure?) presentation. The vacation package as presented seemed ok, but I am philosophically opposed to being asked to make a decision of that magnatude (over $40,000) on the spot. Plus some things happened during the presentation that struck us as a bit curious. Our suspicions were confirmed while chatting with another couple who were given a lower price. Why?

The staff was extremely helpful and nice. The housekeeping was on point everyday and the grounds and the lobby on the resort were like something out of a Hollywood movie. AMAZING!! The one thing I noticed people failed to tell it that they charge a $200 hold on your credit card for every night of your stay. Thank God I had $800 on my credit card at the time of check in. (should have been a $1,000 but she only authorized $800.) I cant image how embarrassed I would have been if the funds where not there. So make sure you have $200 on your credit card a night for the length of your stay for incidental fees. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a HOLD and the funds ARE deducted from your available credit from your credit card and put back upon check out. Which leads me to this. The restaurants on the resort are expensive!! We ate at the Nami Asia our first night which the food was really good. Our total came to $99.51 for two people we paid CASH money. When we received our bill at check out the $99.51 that we paid cash for was charged to our room! Thankfully we had our receipt and it was cleared up when we checked out. ( keep all receipts when paying with cash) We order room service for lunch and for a bowl of soup, 10pc wings, and fries the bill came to $45!!! We also ate at Tempo, which was an Italian restaurant I was very disappointed because my pasta tasted like over cooked mush a four-year might have made. The next three nights we went else where. I highly recommend Coco Sweets bakery at the end of the street right before road 3 on the right coming from the resort.. I had a bacon egg and cheese sandwich the size of my arm for only $3. The breakfast at the resort is $20 per person so $40 for two people to eat breakfast?? I think not! The only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153affordable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd eats are at the wet bar by the pool. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow you to bring in outside food to your room but we did anyways.. Stocked with a cooler for our juice, water, and liquor. By the way they sell liquor at the gas stations! WOW The pool was amazing and they swim up bar \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6lets just say I want one in my backyard. The bartender was soo nice he gave me complementary shots because it was my birthday..gotta love that! Also a rental car is a must\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the resort is about 30mins from the airport and once you turn on Coco Beach road it sits way back the road. For transportation to and from the airport its $40 per person each way so that would have been $160 for the both of us, but I reserves a rental car for $90 bucks for 5 days at Hertz. The beach is defiantly not impressive, but we caught a 1.5 hour ride on a ferry to the island of Culebra where the beach was amazing. We also did an hour of horseback riding, which is about a 10 min drive from the resort. For all the shop alcoholics ladies, such as myself please take the drive down to old San Juan and skip over all the outlet on Road 3. They have the most amazing shops, jewelry, clothes, shoes ever and really affordable! Theres a Coach factory outlet, store there too.You will be in heaven down there!

We got a good deal through agreeing to go to a 90 minute time share presentation. It was not high pressure and we were out of there in 90 minutes. The resort is beautiful! We stayed in a 2 story villa with about 12 rooms in it. There were many of these villas, The rooms were large and nicely decorated. For us the service was very good but we do not expect to be waited on like some people do One day the maid forgot to give us new bath towels, but we didn't bother to tell them because we didn't feel we needed them. If you rent a car, which I would recommend unless you want to stay at the resort the whole time, the parking is about $15 a day. We did not eat at the resort because we read that it is very expensive and we wanted to try out some local restaurants. We had fun eating at Kiosks scattered along some of the roads and other places recommended to us by some of the staff. A good very inexpensive bakery at the end of the resort road came in handy for sandwiches and pastries. We saw a lot and learned about the culture by driving around. We rented from Enterprise for $187 a week . The resort was at a good location for us. We went to Fajardo t(about 30 minutes away) to catch the ferry to Culebra and another day to Vieques and there are more stores and restaurants in Fajardo. I t is also very close to the Rain Forest. The beach is a draw back. It was always clean and looked nice than I expected, but don't go there for the beach. The water is shallow and has a grassy plant growing in it. We tried snokeling there but didn't see much. It is nice to walk along the beach, but you may want to wear flip flops if you're right at the edge of the water- quite a few stones. The pool is very large and beautiful. It has a swim up bar and several more shallow areas with benches and jets shooting out water. There are built in chaise lounge type chairs in the water to relax on. Looking one way, in the distance you can see the rain forest which always has a foggy look over it and the other way you see palm trees and ocean. Beautiful !!! We didn't spend much time at either the beach or the pool because we were out and about exploring the island, I cannot comment on the restaurants because we did not eat there oncel They have golf carts to pick you up and take you around the beautifully planted grounds. We got a room close to everything so we usually walked. The resort lobby is totally open with lots of water with fountains and at night there are candles everywhere. There are 4 computers with high speed internet in the lobby to use, but they were not always working and it was hard to get on them in the evening. Some people would stay on them a long time. That was the only frustration we had at the resort.. We were extremely happy at this resort, but we did get it at a very good price and probably would not have been able to stay there if it were not for the time share presentation (Puertoricostation.com is where we signed up for it..

I am the spouse of the business person, so while he was in a meeting, the most work I did was get out of bed and walk to the pool! I, too, was concerned after reading some of these reviews. I don't think these people stayed at the same place! The resort is wonderful. It's very large, but walkable, and golf carts are around to drive you from the main building to your room. I felt safe the entire time -- even when I walked alone, at night, along the beach. Here are a few tips that I hope will help you: Tip 1: Upgrade to the Royal Service; ours was included in our corporate event. There is a separate check-in behind glass doors. This room also has computers for RS guests. The RS pool is a good size and adults only. There is a bar and room service is available. The cabana beds (I don't know the correct term) are free for RS guests at the RS pool ($50 per day at the large pool). Tip 2: In the RS package (can't say about the standard), you are given one pool towel card per person. This card has a $30 value. If you go to the large pool, you have to give the attendant your card in order to get a towel. Once you return the towel you get your card back. This automatically kicks in the $30 charge on your bill, so be sure to return the cards to the front desk at check-out to be credited the $30 per card. Tip 3: Avoid room service; it's expensive (but what room service isn't?). The RS pool orders from room service, so keep in mind that the pricing is the same. \"Wet\" - the restaurant/swim-up bar at the large pool has a limited menu, but the food is good and reasonable. Tip 4: If you need anything, call Angel. He is what customer service is all about. Always there and always working. Tip 5: Do not keep your room key near your cell phone. This does erase the magnetic strip. I had to replace mine three times before I found out about the cell phone. Tip 6: Avis is the rental car company, so if you think you'll want a car, rent it before you arrive. You can do it there, but you may get a better rate booking from home. Tip 7: This resort is \"out there.\" It's about 30 minutes or so from the SJU airport. The ride is not bad, but traffic can be hellacious. The driving is pretty bad -- no directional use, lots of weaving, etc. Be careful if you drive. Tip 8: Be sure to go for a night swim in the large pool. It's huge and gorgeous. There are 5 jacuzzis in the large pool (not hot tubs). Tip 9: Don't touch anything in your room's mini-bar without checking the prices! If the item is removed for more than 30 seconds (could be 15), you're automatically charged. $3 for a candy bar is a lot to pay to look at the calorie content. Tip 10: Bring a book if you plan on reading, because the gift shop doesn't have a wide selection. I think it only had 3 books. You'll read reviews on here about the construction -- new construction is at the entrance to the resort and is not near the guest quarters. It's not a white, sandy beach, but you can walk in the water. Hope this review helps! I'd return to this location in a heartbeat.

The pool and the rooms are great too. The service, however, leaves a bit to be desired. The staff, on a whole, is very nice and tries to be accommodating and is very pleasant. The problem, we think, lies with management. We got to the hotel at about 1:30pm and asked for an early check-in if possible. We were told that the room was ready and need to be inspected, so there shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem. At 3:30pm we were finally told that we could go to our rooms. We had some small situations, which needed attention; the only problem was getting someone to answer the phone. We had to try many times before someone would answer. Once they did everything got straightened out and the staff was very pleasant. I needed something, so I went to the front desk, at 10:30am, and no one was there. There were a few people waiting to check-in and we all waited a good 10 minutes before anyone came to the desk. I find that very strange for a resort with such a good rating. What we also found strange was the restaurants. There were only three and the Japanese and Italian were closed on alternate days, which left only two. There was no place to get a little snack or a quick bite for the children, except for the swim up bar which closed a 6pm. We all had a nice time and got a lot of exercise walking since our building was pretty far from the pool and restaurants. That is not a complaint. You can ride in a golf cart if you choose to. When we got home and after we paid our bills, we found an additional charge on our credit card. It was from 4 days before we checked out and a evening we were not on the premises. Maybe someone gave our room number by mistake, who knows, anything is possible. I called the resort after I called my credit card company and was told that they would put a credit on my card , after four days I was told that a credit was going to be put thru but it never showed up until my bank gave me an ok on my dispute.

From no soap in the public restroom to taking two days to pickup a roomservice tray from our room, this resort was heavly flawed. The food was way over priced (think Outback steakhouse food at Smith and Wollensky Prices) and whats worse is they couldn't bring the entrees out at the same time dispite being half empty. Forgoten drinks and sides also helped agrivate me. The rooms are very well appointed but our plasma TV was fuzzy so whats the point. The AC duct made a thumping noise but no one came to fix it. There also was never enough towels either; some days we didn't have a hand towel or face cloth? Many problems excist here including no one answering the phone when trying to call for assistance or services. The hotel also nickel and dimes your for everything including parking, poolside cabanas for a measly $50/day, $30/hour for an ocean dingy. There is little to do here other than swim under the blazing sun, golf, or spa. Very boring unless you just absolutly want to do nothing and I mean nothing. Fortunalty they had an onsite AVIS so I and my wife high tailed out of there and made our own fun in Old San Juan, Aricebo and the Rainforest.

The only down fall is that they rotate which restaurant is open and closed on a daily basis. A car does come in handy and they are available at the resort. Ritchie's will pick you up and drop you back at the resort (free) and the food is fantastic, also try La Parilla in Loquillo at the Kiosks. Don't' be afraid of the iguanas, there everywhere. The 14 year old said she was getting married there and asked if they have a university so she could go to school there. the 12 year old wants a pool like theirs at home, good luck. I grew up on the west coast and Texas and I know what a beach is, do not believe any negative things you hear about this beach, It is not a white sandy beach, but I did not see one anywhere near us, except when we went sailing and snorkeling.

We booked two rooms for 3 adults + 2 children and had to be persistent in getting the rooms in the same building, but all was accomplished without anybody being frustrated. We were offered a ride to our car (rental) to get the luggage and they carried everything up to the room. Staff (mostly male) were looking for ways to help with everything, ladies at the counter were more reserved, sometimes short in responses, but polite and efficient. Rooms: great room size, nice beds, all clean, sofa in each room that folds out, serviced well as far as towels, balcony with 2 plastic chairs (but not comfortable enough to sit there). My major complaint is that we could not control the air conditioning in the room, so the fan was going all the time regardless of what setting you put it on (low, med, high) and we could not turn it off. We ended up setting it up to 80 F to avoid freezing us and the kids at night, but it did not help. If you can, ask for a room facing the water, i.e. NOT facing the construction. No matter how far you are from the construction site, the noise will invade the room as soon as you open the balcony door. It was great to enjoy the fresh air and tropical noises (frogs) and look for birds and iguanas during the weekend, but you cannot avoid the big construction noise and view of two cranes. Our other room was facing the other way (facing the water - although we were in the second row of bungalows, so we did not see the water) and it made all the difference. You DO NOT hear any of those noises at the pool, beach, restaurants, garden etc. Refrigerator: we paid $25 for a week for \"refrigerator\". It is a good deal, but do not expect a real thing. It is a small cooler rather then refrigerator and we were able to fit in a couple of yogurts, half gal milk box, half gal juice box, botle of vine and a bottle of water. It kept the milk fresh for the whole week. It is an interesting system that they let you have a cooler, but post a sign that you are not suppose to bring in outside food. We were asked a couple of times to carry the food in a bag/backpack rather then in a plastic bag. Food source: We were not too keen on food available at the resort, mostly due to high prices. Grill by the pool has a wonderful view/location and good food (pool type) - like chicken fingers for kids ~$8, burger ~11. But a bottle of water or a cup of sprite is $3. We did not use the restaurant that serves breakfast, because we did not want to pay $20 per person. They have a corner when you enter the restaurant, that offers coffee and small items. 8oz cup of coffee is $2.50 there. Staff was not very friendly there. We went for Hibachi dinner at the asian restaurant next door and it was OK ($26-32/pp) , but not great. I ordered Daikiri and received strawbery daikiri - sweet mix from the mixing cooler topped off by some rum - no shaking... it was too sweet for me and I just wanted simple daikiri, so I gave it back and was not charged. - I was hoping to get a great mixed drink, since I visited the Bacardi factory/museum in San Juan earlier that week, but they do not do it right. There is a bar at the lobby and really nice places to sit and hang out there, with 4 computers free for all. Mojito there is $10. Food alternatives: got water, milk etc at supermarket \"Amigos\" 10 min away. For ready to eat food: CoCo Sweet Bakery is ~ 3 min by car from the gate to the resort and has rice/bean/meat variations for ~ $6 - very good warm food, pleasant local service. They also have cold and warm sandwiches and the \"bakery\" side of it with all sorts of cakes and white bread. Kioskos is a line of ~ 60 permanent food stands - popular with locals + tourists, but not very atractive to me. Most serve almost identical local food with some exceptions. Local food choices are fried or fried or fried. I loved the \"pinchos\" - meat kebabs on a grill - $2 for piece sold along the road. Beach: not sandy, just thing layers of tiny pieces of shells. Pleasant to walk on, completely empty and beautiful in the morning (7:30 AM). Pool: Fantastic due to its shape, large size, temperature, swim up bar, fountain. Clean and great for relaxing swim.

On a side note the hotel is a good 30mins from anything worth seeing or doing and a rental car a must. Check in was fast and painless, our room was ready and we immediately had someone to take us on one of the golf carts to our room, this was the only time we had a cart immediately available, other times they seemed to be nearly nonexistent...our first day there we found swarms of fire ants on our nightstand between the 2 beds, desks and tables and they continued throughout our stay, our bathroom shower rod was also rusted out, at night the a/c was turned off by the hotel to conserve energy i guess and the fanning system ran so loudly it was hard to sleep. Then, \"the beach\", the waves break about a mile off the shore, the shore is almost all rocks and it was all landscaped to be shaded- absolutely no swimming here and it was pretty much deserted. Parking is 16 a day, but you can get away with paying almost nothing for it b/c they give u tickets to be validated but if you don't take them to be validated no one ever knows you have a car there. Roomservice was outrageously expensive, 2 cheeseburgers and a grilled cheese was 60 bucks and not good, the fries were cold and soggy and the cheeseburgers were tough. The Nami Asian inspired restaurant they had however was very good and priced just like any other hibachi here at home would be about 50 for 2 hibachi dinners. Finally, the staff, while very nice, their English comprehension level was pitiful, i called at one point asking about eye doctors in the area and they said they would send security to my room, i then explained in Spanish my situation and that i needed an optometrist they wanted to send their physician for 150 and said they didn't have info on any services available outside of the hotel area.

They just don't want people rolling in with coolers. I had packed a small soft cooler and we used ice to keep juice and soda cold and although not allowed, we brought it to the pool area in a larger tote bag. We ate at the hotel only three times: breakfast and dinner at the Italian and Asian themed restaurants. Joel at Tempo was the BEST waiter I've ever had (and I go out to eat a lot). He made my younger daughter smile more than any other time during the trip. The prices for dinner were what you will pay at any hotel or higher end restaurant. Breakfast is a bit pricey at $22 for the buffet. As stated in another review stop in at the bakery at the end of the road (Coco Sweet) and get a breakfast sandwich ($2.50 and its huge!). They do not really speak English, so find out how to order before going. Lastly, check out the \"Kioscos\" in Luquillo, about 15 minutes east on 3. It is a line of about 60 food stands. They look like shacks and you might want to pass by based on looks, but don't. We spent a few hours our first day at #8, sitting at the counter talking to the owner who was explaining (and making) his food for us. Everyone we talked to in the area suggested #2 and 9. They are more of a sit-down restaurant than the other stands, offer a higher end product & presentation and a bit more expensive . Actually, #2 prices were comparable to the hotel food. For activities we snorkeled, visited the rain forest, Old San Juan and kayaked in the Bio luminescent bay with Kayak Puerto Rico. The Bio tour was by far the coolest thing we did.

This time, we decided to try a resort, and Gran Melia had cheap rates. It has some good points, a nice pool, a pretty spot, good ocean views and natural beach for splashing and walking (but not swimming), but I wouldn't recommend it. The service at the front desk is unbelievably bad, ranging from merely inept to downright obstructionist. If you want a resort experience, I imagine that El Conquistador or Rio Mar are much better, and if you just want a base of operations, Villa Sevilla is preferable. That said, if you get a super cheap rate and go, here are some suggestions: -Join their MAS program before you go, and bring your number with you. It entitles you to a free room upgrade and buy one get one free breakfast. They will ask you to provide your number numerous times, and act like you are trying to cheat them and are perhaps committing a criminal act, but it's worth it if you ignore the attitude. -Ask for a fridge in your room. It's $25 per week and then you can buy food and drink and store it in the room. If you have to eat at the resort restaurants, go for the pool bar. It's somewhat random when it's open, usually until 6, and sometimes for dinner. For offsite restaurants, try Antojitos Puertoricanos on the Rio Mar road, right after you turn left off of rt. 3. -We loved Las Cabezas de San Juan and El Yunque, and actually had fun snorkeling with the kids on the East Wind catamaran booze cruise. It was mainly families. -Rent a car at the airport. -We forgot to validate our parking tickets at Gran Melia, and they never asked us for the validated tix, so we didn't end up paying for parking. In general, we enjoyed our days in inverse proportion to how much contact we had with front desk staff. Also, the kid's club seemed either non-existent or to consist of one bored teenager. And there's construction all around, so noise is audible from rooms. Ask for a room far from the noise. They'll ask you \"what noise?\" Persist. If you go, game the system, enjoy the pool, eat offsite, and try not to give Gran Melia any more money than you have to, they don't deserve it.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDon't always believe what others say need too experience it your self\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR25056304", "Content": "Hi Like other's almost canacelled my trip to the grande melia due too bad rap and bad feed back.

Check In: Great, wasn't greeted with anything like a cold drink, but it was fast and we got into our room right away. They gave us a tour of the grounds, and the concierge and bellboys were really nice Lobby/Grounds: Were absolutely stunning. Everything about it was fabulous especially the scent! They had these great diffusers throughout that made the place smell so good. Free computer use for everyone...Also-They were pretty good about always having a little cart take you to and from your room if you don't feel like walking. Food: Was REALLY good! I found the specials were always really on par and the fish was nice and fresh. Not a lot of authentic Puerto Rican dishes which was a little disappointing. The ambiance was really nice at the a la carte Restaurants. The buffet was really good and had fresh juices, an omelet stations, fruits, great coffee and all the regular breakfast staples. It is EXTREMELY expensive though! about $40 each! Drinks: Very good, expensive...but very good. Rooms: Beautiful, roomy and BEAUTIFUL marble bathrooms. Stayed in Junior Ocean Suite. Maid Service: Very nice except I encountered one problem which grossed me out. On the first night there I went to get into bed and there were crumbs and hairs under the sheets and bed. I immediately called the front desk and it took about and hour for them to send somebody up! (it was about 11pm when I called) I was really annoyed, but I just let it go. When the maid came she changed the sheets,pillowcases, and entire duvet cover so I was satisfied. Other than that they were very nice and we never ran into them, just came into a clean room! \"Activities\": If you could call it that. I was really excited that they had water sports on site and went down to the shack and decided I would rent a jetski. Both were broken. Okay, I opted for a mini speed boat. Broken. Basically the only things that weren't \"broken\" is what we took, which wound up being a little catamaran and motorized Kayak. The guys taught us how to use them, and off we went. About 200 ft out, We all got stuck out there!! We were yelling for the guys and they were insisting that we were doing something wrong, we weren't! Anyway, after about a half hour of SITTING there. They finally dragged us back to shore, but they were nice enough to refund us, so whatever, not that big of a deal. Gift shop: Nice, not too expensive unless you were buying sunblock! It was $28! LOL stupid me for thinking one spray on can of sunscreen would last me 7 days. Overall, I would suggest this place for young singles, Couples without children, trendy professionals...etc. Would not go there if I had a family.

Two great golf courses also. 4) Ate dinner at both Nami and Tempo restaurants more than once and both had excellent selection, service, and reasonable pricing for that quality of menu.

The night we arrived we said to each other \"wow, look at this place\". The very large pool is really the main attraction, but the whole resort is quite well done, with great landscaping, design, furniture, architecture. We got a room with a kitchen, dining area, and separate bedroom near the main resort building for a pretty great price for a \"5 star\" hotel. However the hotel is not really 5 star. I was not surprised, since I hadn't paid 5-star prices to begin with. The service is nothing special, and there is none of that \"extra\" stuff you expect from a 5-star hotel. The woman at the front desk for checkin was very nice and pleasant, but after that no one stood out as particularly helpful. The room was well done, big, complete kitchen, 2 flat screen tv's, comfortable king bed. However one of the 2 a/c fans would not turn off until i cut the power at the circuit breaker box. After that the a/c worked fine. A light in the shower was out, and was never fixed even though I reported it. One very maddening experience was that we were told on the way to the room by the porter that there were dishes and cooking utensils in the kitchen. He said we could buy groceries and cook if we wanted. So we attempted to do exactly that. As we were walking to our room with groceries, a security guard stopped us and informed us that no outside food was allowed in the rooms for (if I recall correctly) \"security reasons\". When I objected, the guard suggested that I sneak the food in in a suitcase. Rather than argue, I just sneaked the food in. I have no idea what kind of lunatic policy this is, but it wasn't just one rogue guard, the rule was posted on a sign near the main building. I had seen the sign, but thought I must have misunderstood, because the hotel couldn't be that idiotic. I stand corrected. I think the resort tries to keep you eating and drinking their overpriced food as much as possible, which I understand, but to forbid you from cooking in your room, in which they've placed a kitchen and utensils, is unforgivable. The food at the Asian restaurant in the resort was actually quite good. It seemed overpriced at first, but as we travelled around PR, we noticed all the food everywhere was pretty expensive. So no complaints there. The restaurant at the pool was another story. Grossly overpriced, and the staff was completely overwhelmed, even though the pool was not crowded. We had to chase down waiters and bartenders, who were at least polite given their workload. The drinks are definitely overpriced, though, which isn't surprising either. Cheap beers are $5, and I got a very substandard martini at a bar called \"The Martini Bar\" for $10. The beach at the hotel is disappointing. You really can't travel to the Caribbean and spend all your beach time there, it's a waste. It might be nicer than your beaches at home, but there are better beaches here within reasonable driving distance. We wanted to take a ferry to more pristine beaches, but it sold out minutes before we got there. I advise you to buy tickets the day before. I saw other people using the free internet-connected computers, but all of them were non-functional when I tried to use them.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how $$ can be stolen if the safe is used. Room theft is present at any hotel you stay in. I read that one person waited 45 minutes for ice. The hotel is pretty spread out (but no building is more than two stories high\u00e2\u20ac\u201da nice feature), but ice machines are EVERYWHERE. I cannot understand why someone would wait for ice to be delivered, but if they did, 45 minutes would not be out of the question.

It was great. We did not eat at Tempo and I have read some negative reviews. But our neighbors did, and they could not have been more pleased. They got a beef meal (not pasta), and their exact words were: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was so tender, it could have been put on bread and eaten like a sandwich.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We also ate at Passion, a new onsite restaurant, privately owned.

Prices vary by day, room service menu comes and goes, you get charged for tips when you don't even use a service...my list goes on.

The safe is too small to put everything you would need to put into it and then you have to live in fear that someone is going to steal your stuff!

Was the reservation mishandled? Check. Was the staff not immediately accomodating? Check. While we are on the topic of staff... how long does it take to deliver a bucket of ice... if you guessed 45 minutes, you are correct! Personally, I love beach weddings and this one was no different. Except for the fact that at minimum 6 people were robbed during the event. Inside job? Until I hear that someone who was not in attendance of that wedding got fleeced, my mind is made up. And finally, just to give an idea of the ineptitude of the staff, I called 3 times to get a slightly later check out (the line for checking out was probably about 20+ people deep mind you), the first person said, NO, there was someone checking into the room at 3. The second person said sure, pay $150 and stay until 4. The third said 1:30 no charge. All that was in 15 minutes. So if you have taken the time to read this far, my summary is this, the place is beautiful, but it is staffed pathetically. Nothing stays open long enough, and some things aren't open at all.

Having been to Puerto Rico a few times before, and doing my research beforehand I had an unbelievable trip. My husband and I traveled with our son who's 5, and another couple with their son who was 9. We had a garden view room on the first floor....the room was clean and spacious....nothing fancy, but we try not to spend time in our room, after all we are on vacation. Our check in was quick...the room was ready at 1230 when we arrived.. The resort is very expansive, and beautiful....we had no problems getting a ride when we went to the pool, or were going to our car.... the carts were always driving around. Yes rent a car... do it before you leave.....this way you can drive yourself from the airport..Hertz is great, as they have a machine that prints out directions to your resort for you...It was reasonable compared to the resort rental. You need one, as you are trapped otherwise...If you don't mind sitting by a pool all day and doing nothing then it may not matter to you, but just remember if you want local food & some fun...you'll need it. The restaurant we ate at was not that great, but we were in Puerto Rico for local food, so we only ate at the resort one night, as they don't have local cusine. Every morning we went for coffee and an egg/cheese or ham/cheese or danish up the road at the corner bakery. The place is delicious, and the prices can't be beat..If you like coffee this place makes the best I've ever had. There are also the kiosks up the road for dinner, make a left out of the resort road and you'll have to make a u-turn a few miles down, the first one is authentic food, & sits on the ocean....There is also a woman on Sundays that has this little tent set up, where she cooks plantains & chicken...really to die for...$10 for a lunch for three. She is a little after the kiosks... If you need to have food in your room, ask for a fridge in your room, $25 for the week. You can buy what you need and put it in a duffle and bring it thru. Security knows that people with kids or on special diets need stuff, they just aren't allowed to \"see\" it being brought in. There is so much to do.....the rainforest where you can hike down to the waterfall, there is a great little stop half way up on the left, where you can get some more local food, also coco frio..they will stick a straw in a cold coconut for you to drink, then hack it open when you are done, to eat it..There is also a great natural river type place that we went to swim one afternoon off the same road as the rainforest, you park on the road and there are boulders everywhere and fresh water rushing thru...it is cold, but very refreshing & fun.... The best part of our trip was our private island day. Since we knew about the beach at Gran Melia from research beforehand, I found a boat captain online that will drop you on a private island for the day and pick you up later....15 minute boat ride, it was the most gorgeous beach.. quiet...and cost $25 pp for the trip....We picked up sandwiches and packed a styrofoam cooler full of drinks & snacks and made a great day of it.... Overall the resort was in a great location...the pool was nice, the beach was nice for shell collecting and the kids loved all the tiny hermit crabs....The food we'd have to give another try perhaps, but they need some local flavor for sure. We just did our research, planned and made a great trip. We have a trip planned to goto Puerto Rico again this August, but in Dorado where my parents own a place...we hope to return to Gran Melia in 2010. ** If anyone owns a timeshare here feel free to contact me about exchanging...", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, CT", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!

Of all the 4-5 star hotels in Puerto Rico(i checked on sidestep.com) , Gran Melia's price per night was sig. lower than it's website price(we got 800 including taxes on lastminutedeals.com, compared to 1100+ on other sites). I even checked other comparable hotels which, during Christmas, were well above 300+/night for this hotel class. So all in all a great deal! btw, we did not order Royal Service To add to the other reviews listed: Positives: 1. Absolutely beautiful resort landscape and lobby. We've stayed in the Four Seasons Maui which had an awesome lobby where you literally felt the stress go away. Gran Melia's lobby and outstretched gardens, walkways, places to sit +lounge made us feel that way too. 2. Service generally above average- our room was cleaned every day, staff was nice, also our rental car's battery died. the front desk jump started my car within 5 minutes. Golf cart attendants were offering us rides to our room +back 3. There are daily activities that the resort offers--from exercise, to pool volleyball 4. No bed bugs(as other people reported) +short check in time/out 5. Hotel is close to San Juan(recommend visiting old san juan for restaurants) and El Yunque, Vieques island Negatives: 1. It rained a lot when we were there---the bathroom ceiling leaked a bit, but room service took care of that 2. Cafe soleil for lunch way overpriced---almost as expensive as Tempo for dinner 3. Good service from staff, but generally the hotel is understaffed--i think that when Gran Melia took over this hotel, they decided to cut costs in staff(e.g. we saw certain employees working lobby and restaurant; one employee asked us if our room was cleaned---i thought that was a given?) 4. no beach (as mentioned before) but still a relaxing resort Suggestions: 1. This is the hotel for you(vs. those in Isla Verde or other parts of San Juan) if you want a peaceful, relaxing, quiet stay! 2. Take advantage of the numerous activities that hotel offers---but book in advance--e.g. mosquito bay kayaking, el yunque horseback riding, or old san juan 3. other than local food, search out other places to eat in the area---Brass Cactus has 2 locations on rt. 3 . 4.

If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk you must wait for the golf car to pick you up and take you back to the car. They pass by frequently or you can call the front desk and ask them to send someone to pick you up. The hotel also have separate villages, most of them ocean front, that are reserved for the Royal Service category. Meaning you pay more, but they also assign you a personal butler to take care of your every need. These Royal Service villages come with a private outdoor Jacuzzi and you have access to a pool that is also reserved for guests using the Royal Service. The casino is small, but clean. You can drink all you want for free as long as you are playing. No smoking allowed in the casino. Parking is expensive. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe they charge $16.00 a day for self parking or $25.00 for valet parking. I can understand when hotels charge you for parking when they are located in the middle of a mayor city where parking space is scarce, but in this case there was plenty of parking space within the hotel property to justify the charges. On top of that, you must validate your parking ticket every time you leave the hotel. The hotel has three restaurants. One with Italian food, the other with mix American and Caribbean food and the third one is an outdoor restaurant by the pool which opens only during the day (it serves mostly hamburgers, sandwiches and salads). Food in Puerto Rico is expensive compare to other places like Miami. On average, be prepared to pay around $30 per person every time you eat out. The restaurants at the hotels are of course even more expensive. Forget about ordering room services, unless you are willing to pay $15.00 for a hamburger (no fries included). We ate twice at the hotel and the food was decent, but not outstanding. The beach is clean, but the water is not too clear, at least not during this time of the year. Several staff told us there was a huge coral reef in front of the hotel that you can snorkel to, but we did not went into the water because it was way to cold in November. They rent snorkeling equipment at the hotel. Overall, the hotel is beautiful, clean and very well kept. Staffs are friendly and they all speak English and Spanish.

CONS: Nearby construction detracts from the beauty Restaurants are WAAAAAY OVERPRICED!!! Eat out if you can. The local joints are great and won't break the bank. Don Pepe's was one of my faves. You can't bring outside food or drink into your room (HUH!???!?!) The mini-fridge is loaded with their overpriced items. What's the point ?!!?!?! The nearest gas station is a better bet for late night snacks and beer runs. DID I MENTION THE BEDBUGS??? The morning before I was checking out I was nearly eaten alive. When I complained at check out , I was told I'd have to wait at least 1/2 hour to see the \"secretary of health\" and security to file a report. My flight was leaving in two hours, so I had to check out without putting anything down in writing. I called the very next day from home, and was told that since I didn't do it at checkout, I really had no other recourse. A few days later I called again, and was promised that I would be contacted by the necessary parties. I'm still waiting.....

We've stayed in many nice resorts and hotels but we've never stayed in a resort that went so far out of it's way to take advantage of the guests. The illusion of luxury is little more than an overwrought resort experience lacquered over modern-day resort piracy. You begin your sentence with a $35/person shuttle to the resort. You can rent a car in San Juan but they charge you about $15-20 a day to park it. Each group's calculus may differ but we should have rented a car in San Juan. The Avis agency in the actual resort charged me a little over $70 to rent their subcompact for the day. In the end, the resort does everything they can to keep there, preferably running up your bar tab. The food was outrageously overpriced and not very good. Your dinner options include an Asian Fusion, Italian, and a sort of Caribbean themed Cafe. (During our stay one was closed each night) The portions were very small and the dishes, while very artistically plated, were substandard. I asked to see a wine list but was dismayed when A) half the wines were not actually available and B) the rest cost almost as much as my airfare. There's also atmosphere problems- you're not close enough to the ocean, the napkins are disposable, and since there's no casual (or cheaper) place for dinner, half the guests look like bums. Olive Garden or Red Lobster would have been a substantial improvement. The waitstaff was polite, but not very charismatic, helpful, knowledgeable, or experienced. While Gran Melia's grounds get high marks for being immaculate, it has atmosphere problems, too. No actual sand was harmed in the making of the beach. It's rocky, silty, and not great for swimming. A walk at dusk on the beach led us to discover hundreds of tiny hermit crabs which was enough to make my inner naturalist jump for joy. The pool is enormous, which is great, but there's no shade. After seeing the pool at the Rio Mar resort I realized how disappointing the Melia's sun-baked pool was. A hot tub/spa is available for those guests that wish to spend $28 for a one-day spa membership. Gran Melia's lodging sprawls across 16 different multi-room bungalows and a handful of more expensive villas. The rooms themselves are exquisite with marble tile and nice fixtures. The compounds are connected by paths that are adorned by tropical plants, immaculate bermudagrass, and endemic iguanas. (My wife and I found the large iguanas endearing but other guests were a little put off) I liked walking the paths but I grew weary of the golf carts that the staff used, buzzing through and roaring like B-29s while I dove for the bushes. The rooms were nice but there weren't bathrobes or sandals or any of the other sundries you might expect from true \"luxury establishments.\" Our unit's air conditioner only worked 50% of the time but I'm not a real \"A/C-o-phile\" so it didn't bother me that much. I imagine that it was a problem with our room and not with every room. The Casino was a little anemic-.a Casino without craps is like a prom date without a corsage- in bluejeans. Puerto Rico has SO MANY awesome things to do close together that I don't know why I would stay in a resort that penalized you for wanting to get out and see them on your own.

After a busy weekend in Old San Juan, returning to Gran Melia was like a coming home to a private oasis in Paradise... The interior and exterior of the grounds are aromatic and illuminary. Exotic, melodic, up-tempo music fills each of the indoor and outdoor spaces. Our room was beautiful and the bed the most comfortable one we've ever experienced in our lives (coming home to what we thought was a nice bed, was a bit of a disappointment)! Spend the money for the Royal Service Treatment, it pays for itself in spades with a free nightly happy hour from 6-9pm, a private Royal Service Pool, discounted services, and truly amazing, personalized service from the staff. We would specifically like to thank our butlers Manuel and Angel, who were amazing! Manuel took the time to call us on his days off to ensure our side trips were going smoothly and truly, gave us extremely personalized attention. As well, Pedro in the RS Lounge was fantastic, Leslie at the Pool was delightful, and Josh the Manager was always on call. The breakfast buffet is fresh and fantastic, Tempo for dinner was above average. Definitely venture out of the resort for more local flavors. With a rental car (highly recommended) access to all points of interest were quick and easy.

We took a direct flight and we did not have to deal with customs or passports. We booked the Royal Service package and as soon as we landed at the airport the wonderful \"royal service\" treatment began. Our ride to the hotel was easy and our check in was a snap. We were given a ride down a lovely path in a golf cart to our room. Our room was absolutely beautiful. It overlooked the Royal Service pool and the ocean. It was very clean, the bed was very soft and cozy and the best part to me was the sparkling tile floor. I'm not a big fan of rugs in hotel bedrooms. We had breakfast every morning in the cafe and ate dinner at the asian restaurant. All of our meals were delicious. The gym was perfectly sized for a resort. We never had to wait for a machine. I would go for a run out on the grounds-it's about 3.5 to the front gate and back-when I returned a fresh towel and water bottle was waiting for me. Relaxing by the pool on a Bali Bed was one of the highlights of our trip. With our hectic lives back home, I couldn't think of another way to spend our days. The views from the beds were spectacular and the service was fantastic. We would have our lunch there, we were offered a cold towel and Leslie truly knows how to make a delicious pina colada!

Fortunately, I was unable to change my hotel and I am so happy I didn't. First of all, the grounds are phenomenal. Breathtaking. The attention to detail in the architectural and stylistic choices greatly enhanced my experience. The room was large and the views were phenomenal. We were originally put in the wrong room (possibly a sign of the \"poor service\" so many rant about). We were given a garden view when we paid for an ocean view. However, the garden view was amazing (fountains and flowers were everywhere) and when the mistake was brought to the resort's attention, they quickly remedied the problem and sent guys over to move us. The pool was not dirty...it was lovely and the the swim up bar was just awesome. There was a giant chess board set up near the pool too which was great fun. Had a great time at the Casino as well. Gets busy on the weekends. Service: there were definitely some lapses there but it didn't change my overall opinion of the resort. For one, the lapses were more than made up for by the times when the staff went above and beyond the call of duty. As noted above, they put us in the wrong room. Also, they failed to clean our room one day. But on the flip side, the vacation concierge was AWESOME and she gave us great advice and directions for many fun things to do in San Juan. Also, the front desk staff and the golf cart drivers bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of. Food: We ate at the resort only once and were not completely impressed. The decor and service were great but my fillet was severely undercooked and mealy. I told the waitress about it and since I didn't want a replacement, they gave us both desert for free. The pastry place near the resort has an amazing pastrami sandwich and 2 people can eat for about 10 bucks. Also Ritchies restaurant will pick you up at the resort and take you up to their place for dinner which was cool. Beach: Sure, the beach is not a swimming beach but there is a swimming beach nearby which the vacation concierge will not only tell you about but they gave us pre-printed directions and then proceeded to personally explain how to get there. Check in/out: Since we checked in at 10 pm on a Wednesday, there was no line nor a wait. I would suggest checking on on off hours/days if possible because the front desk did tend to be understaffed. For check out, they placed our room charges under our door the morning we were checking out and if we agreed with the charges, all we had to do was sign and drop off the paper with the concierge. So check out took about 5 seconds. There was a long line though for people who, for whatever reason were not doing express checkout. Things I wish were different: Paying for parking for residents. This can get expensive and its really offputting especially since you REALLY need a RENTAL CAR if you're going to be staying at the Gran Melia. Overall, it really was the \"paradise\" experience that was advertised.

Our plane landed just before Hurricane Omar was to arrive. We rented our car and took off towards the hotel. The traffic was slow because of the rain and the traffic lights. Route 3 has a lot of traffic lights. It took us 1 1/2 hours to get to the hotel, but on the return trip only 45 minutes. The hotel was on shortened staff because of the hurricane, but still we got into our room, which was very nice, very quickly. We were told that most of the restaurants were closing early and that the casino would not be open that night. That was understandable. The next day, the staff was at full force and little by little all the services returned. The pool was clean even after the hurricane. The beach was not, unfortunately. But after a few days, the water cleared up. But a lot of coral, so if you need to go in the ocean, bring water shoes. I heard that Trump is going to clean it up, but who knows when. The beds around the pool are great. We paid $50. for 2 days. It was well worth it. Comfortable, cool and shady. They do have a lot of lounge chairs and umbrellas around the pool, but eventually the sun gets to you. The restaurants are OK. We ate Asian one night, not that expensive, Italian another night, not that expensive, (NY prices) The cafe which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner cost more. They have buffets for breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was $15. for continental, which included anything cold, and the regular buffet was $22.00. Not worth it unless you had a very big appetite. Check it out and judge for yourself. We never ate dinner there. It didn't look like it was worth it. We ate one night at Riches, which was a restaurant that would come and pick you up and bring you back. They had a mixture Puerto Rican or American food, so you could enjoy anything you wanted. The view was magnifcent. Bring your camera. If you have a car and want to experience some real PR cuisine, go left on Rt. 3 towards Luquillo. You will see a sign that says Kiosks. Exit on the right and make a left turn under the highway and then another left turn and go into where the Kiosks are. There are numerous food establishments that sell local food. The first place was really good. Well, that is all I can say. The hotel was great, even the casino. We won, but then put it back, but the odds were better here than in the other casinos we played at.

Don't book this hotel -- you have been warned. First of all, they are understaffed. I'm not looking to be waited on hand-and- foot, but you have to wait in line for everything. Did I tell you there wasn't a beach? The water is very cloudy and almost dirty there. One mile away they have a great public beach....they won't tell you that there though. To stop me from ranting I will just include bullet points: - There are no waiters, you have to wait in line to get anything. Wait in line to get a hamburger from the pool bar. You have to wait in line to get a drink at any bar and by the way, they are doing you a favor to get you a drink. Tip them and they don't move any faster (I tipped one waiter $50 -- keep your tip). - The place is very spread out and therefore, once in a while you want to take a shuttle service (e.g., forgot the sunscreen) back to your room. Forget it. The shuttle service is random and almost non- existent. It may be a 8 minute walk to just get to the pool -- don't forget anything!! - We had to wait in line even at the buffet restuarant! The food was OK and sometimes very good. That was one plus. Don't get the steaks - -they are very tough. - The check-in took two hours. We wanted a couple of rooms next to eachother, but we got rooms with our party located in opposite sides of the resort. I called multiple times to confirm we would be next to our friends during check-in. Didn't happen and the staff didn't care. - Don't take the hotel shuttle to the airport. They charge you way too much for this trip. They don't tell you the price and in fact, they act like the shuttle service is free to use. Use a taxi van and you will save yourself at least $100 for a party of four. - The water toys at the hotel are almost useless because the hotel is located on a shelf that has a break reef about 100 yards from the shore. Nobody can pass this breaker wall and therefore, you are stuck in mucky water that is shallow and full of leaves and seaweed -- let alone the rocks that hurt our kids feet and mine. - The beds were soft..huge plus for an island hotel. This was a postive surprise. However, back to the staffing -- the cleaning help barely cleaned your room. They would change the sheets and that was about it. They wouldn't even sweep, or move your shoes, to sweep under them. Overall, the staff takes on the management's attitude. I never complained to the management once, but I heard multiple parties that did call them and complained about the above items. You can join them and go to this hotel, or learn the hard way.

Where shall I begin? We went there on our honeymoon, and booked a beachfront Jr Suite. When we arrived it took almost an hour to check in and we were told no beach front rooms were available, but they would make up for it in other ways...which we never saw. We were carted to our room, and looked out the window to a construction site where they were drilling, and had a very large crane, great view, great noises. No calming sounds of the waves, instead the pounding of the equipment all day long. On the first night there we decided to eat at the Asian \"inspired\" restaurant. I ordered the blackened tuna, and my husband had the seabass. The food was flavorless, and my Mai Tai all of ten ounces was 10$. We charged it to our room,( I figured since they already put $900 on my credit card I may as well use it) and there was a spot for tip on the receipt. Our bill was 60, so I left a 12 tip. I signed for $72. Little did I know they were going to add a 17% tip to what I paid I was unaware of. Make sure you check your charges on your room before checking out, we were charged double for some meals. The BEST AFFORDABLE place to eat is the kiosks on Hwy 3 towards Luquillo. Five bucks for a full authentic meal, we went to them afraid no one would speak english, and we ended up staying there for three hours, the one guy that worked there was from Chicago, the other from Florida. They told us places we definatly should visit, and places that weren't touristy. We wanted to steal the guy from Chicago!! Luckily we rented a car, this is a must, driving isn't THAT bad, just be prepared to run red lights!! On our way back to Gran Melia we stopped at Amigo's grocery and bought some groceries and liquer. When we arrived back at resort, one guard stopped us he didn't speak english, so he found someone who did. This guy gave us a ride to our room, and told us to make sure if we bring anything back to hide it, what they don't see is fine. The internet computers set up in lobby rarely worked, I figured them out and was helping people every time I went down there. Make sure that you validate your parking ticket every time before you leave which takes ten minutes, that is if you even get a parking ticket when you enter, it's broke half of the time. On monday, I went back to the front desk and they were able to move us to a beachfront suite. Much nicer, this is what I was expecting! The pool: Yes it was amazing, but the pool bar closes at six, stops making food at 530, but is the cheapest food at the place, the burger was HUGE and great. The pool, beautiful as it was had a layer floating around the edge which was quite disgusting. What else... Make sure to buy bugspray, they eat the newbies alive!!! This resort was a beautiful thing to look at, but that is where it ended. I would never stay at a place like it again. We had a good deal through CheapCarribean, but the resort made up for it in anything else you did. A few years back they had the music awards there, and according to one of our guides, he said the stars were complaining about how expensive it was, and how they wouldn't let them leave.

I read reviews on this site before we left - some of them were so terrible, it made me a little nervous about the trip. However, we decided to go with an open mind and come to our own conclusions and were very glad we did. Every person we encountered in P.R. (from the airport, to the resort, tour guides & locals) was so friendly and helpful. We arrived at the resort at dusk and were greated with beautiful music, candlelight, a frangrance wafting on the breeze, and the sounds of water fountains and the ocean waves. It instantly begged us to relax. Check-in was a breeze and despite not getting the room upgrade that we were promised from cheapcaribbean.com, our room still had a view of the ocean and it was beautiful. The bell staff was happy to zip us around on their golf carts wherever we wanted to go, all we had to do was flag one down or pick up the phone and ask. The restaurants on site seem to alternate being opened, so we never got to try Nami. However, we ate at Tempo twice and loved it! The food was terrific and the prices were very average with what we would pay for a normal dinner out in Columbus ($12-25/plate). The Wet Bar at the pool was also great - the angus burgers and chicken sandwiches were delicious and in the $10 range. We never ate breakfast at the resort (we packed some cereal bars), but we did get pastries a few times from the bakery at the end of the main road from the resort - they were delicious and very inexpensive! We had dinner one night at La Parrilla (about 10 minutes from the resort) at the recommendation of someone at the resort - it was great local food, but it was actually more expensive than our meals at the resort. We had booked day trips (tours) to El Yunque (it is much more HIKING, than the leisurely stroll that the travel brochure suggests - but really beautiful!), and Old San Juan/Bacardi (you get free drinks at Bacardi!). After we arrived, at the suggestion of the concierge, we also decided to do a day trip to the island of Culebra and were so glad we did. We went on a Monday, the ferry ride was only $2.25/person, Flamengo Beach was GORGEOUS (crystal clear water in 5 shades of blue) and we almost had the whole thing to ourselves (we had not been forewarned about the mosquitos though and are still itching). Due to the weird ferry schedule, we took a plane back from Culebra to Fajardo - it was a beautiful 10 minute ride and only $35/person. Well worth it! We only rented a car for 1 day that we were there, and Avis is on-site at the resort. It's $65/day, but if you book it in advance online, it is less. Also, there is no charge for parking if you have one of their rental cars. We could have probably saved money by renting a car instead of taking the \"tours\" the first two days, but in the end, we also had a tour guide that was full of all kinds of stories, information, and tips - he also gave us all the ice cold bottled water that we could drink, which probably saved us a good $30 each day! Plus, we didn't have to deal with directions and navigating the traffic. The Gran Melia is about 40 minutes from San Juan, so if you are looking for hopping night life, you'll have a little drive. Also the beach at the resort is not really swim-friendly, but I prefer swimming in a pool anyways, and the beach was still great to walk on. Just be careful about picking up shells, cause some do contain hermit crabs as I later discovered. The weather when we went was perfect - mid 80's every day. It would rain for a few minutes at least once a day, but by the time you turned around it would stop and the sun would be shining again. Sometimes in the mornings or evenings it would be humid - so much so that the camera lens would fog up. We had such a terrific vacation - it was a great mix of getting out & about and seeing Puerto Rico, and just relaxing in the tropics. We would definitely go again!", "Date": "October 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tegucigalpa, Honduras", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful facility, services lacking\u201d", "Author": "velvetstar2", "ReviewID": "UR20737104", "Content": "This was a good deal for the hotel & flight bargain that I booked through cheapcarribean.com I went on a view of the vacation club with my husband.

My only issues with this place were the fact that I had to keep asking for clean towels and wash cloths.

Also on my last night there, housekeeping did not clean the room at all nor replace any of the toiletries. Twice during my week stay, the room was not cleaned. The food was not that amazing either. Room service food was horrible. There is a sign saying that you are not allowed to bring in outside food so if you purchased some local delicacies, you have to hide them in your bag to avoid being stopped by security. When I checked out, I signed the room bill with all of the charges. For some reason, after I got home, an additional charge was added to my credit card. The facilities are beautiful. I like the feel of being away from the action but close enough. I liked having a room in a far away bungalow. The restaurants were ok but way over priced and left us feeling hungry.

We had considered other hotels (Inter-Continental, Ritz-Carlton, Rio Mar, Marriott, and El Conquistador) but in the end we decided we didn't want to stay in San Juan, we didn't want a large property, and we wanted to be close to El Yunque. I read all the reviews as I always do when we travel and I know that you can't always please everyone. I myself am hard to please and can usually find something that isn't up to par however, not this time. Roundtrip airport transportation was included in our package and we were met by a very nice young lady (sorry I misplaced her name) as soon as we came down the escalator by baggage claim and we were at the hotel within 25 minutes courtesy of our driver Cesar. We were introduced to our Butler Hector who told us not worry about anything anymore and we were led to the Royal Service Lounge for check-in and offered cold drinks. Check-in went smoothly thanks to the ladies of the RS lounge, Veronica, Omyra, Sara, and Angelica (I know I've forgotten one or two more names...sorry!) who were always friendly, gracious and helpful. We arrived early and our rooms weren't quite ready so we went to lunch and by 2:30PM, Hector was giving us a tour of the resort on the way to Bungalow #18, when he left he gave us his cell# and said to call if we needed anything! We both reserved Ocean Front Royal Service Junior Suite rooms and although we thought a ground level room would be good either Omyra or Veronica suggested the second level for more privacy with the Jacuzzi on the balcony and we were so glad they did! Our room was exactly as pictured on the website with the canopy over the bed, large bathroom (huge shower with great water pressure and drainage) with plenty of towels and bath amenities, big balcony with 2 person Jacuzzi and a fabulous view of the ocean. Before dinner we had a few drinks in the RS lounge (our rooms were really warm but the RS staff said they would take care of it and by the time we returned to our room that night our rooms were much cooler and we never had another problem with the air). We had dinner at Nami, the Asian restaurant, and we all had a delicious meal and was surprised when the bill came considering some reviews stating that it was expensive, we thought it was quite reasonably! Nami is actually like 4 restautants in one; Hibachi, Sushi. Teppanyaki, and then outdoor dining over the water, we ate there a few times and it felt like a different place each time. We also ate at Tempo and loved it (also reasonably priced). The resorts open-air lobby is beautiful with floral arrangements everywhere, lots of comfortable sitting areas, and a really cool bar, The Avenue, with lounges and palapas. Very relaxing, exotic music is played all day and night, and at night candles are lit everywhere, the grounds are beautiful and are constantly being tended to by the staff. The main pool is huge with lounge chairs partially submerged in the water, a swim-up bar, jacuzzi's in the middle of the pool, plenty of lounge chairs, and palapas (Bali beds) that can be had for the day for a fee. The casino is on the small side but that wasn't an issue with any of us. One afternoon while the guys went kayaking, we went to the Spa, our Butler Manuel made the arrangements. I had the \"Rain Forest Body Glow Scrub\" with Yadira, followed by more down time in the spa jacuzzi and pool, it was fabulous! Continental breakfast was included as part of the RS package however, if you wanted the full buffet breakfast it was just an additional $7, we thought it was well worth it. The restaurant's host - Angel, was always friendly and helpful, the staff were attentive and always smiling, and Gregorio the Chef prepared the best waffles, cheesey potatoes, and various Puerto Rican specialties each morning. When we go on vacation I always try to get a deep soaking tub to bubble bath in, my daily life is so busy I rarely have the time to luxuriate in a bathtub so I was really looking forward to our balcony jacuzzi. You can't imagine how thrilled I was when we came back after dinner that first night and my husband called me out on the balcony, it was the best bubble bath/jacuzzi I ever had for no less than 5 reasons . I could describe it but I would rather you go and be surprised yourself, many thanks to our fabulous Butler Mario who made me a wonderful jacuzzi almost night! We loved the RS pool which is exclusively for RS guests (no kids). The pool has it's own bar, is surrounded by palapas, and played soothing music, we loved it so much we stayed all day even having lunch there. Sergio and Leslie were perfect and took great care of us: we loved the cold, scented towels, they were so refreshing, it was heaven! One day we rented a car (thanks Gina, hope your Mom is well!) and went to El Yunque, the light house in Fajardo, and Luquillo. We had a great time, the rain forest was beautiful, went to the tower, hiked to the waterfall and swam in the pool underneath it! The beach at Luquillo was very nice but we thought the beach at the Hotel was just as good. Yes- it was rocky, yes there was grass in the water but it didn't matter, we loved the beach and we found a lot of beautiful shells there (just be sure there aren't any hermit crabs in them). Many thanks also to our Butlers Angel and Marco you made us feel special while we were your guests! Also the Housekeeping staff were great, our room was always clean and taken care of in a timely manner. I think you really have to know what you want or can reasonable expect, in order to be happy with what you get. We loved the two story bungalows, the beautiful grounds, friendly staff, delicious food, relaxing atmosphere, and the RS treatment was so worth it, I would never book this hotel group again without it !

However, it's definitely not as bad as others have mentioned. One caveat - we were there during the low season, and the resort was virtually empty. A rental car is an absolute must if you're staying there - there's nothing within walking distance but a golf course. Location: The resort is located about 20 miles east of the airport, on a little peninsula. The location is great if you want to go to San Juan (30 min), rain forest (15 min), Fajardo (30 min) - as long as you have a car. Finding the hotel: It's so new, GPS (or Google Maps) does not have it's street address, however, as you take Route 3 east from San Juan, there's a huge sign pointing to the hotel. Parking: Parking is not free, and on weekend night there are a lot of locals who come to the casino, but we never had problems finding a spot (or parking right alongside the drive if there were no spots). Check-in: There were two employees checking people in, and it took us all of 5 minutes to check in. The do put a hold of $150 a night on your credit card as a safety deposit - never seen this anywhere else. We asked for a room close to the main area and parking, and were placed in bungalow 16 - a 100 yard walk from the pool and very close to the main area and parking. The room: Very nice - roomy, marble floors, nice furniture and art, decently comfortable beds. All rooms have private balconies or patios (depending on the floor). The only issue was the towels - it seemed that every day we had one less than before, and they did not replace the hand towels at all - just took the dirty ones away... Resort amenities: The only amenities we used were the pool - nice and clean, the gym - it's super hot in there - no A/C it seems, the casino - has an ok selection of machines from 5c to $1 and several tables, and the beach - full of seaweed as it is a nature preserve... Food: Restaurants at the resort are expensive as many reviewers have pointed out, so we had to fend for ourselves. For breakfast and lunch - go to Coco Sweets Bakery - it's at the intersection of the road that leads to the resort and Route 3. Wonderful staff, 70 cents for a cup of excellent coffee, $4 sandwiches, and great pastries. For dinner - if you want real Puerto Rican food and ambiance - go to Liquillo Beach - you can see a long strip of shops along Route 3 a few miles east of the resort - these are all bars/restaurants. They may not look like much, but the food is out of this world and it's cheap. Go to the last one (#60) for the best seafood on the island - try their whole red snapper. Staff: Most of them were very nice and friendly - especially security guards by the bungalo area - their job is so boring, they like to chat with guests - they are a great source of local info. The guest concierge desk staff were also helpful - they have info and directions for most local attractions. Conclusion: A nice hotel if little things don't bother you.

It's an American territory - most signs are english or easy spanish, roads nothing different than lots of other places. 2)Get used to the idea of bugs - there are even cockroaches-it's the tropics! Bring some Deet -ingredient bug juice if the biting ones particularly like you! 3) Appreciate that this is a travel experience, it's not going to be what you have at home - or else, why travel? We are a family of four - with two late-teen daughters. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and a daughter going off to college. We looked forward to a place away from the \"Waikiki of San Juan\" party environment. We found that the resort is lovely - and although far away from most everything - we enjoyed the peaceful, lovely atmosphere. TRANSPORTATION We had rented a car, because 1) in doing the research, including these reviews, the fees for the transportation to and from the resort to the airport were as much - or more than - renting a car for a week!! This was a great decision , EXCEPT that the DAILY FEES for parking were NOT DISCLOSED TO US IN ADVANCE ,by the resort or Travelocity, and this added an unpleasant surprise of an unbudgeted expense for a week! (unless we had used AVIS - they have an office at the resort -and rental charges probably include those fees) 2) Also, the car allowed us to explore on our own; the east end of the island offers quite alot of activities! (the rainforest is great and so close, the luminescent kayak trip is \"work\" but SO worth it, and several swimming beaches close by) and we could get our own food - good & cheap restaurants nearby on the hiway or in other towns - instead of paying the exorbitant prices at the resort! And we could go into San Juan when we wanted (*take the toll road - for $1.50 TOLL it saves MANY slow miles of stop light travel) We did eat one dinner at the resort @Asian restaurant $20.00 - 45.00 pp range, very good and 'gourmet -type (small delicious portions)but very $$$$! Also the breakfast buffet there $25.00 pp / $16.00 for continental(=no hot food) ROOMS: The resort was not particularly busy the last 2 weeks of August, but we still were relegated to the units farthest away from everything (bungalow 7) we figured it had to do with booking through a discount broker, although they denied it. The rooms were great; the musty, tropical air is what you find in the caribbean- it's very much expected. AND bugs of all kinds are also tropical, I doubt there were bed bugs(claimed by another reviewer) -because I didn't get bit, but my husband did- and he always gets bit wherever we are) more likely it was \"no-see-ums\" that are everywhere in the tropics in the late summer ! If you want exterminated and sanitized accomodations - stay in the 30th floor of a high rise american hotel! I did object to the fridge- apparently electronically controlled (ie: they know when you pick something up) filled to the brim with outrageously priced waters & booze (& no room for your stuff) and the candy tray -out on top -with equally exhorbitant prices $5.00 for a .75 cent candy bar. The walk was pleasant when we did walk to the main pool, sometimes hot if it was a muggy day, but sometimes breezy! The golf cart transportation was fairly regular and the staff running the carts were very attentive - or possibly it had more to do with having two cute blonde young ladies with us! The pool was great -almost too warm- and since we live in Calif, we were not looking for A Beach like we have, (again, we read the reviews) we were satisfied with the wonderful snorkle beach they have and the many colorful fish we saw!!

But here are the true things that you need to know about the hotel. 1 - the rooms are entirely too far away from the amenities, you'll have to walk back and forth to access any and everything on the grounds, there were supposed to be carts running every 5 minutes but we never saw any. And calling the front desk was a joke. 2 - there is no beach on the grounds... although the resort is surrounded by the ocean the water is not really suited for swimming seaweed, and other growing organisms will discourage you from doing so. 3- there is nothing to do in the area for miles...so you're better off renting a car so that you can drive if you plan on doing anything off of the resort. 4- the restaurants are overpriced and not that great of quality. 5 - the main pool is just nasty! Looking at the \"stuff\" floating around the family pool turned my stomach and with so many children and babies in the pool there's no telling what that foamy \"stuff\" was. There are two other pools on the property one which is only accessible to Royal Service guests and the other for people who choose to indulge in spa services. We were stopped from entering both of these pools although no one was actually in them 6- BED BUGS! The morning after our first night I noticed that I had several bites on my back...thinking that they were mosquito bites I went to stock up on the Off. The next morning a few more bites...it wasn't until the plane ride home with I noticed the strange looking bites on my feet and ankles and realized just what they were.

The pool was large, with a swimup bar/restaurant...that was pretty nice. The room was nice, but lacked a view.

It is fthe first thing that comes to the mind when I think about my stay in the Gran Meli\u00c3\u00a1. I was in this hotel from the 8/21 to the 8/24. The reservation was done with two months of anticipation. It is really hard for me to think that such a beautiful and elegant hotel has been of such deception for me. Next I will summarize and expose my points of view having used this order: Value, Hotel and Facilities, Front Desk/Activities/check in /check out. A little about me, I was born in Puerto Rico. I have been living in Philadelphia, PA for more than 18 years. I studied in LaSalle University. I travel constantly inside and outside the USA. I consider that the value by money of the hotel is absurd due to the reasons that I will expose ahead. The right price by stayed in this hotel should be $70-$95, not more. The hotel does not work as four stars rather work as two stars top. Moreover, 80% of the employees have a lack of courtesy and respect towards the guests. The facilities are gorgeous, elegant and clean with an enormous swimming pool that is opened 24/7. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable you can accommodate up to four adults and you can request to prepare the sofa bed for you if you needed. The rooms are far from Front Desk. The resort has golf carts that run throughout the grounds to transport you to and from your room every 5 minutes. I do not recommend using the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s towels they are dirty and stained. Bring your own towels. The rooms are equipped with a ridiculous electronic candy bar right under the TV set. This potentially will ruin you vacation if you brings kids, the prices are extreme. The resort is near the ocean but, you cannot swim in the beach. There are so many rocks and, seaweed on the beach that make it impossible to swim on it. You cannot use the beach volleyball court because the sand is very hard. I assure you that if you fall on it they have to take you to the hospital with big lacerations. The restaurants are expensive and there is no restaurant with a Puerto Rican flavor. There is an absurd parking fee of $16.05 per night. The resort never told me about it until I arrived. This, I consider is a robbery and a disrespect to the guests that not only have to pay this fee but, to make matters worse a 22% of tax or IVU, whatever. Let talk about check in; when I arrived to the resort an employee made me wait 45 minutes for the check in, first she did not find it in the list since I am member of MAS and soon she requested to me to be seated while she resolve the situation. After 45 minutes and feeling that they forgot me I decided to look for another person in Front Desk. I decided to look for another person in Front Desk. I finally found an excellent employee Jose, who helped me. In the Front Desk most of them are rude and slow with the exception of Jose. We decided to stay at the Gran Melia because we wanted to relax and stay away from all the action. I have to say the Gran Melia ruined my wished vacations planned with months of anticipation because they never informed to me about one of the worse event I have never seen \"Heineken Fantasy Island\" The hotel made me spend an horrible day WHERE Not only they restricted the entrance to the main swimming pool but, in addition, they constantly harassed with stupid questions. The security of this event was very rude, and constantly obstructed the flow and freedom to walk inside the resort. In the event djs and singers were constantly using obscene words. Do not take kids to the resorts if you know the resort will held an event. The swimming pool could not be used because not only was full to the top also were people drinking, smoking and apparently some of them making sexual things the Djs constantly found it funny. The security never acted on the matter; they were worried only for wrist bands. A Lots of drunken people. In that night the only thing that matter to security was to received money for the event and drinks, not to the security of the hotel, nor of the guests. In less than 30 minutes I observed to leave drunk and unconscious with paramedics to more than 2 persons. The check out was long. It took me over two hours to check out. Most of the time they only had 1 representative working and there were a lot of people in line. In conclusion: Thursday and Friday were excellent days of relaxation and enjoys outside the mishaps with Front Desk. Saturday and Sunday were the most horrible of my life. I strongly believe that the hotel must warn everybody in case of any event or celebration where they would limit the use of the facilities. The best thing of the resort is the physical beauty. Unfortunately, I cannot say that I will be returning to this resort.", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "4", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cBad experience all around\u201d", "Author": "WebGirlUsa", "ReviewID": "UR19718735", "Content": "I just returned from this resort with my family.

We were originally going to stay at the Ritz but my wife changed plans at the last minute for what she perceived to be a better deal of comparable quality. We participated in the Royal Service option that the hotel offers and did spend considerably less than we would have at the Ritz, but this hotel is currently a 3-star at best. To follow up on some of the earlier comments, the place is really beautiful. The grounds are well maintained and all of the buildings and interiors are for the most part quite stylish. A couple of big points though: 1. There really is no beach. A line of boulders skirt the waters edge to prevent erosion and at a few points there is about 10-20 feet of rocky sand. If a nice beach is a part of your ideal Caribbean experience, do not book here, you will be disappointed. If you call and ask the hotel if they have a beach they will dutifully say 'yes' and technically speaking they aren't lying. However, buyer beware. For a hotel with 500+ rooms, you will see maybe 0-10 people actually in the ocean or on the beach at any point in time. This is a pool-centric hotel. 2. The food is marginal at best. The breakfast buffet is very standard and unimpressive. Lunches and room service are limited and basic. We ate at the Italian restaurant and the Japanese restaurant and had mixed experiences. The Japanese place served a great lobster meal but my wife ordered the sea bass and was sick by the time she got back to the room. We both had the filet at the Italian place and it was good. Not great, but good. The dinner buffet cost $35 per person and was basic cafeteria-style fare. In short, one way they are able to charge less here is by skimping on the food. 3. Royal Service. Josh, the manager, and his staff go out of their way to try and take care of you. If you aren't happy, tell them, they will try to fix it. If you have an issue with your room or anything else, let them know and they will do their best. For example, the hotel hosted an enormous Heineken music festival last Saturday that was open to the public. The place was filled with 18-25 year old kids and had the feeling of an all-day rave with loud music, drunk parties and delays for everything in the hotel. Not at all what we expected, wanted or even knew about. We complained and Josh made sure we were credited appropriately on our bill. End of story. The Royal Service staff does try hard. The best example of the Royal Service attitude is Leslie who works at the Royal Service pool (separate from the main pool with no kids allowed). He is a ROCKSTAR! He anticipates what you might want and brings it. He remembers what you ordered the previous day and has it waiting for you when you arrive. If everyone at the hotel was as solid as Leslie, the reputation of this place would skyrocket. Another worthy mention is Pedro who serves drinks in the Royal Service lounge at night during the cocktail hour. He is another one who anticipates needs, remembers favorites and doesn't wait to be asked, he just takes care of things. And finally, we hired a nanny recommended by the hotel named Evelyn. She was awesome with our 10-month old son, always showed up on time (or early), was very reasonably priced and even bought him a small frog toy stuffed animal as a parting gift. I highly recommend her if you need a babysitter. These people literally salvaged what could have been a negative experience. It seemed to me like the hotel is still trying to figure out what it wants to be. It's not an all-inclusive, but has much of the same cheesiness and cheap feel of one. On the other hand, the spa, hotel facilities and Royal Service options are decent values. When we were there, a famous ex-NBA basketball player was also staying there so the place can attract a good clientele and does have potential. In my opinion, if you are going to the Gran Melia, DEFINITELY go the Royal Service route and don't have lofty expectations.", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny ny", "Title": "\u201cehhh...if u want to RELAX and SLEEP, this is the place for u\u201d", "Author": "phillychic928", "ReviewID": "UR19348550", "Content": "+ i am a vaca club member so i had a villa, it was beautiful and HUGE..however the sofa bed for my daughter was heinous, held together by white ties, no sheets, no blankets.. + maid service made the beds but thats it.. + if u like to party THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR U, we arrived @ 9pm (flight delays), had to rush to dinner and then we wanted to unwind with a few drinks and last call was at 1130p...THEN there was electrical work going on so we had NO cable and the property was DARK...we had no choice but to sleep.. + remotely located and taxi's are $$$$$..so your stuck on property unless ur willing to rent a car or pay out the nose for a taxi to take u god knows where.. + if you are a beach person DO NOT COME here either, the beach is lousy, and i never ever saw the activity person or anyone in the \"ocean\" + staff was helpful but nothing earth shattering + italian restaurant was great and cost was average, better than eating at teh pool bar...i would never PAY the addtl all inclu cost though + landscaping RIGHT by my window at 7am, i literally jumped out of bed to an employee at my bedroom window, i was furious and let him have it..", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cThe Bad Prevails\u201d", "Author": "frmorris", "ReviewID": "UR19220471", "Content": "My best friend and I returned last week from staying at the Gran Melia Puerto Rico for 8 days (August 7th \u00e2\u20ac\u201c August 14th). We are 2 single females that travel very often. We decided to stay at the Gran Melia because we wanted to relax and be away from all the action. We were very mindful that we were supposed to be at a 4 stars resort (SO NOT) and we were willing to pay the extra. I am one who does not mind paying extra if I am getting good service and besides I was on vacation. Then on the other hand, I am one that believes that if you provide poor service, then you WILL NOT get my money or business. You definitely want to get a rental car because there is nothing else around for several miles. The resort knows this therefore they overcharge for a lot of things. I think some things were reasonable, but others were ridiculous. For example, do not book tours through the resort, you will definitely overpay. If you get a rental car you can drive through the rainforest free of charge on your own. Also, do not pay to go into the Rainforest Center. There is nothing there and they are only going to send you back out to the main road onto your journey. Get directions and a map from the resort free of charge. LOCATION/TRANSPORTATION: The resort is 45 minutes away from the airport. Gran Melia Puerto Rico offers transportation to/from the airport for $30 one way/per person. Our package included transportation to the airport. However, we had to find our own transportation back to the airport. This was not a problem because we made a rental car reservation before we left home. We were able to pick our car up from Avis at the resort and return it to the airport when we left. This was such a great idea because if you wait until you get to the resort to rent a car, the price more than doubles. We paid $30/day for a subcompact car. Cars at Avis rental at the resort starts off at $59.99. The price goes up $10 additional for every car size you go up (ex. Compact $69.99). Parking is free if you rent your car from Avis at the resort, otherwise, you will have to pay $16.05 a day for parking. We were not schedule to pick up our car until the 3rd day there. When I arrived to pick the car up, the representative told me that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have my car available, however, she had a deal for me. She told me that she was giving me an upgrade to a midsize car at no additional charge but I would have to clean it and accept it dirty. She continued to state how they did not have anyone to clean the cars. She explained that she was the only one working and they send the employees home at noon that are suppose to clean the cars. I told her that I did not want a dirty car or a midsize. I explained to her how my car was reserved far in advance and I did not want a midsize car with the price of gas. After going back and forth for a few minutes, she reached in the box and gave me the keys to a clean subcompact car. Then she stated that she would just tell the next customer that the person never returned the car they were supposed to have. CHECK IN: When we arrived at the resort we were told that our rooms were not ready, but it would be in 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes turned into at least 40 minutes. Once we arrived in our room (#1111), we found it to be everything, but ready. Neither bed had comforters; all the sheets and pillowcases were stained; my bed had little black things in it; under the sink in the bathroom, housekeeping swept trash in the corner; the bathtub was filthy; there were only 3 towels, no washcloths or hand towels. I called the front desk and someone came within 30 minutes. I took pictures, so I have proof of these things. They switched us to another room with no problem. When we arrived in our new room (#1323), we had some of the same problems. The tub was dirty, the sheets and pillowcases were stained, 3 towels, no washcloths or hand towels. However, this room did have comforters on the beds, but they were stained as well. It took 3 calls to the front desk and 2 \u00c2\u00bd hours to get someone to come to the room. Lernie, Housekeeping Manager finally arrived with an assistant. I wish I had a video camera because they were putting sheets and pillowcases on and ripping them back off like no other. I cannot tell you how many times they did this. Everything they were putting on the bed was stained. I come to realize that they do wash the linen, but whatever they are using to wash them does not work for stains. We had the same problem with the towels and wash cloths. Eventually, we were able to get clean linen and towels. My advice is to definitely bring your own wash cloth and towel. For our inconvenience, Lernie was able to get us free breakfast the next morning. I would like to say that Lernie was great and he was 1 of the very few that really tried to satisfy the customer. FOOD/RESTAURANTS: We ate breakfast the next morning at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Soleil. The cost is $23.95/person for the buffet. Here you can get omelets freshly made, pancakes, waffles, coffee, bagels, etc. I am so glad that we did not pay for it. I do not feel that it is worth $23.95. It should be half this price. Not because of what they offer but because of the quality of the food. I found the cook to be rude, but our waitress was very nice. We were told that our names would be in the system for free breakfast, but when we arrived it was not. After eating we had to wait at least 45 minutes for this issue to be resolved. We ate at the Wet Pool Bar and Grill twice for lunch. There is an employee by the name of Jay who was great, excellent customer service. Jay gave us a list of nice restaurants to go to with great food. The first day we ordered the Monterey Jack Chicken Sandwich with French fries. This meal cost $9 at the Wet Pool Bar and Grill which closes at 6 pm, but if you order it for room service, it cost $17. The first day it was wonderful; so wonderful that we went back the next day and ordered it again. The second day we decided to sit down at the pool bar and order. Unfortunately, this time it was terrible. Not only was the food terrible but so was the customer service. They were not busy, but we still had to flag down the bartender who barely understood English to place our order. There was a female employee just standing there on the cell phone. The waiter got both of our orders wrong and did not bother to ask if we wanted anything to drink. We decided that we would not give the resort any more of our money and decided not to eat at Nami or Tempo. However, we did look at the menu. I found Nami to be reasonably price, but Tempo was overpriced. We did not have this problem, but we saw that several people did, the resort ban you from bringing outside food in. They have security guards at the gate that will not allow you to bring in food. However, you can get around this by putting it in a suitcase or backpack. This really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense we they have rooms that have stoves, refrigerators, microwaves, etc. Why would you have these appliances in your rooms, but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow your guest to bring in outside food? RESORT/ POOL/BEACH: The resort was very clean, well manicured, and ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. The resort has golf carts that run throughout the grounds to transport you to and from your room. I know some people complained about being able to get a ride, but we never had a problem. The pool was just as beautiful as the resort grounds as well as the lobby. Surrounding the pool are some cabanas that you can rent for $50/day or $100/day for VIP service. Unfortunately, I cannot say I feel the same way about the beach as I do about the grounds and pool. The beach is a completely different story. I have travel all over and never seen a beach look like this. It is not clean. Rocks, boulders, seaweed, and trash were all along the beach. You can barely fit a lounge chair on the beach to enjoy the ocean. You cannot swim in the ocean because of there are so many rocks, seaweed, etc. ROOM/ROYAL SERVICE: We had a nice garden view room. From our room you could see a pond and fountain. The room had a safe (free of charge), small refrigerator, and was stocked with candy bars, candles, wine, etc. However, there is a fee for these things. Like I stated earlier, some things are overpriced. The cost of a candy bar was $5. The resort does offer Royal Service for $50/day for a garden view room or $100/day for an ocean view room. With this service you get access to a private pool, free daily cocktails, and free continental breakfast. During our 2nd day we had an Ant problem. There was a trail of ants coming in our room from the patio. I ran into Lernie, Housekeeping Manager the next day and he had someone to spray that day while we were out. After returning from a 5 hour walk through the rain forest during day 6, we found ourselves to be locked out of our room. The resort had deactivated our room keys. We were not scheduled to leave for another two days. We used the hall phone to call front desk and they told us that they would send someone immediately. After waiting 35 minutes, we called front desk again & told them that we were still waiting for someone to bring us new keys. They apologized and said they would send someone immediately. Well, after waiting for over an hour my best friend decided to go get the keys. No one ever came to bring us keys. STAFF: I did not find about 90% of the staff to be friendly. I have never seen so many employees on their cell phones nor have I ever received such bad service while on vacation. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assist you because they are too busy talking on the phone. The customer service that I receive was definitely not the service that you expect from a 4 star resort. However, I do want to give kudos and praises to Lernie, Housekeeping Manager and Jay, waiter at Wet Pool Bar & Grill. With the exception of Lernie, Jay, & a few others, everyone else needs to go to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Customer Service 101\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd class. CHECK-OUT: Check out was long and painful. It took me over an hour to check out. They only had 1 representative working and there were several people in line. DO NOT JUST PAY YOUR BILL! PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILL BEFORE LEAVING THE RESORT. When we got our bill we had charges that were not supposed to be on there. My bill was over $216, but after removing charges that was not mine, it was $56. They tried to charge me $71.40 per person for picking us up from the airport and $16.05 for parking. The couple in front of me had several charges on their bill that was not theirs. They had already paid their bill. Someone had charged hundreds of dollars to their room. The problem is that the resort will not allow you to pay cash at the restaurants. You have to charge it to your room. You do not have to show proof. All you have to do is give them a room number. The representative pulled the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s receipts from the restaurants and found that the signatures did not match theirs. Someone had been using their room number and getting away with it. This is so easy to do. I cannot say that I will be returning to this resort. This resort should be 2 \u00c2\u00bd stars tops. The only thing this resort has going for it is the physical beauty of it.

The Gran melia is one of the most gorgeous places i have ever been, so much so that i was considering getting married there. the pool is open 24 hours, the room was amazing,the grounds are well groomed, the view from my window was stunning, and if you have a car the location isnt too bad, but thats where it ends. Parking at the hotel is $16/day which wouldnt have been a problem if there was anywhere to park. the hotel bar and casino are open to the public and there is no seperate lot for guests so if you want to leave the grounds not only will you lose your parking space but you will more than likely have to walk about 15 minutes back to your room. the second day we were there we were told by the parkin manager that if you rent your car through Avis (which we did) parking was free so you can imagine my suprise to see 4 days worth of parking on our bill at the end of the trip (along with 5 bottles of water from the mini bar that we didnt drink). when i told the front desk clerk what i was told by the parking manager she informed me that i would have had to park in the avis parking lot to get free parking, and when i asked why no one had informed me that there even was an avis lot she replied \" I dont know\" and walked off. so i went to get a manager, but convieniently all the managers in the entire hotel were in a meeting and no one knew when it would be over. Add this to the constant fire alarms in the middle of the night, and the ridiculously expensive room service (which is the only way to get food after 10:30 because you cant bring in outside food or drinks) and it was just not a pleasant experience. I thought that once i got home the dramatics would be over but when i went to check my online banking the gran melia had charged $150 to my card when they were just supposed to put a hold on it and when i called them to get my money back i was told that i was wrong and that they hadn't charged me it was just an authorization. when i explained to the hotel accountant that i work for the bank and that i know the difference she laughed at how upset i was getting and put me on hold for about 20 minutes before she came back and told me she had returned my money. I know i've been rambling but i guess i'm just upset that this place is so gorgeous and i had such high hopes but none of it matters because of the staff.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bossier City, LA", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Experience...Fabulous...

First: There are a series of bungalows on the property and the property is QUITE expansive. We were in Bugalow 6/7 which was the very farthest one from the main club house, restaurants and pool. They have golf carts that supposedly drive by every 5 minutes... but its not nearly that frequently and they tended to be full many times when they passed us by. Make sure you are aware where your bungalow is and you are NOT so far away from the main area of the resort. Walking constantly in the PR heat gets annoying Second: I had no idea this would be the case. We rented a car with intentions of getting snacks, sodas, etc to consume IN OUR ROOMS (not at the pool or on the public areas of the property) and they continually stopped us from visibly bringing it in. That is ABSURD!! If I want a bottle of water, a granola bar or a can of coke in the middle of the night, how dare they tell me I cant bring it into MY room that I paid for. They actually have guards that stop you when you try to do this. The trick? Just empty a suit case and do it anyway. Still VERY annoying. We are not 3rd graders and should not be told what we can and cant eat in the rooms we PAY for. Third: This resort is remote. IF you want to do anything (Rainforest, Loquillo, eat elsewhere, etc.) you MUST rent a car. Its far cheaper to do this at the airport than at the resort. The rainforest and an amazing beach (Loquillo) are all within a 10 minute drive, so do rent a car and dont waste your $$ for the guided tours. Fourth: The front desk is a NIGHTMARE. OMG! It takes them 20 minutes to check one person in or out of the hotel. The inefficiency is absurd. The Beach: Okay, it is beautiful but very natural and not the beach you tend to think of when PR crosses your mind. The sand is not white, there is a lot of seaweed and there are rocks and boulders everywhere. I still found it to be highly beautiful, but nobody was swimming or really out in the ocean. There are also NO waves, its more like a bay. The Pool: The pool is beautiful. There are 3 pools (the main pool, spa pool and Royal Service pool). The main pool is expansive - during the day they have loud enjoyable latin influenced music playing. There are lounge chairs built into the water (amazing), there is a swim up bar (pricey - but nice), and there are rentable cabanas. They have pool waiters to grab you drinks and food. The restaurant at the pool is VERY reasonable with decent sandwhich-y foods. Restaurants: There are 3 main restaurants on the premises - an Asian Fusion, Italian & a buffet. The buffet is mediocre & somewhat pricey. We also ate the Asian Fusion which has a Hibachi option. The food was good and somewhat pricey. I was actually pretty impressed by the Asian restaurant. As I mentioned before - the pool bar is your best bet for lunch. A meal is only like $10. There is also a breakfast stand with bagels, coffee, etc which is reasonably priced and much cheaper than the restaurant option. The Room: I found the cleanliness to be mediocre. They ration towels and at times we would only have 2 new towels replaced in our room. The beds are AMAZING. Some of the most comfortable beds I've had in a hotel setting. The bathrooms were also nice... but the maids always closed the doors after cleaning and it smelled musty & like mildew constantly. The staff: For the most part, I found them to be pleasant. The golf cart drivers were very sweet and should be tipped. Bring singles on you to tip because I constantly needed them. I found the front desk workers to be somewhat rude and at times not helpful. My key kept losing its strip and it would take me 20mins at the front desk to get it reactivated. We also had a fire alarm in our building go off once at 3.30am and once at 11.30 pm. When I would call the front desk sometimes it would ring unanswered. Then when I would get someone they were unapologetic and somewhat rude. The alarm was supposedly a glich in their system - but nobody wants to be awaken to that. Nightlife: Other than the casino this place turns into a 'pumpkin' by 10pm. The pool bar closes at 6 on weekdays and 7 on weekends. Although the pool is 24hrs, I think its ABSURD that the bar closes that early. They need to keep it going for at least 3 more hours. There is also the 'Avenue' bar which has some nightlife, but its average at best. The casino is small and simple, but it'll do if that's your thing. When I was there they had BJ tables for $10 a hand and lots of slots. Not too bad. The resort is WAYYY off the beaten path, so you cannot walk to anywhere close by for nightlife. We took a shuttle to the nightlife of old san juan. I wasnt all that impressed for the cost of the shuttle ($45pp). Its a nice resort - but its got several flaws that are not (in my mind) worth the price or going back to.", "Date": "August 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cThe Worst Service Ever!!!\u201d", "Author": "aes2167", "ReviewID": "UR18953071", "Content": "Let me start with the fact that I booked this hotel (2 rooms) three months in advance, and called several times to confirm the reservations; I recieved assurances that the reservation was booked and that we can arrive at the hotel on Jul 31 at 3:00 pm.

I was then told by the front desk that the hotel had overbooked and that we would have to move to another hotel 15 minutes down the road (mind we had gotten lost finding the hotel and was the reason we were late gettign to checkout). The front desk clerk assured us that we would need to stay in the other hotel for just one day and they would accomodate. After waiting another 30 mins for manager and were set with the fact that we would only need to stay at the other hotel one night we were asked to sit and wait for a van to pick us up; another 20 mintes later the manager told us that we would need to stay in the wyndham hotel 2 nights instead of the agreed upon one night. The manager (Isabella) then stated that we would be accomodated for each night we spent in the other hotel spa and/or free meal when we came back to Gran Melia. It was hard because when you go on vacation you want to relax and unpack once not have to pack again, unpack, have your vacation interupted etc. Needless to say the other hotel Wyndham had much better service, better casino and a better attitude towards their guests. We fel so much apart of the hotel not a number or cattle to be shipped around. Evening though Wyndhams' rooms were not better than Gran melia the service made up for it--This was the most we felt on vacation and they even have a better beach than Gran Melia. When we returned to Gran Melia there was a mix-up with the accomodations we were to recieve because of the move, Isabella initially told us that she did not say that we would be accomodated for each day, causing a mix-up and some what of more disappointment in the Gran Melia system. She allowed it and then on check out day there were charges on the bill that we did not spend, although they took the charges off we had to prove that we did not use some of the services and items in the mini bar (which an attendant went to the room to check-which felt like we were discredited or not trust worthy), If any one is not trust worthy it is this hotel.", "Date": "August 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cFamily Reunion at the Gran Melia\u201d", "Author": "EasyPhysics", "ReviewID": "UR18944479", "Content": "We recently returned from having a large family reunion at the Gran Melia in Puerto Rico.

There was a line of about 30 people waiting to check in with only two hotel employees handling the reservations. After 2 hours we finally were given our rooms but without the room keys. It turns out the rooms were not ready yet. I demanded to speak to a manager and after demanding to get some resolution I was given keys to two of our rooms only. The explanation for the delay was that the hotel did not have any clean sheets available and we would have to wait for new ones. We ended up getting the other two rooms two hours later. In all the checking process took 4 hours. When we got to our room we noticed the bathroom did not have any hand or face towels. Upon inquiring about it we were told there were none. My guess is either the hotel is short staffed or they don't have enough supplies for all the guests. Another issue is the charges for room service and meals at the resorts restaurants.

Gran Melia also makes extra money by letting non guests pay to use the pool, so the place is crawling with kids during the day.

Upon our arrival greeted by a very friendly and competent bell man, Dario. Dario immediately made us feel welcome. However the experience went downhill from this point on. Our room was not ready, which was understandable as check-in was not until 3pm and we arrived at 2. there was a room availabe with a king size bed which was not what I had reserved so we chose to wait. The woman checking us in at the front desk was apologetic, however could not give a time frame for when the room would be ready. She advised us that we could change and leave our bags in the hospitality suite, took my cell phone number and said we would be contacted when the room was available. A different person took our bags to the hospitality suite. This person was rude and acted as if this was an imposition. Upon going to the beach area no towels were availabe for three and a half hours. After all this time I finally went back to the front desk as at our 8th try at towels the girl there told us our room was still not ready. We went to the front desk to inquire and the girl told us the room was ready and offered no explanations as to why I was not contacted. When the card keys were handed to me, it looked like there was only one. When I asked the firld for two she rolled her eyes and flipped the cards apart and thurst them at me. At this point I was so frustrated I didn't trust myslef to say anything to her. The suite was beautifully appointed. The bathroom was huge with a suken tub. There were no complaints as to the accomodations. The next day we had breakfast at the hotel. There was one person making omeletes, one at a time. The food was standard fare you would get at any hotel. My cousin wanted several treatments at the spa but no one could explain the services to her. We went to the beach and again no towels were available. After the 7th or 8th try (and 2 hours later) at towels, my cousin was so frustrated that she complained to a manager. The manager listened to all her complaints (some which to this point I have not mentioned) and comped our breakfast for the duration of our stay. We had a problem with the light being out on our terrace and after 4 hours and another phone call someone came to fix it. A follow-up call from the hotel was made to our room and appreciated. Our last full day at the resort we got towels at 8am with no problem. However on this day both keys to the room were deactivated for some unknown reason. The parking situation at the hotel needs to be addressed as there are not enough spaces for guests. Upon checking out we asked to speak to the manager. We spoke to Felipe Cervantes who attentiively and patiently listened to our complaints. Mr. Cervantes apologized and promptly comped all parking charges. Mr. Cervates assured us that if we chose to stay at the resort in the future he would personally see to it that our stay there would be comfortable. All in all the resort and grounds are beautiful. However a resort of this caliber should not put there guests through the hardships we endured. When you go to a 4 star resort you expect to be pampered, not have every day with thoughts in your head of what went wrong. Hopefully these issues will be resolved as this resort has great potential.

There was always plenty of suttle lighting, security personnal visibly on-site and patrol. We felt we had the best of both worlds, we were enough of a distance from San Juan to really feel the resort atmosphere but close enough to tour the island comfortably. Instead of paying for the tours we rented a car and went on our own. We got around easily and were able to do and see a lot on our own time frame. We spent a day in Old San Juan, saw the Fort Castillo San Cristobal-El Morro, shopping, lunch and dinner and even the Baccardi rum facility. Another day we went to the El Yunque Rainforest and loved having our own car to get around, (hint, wear your bathing suit and a cover-up and walking shoes) after leaving the rainforest we enjoyed the nearby Luquillo beach. There is an Avis car rental on site at the Gran Melia and Gina who works there is wonderful. She used to be a tour guide. One day she sent us on a scenic route to Ponce, south west/central, carribean side of the island. It was beautiful. Saw the eastern exterior, beachs and the interior mountains. We toured a coffee plantation just outside Ponce, (we got the 2 hour tour because they only harvest in October, which is when they offer the 4 hour tour) then we went into the city and toured the Serralles Castle, a beautiful mansion that sits high above the city with an awesome view of the caribbean and city of Ponce. Visited the town square (the trolly's end at 4:00 so we were to late to take a trolly) but after that we went to the boardwalk, five minutes from the city square. We had dinner at El Paladar Bar & Grill right on the boardwalk, very obscure but we had the the freshest, most delicious, seafood meals. We took the interstate back to San Juan and on to the Gran Melia within 2 hours. This day away really made us feel like we had experienced Puerto Rico, because we saw so much outside of the commercial and resort area. One of our favorite memories will be the Coco Sweet Bakery. It sits at the red light entering the road to the Gran Melia. Every morning we had breakfast here. Fresh island coffee was 70 cents, 3 scrabbled eggs with vegtables and fresh baked bread was $3.00. Cuban style, egg, bacon, cheese sandwich was $3.25 (great to go). It opens at 5:30a.m. and closes at 10:00p.m. Donuts were superb. We sun bathed Sunday afternoon, Tuesday after the rainforest, all day Thursday and Friday morning before heading out to the airport. It was truly a great trip and yes I would return and visit the north west side of the island and the caves. I will always stay at a Gran Melia hotel when it is available for future travels. It was a very hospitable and welcoming experience.", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jayant98", "Title": "\u201cNIce Hotel, Very Poor Service\u201d", "Author": "Jayant98", "ReviewID": "UR18010311", "Content": "My husband and I were recent guests at Gran Melia Puerto Rico, where we stayed for four (4) nights (July 12th -July 16th), and I have to say that for being a four (4) star hotel it sure did not meet our expectations service wise. The quality of service was extremely poor. During our stay I was told by at least 4 different employees that they were unable to fulfill my services being that they did not have time or were too busy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this is something you do not tell your guests especially when they are paying $265 per night!!!!! The hotel should be prepared for any given number of guests on any given day. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the hotel gets a list of the number of guests that will be checking in/out on a daily basis in advance. Therefore, they should have the proper staff to cover the number of people staying at the hotel. Now I will go into details of the services that I was totally disappointed about: 1. When we first checked in, the check in procedure went smooth; however, we had to wait around approximately 40 minutes for a bellboy to escort us along with our luggage to our room. That took away from our first impression of the hotel. How are you going to have your guests, who are trying to get away from stress and finally relax, get aggravated and waste time sitting around waiting as soon as they begin their vacation??? Obviously the hotel did not have the sufficient amount of bellboys needed for the number of people checking in. The least they could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done was given us some guidance on how to get to our room and around the hotel this way we could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve enjoyed ourselves upon arrival rather than wait around and then bring our luggage to our room when possible. 2. Housekeeping was good the first day, then after that it went downhill. The 2nd day our room was never made, we had to call for clean towels and was told that they did not have clean towels cause they did not have time to do them?!?!? How can you say that to your guests???? Finally, like two hours later housekeeping came by (at 9pm) to make our room and after we had already showered provided towels. The 3rd day, again they came pretty late in the evening to do our room and did not even bother to take the dirty dishes that were sitting on the table, which actually stayed there till we checked out. 3. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t refrigerators in the hotel rooms; therefore I was unable to store several items that needed to be refrigerated. Yet, I figured I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get enough ice to keep them in the ice bucket and that should keep them cool. Well all the ice machines were out of ice throughout my entire stay and when I called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ServiExpress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to have them bring ice to the room once again I was told that they did not have ice cause they did not have time to make the ice?!?!?!?!? EXCUSE ME???? No ice in a 4 star hotel??? As a result my husband had to walk the lobby bar almost every night to get ice; mind you it was approximately 1/3 of a mile walk since our room (911) was almost at the end of the hotel. 4. We had a tee time to play golf at 3:45pm, however from previous experiences we decided to call the bellboy to pick up our golf clubs at 2:30pm, figured an hour and fifteen minutes should be enough time, specially since the golf course is only a two minute drive. Well good thing we call with plenty of time in advance cause after 3 phone calls and a 45 minute wait the SECURITY GUARD, NOT THE BELLBOY, came to get our golf clubs. Wait, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more to it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 when we were done playing golf, we requested for the hotel to pick us up, so we gave them enough time to come by walking around in the clubhouse, since we know they are never prompt. Well as we are walking out of the clubhouse the guy is driving away, he never even bothered to come inside and ask who needed a ride back!!! Ok, so then he finally turns back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well the guy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even work for the hotel, the bellboy ask this guy (the driver) to do him the favor since they were so busy!?!?!? CAN YOU IMAGINE???????? 5. Our last night we had our children stay with us since we were flying out the next day and figured they can sleep on the sofa bed, after all we only needed extra blankets and pillows\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well once again it took them almost 3 hours (past midnight) to bring us the blankets and pillows. UNBELIEVABLE!!! Overall, I do have to say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful hotel, great ambiance, nice rooms, good location and decent food. However, due to its lack of service I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give this hotel 2 1/2 stars and would only recommend it to people who do not really care for good service.", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Time!\u201d", "Author": "Citychick_0274", "ReviewID": "UR17996100", "Content": "I almost didn't book this hotel based on the not-so-great reviews but I am super happy that I went with my gut and booked the Oceanfront Royal Service. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and relaxing. My only disappointment is that we were only there for two days as we traveled all over the island on our trip. If you can swing the Royal Service, do it!! It's completely worth it. A lot of reviews have complained about how long the drive is to the resort and how far away it is from everything. Considering it only takes approximately 2.5 hours to get to the southwestern municipality of Guanica from Rio Grande, it's not that big of a deal. However, unless you are only staying in Old San Juan you definitely need a car to fully enjoy PR. After a long red-eye flight we stopped for lechon asado and batata off the freeway (OMG! Amazing) and a Medalla at a roadside bar a bit further up the road from our meal. We were on vacation after all and in no huge rush to get to the hotel. It is true that the resort is a bit of a drive from the airport and about 3 miles once you pull off the main road but the view is so stimulating you don't even notice it! The plants, golf course, flowers and birds are pretty and vibrant. When we finally pulled up I took one look at the parking lot and it was decided we would spend the extra cash for valet. Totally worth it! The last thing I wanted to worry about on vacation was finding parking. Check-in at the RS lounge was quick and easy; it should be noted that when I called three days prior to arrival they did not have a reservation under the booking number I was provided by the website. Two phone calls later it was fixed. Save yourself the hassle and call ahead. We were greeted with cocktails and our fab butler, Manuel, picked us up and gave us a tour of the property all the while providing us with useful information about the resort and surrounding attractions. Our room was right next to the RS pool and was big and beautifully appointed. I loved the huge shower! Manuel took care of everthing we needed, whenever needed, and my boyfriend loved how close it was to the beach. The outdoor whirlpool was so relaxing at night with the sound of the waves lapping the beach and the coqui chirping. *sigh* I miss it already! Another big complaint that I read about was that the beach was rocky and full of seagrass. It totally is, but we thought it was fun that you could walk out super far and the bathtub warm water is barely thigh deep. We enjoyed looking for shells and playing with the colorful hermit crabs. Again, you are on vacation and walking along the beach in Puerto Rico, enjoy it and stop sweating the small stuff! HAHAHA We only ate at the resort twice. Once for dinner and again for breakfast. Although the food is a bit salty, it was still pretty good and coming from San Francisco we thought the prices were reasonable. Service is a bit slow but our waiter was personable and accomodating at dinner and the waitress at breakfast was awesome as well. Our big thing was to eat Puerto Rican food so we only ate at the resort when necessary. By choice, we did walk alot on the resort but there were always carts going by. When we did want a ride back to the room it was not a problem catching one. All in all this hotel is beautiful, the staff is amazing and we had an AMAZING trip.

I'd put my overall experience at the Melia up there with both of those resorts. The hotel is located about 7 minutes from the main road and there's a lot of construction going on before you get there, but once you get to the hotel, it's beautiful. I stayed in the Royal Service part of the hotel, so you have a dedicated check-in desk away from the masses, although they don't tell you that (I waited in line for about 15 minutes before I was shuttled over there). My room was spacious, marble-laden, and luxurious. I appreciated the private pool and cabanas that are reserved for the Royal Service clientele. The restaurants were very good, and the sea bass at Nami, for $22, was a relative bargain and outstanding.

I am wondering if some of the negative reviews I read prior to going were written for the wrong resort. I must say the resort is beautiful as well as very well kept. Everyday the landscapers were hard at work keeping the resort in top notch condition. As you may have read swimming in the ocean off the beach can be done, but is not the best, consider this if swimming in the ocean is important to you, for me I prefer the pool so it was not an issue for me. As far as the people complaining about the prices being too expensive, come on folks you are on a beautiful resort, you get what you pay for, and if you think it is too expensive then maybe you should consider staying in a hotel and not on a resort. Getting around is requires a little work and research, Jose and Melvin were very helpful with this; I would recommend speaking with them prior to making any plans outside the resort. Things you must do are visit old San Juan, plan for a full day if you want to see everything, and rent a car for the day.

First of all, as I have learned from many reviews off Trip Advisor, don't believe everything you read. The only thing I have read consistently with any accuracy is the need to get a rental car. Let's break it down. Rooms were spacious and well kept. The first night we arrived the maid never came by, but it was minor to us. We had plenty of towels and only slept in our bed for a night. I gave them the benefit of doubt and never complained, and to there credit we never had that problem again. They called us daily to see when we would like housekeeping to come by. Yes, the room had a bit of a musty smell, but it wasn't due to the lack of cleanliness. A candle fixed that. We even had an extra fridge in our suite so we were able to keep our own supplies readily cold in our room for consumption. Property was awesome. We were in villa 924 with ocean view and yes, it was a bit of a walk to the main resort and pool, but that was how we liked it. We enjoyed our daily walk to and from the pool/resort. The scenery was amazing so we enjoyed taking in all of it during the walk.There was never a time that as we walked to and from our room, a staffer with a golf cart stop to offer a ride. Never ate in any of the restaraunts since we had a rental and wanted to experience Puerto Rican food while in Puerto Rico rather than Japanese or Italian. We ate daily at the pool grill for lunch and it was decently priced. C'mon folks, a $9 Cheeseburger with fries is the norm. If you want a value meal, then stay close to a McDonald's. Same goes for the drinks. I don't know where some of the reviewers normally go, but where I am from and where I have been $5-$10 for a drink is norm. Bartenders took care of us and never skimped on alcohol content. Try to stay during the week if possible. Service is different when the volume increases, but that's to expect anywhere. One thing I was frustrated by was the parking situation on the weekend. There was so many guests and so many people visiting guests, parking was non-existent beginning on Thursday and no one in the hotel seemed to care whether you found a spot or not. We ended parking on the other side of the resort. A small discrepany, but definitely something that needs attention. That Friday we had a problem at the pool grill too. The servers didn't have a grip (nor cared) on who had what tables so several families waited for some time to even get to order a drink. A couple next to us called management and to their credit the grill was swarmed with management and additional staffers within minutes. They personally stopped by our tables, took orders, and comp'd drinks and food for the inconvenience. Every resort working on that scale is likely to have problems. It's how they react and attempt to wrong the rights it is what counts! There it is. Don't let such a great place/deal be overlooked because some people expect way too much even though they got a great deal. We thoroughly enjoyed it and because a few good reviews, we were prepared and it made our vacation so much better.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat...rent a car for a complete vacation!\u201d", "Author": "TravelClarion", "ReviewID": "UR17802768", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay at this resort.

Pool: Great! Warm waters. Can sunbathe on \"island platforms\" within the pool or nearby Coco Beach. Watch for the friendly hermit crabs that children like to collect. Food: We had been worried about eating at the hotel because of the other reviews, but the resort is located just off Route 3 with malls, supermarkets, a pharmacy, fast food places, and a deli nearby. For breakfast, there's also a stand called Gran Melia Cafe that sells juices, coffee, and sandwiches. We opted for Coco-Sweet Bakery & Deli (located by the highway exit for the resort). The resort food was delicious also; we had the churrasco with yucca fries and salad ($14) at the Wet pool grill. They give an ample portion, so my husband and I shared and ordered a side, as well. (No refills for beverages). One night, we ordered the pizza from room service ($16 + $3 service charge). We loved the way they made the crust and extra cheese. For a typical Puerto Rican meal, the vacation concierge recommended Richie's Cafe, located at the Rio Mar hotel area a few minutes away. (Try the mofongo and guava pastelitos with \"mayo-ketchup\"). The place has wood sculptures and opens up to overlook the cityscape (very romantic). If you want quick and convenient, there are many stops along the highway as well as the food court at Belz Factory Outlet Mall, which has a variety of familiar and local options, as well as a movie theater.

All he said was thank you and dropped it in the comment box. So here's the list in no particular order; 1. Don't touch the minibar in the room. Each item has a sensor, the second its moved, you are charged. The minibar is a small tray under the TV, on a Desk and also a small refrigerator. The second something is moved, you're charged about 5 times the average retail price. MM's was 3.50 and Water was 4.50. We didnt want it, we just picked up the MM's but them back, and the water was hot, went back later for the same water to see it was colder, and was charged again, for the sameeeeeeee waterrr. Had to wait until someone could come to the room and verify I didnt actually consume the items. 2. Our room was exactly 1/3 of a mile from the lobby. So they have these trolleys that take you to the room after you check in right. Well that's about it, after you check in you're on your own to walk back and around the grounds. If I wanted to walk two miles a day I would have stayed home and gone to the Gym. Finding a trolley at night is impossible, we couldnt actually. After arriving from dining or from outside of the hotel, we had to walk, and much further because at night you have to park really far because parking cant be found since there's a casino and a lot of locals come to play at the casino and they take up much of the parking that the guest could use. 3.Ohhhhh, don't use their public bathrooms near the pool, they are broken, doors wont open if you can manage to get in, and the toilets are disgustinggggggggggg. I complained each day I was there, \"Arent you guys going to clean those bathrooms, send someone for crying outloud.\" 4. So we were told of this great vacation program that we were\"eligible\"for. My fiancee said sure, no problem, especially since the hotel employee advised us that we would get 3 nights free in Dominican Republic in their hotel if we went. So the next morning we went. A gentlemen by the name of \"Toby\" showed us a video, made us walk around a fancy hall with pictures of their other hotels around the world, and then asked us if we would like to stay in them. We said sure why not, then he mentioned to us that for $24,000 with 15.99% for 10 years we could own a timeshare. Whattttttttttttttttttt? I didn't go to no stinking hotel on vacation to think about buying a timeshare. So he bugged us and bugged on, we told him thats not what we came there for, he didnt want to let us leave, until we decided to just ignore him and walk out while he kept talking. 5. No parking at night, dont leave unless you want to take a hike at night back to your room or risk waiting for someone to leave. That kind of sums it all up. Remember, no trolleys at night. Also total mess with the parking tickets, you cant leave without going to the lobby and having them stamp your parking ticket so that they can charge you etc. 6. Oh so they have this VIP stuff all around the hotel, VIP lounge, VIP pool, VIP internet. No one explained this to us. So we decided to ask, its a royalty service they provide. Mind you, this \"Royalty Service\" you have to pay extra which is the same service you get for free at a regular hotel. Why in the world would you pay extra after paying close to 300 a night for a room. 7.Ok, our room door was broken when we got to our room. So we called up to have our room switched as we wanted to head back out to enjoy our brief vacation and we wanted to leave our stuff nice and secure. They advised us they couldnt and they would send a maintenance guy. That took over an hour to happen and we had to wait till he fixed it, so we wasted about 3 hours waiting for a freaking door to get fixed. The problem with the door was it didnt lock, so anyone could come in and take our cameras and passports. 8. Ohhhh, towel card, Cant get a towel at the pool without it. And if you loose the card, like we did, its thirty dollars for a little pc of cardboard credit like card. Its one towel per guest per card.. Once youre done with the towel, you have to return it, and before 6. Cant take it to your room, cause you need the card. Again, nothing like other hotels. 9.Check in was a mess, they had something called a precheck in to make check in when the room was ready nice and easy. Well we did that for nothing, because we still had to do everything again when it came time to really check in. Waste of time. We're like we already gave you guys all of this info, why are we doing this again?", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cGran Melia Puerto Rico--Do not waste your time or money, read this review.\u201d", "Author": "PapiHenry", "ReviewID": "UR17705522", "Content": "Ok, I will preface by saying I am Dominican (my grandparents were from Puerto Rico) and my wife is 100 % Puerto Rican, so for us to be disappointed, annoyed, or upset regarding one our OWN island is extremely difficult. We are very laid back and are very low maintenance. We went for 5 days, 6 nights without the kids as we try to travel on our own at least once a year to relax and this was that trip. I'll start by with the check in. So my wife and I get there in an older toyota corolla that we borrower from my father-in-law (1) because he insisted and would feel offended if I rented a car (2) I really didnt care since we usually get to a hotel and stay there until it's time to leave and we were also staying at other hotels and different places around the island. But we wanted the \"RESORT\" lifestyle for the time we stayed. This was my first mistake of many. So anyways we get there, I pull up, my wife gets out, I get out and we just stand there while the two bellmen just talk to each other and ignore us. After 5 minutes or so (again we are pretty laid back) they turn to us and don't even say welcome or address us. My wife immediately says something to them (obviously a little annoyed) but nothing out of the ordinary. It was something to the effect of thanks for noticing. In any case the guy goes \"But Honey I waiting for you\" in spanish. I almost flipped since my temper goes awry when it comes to those things but I let it go. I then asked what to do with the vehicle, they kind of just grunted and pointed me to the parking site which was not too far way. I actually wanted to Valet since I didnt care to pay whatever it was (I later found out it was 25/day if I recall correctly) but they never asked nor gave me any options. So we then check in (took about 30 minutes), and it was ok. Again no Welcome, no cold towel, no smiling faces, nothing. Everyone seemed bored and upset to be working, which we can all understand since we all work, but I dont expect that at this type of resort and not at the price I paid. We, unfortunately, went to Punta Cana and had the greatest hotel and resort vacation and experience EVER so we compare it a LOT whenever we go anywhere and this was like comparing the experience of Disney World (live in Orlando) to watching TV in black and white with rabbit ears in 1980. Maybe, we expect resorts and hotels like Punta Cana or just people in General like Dominican Republic but not here, not at this hotel, not even close. On with the appearance of the hotel. The hotel is Beautiful and has a lot of potential for the location where it is. It is pretty well kept, the grounds are usually nicely trimmed. The Beach is \"blah\" at best, not the hotels fault but if you think you are going there to swim in the beach, think again. The pools are nice and long, well cleaned and kept . Pools are pools so what can I say? The service at the \"Wet Bar Grill\" is HORRIBLE to say the least, aside from very expensive. I will pay whatever if the service is good, but this was something out of the twilight zone. I went to the bar and said, \"Hello, how are you doing today\" and I just saw the girl stare at me and say \"what do you want\"? I said politely I'd like a mojito please, she then looked down, walked away, came back, talked to her coworkers about 5 minutes, then made it. I said \"thank you\". She just grunted. Mind you this is all in spanish, my native tongue, and I'm just a nice guy that just always says please and thank you, I figure everyone works, so just be polite. In any case the mojito was $11.00 which is a lot even on vacation, and I still gave her a $4 tip--I dont think I should have but I thought this was just an anomaly. Wrong--This is the attitude of the hotel in general. I wont bore you with details, but most employees were exactly like the one I mentioned--bored, unhappy, unprofessional, jerkish, and just plain rude. Food- ate at the cafe for breakfast and dinner- 70 and 95 respectively for two people. My wife had a coke i think and i had water. Yea. Both Buffets, both horrible. Very little selection. Very expensive for what it is. My wife had some cheese, crackers, and ham. Crappy service again and crappy food both times we went. We kept thinking things wood change--never did. Again we are really outgoing people and very nice--we met some couples and they shared same sentiments with us. Dont eat the food here, it's overpriced and just crappy food. We didnt eat at the japanese restaurant or the italian (I learned my lesson after this next story), but we talked to some guests and said it was equally crappy. Ok---so the morning we're having breakfast (1st day after checking in previous night) and I get up to get some bread and behind the bread I find two HUGE cockroaches, which I dont care for but I'm pretty cool with these things and I just laughed about it. So I go up to one of the ladies that host and I say discretely what I saw and to take care of it before anyone notices. She shrugged it off and said ok and dindt even thank me or anything. Again, I dont care that much about this---it's the caribbean and insects are all over the place, but I expect better service. 30 minutes later we finish eating and I notice the same bread basket and layout still there, so nothing was changed or removed. I never went back to ANY of their restaurants. Enjoy Rooms are not that clean, we found a lot of dust (extreme amounts) throughout the room and candy wrappers under our bed. The bathroom was \"ok\", not greatly cleaned. I found hair in the shower and the tub was somewhat dirty. THe room looked good an we had a nice balcony and nice view on the 2nd floor. If you dont like walking a lot from your room, I dont suggest you leave it. The golf carts supposedly are all over the place, my wife and I walked a LOT because we would just wait and wait and wait and even if they saw you they wouldn't stop or even say I'll be back. We walked a LOT to and from the rooms, and were pretty far from the main lobby. So yea. The one and ONLY person that made us feel welcome was the Manager/Supervisor \"OTTO\". This guy us very friendly and understanding after we vented about some of the things we found out towards the end of our stay. He is extremely helpful, professional, understanding, and always had a smile. I asked him why he worked there because he's by far the best treatment we received. I would only go to this resort to say hi to him, but I would not stay here again. Thank you, Otto for all your help and comfort. I have more to write but this is long enough. To those that have very good reviews about this hotel, you were one of the few lucky ones and you probably have not been to Punta Cana or a comparable resort--this hotel is terrible on so many levels I am missing so much because it was ALL so bad. Oh by the way, the day we checked out I had to walk with 3 suitcases from my room to the lobby (about 15 min walk) because front desk would not pick up the phone for whatever reason and no carts would pass by either. We did speak to a manager when checking out because we had it. She was very nice about it and apologized, so we did tell her all the things we found right and wrong with the hotel. I cant recall her name, but she was nice about it. We didnt yell or act inappropriate but we let her know we were upset and disappointed with our stay and treatment. If you want to have a good time or just relax, dont come here. The people we met at the pools were great. Some locals, some tourists and most agreed with our perception. There was one couple that said they were having a good time and that this was the 1st time in a resort like \"this\". When you have nothing to compare it to, I guess it's mediocre at best instead of horrible. Puerto Rico is beautiful and most of the older generation is very helpful and nice. There are a lot of beautiful places to visit and we actually had a great time EXCLUDING our stay at the Gran Melia. I will never come back here, ever. I may give them another try in a different country. Good Luck in your future vacations!

The trip was a little bit of business and pleasure. I can't understand some of the negative reviews on this resort. The resort is absolutley beautiful and everything is extremely clean. The rooms are incredable and also spotless. We did not meet one singel staff member that didn't have a smile on their face and were always asking if there is anything they can do for you and how are you enjoying your stay. They were terrific! The main pool is great. It as extremley large. You never had to fight for lounge chairs. We booked direct with the hotel and got an upgrade to the Ocean Front Royal Service Suite , which is well worth the additional money. Included with the Royal Service is complementary cocktails from 6 to 9 each evening in their private lounge. It also includes breakfast each day. The Royal Service guests had their own private pool. In the evening the resort has candles lit everywhere. They play very exotic / relaxing music all day and night. They have beautiful couches and comfy lounges through out the resort. The pools are spectacular. Their restaurants are very nice bur are expensive. This is to be expected at a 5 star resort though. The drinks are around $8 a drink.. Beautiful Golf Couses. The whole resort focused on complete relaxation. I just can't say enough about this resort. If you do go to Gran Melia you must have dinner (or lunch) at Richies Cafe. Richie picks you up from the resort and brings you back. The cafe is high up on a cliff with a wonderful view. The food is excellant!. the view and the food were so good we ate there three nights in a row. Richie is a wonderful host.

The combination of over-the-top ostentatiousness, exceedingly inefficient service (with the exception of that which is offered to Royalty Service patrons), mildewed rooms (we stayed in 3 of them, all of which had the same problem to differing degrees) and being nickel-and-dimed for everything (including hi-speed internet access - they give you the dial up for free) made for an overall unpleasant stay in what would have otherwise been a decent enough place. Check-in (we arrived at 4:00) took several hours - there were no rooms available with 2 beds and we are a family of 3. At 6:30 we were finally given a room that reeked of mildew. The delay in check-in meant that we were unable to make it out to Fajardo to go to the bioluminescent bay as we had planned. I complained to management the next day an we were upgraded to one of the Royalty Service rooms, which was a significant improvement (in fact, I would never stay there again unless I were to have Royalty Service (which is how *all* of the guests should treated - not just those who fork over the extra $$). The grounds are fairly spread out, which was a huge problem fore me as I have limited mobility due to a disability. We were told that carts circled the property regularly or that all we had to do was call and someone in a cart would come to pick me up whenever we needed transportation. The only carts circling the property regularly were security/landscaping/housekeeping. I called to request a cart on THREE separate occasions and no-one came after more than 20 minutes of waiting!! (The night before we were leaving I even arranged in advance to have a cart pick us up in the morning and it never came!! (In addition to the prior arrangement I made the night before I called in the morning to make sure they would send it to no avail). I should point out, however, this was not the case when we stayed in the Royalty Service quarters, as they have \"butlers\" available for transport, etc. at all times. Again, this is the treatment that should be offered to *all* of the patrons, not just those in Royalty Service. The inefficiency with which the place is run is staggering!! In addition to the outrageously long wait for check-in, each time you leave during your stay you have to get your parking ticket validated (for which there was generally a line). On our check-in for the second visit (a week after the first), we requested that express checkout paperwork be sent to our room to avoid the interminable and unavoidable line. The paperwork was never sent. The tendency to nickel-and-dime the patrons for everything from lying on the canopyed beds by the pool to using the high speed internet was rather annoying. Another *huge* problem for me were the polished marble floors all over the place (very slippery when wet (and it rains a lot in Puerto Rico) - I fell on two occasions).

Puerto Rico is really easy to drive around and we used our car to drive into San Juan about every night and drive to local bakeries to get lunch etc. Without a car, i think we would have been really unhappy. The pool is gorgeous. very big, lots of built in beds, very clean, great temperature. It was packed with kids over the weekend (we do not have kids) which was a little \"loud\" for our taste but they were just kids being kids, so we can't complain. Monday and Tuesday the pool was very quiet. Our room was nice, always cleaned promptly, very comfy bed, great flat screen tv with all the american channels. We found service very friendly and willing to help. We did not like the beach at the property (full of rocks, like the pictures show) but we took our rental car a few miles down the road to Luquillo Beach which was beautiful, easy to find and almost empty on a Monday.

The lobby smelled and looked amazing. I almost couldnt contain my excitement that THIS is how I was spending a week at work. Turns out they really need to address a few things. YOU FEEL LIKE A HOSTAGE: RENT A CAR! They charge you rediculous amounts of money to take a cab anywhere off the resort. I was tempted to walk to the nearest grocery, but the driveway is like 4 miles long. I would have felt a little better about the whole thing if I had control over where I could go. Plus, they charge by the person to go anywhere ($80 each way per person to old san juan), which sucks. I actually spent $120 for a 10 min trip to the rainforest (which was cool), but again overpriced. THE FOOD IS MEH: There is not a whole lot to choose from and it is very overpriced.

I was really dissipointed I did not get to show my girlfriend how good Puerto Rican food really is. Again, if it wasnt so crazy expensive to get a cab out of there, I could have taken her to many better places to eat. I actually played a few hands of blackjack for the free sandwich (hot ham and cheese) which unfortunately was just as good as anything else I had. My girlfriend did get the seabass one night and liked it. KIDS ARE EVERYWHERE: Be prepared... INCONSISTENT SERVICE: Sometimes it was good, sometimes not. We once ordered our food and never saw are waiter ever again. We got our food from the sushi chef and our check from the manager...no lie. Expect to wait a good 15 min for your check wherever you go. The maid service was strange. At times they were overbearing and could not comprehend that I left a DND sign on my door all day. I was working and by myself, I really didnt need any pillow fluffing. But a 2 maids and a large man visited my room in the span of two hours to see if i wanted service. By the time the weekend hit, I came back to my room at 4pm and nothing was done. Very strange indeed. THERE IS NO BEACH: Just know that and accept it. Overall, I did not have a bad time. I spent one full day at the pool and it was lovely. The pool is spectacular. Its big and the has tile lounges that sit half in the pool. My pina colada was delicious and my sunburn was worth it. The senery is to be marveled at, I was really blown away by the beauty of the place. Unfortunately, I felt they were getting me comming and going. I dont mind spending money for good food and good times, buit you know that feeling when you feel as if your being ripped off a little and there is no doubt I felt that way. (You know its bad when you are pocketing food from the breakfast buffett for lunch! lol) If the resort was all-inclusive (i have seen here that it used to be) it would be really nice, but Puerto Rico has too much to offer to be held hostage on a resort with mediocre food.

They started off acting like you were very special (we put down the extra $$ to get \"royale service\" - definitely not worth it) and took you on a tour of the grounds before your \"butler\" dropped you off at your room. We went to dinner at their italian restaurant because the sushi place was closed for the evening and there were about three other couples there and no outside dining. The next day we kept making reservations for the sushi place but each night we would show up and they would say that it was closed and would be open the next day - with all of the so called royal service we paid for, wouldn't someone contact your room and let you know that your dinner plans were cancelled? Also, we kept getting snubbed by the Royale service - no one was in communication with anyone else. We called three times to get these special pillows they offer for their guests and each time they said they were on their way but we never received them. I felt like i was staying at a poser luxury resort. They also give you the \"royale service\" that has appetizers and drinks from 6-9. the appetizers didn't come out until 6:30 and it was a plate of crackers with some sort of olive paste... not my idea of appetizers since you get that for free at the italian restaurant. Also, the crowd was less than exciting - one night we were at dinner (the same place we had breakfast - depressing in and of itself) and a clown came over and started doing tricks for us - super awkward. the only good thing about this place was that with the royale service you get access to their \"RS\" private pool and extra towels (if you don't have RS you have to keep a card and get one very warn towel to use per day and you have to give it back or else they charge you $30) you can try to snag for free one of their palapas - however, they didn't even bring over water which i was surprised at as most luxury places in hot areas (carribbean, phoenix, california) have pitchers of cold water.

A friend and I went to enjoy a relaxing few days for his birthday. First, I must say that everyone must view each person's comments as relative. As it is relative to how many other places and experiences you can compare this to. Also, you CANNOT compare some place else to your own home comfort, especially when you are visiting another culture or country. Each culture and country are very diffrent especially when it comes to food. I would only agree with one thing and that is that service should be at high standards no matter where you go. Remember, your ATTUTUDE can predict what type of service you receive. We did not have a problem with service. All if this to say, The Gran Melia was a nice resort, however, it is a little distant from some things you may want to do, (so rent a car - cheaper from the airport). The rooms were a little musty, however I always take scented candles everywhere I travel as you just never know and I have had a smokers room. The people were very nice. As with any place, you can have a \"hit or miss\" with service, but we did not experience and \"bad service\". Now, I will agree with one thing, the food was pretty bad. However , we rented a car and was able to get out and about , which we enjoyed a lot. We did enjoy the habachi restaurant, but we knew what to expect there. No it was not sauce on everything, but if you are looking for healthy eating this is not the place. Try this type of restaurant in your home town to see if this is something you like. I cannot say that this place was anymore expensive than any other resort /place I have visited, St. Lucia, Grand Cayman, Bahamas, hell, Miami to name a few. Again, that is relative to what you feel is expensive. To some, $2.50 for a hamburger is expensive; yes it is if you are only are use to eating on the dollar menu. Yes, it was not a beach resort, however some places in Hawaii is the same way. Lastly, we left our I-pod there. I called and they had it and sent it to me.

We were playing volleyball down the beach a ways, and he came down with a tray of ice water for all of us, we had about 8 kids with us, and nobody told him to do this, he took it upon himself to do this. Manuel is another one that is great in the Royal Service lounge , he will get you whatever you want whenever.

We were not looking for the mistakes or mishaps during our stay as it seemed many who read these reviews and traveled there did. My husband and I travel quite a bit and have stayed in some wonderful places and we consider Gran Melia one of them. The resort is beautiful and very relaxing. We did not have a problem with the food. We ate both at the resort restaurants and outside of the resort. Yes, prices overall at Gran Melia were quite expensive, but I agree with the other reviewer that it's due to the importing of items. You have to pay for convenience. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Particularly Miguel from the concierge desk. He was very consistent in making sure our visit was comfortable. I do recommend that you rent a car because it's a great convenience to be able to explore towns and local restaurants outside of the resort. Miguel had recommended Pasion Por El Fogon in Fajardo (www.pasionporelfogon.net). It was excellent! In fact, we ate there 2 nights in a row. He also recommended Richies's in Rio Grande. Can't see how the one reviewer talked badly about it because it has a great view, menu and Ritchie was nothing but friendly and accommodating. Gina from the Avis desk was also a wonderful person and very helpful. My husband had mentioned it was my birthday and we were going to drive into Old San Juan for dinner. We talked about finding some good paella and she recommended Rosa de Triana, a place that she frequented often in Old San Juan. It's a great casual local restaurant which also has a Flamingo show. When we arrived, Gina was there dining and had arranged for the Flamingo dancers to sing happy birthday to me. Very special and sweet of her to do that for me. Gina was right, the paella was excellent. As far as the pool being too cold. Well, I don't know about you, but while I'm sun bathing in the hot tropical sun, I want a cool refreshing pool to step into, not a warm pool. The activity and towel center staff were also very accommodating. As far as the distance of the rooms and everything else in the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.we didn't mind the walking. There were carts to use but we found the walking a plus after having such wonderful and filling meals. Good advice as far as signing up as a Sol Melia member (which is free). It's gets you a 2 for 1 breakfast, as well as a discount off your restaurant tab. The drive into and out of the resort didn't bother us. Yes, there is construction near the resort itself, but that didn't take away from the beauty. We didn't use the Royal Service package and felt we really didn't need to. Our room had a partial ocean view and sat behind the Royal Service Pool, which was just fine. Very spacious and clean room. We never encountered any bugs, bites or attitudes and had a very pleasant stay.

Internal commute from the main lobby to the individual resort rooms - they have travel carts that take you back and forth between your rooms and the main parking/ lobby area, but wihout the carts and if you have to carry stuff to your rooms, it can be a pain. Restaurants- Internal 2/3 restaurants - A little expensive, but the food/ decor is ok. There is a inhouse casino, but I never went inside. Room - We did not have the ocean view room, but it was nice and quiet. Much bigger than the regular hotel room at a Days inn or likes. Bed was real comfy, and the room cleaning service was regular for the all 5 days that we stayed in the resort. Room service for food- Ok. No microwave in the room offered or available. There is a small refrigerator to keep maybe 5-6 beer bottles max. I personally thought the room service was a little expensive. 2X2 egg omelettes + tea = $45 Beach - The resort has beach access to the coco beach, but corals and rocks are in abundance, so cannot go in the beach. So the beach access is pretty much only for the view. There is one area with net to play volleball. I think the Marriott next door seems a better option, and that does have a beach access with a beach that you can actually go into. Nice pool area, actually one of the best pools that I have in terms of size, layout etc. No hot water area or heated pool, so the water can feel much colder. Kid area- there is a kiddie pool and a playing area for kids, with slide, swing and toyhouse. There is also a parrot in the main lobby, my 19 month old loved this exotic bird :) They do have an AVIS rental office, so you can pretty much get picked from the airport and then rent your car from the AVIS office in the resort itself.

This place was amazing! I booked my destination wedding there without ever visiting and I was extremely nervous about it once I read the reviews! I had 20 guests in 10 rooms and not one of them had a complaint! They kept telling me how friendly everyone was (grounds crew, service staff...every one) and I agree! The food at the pool bar as good and reasonably priced for a resort...obviously people think they are going to Mexico where everything will be dirt cheap but this is America people and the prices are comparable..except remember it is an island so things have to be imported so they are more expensive. Stick to what is native, RUM, FISH, Plantains...etc and you will be ok. Yes, there were a few minor things that happened, such as my brothers room kept blowing a fuse with the AC but it was quickly fixed. You can't expect perfection but you can hope that any issue is resolved quickly and efficiently, and it was. As for people complaining about musty odors or a lack of shopping should go to the mall for vacation. It is an island, surrounded by water and guess what?...things get humid and damp. Try to remember you're on vacation and have to be a little less stressed and go with the flow. Rent a car and explore the island if you don't want to stay at the resort the whole time...it's not like they advertise being in the shopping district..stay in San Juan if that is what you are looking for...or go 7 minutes down the road and the is an entire outlet center! A few notes on other things: BEACH: natural wild life preserve, excellent for shelling and we did some fun snorkeling too. We found starfish, a living Conch, and sea urchnants. Don't plan on riding the waves...because there are none....if you have water shoes bring them, but enjoy the beach none the less! FOOD: we ate in all 3 restaurants and l liked them all. The Habachi was very fun and delicious, Italian, very good and The dinner buffet (Cafe Solie)- ok for adults but excellent for kids. We had two 10 year olds, a 6 year old and a 4 year old and they all ate well that night! For breakfast I skipped the buffet and just grabbed something from the \"Cart\" (Kisok)...it was a small wagon with juices, muffins, breads and eggs and coffee. All we needed. Pool BAR/GRILL - any one who complains about this has issues. There are lots of people and they serve you as quickly as they possibly can. You can see the guy cooking behind the bar so it's not like they are being lazy...just busy. And the drinks are about $10 but any one who has been to a resort knows this is the going rate! And they were strong and good. I recommend sticking with the Mojitos!!!!!!!!!! (rum, fresh mint, club soda and sugar) If you can, go with the Royal Service (but if you have kids you will probably stick to the main pool and thus not enjoy all of the benefits) but the special lounge, pool and little extras were really nice. My guests didn't have the Royal Service and they all still LOVED the place and all said they would return.

One reviewer said we need to realize that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a premium property so we shouldn't have problems paying for the ridiculously expensive food. Problem with that theory is, that most of the food isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \"premium\". The worst Hibachi food I've ever had. $24.00 a person for the breakfast buffet. Old cold Bacon, some kind of weird scrambled eggs that tasted like whole milk, and the omelet guy was in no way interested in making an omelet for anyone. The Asian fusion restaurant had very good food, but way overpriced. What we did: Rented a car on the 2nd day for around 45.00 a day from Avis, which has a desk there. We kept it four days. You DO NOT have to pay anything for parking if you rent the car there. We went to a local grocery store (Many tourists were in there from Gran Melia doing the same thing) and got some dry goods and a little cold food (lunchmeat and cheese). Gran Melia provides only a small cooler (NOT a refrigerator) which is kept cool by a block of ice because they do not want you bringing food on the property (Which is posted at every entrance) because they cant soak you if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat in the restaurants. It was plenty cold enough for food and drinks. The four days we had the car, we ate local food from the stands on the beach (YUM!) or local restaurants. Stay away from Richies Restaurant. We gave up waiting for our dinner and left after being there for an hour and a half. The place was only 20-25% full, and Richie told me he didn't need tourists business anyway and could have cared less. We also went to public beaches because the beach at the Hotel is useless. The swimming pool was FREEZING. Very rarely were their adults in the pool, just kids cuz they can take the cold. There is no bar outside that you can sit and have a drink with the exception of the swim up bar in the cold water. Makes no sense! The dealers and moneychangers in the Casino were beyond non-caring. You were nothing more than a nuisance to them. On the first night there, we got in late after several delays (NEVER FLY DELTA). We were thirsty and hungry. Nothing is opened after 10 PM, so we had to order from room service. Tried to get a can of coke and water for me and my wife at 11:00 P.M. It took an hour for to get to the room. Some of the employees were nice, others weren't. Get used to waiting, because the staff is in no hurry to help you. Generally, you will not see a waiter after your order until the bill comes. Housekeeping paid no attention to cleaning the small patio. Sometimes the coffee cups weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned. If the property owners had any sense of basic economics, they would just lower prices on the food and people would eat there more and they would make more money. People obviously were not eating lunch and breakfast there much because only 1 restaurant and the WAY OVER PRICED food stand/bar by the pool were opened during the day. They also have a stand by the lobby opened until 2:30 that serves microwave breakfast sandwiches at around $5.00. The place isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that bad if you are willing to rent a car.

While the poolside grill blared salsa music over their PA system, the activity hut speakers alternated between Latin-flavored techno and a live singer performing a hackneyed karaoke routine for anyone who happened to be within a 100-foot radius.

The hotel was recently purchased by Melia. If you are looking for an all-inclusive resort where you can just plop yourself down for an entire week and be entertained and have plenty of places to eat, this isn't the place. That said, if you want a beautiful place to stay that is close to many attractions, such as Luquillo beach, El Yunque, San Juan, etc. and have a rental car, you will enjoy your stay here. Restaurants: The website advertises 6 restaurants, but only 3 are currently operating, and they actually only have 2 open at a time, on a rotating basis. The food was great, but as others have said, service was slow (Toto, we're not in DC anymore!). Since we were four adults who enjoyed each others company, this was not a problem. The food was indeed pricey, but this is what we expect at any resort. Room service is actually cheaper than the restaurants. We skipped the expensive but nothing special breakfast buffet and found a few places just off-site on Route 3 that were local, laid-back, and fun (ala the Point at What You Want menu). The hotel staff can point you to these breakfast spots. Beach: Lovely for sunning and walking, but not recommended for those looking for waves and to run and play in the water. Pool: Gorgeous, huge, not heated, almost empty. We loved it. Rooms: We had 4 adults in 2 rooms and had absolutely no complaints about cleanliness, our beds, none at all. Lovely views of the garden from our balconies. Other facilities: There is construction along the road on the way in to the hotel in preparation for the PGA Puerto Rico Tour that starts March 17. The construction was not visable or audible from our rooms, the pool or the hotel. I would imagine that the place will be stunning when they are done since there is less than a month to go. Staff: Concierge and staff were always helpful and friendly, the front desk staff of course all speak English, and the other staff appreciated it when we attempted to speak Spanish. The concierge has menus for the restaurants, but the menu for the Italian restaurant was not up to date. they also had pre-printed directions to all the local sites. Most of these were great, but we got lost following their directions to Ponce! This, however, is pretty much par for the course in Puerto Rico. As for BUGS: we didn't get a single bug bite, but there are no-see-ums and mosquitos pretty much everywhere in the Carribean. We do however, have a SECRET: About a week prior to any Carribean vacation, we start popping garlic pills twice a day. Even if they are swarming around us, they aren't remotely interested in drinking GARLIC blood. Added benefit: We have never had a problem with vampires either! WEATHER: The resort is close to El Yunque, so there are often clouds for about an hour each day (see attached picture) - if there is wind (usually the case) these will blow off for a lovely sunny day. To sum it up: As members, we hope that the Melia ownership will bring this hotel up to a true 5-star level.

Lunch is OK with about $20 a head at the poolside cafe. If you don't want to pay so much for food, rent a car at the airport and drive in, so you can go off property to eat. But mind you, it is $20 a day for the valet and $15 for self-park. One huge complaint - the waiter in the Italian buffet altered the bill to give himself a $35 tip when I had clearly marked only $15 - I pointed this out when I was checking out, and the reception desk tried to brush it off. After I insisted, they spent 30 minutes of my time looking for the signed bill from the restaurant. Of course they couldn't find the bill because the cheatin' waiter didn't dare to send it to the reception. He was clearly hoping I wouldn't notice the extra tip in the overall bill. The idea that I would tip $35 at a buffet is ridiculous, and eventually they refunded me the difference. So watch those bills closely.

It all depends on why you are going here. You would probably hate this place if you are looking for night life and high energy. You would think it was pretty bad if you just wanted a beach to swim in. But if you are looking for a beautiful or romantic place to relax, you may have found a gem. I took my fiance for a long weekend, and it was a lovely experience. THE GOOD: We had an ocean front suite with the jacuzzi tub. The main area of the hotel is very beautiful, lots of marble, candles lit every night, open air, fountains everywhere. The royal service pool was perfectly quiet, we had an amazing bed looking out at the pool and the ocean just beyond. We enjoyed the fact that the pool workers weren't coming over every 15 minutes asking for another drink order. When we wanted something it was a short walk or an armwave. We ate at the Asian restaurant and watched the cook on the grille in front of us. Fun to watch, fun to meet people, and the food was just fine. Cafe Soliel had a great breakfast buffet that would tide you over until dinner if you ate around 11:00. The grounds are nice, above average but not like a Ritz or Four Seasons. The service was acceptable, nothing special but certainly not to the point of complaining. When we wanted to go off site for a local dinner, our butler, Marcos, recommended TACO RICO, which is just east of the resort road on 3, past the shell station about 2 blocks. You will probably pass it the first time, but it is worth the trip! We were the only non-locals and the owner is the only one who speaks english. They do not serve alcohol, but if you want a beer or wine, the owner will go to the bar down the street and get it for you. The food is awesome...let the owner set you up with appetizers and your meal! You won't regret it! The BAD and UGLY: While the \"beach\" is very picturesque, everything you have read on previous posts is true. It looks great! But what is pictured is like a hard clay with lots of rocks and coral that they groom in the morning so it looks a little like sand. Gorgeously landscaped, with chairs and hammocks but not very friendly to bare feet. There is a line of rocks that separates this clay beach from the \"sand\" beach. The sand is very coarse and is more like broken shells than sand. If you have water shoes or plastic flip flops, this is a nice beach to walk, and you can go pretty far. We were with people who saw an octopus, an eel, and a manta ray in the water from walking on the beach. I think you could have some fun and see some fish snorkelling here as long as you don't need the water to be really deep and sandy, but unfortunately the one day we tried, the water was too cloudy. The only other complaint is that the road into the resort is long and with a lot of construction. It detracts from the beauty of the resort to see all the dirt and mud and the lack of landscaping. Overall we had a super relaxing experience. Went to the rain forest and walked to see mina falls and tall tree trail. Saw Luquillo beach where people were surfing on giagantic waves, and spend a lot of time reading books and enjoying the sounds of the surf at the resort. And enjoyed some sunsets over the tree line to the west.

If I sound obsessed about the food, it is because we had to endure 21 meals there. The Royal Service plan is a joke. One morning, I came in to the Royal Service lounge to find a young family grazing over the buffet of breakfast foods, eating while food dropped from the dad's mouth into the tray of food which was to be consumed by other guests. The cheeses were slimey and much of the cold food suffered time and temperature abuses galore! We were afraid to eat some of this. Without giving the details of each day, I will say this: Never go to this resort. You will be extremely disappointed with the service, food, and inconsistencies! The final slap in the face was the bill. Our week was consumed with stressing over what we would be able to eat. OH! And don't ask for the wine list. We did, and after many minutes of waiting, the waitress came back and said that they didn't have 75% of the wines listed. She was reluctant to to tell us this, but finally decided that I was not going to give up! The spa was also a joke. NOT CLEAN. The staff provided basic treatments, which were represented as much more than they really were. The skincare products were absolute crap. The special anti aging facial was $190.00 and was the most uncomfortable 80 minutes of my life, with a nervous gentleman administering the treatment, after not washing his very cold hands. Also, the spa hours are from 10 to 8, but try to book a treatment during the early morning or late afternoon and forget it. All the appointment times seemed to be between 11 and 3, which is prime pool time! We knew there would be no beach. The Royal Service Pool was nice. The only beer we had that was served COLD, was here. Leslie was the best pool guy in the bunch. Our butler, Manuel, was awesome too. But you just knew he couldn't right all of the wrongs at that place. So why complain to him? The Royal Service people (Veronica and Tamary) were helpful in negotiating our complaints with management. From the conversations we overheard at the pool and in the restaurants, many guests were flatly disgusted with what they had paid and the quality of what they received, if they received it at all! It was to the point where, each morning, we would say EXPECT NOTHING. Then, when something good happens, we will be happy! We took a taxi to a seafood restaurant on the last night just to have edible food. The taxi was $120.00 and the meal as much. If you are a vegetarian, you will be miserable here. We do eat fish, but that is it as far as animal products. Ask for veggies and rice, and be prepared to take a potent diuretic the next day, as the use of salt was extreme. Most of the staff was friendly, but they seriously lacked communication, just forgot things, and were generally inconsistent with respect to the rules. The Royal Service Pool was to be restricted to children, no matter what. Yet, every day, someone would have a child under 16 there. This is an example of what I mean by inconsistent. I could go on and on about this. Basically, if you don't have enough frustration and stress in your life, come to Gran Melia Puerto Rico. By the end of your stay, your life will be completely full of it. The resort itself was beautiful. I will give credit where it is due. Our room had a funky yeasty, moldy scent, too. If I were given a free week here, I would return. That is the only way I would ever come back.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHuge New Year Disappointment\u201d", "Author": "fbusa", "ReviewID": "UR12548821", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in a Royal Suite room.

Upon arriving the hotel is so beautiful and the ground look so nice that you couldnt imagine taking any issue with the place but we experienced so many problems with the service that we couldnt ignore it any longer. Upon checking in there was only 1 person at the huge desk and we stood there for about 15 minuted while she took care of the people in front of us (who seemed to have had a problem.) Then we walked to our Bungalow which was touted as an ocean front suite but we couldnt even see what minimal beach there was from our room. The room was not very nice either. It was big, but it was decorated tastelessly, the beds were uncomfortable and the second night there was a pillow on the bed that had no pillow case on it and had dried blood spots. The first night we went to Nami, their on site HIbachi restaurant, it was very good and fun. Order a glass of sake and they fill it up to the top like it's a glass of wine! The next night we went to the Italian place, Tempo, but my fiancee is so picky when it comes to food and all of the \"italian\" dishes had some sort of a seafood twist to them so we left and ordered room service, this was the worst of it. The room service took 1 1/2 hours to get to our room, and when we called after 45 minutes to see what was taking so long they took our order again as if they didnt have it in the first place, I had already fallen asleep and then when it got to us it was the wrong order and we'd been charged for things we didnt even get! We also tried to make reservations both nights for the restaurants and couldnt get through to the restaurant or reservations either night. On the whole the managers seemed very helpful, the porters and the concierge but the other staff just honestly didnt seem to give much of a thought to the guests. A few times while trying to get towels for the pool we had to wait for the young girl to get off of her personal cell phone. I believe that this hotel used to be an all inclusive or still partially is and the staff still has the all inclusive mentality, that you've already paid for it so they dont have to do much more for you. The last issue I had was the \"Royal Service\" part of the hotel. It costs a lot more to get the \"Royal Service\" and you get a butler and there's a separate pool, etc. It just seems as if they flaunt it, you cant go to the pool which is much nicer, calmer and has a private bar (it's HELLISH trying to get anything from the WET pool bar and the foo dis not good.) It just seems like the people who pay for \"Royal Service\" dont get perks, they get a whole separate experience. It was very elitist to say the least.

Many visitors to the Grand Melia don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand the economy of tourism, especially in poorer areas and have set too high expectations. In short, if you have a Wal-Mart budget \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stay home. Several reviewers were accurate with their assessments and I will echo their advice. The Melia just took over from the Paradisus this year, which was an all-inclusive family style resort. My impression was the employees are still adjusting to different hotel policy. Loungers and towels still had the old name on them. We had a great time because we did our homework, and you will too. Below is my advice for this resort. 1. Transport: Rent a car. For the whole trip. From the airport. We got 5 days with full insurance and prepaid gas for $235. Not hostage to shuttles, or schedules (blah), or the onsite Avi$$. Yes parking fees are charged, but so does every other hotel in PR. There are two lots inside the gate, right is closer, left is the remote lot. Nearby is El Yunque, Luquillo beach, Fajardo. 2. Royal Service: premium \u00e2\u20ac\u0153club style\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd service. Basically an upgrade in room, attention and treatment, running from $75 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c100 more per night. You have your own lounge with complimentary hors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 douerves all day, free Internet and a comp bar from 7-9 PM every night. Plus any room or activity issues you go through them, and not other departments. Use of the Royal service pool. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a better class of service. Highly suggest. 3. Meal Plans: The Melia needs to rethink their AP and MAP plans, way overpriced. We prepaid our breakfasts (at $20 pp over 4 days). The buffet style breakfasts were plentiful, with omelet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, waffles made to order. For dinner, slow service meant long waits at TEMPO. Decent food, I give it 3 stars out of 5. At the Palm, Puerto Rican Paella was excellent. Reservations are not taken, its FCFS. Kids will be everywhere. Not too many fine dining options near the hotel, we ate out one evening at the Rio Mar, about 5 mi down Route 3. 4. Food and Beverage: Pricey. Prices are as other reviewers stated. On Route 3 make a left out of the access road \u00c2\u00bc mile on left is a strip mall with a BK, a KFC, a Subway and AMIGO \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their version of a Shop Rite.. Soda & beer at supermarket prices. A good way to keep the lunch and beverage costs down. 5. Rooms and grounds. Beautiful. Rooms look freshly painted. Gardens are full, lots of color. Main pool is enormous, with plenty of lounge chairs (could use more umbrellas). Beach: a disappointment. Rocky, red sand. Sea grass. Good for sailing, not for snorkeling. Calm. If you want surf \u00e2\u20ac\u201c go to Luquillo, about 10 miles away. There is a kids club, and there are games, bikes for the young ones. 6. Main building. Open air. Lots of chaise lounges & sofas. Gardens & fountains everywhere. Clean. Live music at the bar every night.

They really give you no alternative. On the other hand, the food is extremely expensive. Can you imagine paying for a Chicken sandwich US$20 plus tax, tips, fees? Also, with these prices, be careful with tips, they can rack up to be quite an amount. Also, it is impossible to be there in the summer time, there's no A/C in the lobby or bar area.

From the time when we first arrived and until we left there were little experiences that added up to up to us both making the determination we would not come back, nor recommend this place to friends. Arriving from the airport the cab dropped us off at the wrong hotel, we were left at the golf resort, which is on the same grounds, but about a mile away from the Gran Melia. My friend and I knew our adventure had begun! Arriving at the Gran Melia the welcome was nice and the the hotel looked very inviting. Check in was good and our bags were brought to our rooms. We had a handicap accessible room, although neither of us is handicapped. We just assumed this was the only room they had with two double beds. The room was nice, however it was missing little things you would expect out of a four star hotel, a mini-bar, note pads and pens, a \"do not disturb\" sign, a guide book that discusses the hotel, the amenities, local attractions, etc. Not having these things did not dampen our experience, but I would expect a four star hotel to have these things at a minimum. The beach - well I always heard about the beautiful beaches of Puerto Rico, but the Gran Melia is not on one of those beaches. The path to the beach was filled with rocks, which in bare feet is somewhat of a challenge to walk and water and beach itself were also filled with rocks. You could not lay out on the beach with a beach chair because there was not enough space, not b/c there were tons of people, but because the beach was more like a small patch of grassy area. The water was beautiful once you got past the rocks and the non-beach area, but the Melia cannot take credit for that. Beach experience - Grade C Before laying on upper level of the beach (grassy area near pool) we asked the pool bar/restaurant for food and drinks. The wait staff did not seem eager to assist us. Several staff just stood around talking while we were standing at the bar and the waitress who finally assisted us seemed like she would have preferred to do something else with our time. We eventually got our food and drinks, which were okay, however, that was the only contact we had with the beach staff. One would expect (or at least we did!) that someone would come up and take out plates and cups, no one did, one would also expect that they would ask if we wanted anything else, no one did. We were on our own! If I am staying at a four star beach resort I would like someone to come and see about me, but we came to the conclusion that attention to customers was not their strong point. Another slightly annoying fact is that we couldn't pay for anything in cash, we had to charge eveyrthing to the room. Beach and Beach Service - Grade C Restaurants - well there really weren't any choices b/c only one restaurant was open! The restaurant was \"fine dining\" and the food was okay, but again for a four star place, why only one eating option??!! I would suspect that on a beach vacation most people would want to grab a burger or something non-fine dining, however, there was no type place to go to. Now we were told that there was room service, which there was, but since we did not have a book in our room with a menu we called to the front desk. What was give to us was a paper print out of the menu, again, not very four star like! The food took 45 - 60 minutes to arrive and when it arrived it was a bit cold, and the order was wrong! I definitely think there were some language barriers to ordering. Breakfast was okay at the buffet. Food and Restaurants - Grade C Transportation - now I mentioned above the cab from the airport dropped us off at the wrong location, which wasn't a huge problem b/c the shuttle from the Gran Melia came and picked us up. However, my friend and I wanted to leave the resort and go into town (15 minutes away from the hotel) and the cab ride cost us an arm and a leg! Considering it takes about 5 - 8 minutes to get off of the resort grounds, $30 for a 10 minute ride seems excessive! However, the ride into town was worth the meal we received at a restaurant called Sandy's. Great food and a great waitress! That meal was the best meal of the whole trip but the only meal eaten outside of the hotel. We had to hire the same cab to take us back that brought us to town, for some reason only certain cabs are allowed on the property - a round trip fare for a twenty minute ride $60. I think that is waaaaaay too much! Transportation - Grade C Guest Services - well, the people who drive around in the golf carts were attentive in asking me if I needed a ride anywhere, but short of that there was little to no customer attention. All of the staff had the same \"don't bother me\" attitude. When you asked for something they got it (or tried to) but other than that they seemd like they didn't care about your stay. Guest Services Grade - D I could go on and on about the averageness of this place or the lack of things a standard four star hotel should have but I will leave you with this. My first night in the hotel room I kept waking up thinking there was a mosquito in the room. I checked the bed, pulled the sheets off, looked at the mattress, but didn't find anything. But each night I felt the same way, but could never find anything. But each morning I woke up with more and more red marks on my arms and legs. These marks are not mosquito bites, and after some investigation they may be bed bugs. Psychologically I don't feel ilke leaving my house for people staring at the marks on my arms and legs! I should not be stressed out after vacation about whether I am bringing bed bugs into my house!!!! Thankfully my roommate didn't get any bite marks, but I did see a few other people at the hotel with the same bites on their arms and legs. Bed Bugs - Grade F After all I mention above this is not a place I would go back to or recommend to my friends.

A large pool with built in lounge chairs and tables to place the tropical drink you just got from the swim up bar. Shuttle cars leave regularly from the open-air lobby to transport you to and from your room. Four elegant, high-priced restaurants cater to your dining needs and a buffet breakfast stocks more food than you could possibly sample. Now imagine you want to leave the resort and experience the culture of Puerto Rico. You want to hike the waterfalls of El Yunque, the only rain forest within the U.S. National Forest system. You want to swim at Luquillo beach. Then you discover the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dilemma: the resort is so far off the beaten path and the prices to leave it so high that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to leave. However, with the prices incurred on the resort, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to stay either. You soon learn that everywhere you turn another guest has a horror story to share. They are commiserating in paradise, over delicious strawberry daiquiris, about slow customer service, long check in lines, false promises, and exorbitant costs. Since the Gran Melia used to be the Paradisus, an all-inclusive resort, the clientele was mixed when we were there. Adding to the tropical flair are the bali-beds, draped in canopies with soft cushions. A romantic dream that can be rented for $30.00 per day. You can frolic in the pool or on the beach on a $15.00 per day raft. Towels are free in exchange for your room number, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t loose them or you will be charged, from what we heard the price per towel ranges from $75.00-$100.00. We chose to have breakfast included in our vacation package. A smart move considering it was the only meal of the day that was guaranteed us. The first three days they gave us a check and we had to take the time to explain we had the breakfast package. We ate a few dinners at the resort restaurants. Here are a few examples of the food options taken right from the menu: Romantico (a fine dining experience in elegant surroundings with excellent service) Salmon Alumando appetizer $13.00 Cordero a la Narranja $37.00 Nami (Hibachi-style dining with a Japanese flare) Teppanyaki Dinner Table $39.00 Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Soleil (considered a steak house) Seabass fillet $27.00 8 oz Rib eye $30.00 Side dish (e.g. baked potato) $7.00 Dessert $7.00 ($8.00 for the Key Lime pie) The other restaurant, an Italian option, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open while we were there. Lunch at the pool-side bar will set you back $12.00 for a hamburger. Now imagine yourself there with children. Many people I spoke to with families rented a $65.00 mid-sized car from the on-site Avis dealer for $117 per day (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s including tax, insurance, and other hidden fees) and headed to the grocery store down the street. We soon rented a car ourselves; a compact car for two days got us off the resort for $138.00. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing my friend was comfortable with city driving, because a cab to San Juan was $80.00 each way, per person. We took the car to El Yunque and after paying $3.00 at the visitor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s center we saw the beauty and spendor of the rain forest, a short, 10-15 minute drive from the resort. The same excursion from the Gran Melia, advertised as a Rainforest Hike to Waterfall Swim (3.5 hours) will run you $97.00 per person. Since getting around was a key frustration for us, I do have to mention that I asked about Sunday services. I noticed a Catholic church on Coco Beach Road, the road the resort is on. I inquired about Mass times and how to get there. Once I found out it was $20.00 each way, per person, I decided that God would understand if I missed mass this week. A side note about renting a car: There is also a $15.00 per day parking fee that you are not informed of. We learned, however, from one of the other hotel guests that the parking ticket can be validated in the Casino with minimal gambling. Short of the canned hotel information, I felt uninformed about how to enjoy my vacation. I felt as if the staff at the Gran Melia did not want me to leave the resort except by the means they provided. By the time I figured out how to have the vacation I wanted, my time was up. I wish the staff was forthcoming and told me to go enjoy a dinner in Old San Juan or to take the car to Fajardo for the experience of a life time. There was very little in the way of entertainment and thus, the nights were boring and rainy day proved long and uneventful. I may have been looking for the experience I had at the Divi in Aruba last year where dancing and shows were provided every night. Music in the lobby and one show with dancers (that we found by chance) did not do it for me. I can overlook the mistakes that happened to us: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The hotel transfer was not communicated properly. Once we found where to go our luggage took one bus and we took another. We were even asked to get off of the first bus because it was a private group. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Our room not being ready (even though we made the reservations well in advance and specifically requested two double beds). A hospitality room was offered to us where we changed and stayed by the pool. My friend asked for a complimentary drink at the lobby bar for our troubles, which was granted by the front desk, but not the bar tender. A manager was summoned. After a few hours we were placed in a room that was first offered us (unacceptable due to the travel party). We did not get in our proper room until 10:00 that night (check-in was at 3:00, our first room was promised to us by 5:00). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Our luggage was sent from the hospitality room to the first incorrect room (the one that was describe during check in that we specified would not work for our party). Some clothes were lost in transit, but then later found and returned. My friend requested a complimentary dinner for our troubles which was granted by the front desk. No one in the restaurants had known about it. We did finally get it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2A party at the resort (not for hotel guests, but sponsored by Budweiser) was not well thought out. We took our rental car into Old San Juan returning about 10:00 p.m. It took us 32 minutes from Old San Juan and 40 minutes waiting in a line of traffic to get into the Gran Melia. No accommodations were made for hotel guests. To add insult to injury when we got to the front of the line the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lot closed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign went up. We explained that we are hotel guests and were redirected to the Avis lot that was already filled with cars from the Budweiser party. We did not have the option of attending the Budweiser party. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2They tried to charge us for our breakfast included in the vacation package for the first few days. The Gran Melia traps you in an overpriced paradise on the wrong side of the island (if you are there to experience beautiful beaches. We did not see anyone swimming, nor did the beach water look inviting to us.) The staff will try to make you feel as if you are the most important entity to them, while they never follow through with promises. The right hand doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what the left hand is doing is an extreme understatement. As far as I can see there are two choices at the Gran Melia; stay on the resort and pay for overpriced meals and excursions (but then you miss the real local flavor of Puerto Rico), or rent an overpriced car and get out and live the culture with the locals.

Well to our surprise, ONLY 1 RESTAURANT WAS OPEN FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK and the japanese (NAMI) is opened only on Fri & Sat. Now that is totally riduculous. You go on a vacation and expect to have a nice dining experience but you are stuck eating the same food. We had to rent a car to go out of the resort to eat after 2 days of the same food. We went to Old San Juan (Highly recommended) & El Conquistador (Highly recommended). DON'T STAY AT GRAN MELIA. * Service: The service experience from the restaurant to the pool side was THE WORST. Gran Melia just doesn't care of taking care of their guest. If we asked for a drink, it seemed that we were bothering them. After complaining about 10 times to various management and front desk, their only excuse was that people were laid off. Even the people working there all agreed that service has gone done after Gran Melia took over from Paradisus. The restaurant personnel are not trained properly on how to serve guests. People don't care to wait on guests. At least in Mexico, the service personnel are eager to help the resort guest. That is not true of this resort. * Quality of Food: We ate at both the Italian and Japanese and it was well below par. The japanese restaurant hibachi grill cook used a ton of soy and all you tasted was soy sauce. The breakbast buffet (almost $30/person) didn't have a variety. On a postive note, the rooms and the resort layout was beautiful but that doesn't help when your overall experience was horrible. I spoke to their management and they seemed not to care.

It was not that well prepared for the price, sides cost extra and the service was not that great. More over we felt as if we were suppose to tip very high...we didn't.

When we arrived at 2pm we were strearnly warned that \"like I told those people before you, you're early and there's nothing I can do for you until the 3 pm check in time.\" That was our mistake and understandable, however, not being able to check in until 6pm was unforgivable. It included waiting in the check in line 3 times, each time in excess of 45 minutes. After the second time (and 430pm) I asked if there was a way I could avoid the line a 3rd time when we were told our rooms would be at least another 60-90 minutes, she said yes, just call the front desk...I did....no one answered. When the rooms were ready, two of them were incorrect and wouldn't be changed, single instead of doubles and one of the three rooms was not ocean view as requested. The rooms are exceptional in size and nicely decorated. However, two of the three rooms had ants, the night stands were sticky with spilled \"something\" from the previous occupants. The bathtub appeared unclean. The two with ocean view rooms, had incredible views. Since we weren't allowed to check in until 6pm and weren't given hotel information it was too late to make reservations at the on site restuarants, so we ended up making the best out of it with a $180 rooom service bill (nachos and $13 hot dogs). The resort is very isolated, so if you don't have a car you are at the resorts mercy. Expensive restuarants, a single small gift shop with $6 bags of pretzels, that they are more likely to be out of than have them in stock (while they are waiting for their deliveries that were suppose to arrive days before). The resort is very spread out which lends to its beauty, but if anyone in your party has difficulty walking long distances they will spend long periods of time waiting for golf carts to drive them to their destinations. One our rooms wasn't made up one day, yet they did remove the old towels, however, it took 3 calls and several hours to get fresh towels. The ice machines are not near the hotel rooms, rather they are in cabanas along the pathways and they didn't have ice. This is not what I would consider a \"beach\" resort. The \"beach\" is only a few feet across with little actual sand. A few feet out into the ocean, the ocean floor is covered with some slimy form of sea grass, and the beach is often \"frothy\".

A high percentage of the reviews were correct and I should have listened. THE CHECK-IN: Everytime I walked thru the lobby there was a line that was 10 people deep. Expect to spend an hour in line awaiting check-in. They move slow down there. ROYAL-SERVICE: We did upgrade to the Royal Service and ROYAL it is not. The breakfast buffet for Royal Service is from 7-9. Who gets up that early while on vacation? Other than the Royal Service pool (no kids allowed) there is really no need to upgrade to Royal Service. Shout out to Leslie at the pool. Oh, the Royal Service lounge has free drinks from 7-9, but the service is awful. The ladies at the reception desk in the lounge don't even look up from their computers to say hello and butlers don't really address you either. My suggestion -- only do ROYAL SERVICE if you get the beach front room. At this resort, it isn't worth the $$. THE ROOM: Nice, but just nice. There is a constant mildew smell, but it is close to the ocean and you're just going to have to get use to it. Other than that, the rooms were cleaned on time; ample towels; mattress is comfortable. I'd give the room a B-. ROOM SERVICE: If you want hot food -- don't order room service. They say 30-40 mins. to receive your food, but it's more like 1 hour. One day we waited 2 hrs. and then had to call the General Manager of the hotel to get someone to respond to taking the charge off of our rooms. They're explanation? \"We don't have enough butlers to bring it over to your room\". So it sat there until they found someone. In a nutshell -- awful service. FOOD: This place is expensive. $23.50 for breakfast buffet. $26.50 for lunch and for dinner you must make reservations. Since their ideas of service are different than the continental U.S. you just don't feel comfortable spending $50/per person for a lackluster dinner.

After 2 years staying at the El Conquistador, we decided to give the Gran Melia Puerto Rico a chance. My parents had stayed here before (when it was the All Inclusive Paradisus). However, my wife and I had not. Structurally, from the outside, the hotel doesn't look like much. However, once you enter the lobby area, it's a beautiful resort and nicely decorated. The pool area is the main focal point and it's also very nice. The rooms are some of the largest and nicest I've come across (with large bathrooms, large balconies, and marble throughout). Instead of one large high rise building, the hotel is spread out with one main building housing the lobby, casino, shops and restaurants, and several bungalows where all the rooms are located. These are spread out throughout the property. We were in bungalow 10, and even though it wasn't the farthest one from the main building, it was still a 1/4 mile walk.(distances are marked along the paths). Golf carts are constantly going by taking guests from building to building, but don't hold your breath for one. During the 3 days and 2 nights we were there, I was only able to ride them once. This hotel became a Melia resort a few months ago, and unfortunately, the transition seems to be hurting them some. I hope that they can iron the problems because it's the only way that it can truly be a 5 star resort. We encountered some problems, which could've ruined our vacation, however, we tried to make the most of it: - CHECK IN: Veeeery slow. We arrived at 6:00pm. Our reservation was nowhere to be found and they tried to convince us that we had only reserved one room and the hotel was full to capacity (I was not planning on spending my vacation sharing a room with my wife along with my parents!). I asked the lady to allow me to look up my email account where I had saved my confirmation which obviously stated two rooms. Magically, the second room appeared. FINALLY, one hour and 10 minutes after arriving at the hotel, we were on our way to our rooms. The golf carts were nowhere to be found, and after waiting some more, we decided to walk the 1/4 mile to our bungalow. Unfortunately the luggage didn't arrive until 9:00pm (3 hours after we first arrived)! We kept calling, and calling and they kept saying that they were very busy (and apparently the front desk team was also understaffed). - THE ROOM: As mentioned before, it was one of the nicest rooms I've ever had at any resort. The only negative was that there were three phones, but the only one that worked was the one in the bathroom by the toilet! - HOUSEKEEPING: We left our room at 7:00am and returned at 4:00pm only to find out that the room had not been cleaned. We called for clean towels which were delivered promptly. The maid knocked on our door around 5:00pm, but by then, we didn't care about having our bed made so we thanked her but told her not to worry. Once again, I believe their housekeeping team was also understaffed. - FOOD: The only place to eat something without getting raped with the prices is the grill by the pool. Even though $13.50 for a burger is insulting, we expected these prices since this was a resort. The breakfast buffet was $23 per person. Dinner at the Tepanyaki restaurant was $39 per person. Even though the food is obviously overpriced, it was very good. We did feel sorry about our waiter at the restaurant for dinner. Usually, at resorts, and in order to maintain the service that is expected, you would expect several people serving you at once. Our poor waiter was doing an excellent job, but he was all by himself, running like crazy between 2 tepanyaki tables with 10 people at each one, cleaning, bussing, taking orders, serving drinks, cleaning again, serving desserts, and still managed to keep a smile. Dinner was a 2 hour affair, mostly waiting and watching our waiter run from one table to another, but the food was very good. Once again, the problem here seemed to be with staffing. -ENTERTAINMENT: We went to the bar area after dinner, where they had live music, featuring traditional and fun music from the island. It was definitely very entertaining. After that, we went to the casino which is terribly small, but we aren't big gamblers so we didn't care much. After that, we returned to our room where we attempted to get a movie on pay per view, only to find out that we couldn't order because the hotel reservation system didn't show anybody checked in to our room (??). They promised to fix it, but after waiting for 20 minutes, we decided to give up on that idea. FACILITIES: Very nice, but some construction going on as part of the transition. It didn't bother us too much, but there was some jack-hammering during the day which didn't mix too well with the \"serene\" atmosphere of a beach resort. Overall this resort will be great once all of the problems mostly caused by understaffing and renovations are addressed, but the experience we had was somewhat dissapointing. The rate was great, but after staying there, we understood why this resort was mysteriously priced substantially lower than all the other resorts in the island....", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "shelton, ct", "Title": "\u201cnever again\u201d", "Author": "sus430", "ReviewID": "UR8123571", "Content": "myself, my husband, and my 2 teenage children spent our 4th of july vacation at the Gran Melia.

The room, for example, did not smell musty and was clean, although the shower took a long time to drain. However, it still has a ways to go, and some things can't be fixed. For example, unlike every other resort I've ever seen, the pool, nice as it is, isn't in the center of the resort but off to one end, a VERY long distance from the rooms. During our stay the shuttle ran fairly often until a convention came and most of the shuttles were reserved only for attendees. The beach is narrow and the water not very inviting, although one employee said that will be fixed when the hotel convinces the government that they should be allowed to blow up the reef! Renting a car is a must, considering the cost of the hotel shuttle and on site restaurants. I never saw a taxi at the property. Unfortunately, the hotel charges $10 a day to park, even though its in the middle of nowhere. And the system for paying couldn't be more annoying and inefficient. Every time you enter the property you must take a ticket. When you leave you have to have the ticket validated at the parking office at the opposite end of the hotel from the rooms. Apparently they never heard of a parking pass. The 15 unnecessary speed bumps on the way out to the main road manage to make the experience even more annoying. We never ate at the hotel, instead we bought pastries and drinks at the very good but inexpensive bakery on the main road and kept them in the small refrigerator in the room.

The photos showed a beautiful smiling family on a white beach, and also a man relaxing in the waves of a blue ocean on a lounge chair. I really think Gran Melia should remove these photos as they certainly are misleading. AND in addition, there was non -stop construction at the pool/beach area- and I mean JACKHAMMERING!

I prepared myself for what to expect (as always!) by reading the reviews and complaints of previous guests. I have learned to take other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinions with a grain of salt since some people are just overly picky. Good lesson for everyone!! We had a few hiccups during our stay, but nothing major. The A/C wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working our first day. We called to report it, and within about 20 minutes, someone arrived to fix it. He made one minor adjustment and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have another problem. The pool was great. The size of it was nice, and it allowed everyone to have their own space without feeling like you were invading someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The cabanas around the pool were a perfect touch. We had a place to put our stuff and relax, out of the sun. And the bar was good too :o) The beach wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best, but I was FAR from disappointed. And yes, there is vegetation in the water. Not all over, but most of the beach area in front of the Gran Melia has some sort of seaweed close to the shore. BUT, I love to snorkel, and with the vegetation so close to the beach, there were LOTS of tropical fish extremely close to the shoreline that were perfect for my 8 year-old to see. She had never snorkeled before so that provided an excellent experience for her! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about going out deep; it was convenient to do it in 2-3 feet of water! Someone complained that there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any waves. I saw that as a good thing as well. I got GREAT digital pictures of the tropical fish just by standing over the water and snapping pictures. They turned out better than my underwater camera! One really neat thing was the lizards that run around the resort. Being from Florida, we have lizards everywhere. But these suckers were HUGE. And quick I might add! We also had an iguana that perched itself on a rock in the small pond right outside our bungalow. It always caught our eye as we walked by. Besides the prices the resort charges for the meals (which again we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay), the only other complaint I would have is the service in the restaurants. On one occasion we had to wait to find out who was responsible for our table (to sign the bill) so we could leave! The hostess got us drinks and we had no service during our entire meal. But again, since we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying the bill, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too upset :o) We rented a car for one day from the Avis counter at the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.that was a little frustrating. It took us about an hour and a half to finally get into the car. I returned the keys within the 24 hour period, but was still charged for two days when I got my credit card statement. Avis corrected the charge, but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy about having to call to fix an error that should never have happened. Overall, I think the experience was good. We had been to Puerto Rico before, so we knew what to expect from the island. Many people think that just because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Caribbean island, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a tropical paradise. The island itself is quite poor and rundown. So the Gran Melia was a great escape for us. I definitely feel there are opportunities for improvement. But that goes for just about anywhere you go. Do your research, know what to expect, and make sure you plan ahead for what you want to do while away on vacation. I am a planner by occupation, so it kind of comes naturally.

I must say, when I got to the resort, I thought it was incredible. The pool was gorgeous, the view was breathtaking and the hotel was beautiful. I was a little disappointed that the outdoor grill wasnt open due to the resort making some changes. Unfortunately, I do have to agree with the other people who reviewed this resort. They definitely nickle and dime you to death here. We had the meal plan thank goodness which covered our breakfast and only covered either lunch or dinner so we mostly used it on our dinner. Our first day when we got here, we were about to starve and ate at Caribeno which was a buffet. We about had a heart attack when we got the bill which was $53 without the tip. There wasnt much else to do though bc the resort doesnt offer any type of sandwich shop which wouldve been nice for lunch instead of a huge buffet. After that, we felt like we had to eat all we could bc of the price so we endd up overeating all week!! My husband went and played golf at the Coco Beach golf club and it was very nice. The views were gorgeous with mountains on one side and beach on the other. The golf club is right down the road but the resort charged us $20 to drive us down there (Pretty ridiculous if you ask me) I went to the spa the same day for a massage. It was great but it was very pricey and I think very comparabe to the $80 massages I normally get where I live (ended up paying $135 as gratiuity is included). We decided to order room servie one night to save money and my husband wasnt feeling too good. All we ordered was 2 grilled chicken sandwiches (no drinks) and a slice of choclate cake....oh yes, they charged us $60!! I simply couldnt get over the food prices my whole trip down there. If anyone frm the resort is reading this, you MUST add an affordable lunch option!! I would say that the food options were my only complaint. The staff was very nice (esp Mark and David), the tour desk and concierge service. Our room was nice with a nice view (was a little far away from everything though). Overall, we had a great experience with this resort. If I give a low score, it's only bc of the lack of food options and the expensive food prices.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dover, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful but has problems.\u201d", "Author": "claudster22", "ReviewID": "UR7796346", "Content": "We stayed at the Gran Melia PR from May 29-June 4, 2007 for our honeymoon. First off, the hotel is beautiful. The grounds are gorgeous, the pool is awesome and without a doubt the best thing about this hotel. The beach although not very swimable is very pretty as well. The lounge chairs everywhere are relaxing and the cabanas surrounding the pool area are great to lay down, relax and take a good nap. The room was spacious and beautiful as well. Very high celings with a very large marble bathroom. However................. there were many drawbacks. The food and drinks are extremely overpriced and too expensive to really be able to enjoy. We were on a budget, but even if we weren't still think prices are too high. We ate only at the Avocado once for breakfast. All the restaurants are buffet or a la carte. The breakfast at the Avocado although they had a great variety, was mediocre. We payed $48 just for my husband and I and it was not worth it! All the food was cold, the eggs rubbery, the bagels stale an dry. I even spotted a few flies flying around the cold cuts. Pretty gross! Needless to say at those prices we did not eat at the hotel again. The pool swim up bar closes at 6pm! Not much fun if you are on vacation. We could not enjoy the swim up bar either because they charged us $20 for a Long Island Iced Tea and a substitue for a Mojito (they ran out of mint and mix)! The drinks were practically non-alcoholic too. Very weak. Beers cost $8-9 dollars a piece! From then on we went to a loca supermarket, stocked up on beers and wine, bought a foam cooler and kept it in our room. They don't let you walk around with glass bottles or glasess though, so make sure you get some plastic cups too. The Mirador Grill one of the other restaurants by the pool was closed the whole time we were there. Apparently they will re-open again, but what a shame we could not even try that one out. It's an outdoor restaurant with views of the ocean. You are not allowed to eat outside at any of the other restaurants even though they have chairs and tables set up outside. The biggest issue with this hotel is the parking. What an incovenience and mess! Not only do you have to pay $15 a day to park your car, but they do not even have enough spots to accomodate all the people staying there. During the week not as bad, but on the weekends they have a lot of proms, graduation parties, weddings, etc. On two separate occassions we came back from the beaches outside and could not find parking anywhere. We had to valet park. It was an unorganized mess. The worst part was that later on that night when we tried to go out of the hotel for dinner, they could not find our car. They had lost the keys to our car and it took them an hour to find it! Needless to say we lost our dinner resrvations and by the time we got to the restaurant it was closed. They need a better parking system and more parking spaces. It seems they cater more to their weekend party people than their guests. Another thing, the hotel is located in an area that is far and isolated from the highway (Rt. 3). Just to get out of the hotel we had to drive 5 min. and go over 15 speed bumps (yes, I counted). What a hassle! It makes you not want to go anywhere, which is probably what they want. Aside from those problems, the service was pretty good. People and staff were nice and friendly. Jose at the front desk was very helpful and accomodating when we checked out. After telling him our problems he was kind enough to knock off some of the parking fees and a discount on our whole bill. This is a good place to stay only if you plan on being in the pool all day and spending all your money there and nowhere else. If you are the type of people who like to explore and experience being in another country, this is not for you. We ate at Amadeus in Old San Juan once, it was delicious. There are also 2 restaurants off of Route 3 East, one called El Meson next to a Suzuki dealership and one near entrance to Whyndham Rio Mar called Antojitos.

We had read the many reviews so were a little nervous about what we were getting ourselves into. We went with a big group of family. We knew there had to be some catch because we got a great price for a \"5\" star resort. The hotel was about 35 minutes from the airport. It was not a bad ride at all. I will start with the bad.. We get to the hotel, pull up and just sit there with our car inthe front(being that we had gone to many other 5 stars inthe past we just assumed a valet person would come and open up the doors for us) which they didnt so we sat there. We then waited to check in for about an hour. Not only were there about 2 people behind the check in desk(with a big line) but they kept dissapearing leaving us to wonder if we would ever check in. When we finally checked in, the girl was not partically friendly. She didnt give us to much information when we asked. We finally got our room. We went to the pool(which I have to say is beautiful) I was hungry but apparently there was only 1 place to have lunch which was a 25 dollar buffet. No place for a burger or just a snack The room was far away from the pool but being that we are active people, we didnt mind walking and seeing the grounds( plus they do have shuttles, which I never saw before). When we got back, I went to take a shower and the shower was filthy. There was hair in it! We complained(which we never usually do) and we ended up getting upgraded to a nice suite. The suite was modern and clean. After that we went to Toscano and had a very so so buffet. We ended up talking to the head guy of the restaurants, who explained to us about the changes going on there and to be patient. He ended up picking up the tab for our troubles and giving us a wonderful dinner the next night for a birthday we were having in the family. So they were very accomodating. Long story short, the next few days ended up much better. This hotel is going through many changes from all inclusive to not all inclusive and the facilites are meant for all inclusive so some restuarants do not have bars, 2 out of 5 were closed due to renovations. A few things to know..Although all the buffets are expensive, You can have continental breakfast for half price at the buffet. We did not know this till the last day. We ended up having fruit, cereal, and all breads for 1/2 price. They dont tell you that though you have to ask. It is the same for lunch.Romanticos was a nice place to eat with good service. Toscano, the buffet was not worth the money. There are restaurants and delis outside the resort on the main road you just have to ask where. I believe in about 6 months this resort will be lovely and much better. The grounds are really beautiful and serene. We went to ElYunque(not a bad 20 Minute drive) and hiked for an hour and to Old San Juan, about an hour drive. Defintely rent a car!! and NOT from Dollar!! Its cheap but u get what you pay for.

I asked for bread before our dinner, and she said go ahead and get some at the buffet counter...We did not order a buffet....I ordered wine. It was one of the smallest glasses to put wine in... 6.

I didn't have much choice though. I was a cheapo for our honeymoon, and I have been paying for it ever since. I was told by our travel agent that we were getting the Royal Service for no extra charge, which may or may not be true. And, I think if not, then not, our agent was only relaying what she saw on her screen. Anyway, we got a beach-front room even though we were told we were only getting a garden-view room. Maybe it was a mistake. Whatever. I didn't complain about it. It was a great room. Food -- Pretty good! I think almost everything there was good, but I was told by many that the sushi was lousy. We ate at every restaurant, and I had no complaints except that maybe the AC was a little intense at Toscano. I had filet mignon every night, except for the night I had a ribeye. Ahhhh. We were on the all-inclusive plan. (More about that later.) I cannot imagine what it would cost for a meal. I think the bills for our meals would have been around $150 for dinner alone each night (meal, appetizers, deserts, drinks and wine ). Trust me, if we had not been on all-inclusive, we wouldn't have gotten such extravagant meals. We are simple, humble folk. Remember, money really wasn't an issue. I would have spent most anything to provide my wife with a relaxing vacation. Trust me -- she deserved it. The Royal Service was DEFINITELY the way to go. I loved the Royal Service lounge. Anytime I wanted, I could pop in to use the computer or get a drink without having to wait at the bar. The computer was very nice, and I was able to take care of a little business at home while I was away. Snacks were also provided in the lounge. The Royal Service pool was nice, but small. SERVICE -- People like to talk about the \"laid back\" atmosphere of the Caribbean. Yeah, that's great except for when you're paying $500 per day for your room, and time really is money -- a lot of money. You will spend a lot of time (and money) waiting if you don't raise your voice. Some people call it rudeness. I call it ASSERTIVENESS, and sometimes your level of ASSERTIVENESS must rise to meet the hosts' LEVEL OF APATHY. If someone on the staff is being dismissive or slow to act, SPEAK UP. It's your money. (More about that later.) Remember, YOU DESERVE GOOD SERVICE. if you demand good service, you will get it. If you are o.k. with someone wasting your heard-earned money, then by all means, keep quiet. This is rated as a 5-Start Hotel, and you SHOULD EXPECT BETTER. The SPA: My wife loved it. She had a massage, and some of that other stuff. It was o.k. with me, but I don't really get into spas. I had a massage by a very pretty young lady, and I wasn't sure how to deal with that. I mean, if I'm enjoying it, am I being unfaithful? But, isn't the point of the massage to enjoy it? Every time, I started to relax, I thought \"Oh, this feels too good.\" Then, I would think, hmmm, better not enjoy it too much, right? Oh, too much confusion. Too many questions. And, no booze at the spa. Apparently, drinking prior to getting into a hot tub is dangerous. The ROOM: Very nice -- just like the website photos, but the floor was marble and very slippery. The TV was great. I looked through the pay-per-views movies. There must have been 50 ADULT movies. Geez, how many dirty movies can one person watch in a week? It seemed like overkill. The bed was o.k. The AC was great. Bathroom was nice also. We had a no-so-private hot tub on our porch facing the ocean. It was o.k., but we learned one night that it's REAL easy to lock yourself out. Someone had to come and open the door for us. We also learned that the secondary lock was useless. (It's kinda like a door chain but steel bar instead of chain.) They have been bent open to disable them. The maintenance guy just unlocked the door came right in even though we had the lock on that is supposed to be opened only from the inside. Also, I liked the in-room safe. It opens with a code rather than a key. ROOM SERVICE: LOUSY, LOUSY, LOUSY even though we supposedly had Royal Service. And, when you check in, CARRY YOUR OWN BAGS TO YOUR ROOM. We waited HOURS to get our bags. I had to berate the front deck baggage man just to get our clothing. We wanted to get to the pool, but they were holding out luggage hostage. It was at this point that we started learning about that \"laid back\" attitude that we could come to loathe. We could have easily carried the luggage the five-minute walk to the room, but they insisted so we relented. We didn't make that same mistake when we checked out. POOL: Fantastic, just like in the website photos. BEACH: Not so great. There's a lot of muck and plants in to water, but another person told me that once you get past that the snorkeling wasn't so bad. EXCURSIONS: We went snorkeling with the on-site company. It was just o.k. The water was choppy and deep. It also took forever just to get there, and I was glad when it was over. We used a rental car to explore Old San Juan and the forts -- definitely worth seeing -- as well as El Yunque Rain Forest. El Yunque was o.k., but it looked pretty much like the mountains of NC, which I can see anytime. The only difference were the Coqui frogs. There's a hike they tell you to take to a waterfall -- not worth it, in my opinion unless you LOVE waterfalls and you plan to swim. And, AVOID THE CEMETERY AREA IN SAN JUAN. Just don't go there or to the tiny ocean-side neighborhood next to it. These are DANGEROUS areas. RENTAL CAR: After waiting in line for two hours, I learned that our RENTAL CAR WAS NOT AVAILABLE when we went to pick it up at the on-site HERTZ desk. Our reservation was apparently not a reservation. Instead, your reservation is merely the right to reserve a reservation. There was no car available for our first day, and nothing would change that. After much of my yelling, which regrettably made the HERTZ lady cry, we got a Pontiac Aztec at a very low rate. But, we only got it for one day. The next day we got a Cadillac. The Hertz lady was very nice, but she was constrained by the lack on a computer on-site. She said she didn't know what she would get each day. If you plan to rent, see the Hertz lady a day ahead to get everything sorted out. They most likely will NOT have what you reserved so be prepared to be disappointed. ALL-INCLUSIVE: Better than paying every time, and with the prices like the were -- $8 for a drink, $100 for dinner -- it worked better for us. I'll gladly pay extra to avoid extra hassles. Some people didn't get the all-inclusive plan. There was some kind of an electrician's convention, and one of the wives was begging for drinks at the bar. She didn't have an all-inclusive wrist band on. She claimed she couldn't get the bartender's attention, and wanted me to order for her. It was annoying. I knew what she was doing so I said, \"I will order a drink and swim away. If it's not here when I get back, I'll just assume it got poured out.\" Luckily, the bartender never came back to me. He was too busy taking care of the people who were tipping. TIPPING: In spite of the all-inclusive talk, TIPPING STILL MATTERS. I found that I got much more attention when I gave the bartender a few dollars. We tipped one guy really well, and he spent the evening coming with new drinks for us and a couple we went snorkeling with. One was on fire. I also taught the bartender a new drink. MUCHO DRINKO. MUCHO HANGOVERO. SUMMARY: Pool - A Beach - C Food - A Service - C- (But F if you consider that this is rated a 5-star hotel.)

This place is all inclusive but we hear that is going away. This place has some major problems. It could be so much better with a little work. Here's our story: We checked in and our room on the 1st floor was terribly musty. I read the previous reviews so I knew this may happen. Before we unpacked we called and they offered to Bomb the room with some spray that I knew would not work. They brought a service AC guy who played the acting part and acted surprise about the smell and said the AC was not working but I knew better. We told them to change our room and asked to move up to a 2nd floor room which was better I figured just like your basement often can have a musty smell. It was still musty but better. Still the keys did not work and they had to go back to get new keys. All of this before we even got started. I notice on the thermostats in the room it has a motion detector that the hotel can use to save energy by turning up or off the AC when no one is in the rooms to save money. That is why I am assuming the rooms are musty are that they don't run the AC enough as I asked our friends and their rooms were must y also. The next issue was the restaurants. Only a few were open. Romantico was under construction; another one by the ocean was closed so it was down to basically 1 or 2 places to eat. The problem is you are far away and stuck at the resort unless you rent a car or take a taxi. We ended up eating at the same place for 8-9 meals as thats all that was open. The service was spotty; you had to keep reminding them to bring you water or something they missed. The food was so so. I never saw any managers which is why I think this place is hurting. The staff is doing its best with what it has to work with. They do not have enough people to serve and no one is there managing them. If they had managers at each restaurant and at key places around the hotel it would be so much better. Avocado's was fair to good and so was Bamboo. The rest were not rated highly. They served steak one night and said they had no steak knives but the next night they would. Go figure ! Our bathtub was clogged and drained very slowly so you had to take showers in a pool of water. We asked our friends and some had the same issue. Our room lamp was broken and they had to tape it up. The porch had red ants that were biting. The checkout line during the rush time in the morning had only 1 person to check you out. I could go on. The drinks were all included but they measured 1 shot max for every drink so you never could get buzzed. I stuck with beer so I knew what I was getting. Good things included the grounds, landscaping, pool and pool bar and the bell hop and casino bar. The best was the pool.The service got better during the weekend when more people came to the hotel because they added service people. Good place if you just hang out by the pool. Other than that avoid avoid avoid. We were lucky that the company paid for everything or I would have been really steaming. The beach was unusable due to vegetation and/or coral. Our friends went golfing for $200+ and it was under construction with backhoes and construction equipment all over. They were able to get half their money back after waiting 20 minutes to meet with the golf pro. My take; if they added managers and tried to tackle the problems this place could be so very very good. It could be a great turnaround story. The layout is great and has alot of potential. This place could easily be a Ritz Carlton if they put service first.

From the time we got to our room until the time we left, it all went downhill. For being an advertised 4 diamond hotel we were amazed that the service was so sloppy and the rooms were in the condition that they were in. After check in we got to our room and the key didn't work. That was ok, because these things do happen, but when the securities key didn't work we should have known that it was going to be a problem. After waiting almost 30 minutes to get into our room it got worse. We entered our room and the smell of mildew was so over whelming that we could not stay in the room. The wall where the bathroom was located had water stains and the tile did as well. We called the front desk and told them that we will be going to dinner and passing by to have our rooms changed as per David. After dinner we did just that and we were assured that our bags would be brought to our new room. We spent time in the lobby and finally decided to go back to our newly assigned room after about 2 and a half hours to find that our luggage was not yet moved to our room. It was about midnight and we wanted to get ready for bed in hopes that the next day would be better. Not to mention that the new room also had the smell of mildew. We were very surprised that a hotel of that caliber would have rooms under these conditions. After working in the hotel industry myself in the past, it made me feel as though these rooms were maintenance rooms and the only time these rooms are usually used is when the hotel has been over booked. The service at the restaurants were also lacking. The food was great, but the service was very slow at the Avocado Grill. The Bamboo was wonderful, but our reservation was at 9:30 and we were not seated until 10:15. I think Romantico was the only restaurant in the resort that we had a great experience. Room service was horrid. We ordered room service and it took almost 2 hours to be received and the food was cold when received, not to mention the beverages were warm. Like I said, we were very disappointed and when we mentioned the issues we had, all we received in return was a mere \"I'm sorry\" and nothing was done to make sure that we were satisfied or taken care of for our inconveniences. In my opinion, this hotel is not a 4 diamond/5 stars. I wouldn't even give it 2 stars. Not worth the money. Extremely disappointed as it has such wonderful potential.

The grounds are lovely - beautifully landscaped and well maintained. The rooms are spacious and nicely furnished. (The bathroom is large with marble floors and countertops, large mirror and terrific water pressure). The AC works well - actually a bit too strong for my taste - so the ceiling fan was fine. There was a musty odor when we first got to the room - which seems to emanate from the AC unit. As soon as we turned it off, and used the fan, the odor was eliminated. Negative comments about the staff should simply be disregarded. From the reservation desk, to the poolside bar to the activities center - all of the staff with whom we interacted were friendly and helpful. Everyone we encountered greeted us warmly and with a smile. As long as you are friendly and courteous, you will receive the same in return. The beach is not what most envision for the Caribbean - it is rocky with seaweed patches. But all you would need are aqua shoes and you are set to go. The water is warm and clear - actually warmer than the pool on some days! There are kayaks and boats to use or just a long stretch of coast to walk and find shells. During our trip, the Paradisus was still an all-inclusive. The choice of restaurants was fine. We had breakfast each day at Caribeno - a wonderful assortment (eggs, fresh omelettes, pancakes, bacon, oatmeal, fresh fruit, blintzes, muffins, bagels, juices, and Puerto Rican specialties etc.). It also has a lunch buffet that was great. We had lunch at Mirador grill since it was closest to the pool. The lunch there is average, but one could always find something to satisfy the appetite. The dinner choices (beyond Mirador Grill) were Romantico (adult only, so since we have a teenager and 8-year-old we did not try it); Bamboo (a Japanese hibatchi-style restaurant - very nice, tasty - John Carlo was our chef and was terrific); Avocado (typical steakhouse - make sure to have the shrimp at the buffet - they are large and delicious); Toscano (rather pedestrian Italian fare). All in all, the selections were numerous, the entrees were well presented, and the staff at each restaurant was attentive and pleasant. Keep in mind, this is not a resort know for gourmet food. However, there is something for everyone, and in general, the food was above average. A few tips - check-out is at noon. Be sure to check out at 8:30 to avoid the rush. You can then leave your bags in a locked room near the front entrance, enjoy the remainder of your stay at the pool and then shower and change in a fully-equipped salon next to where you leave your bags. Don't book trips to El Yunque rainforest or Old San Juan through the hotel. The costs are exhorbitant. Instead, rent a car from the Avis representative at the hotel (Gina was ours - she was great). We rented a car for a day ($70) and went to the rainforest (20 minutes away), Luquillo Beach (another 10 minutes away) and then drove back west to Old San Juan. If we had booked the tour through the hotel, this would have cost more than $500 for the 4 of us. We'd go back to Paradisus tomorrow.

All of the entrees were simply drowned in soy sauce and our hibachi chef kept dropping his utensils. But other guests at the resort loved this restaurant, which shows that people like different things. Just remember to make your dinner reservations in advance and you will be fine. And yes, it definitely helps to tip. We did not choose Royal Service, which, by the way, guarantees dinner reservations at any time.

We found the food to be wonderful at Toscana and Avacado. Breakfast was more than adequate, as was lunch. Next time if we're traveling without the kids, we would do the Royal Service. We truly enjoyed the Spa. If you have a treatment, you are then able to use the Spa pool (which is private and very quiet) that same day. The couples massage was wonderful!!

We upgraded to Royal Service. Our review is mixed: we had a wonderful, relaxing time but the customer service is REALLY lacking. First, the Royal Service turned out to be a good thing for checking-in (we were able to bypass the front desk) and for making dinner reservations and also for reserving the \"huts with beds\" at the Royal Service pool. The Royal Service pool was great---not crowded and quiet. No children are permitted. There is also a separate bar at the Royal Service pool. That is the only upside to Royal Service but highly recommend it since we couldn't imagine what the service would have been like if we didn't have it. The food at the resort was excellent. We tried all the restaurants except the Italian. Order the filet mignon where you can. The Asian Fusion restaurant was ok but the menu was limited and again, the service was lacking. Breakfast and lunch are buffets but don't be scared---the food was great and varied. The lunch buffet had fresh fish, sandwiches, hot foods, gourmet salads, etc. The rooms were clean and spacious. Each room has a balcony with chairs. We had no bedbugs as earlier reviews reported (believe me, we checked). We thought the beach was beautfiul. Very natural setting but it is not a beach where you swim in the water so we did hear that people were disapponted in that. You could take beach chairs down to the water but most people were by the pool (which had a great view of the ocean). There is no snorkeling. The problem we had was the service. We have been to a few all-inclusives and the staff would do anything to make your stay comfortable. We were used to the friendly, enthusiastic and proactive service of the staff at the resorts in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. But here, it always seemed like we were bothering the staff when asking for a drink or even checking in at the hostess station and EVEN at the Royal Servie lounge! We found ourselves standing in front of a hostess or at the bar and we would sense this attitude of \"We will get to you when we are ready\". There was no acknowledgment of \"We will be with you in a second\". This attitude was pervasive and it wasn't any better at the Royal Service pool. At points on the trip, it felt like we were on a 'Seinfeld' or 'Curb your Enthusiasm' episode. We would be the only people in line for say, lunch. The restaurant was just opening and there were only 4 people standing there to get in (and NO ONE was in the restaurant). They would not acknowledge that you were standing there until they were ready (we almost thought they were faking busy) and then they would take our names and tell us that it would be a few minutes. This was funny in itself since the restaurant was open and no one was inside. Then seconds later--with still only 4 people standing there--the hostess would seriously yell out our name like she had no idea where we were. We were like, \"we're right here, you just took our names 5 seconds ago.\" If we hadn't spoken up, I was convinced she would have just crossed our name off the list. It became comical. And it didn't matter if you tipped every bartender or server (which we did). Another scenario was when we would request a refill of water or request a utensil or napkin. We would both have empty water glasses and only the person that asked for the water, got a refill. We had to stop the server from walking away so they could refill the other glass. At the buffet, they take away your plate each time you go back up, so usually your fork would be missing when you got back. It was getting so hard to get someone to come to the table that we saw the drawer where they were getting the forks and would just help ourselves. Thank god the food and the resort were excellent or we would have not enjoyed ourselves as much as we did. We did have 2 excellent servers: Harry at the Romantico restaurant and Diana at the Avocado Restaurant. Very friendly and proactive. Glasses were refilled with water and wine and they would check-in with you to make sure you had everything you needed (and if you needed something, they would actually come back to give it to you within a 15 minute period.) So, in summary: despite our frustration with the serivce, if you are booked for the all-inclusive in the next month (the hotel changes hands May 1st--no all inclusive after that point), I would say that you will love the resort and the food. It is a great place to unwind and relax.

I used the in room safe wisely because I heard that $300 and jewelry were stolen from rooms. Someone's door was broken and the guest did not want to leave it open.

I read a lot of bad reviews before going to Paradisus this March and was a bit nervous. I'm happy to report that after a week with my husband and 2 grown sons, we all had a wonderful experience. Check-in was a breeze. We took our luggage to our room so delivery of baggage wasn't an issue. We had Royale Service, which I highly recommend. The room (ocean view) was very nice, clean and well appointed. Maid service was excellent . The Royale Service pool was fabulous. We reserved a private \"palapa\" each day with no problem. The bartenders and attendants were extremely efficient and friendly. (When a gentleman dropped a piece of fruit poolside a nearby bartender quickly picked it up, washed it, and returned it to the man's lounge chair. ) Our \"private butler\" introduced himself to us the first day. And although we never used his services, he saw my husband 3 days later and spoke to him by name! (very impressive) The grounds are beautiful and extremely well kept up and clean. No surprise....the beach was not great - can't really walk it or swim. But the kayaking was fun. We didn't expect gourmet food and didn't get it. (This is the reason I'm not giving this resort a 5* rating) The breakfast and lunch buffets were terrific (But avoid the Mirador Grill - ugh! opt for the Carribean instead) Romantico is over rated. We enjoyed Avocado and Tuscano better. Bamboo is your typical hibachi place.(Avocado has great beef) Overall we found that the beef was much better than the fish -fine for my sons but my husband and I prefer seafood. The snacks that were always set up in the Royale Service Lounge were great. There was a problem with a restaurant booking one night. When the RS manager called to explain we couldn't get the time we reserved at our chosen restaurant, we didn't make a big deal about it. He quickly got us a table at another restaurant. Fifteen minutes later he, along with a waiter, arrived at our room with a bottle of wine and a plate of hors d'oeuvres to make ammends for the mistake. Now that's great PR!!! I cannot stress the cleanliness enough - everywhere! Especially the bathrooms. EVERYONE (maids, shuttle drivers, bartenders, waitstaff, gardeners, watersports staff, etc. etc) was extremely warm and friendly, and always quick to greet us.

We did NOT upgrade to Royal Service, but still managed to have no issue with service or attentiveness by the staff. Example: one night we locked ourselves on our patio. (Actually not that hard to do, so watch out, people!) I flagged down one of the MANY golf carts that drive around offering rides to guests to ask him what we could do about it. (I was in my jammies, as was my husband, and didn't really want to walk back up to the front desk.) The driver stopped the golf cart, even though he had a passenger on it, went to a courtesy phone, had them speak to me to verify I was who I said I was, and then used his master key to get me back in my room. All was taken care of within 5 minutes. We also couldn't have been more happy with the staff - they all had a big smile and a wave for each guest, and went out of their way to help you out. A girl working at the pool taking drink orders even went into the casino to get change for me! I was amazed. And they were all so helpful as far as telling us what everything was - there was a traditional Puerto Rican dance show our first night there, and the VERY busy bartender took time out to explain to us what it was, what its' name was, and why the dance was done. The food was GREAT. Yes, the outside dining (Mirador Grill) has quite a few birds flying around, and you do see them around the salad bar area, so if you get queasy about that, don't go there. The Caribeno (the other casual buffet) is inside and WONDERFUL. The restaurants that require reservations were delicious, and the appetizer buffets are ridiculous. You barely even need your entree! Beware of the 'snack' buffets, though (afternoon and late night) - all greasy stuff. Ick. Chicken wings, pizza, chicken nuggets. I guess that's more for the kids though. All in all, it was Paradise.

However, one night they closed a restaurant for another party and rebooked us. The restaurant manager was actually a bright spot in the bad service we kept encountering. He rebooked us to a restaurant of our choice. Security: We found it odd that we had to shout out our exact room number, when there were bungalow labels. This was required on a shuttle or the casino. My friend tried just shouting the bungalow, but they didn't go for that. We were not surprised to hear of SEVERAL thefts. (Our group did use the safe provided and were fine.) Hygiene/utilities: The sinks and showers were clogged. How elegant does it feel to go into the shower after your friend and stand in ankle deep dirty water?

Or how about a $45 plate of spaghetti with a couple small mussles randomly placed on top. The food was well below \"Elegant\" or worth the cost. We enjoyed a nice dominos pizza the following day for $15 and enjoyed it much more. Staff was less than helpful. They seemed irritated they had to serve you another drink or sign a dinner slip because of the green bracelet. Some of them didnt even know what it meant and questioned me like some sort of criminal for wearing it as if I didn't belong at the resort. To sum it up.

However, Paradisus serves decent food in the buffets, very good food in the reservations required places and has top shelf drinks included - the value is not bad as compared to other places. Paradisus has nice, large rooms with balconies. The beach is OK, not great. But the pools are wonderful and the place is large - i.e. not crowded. The service staff is primarily younger folks (this is not their career unlike what you find in many other Carribean destinations) - you see many of the things that can come with that - service is not always rapid fire or accurate - but it is generally very good. The hotel is well outside of San Juan. If you want to do excursions with a tour company, you get stuck with the inevitable waits you see anywhere in the world.

Driving in PR is easy, rental cars are cheap, picking them up at the airport is fast and easy, self park is close to the rooms. A lot of cool stuff can be done on your own, you don't need a tour company. Or, hook up with the tour company at the destination rather than waiting on a shuttle.

Our party included 18 people ranging in age from my grandparents to young cousins. I am a 29 year old male. I should note here that our last family trip to an all-inclusive resort was a disaster. Stay away from Playa Naco in the Dominican Republic at all costs. Paradisus was head and shoulders above our last experience. The trip to and from the airport was about 40 minutes by van and not bad at all. Our first order of business was an upgrade to royal service. I recommend this move if your budget allows. It provided access to a few extra ammenities including a separate royal service pool (ask for the mojitos), and some upgrades in rooms and dining. The all inclusive food and drink worked out very well for our party. It was great to be able to eat or get a drink at any time, day or night. My uncle was able to force me into a shot of tequila and a beer as I stepped out of breakfast one morning. The quality of the food was very good over all. This included the breakfast (good omelettes) and lunch buffets, and all of the different restaurants on sight. The only negatives here were the slow service at one or two of the restaurants, and some confusion over reservations. Not bad over all. Room service (try the quesadilla) and butlers were also free with royal service. The main pool in the center of the resort was a lot of fun for all including water basketball and other sports. I should note here, if you are a looking for a beach-front resort, paradisus is not for you. The pools were great and there was a beach volleyball court. The sand and beach area were not great. The staff and service was very competent and friendly over all, including one woman with beautiful eyes that my brother is still talking about. Some slow service in the restaurants but we had a party of 18 to serve each night. We were lucky enough to have great weather for most of the week. A little overcast and rain at times. The resort did get buggy at night and my feet and ankles were pretty bitten up all week. On our last night we were fortunate enough to catch the \"white party.\" A dance party where guests and staff (yes she was there) showed up wearing white and we danced and drank until the wee hours of the morning.

After reading many negative reviews I was hesitant but the lure of an all inclusive sealed our stay here. Thanks to the advice of some savvy travelers, the suggestion of upgrading to \"royal service\" was heeded. I firmly believe if you can afford it, upgrade. The service was notably better as far as gaining dinner reservations easily with other advantages such as a private butler. Our butler provided us with special services such as a cheese plate with wine before dinner and they even set up a romantic jacuzzi evening for us. It seemed to be ask and you shall receive. Fortunately we never found service to be an issue. If you travel a great deal, you know- tip when appropriate-yes it is an all inclusive and no you shouldn't have to give extra but if it makes life easier to part with a few singles here and there, why not? You will be amazed how much better attitudes become. Royal service also provides a separate, adult pool that is only for royal service guests. It is a smaller pool but definitely more quiet and allows personalized attention. A word of advice, try to get poolside before 10:00 to insure your own cabana for the day. As other travelers stated, the beach is nothing to be in awe of and swimming there is not ideal. But it still makes for a nice stroll and to dip your toes in. They do have paddle boats and catamarans to enjoy. The 5 star element here is undoubtedly the grounds. Paradisus is a breathtaking place to behold and the attention to its decor is amazing. If only they placed remotely close attention to their food. There is nothing 5 star about it. I have been told that all inclusives almost never have gourmet food. Everyone was right. The food here is fine if you do not expect stellar chef delicacies. We ate at every restaurant except Toscano. Romantico was more upscale and other travelers said it was the best pick. My boyfriend had a delicious lamb entree but my seafood entree was inedible and I had to return it to the kitchen only to be told it would take another hour AGAIN to bring me something. I left hungry and couldn't believe the mis management with that one. I would have opted for room service when we got back but the room service menu is extremely limited.

Also, none of the staff is eager to get you another drink, many times we had to just go to the bar and get our own. This is definetly a beautiful place but for the money you could go to an all-inclusive in Mexico and get much better service and food.

My delight at the goreous scenery, huge pool and luxe furniture faded and soured as the week wore until I was finally so appalled at the way the hotel was managed I gave up trying to enjoy the place. Although the staff generally seemed like nice people trying to do their jobs, nothing went smoothly. Getting an issue resolved from the staff gave me the same feeling of helpless frustration that I often feel when calling a customer support center in Bangalore to get a computer fixed. Minor inconveniences like water not working, bugs in the room, repeat buffet food, or lost reservations might be fine if you're staying here for pleasure and are enjoying all the cocktails the hotel generously pours, however, as a business traveller trying to make efficient use of my short time there, I found the experience quite antagonist. Here's the details of just one of these inconvenineces: Upon check-in, I found tiny ants (or some other bug - hopefully not bed bugs) in my room, and requested to be moved to another room. I was asked if I had called engineering to resolve the issue, and was told that I had to follow procedure before changing rooms. The \"engineering\" staff (an employee with a spray can) sprayed the part of the room where I had seen the ants, and left me with a foamy residue. A few hours later I spotted more ants in other parts of the room, and got some more spray. Not suprisingly, I kept seeing ants and finally when I saw that they had moved into the clothing in my open suitcase, I called and requested a room change. They promised a bellman would come immediately to take me to a new room, and 45 minutes later, the bellman had not arrived and I had missed my dinner. I requested an appointment with the manager the next morning to discuss my frustration with this issue (and several others too tedious to discuss here), and scheduled an appointment at 11 am. I arrived at the check-out desk at 10:15, and was still checking out at 11 AM due to several errors in billing (double charges for phone, etc). I waited for the manager until 11:20, but could no longer wait, and left the hotel feeling insulted and a bit bug-paranoid.", "Date": "January 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockville, MD", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation Place\u201d", "Author": "miav", "ReviewID": "UR6606704", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Paradisus during the Martin Luther King, Jr. weekend. We read the reviews before we booked our vacation and decided to go to Paradisus since our first choice hotel was booked solid that weekend. Thankfully, we were not disappointed. Personnel - 4 out 5 stars 8 out 10 staff members smiled and greeted us. We didn't have any issues checking in or checking out. The operator was always there to pick up the phone and helped us. Everyone was friendly and attentive. Food & Drinks - 3 out of 5 stars overall, but some restaurants are better than others We didn't use room service, so we can't comment on that. We had breakfast at Caribeno and Mirador Grill. We found Caribeno to be better than Mirador Grill for food quality. The outdoor seating at Mirador Grill is nice and convenient if you've been out at the beach or the pool all day, but there were bees by the desserts and pastries - at times I wasn't able to get desserts and pastries because I was afraid of the bees. Mirador Grill is also open for snacks in the late afternoon. We had dinner at Avocado (steak house), Romantico (fine dining) and Bamboo (Japanese steak house). Avocado was below average for your usual steak house - the appetizer and desserts were buffet style, but the main course is ordered from the menu. We liked Romantico and Bamboo much better (both are not buffet style). Make sure to wear pants for Romantico, we saw a guy who was asked to change since he had shorts on. Other restaurants were not as formal, but people did somewhat dress up for dinner. We didn't have any issues with dinner reservations (we made our reservations right after we checked in), but the hotel didn't seem to be booked when we were there. Facility - 4 out of 5 stars The grounds are beautiful and nicely kept. We didn't use the spa service - I called the spa twice but noone picked up the phone, so we just decided not to get spa services. We stayed in a Jr. Suite - it was roomy and clean, it also has a small balcony. We were in building 7 by the villas, which is about 0.3 miles away from the lobby, pool and restaurants. It's a nice walk from the room to the pool because of the beautiful grounds. They have a shuttle that just goes around and around the resort. They always stopped to offer us a ride, but we declined most of the time since we wanted to walk off all that food that we ate! Casino - 3 out 5 stars I'm not a big gambler, but we stopped by one night just to check it out. It is small, but aren't many Caribbean hotel casinos? They have slot machines, blackjack tables, poker tables, roulette and Texas hold'em poker. A great thing about the casino is it's smoke free (maybe not good for some, but this is a great plus for us). Beach - 3 out of 5 stars Definitely not a white sandy beach, but not rocky enough that you need shoes to walk on the beach. Water was calm and warm. We also went out on a kayak and a paddle boat. Easy enough to rent - just sign a waiver and pick one to take out in the ocean. They also have hobie cats and one of the staff members goes out with you. Be careful as you may get stuck when the current is strong and the wind is working against you - my husband had to help these 2 teenage girls who didn't seem to be strong enough to paddle back to the beach. Pool - 5 out of 5 stars Nice, big pool, with a swim up bar. There are jacuzzi areas (not hot tubs) in the pool and also in-water lounge chairs. There were plenty of lounge chairs when we were there. Sunday was more packed, but we always got to the pool early enough (around 9:30 am) to pick our spot. They also have cabanas that you can lounge in, just go early and put your bag or towel there to mark it. Proved to be useful when the intermitten rain came (which usually lasted about 5 minutes and then it was dry and sunny again). Guests I was afraid the resort will be full of drunk college students since it's all inclusive, but thankfully we didn't see any. But we went in January, not during spring break, so I don't know what their clientele is like throughout the year. When we were there, we saw a lot of families (the kids are about elementary school age) and couples (about mid 30's and up). We're in our early 30's and we're happy to have a quiet vacation with no distractions. We didn't see a lot of honeymooners, but it wasn't during a honeymoon season. We did see a wedding party who seemed to have a lovely wedding at the outdoor chapel. Others While we were there, we didn't see one mosquito. We saw birds, small lizards and iguanas in the gardens, but none came close to us. None came in our room either. Thumbs up overall. We'll definitely go back to this resort for a nice, relaxing vacation. This is our second time in Puerto Rico, so we didn't venture out of the resort.

Reception - We arrived at 6:00pm and there was one woman at the reception who was not terribly nice. There was only one family ahead of us but it took us 45 minutes to get checked in. Food - Atrocious. at $1240 a night per room, (and i would say that our room was worth at the very very most $300 a night (actually, i am being very generous), which leaves about $940 for the rest of the amenities per day, $470 per person, the food should be beyond amazing. However, most of the restaurants offer buffet-style appetizer dining and in my book, no classy restaurant makes you run around and serve yourself. in addition to which the different cuisines that they offer (french, italian, carribean, etc) offer largely the same array of dishes for the appetizers, which is very disappointing. The presentation and quality of the food also very disappointing. A japanese restaurant with no chopsticks, for example, is just weird. The all-day dining room service menu stinks too. They offer sandwiches, BLT's, hamburgers, for the most part. The fanciest offerings are a shrimp ceviche and beef carpaccio, but they are mediocre at best. And you are restricted to 2 beers per room per night. What the hell is that? Spa - They tell you it is included, and that the massage/facial treatments are not included, but in fact the use of the spa is only included if you have a facial/massage appointment that day. Those treaments cost between $80-$165 and the spa itself (we had a look) is pretty meager. The spa in my gym at home is set up better than what they have there. In order to even use the spa by itself, you have to pay $28, which makes it in fact NOT inclusive at all as part of the package. We were so annoyed by this that we canceled our appointment at the spa since we just had a feeling that it would not be a very good experience in the end. Beach - The nice part of the beach is that it is never overcrowded since it only serves those staying in this hotel. The problem is that it is completely rocky and you cannot really walk on it without shoes on. there really is no sand to speak of, more like gravelly pebbles, which smart quite a bit on the feet. Not surfable for sure, at least not while i have been here. The Hotel Building - Really beautiful, very photogenic, it really is a sprawling complex that is great and not over crowded and well-decorated. Conclusions - I just think that this is the very problem with this hotel which is that it looks good but tastes like crap. The fact that the food is so mediocre is a really big problem because the least that they can do is offer excellent food and it is just too disappointing in the end and there is no excuse for it given how much money people have to spend here.

I chose this resort based on my previous stays at the Paradisus Punta Cana and the special pricing I received. As all the reviews have stated, it is a beautiful resort. The room and bathroom were both large and well appointed. I did not expect the groomed sandy beaches because I had read previous reviews but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure some guests were disappointed. The food was always good, especially Avocado. I am not one to always plan my evening meals and would have liked the option of an informal evening buffet.

To our advantage there were few guests staying this week. I have read that getting people to come to this resort has been an issue and may explain the special pricing of my package. I do take exception to the negative comments about the staff in previous reviews. I felt the staff was no less than great. Special thanks to bartenders Efrain, Shirley and Alex, and server Vanessa. I did find the management team was rude to guests as well as staff. The tension between management and staff was obvious. This may explain some of the less than flattering reviews about the staff. The Melia parent company is also promoting its vacation club that has a building under construction at this resort. This, as well as the pressure for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Royal Service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, was somewhat distracting. The entertainment and activities staff was not as I was used to from my many stays at other resorts. The entertainment was a singer in the main bar area every evening and the activities seemed less than enthusiastically promoted. The only major complaint during my stay is what will prevent my return and my recommendation of this resort to others. The resort allows day passes for guests, which in itself is no problem. The problem occurred when 70+ young adults (18-25) from Blockbuster Video converged on the pool at 10 in the morning and drank heavily until 5 in the afternoon. They were loud and obnoxious. When I complained to management that there was no oversight for these individuals I was told there was nothing they could (or would??) do. These guests had paid their $135 and basically too bad.

We stayed just before Christmas 2006 in a Royal Service Oceanfront Junior Suite. We found our room musty and poorly ventilated. The beach was for walking only, and not for swimming--we had to hire a driver to take us to a nearby beach for that purpose. The enormous pool is gorgeous, but not heated. Two restaurants were open for breakfast and lunch. One, the Mirador, was infested with a number of black birds. Several of them landed on the bread line of the buffet and picked away while we were seated there. The remaining quickly circled our table. The staff did nothing, so we left promptly. We ate the rest of our breakfasts and lunches at the other restaurant, which typically opened 5-10 minutes late. We found the \"Royal Service\" not particularly helpful in making reservations. Rather than arrange travel or tennis for us, for example, we were simply directed to queue up at the front desk, concierge, or travel desk. Royal Service did provide a prompt check in and check out, however, and also gave us access to the charming \"Royal Service Suite\" as a base of operations. The suite was far less musty than our room, and featured a TV, Internet access, drinks, and a small buffet. Although the hotel boasts that tennis lessons are available at certain times, in fact the staff will simply call local tennis pros to see if one will visit on-site. Nobody was available during our stay, so my daughter didn't receive a lesson. The hotel cancelled one of our restaurant reservations (at Bamboo) just a few hours before we had arranged to arrive. Other restaurants were closed for one or more nights during our stay. I found the food on whole rather undistinguished, with the exception of the fine meal served by the Romantica. The decor of each of the restaurants is quite spartan, and all but the Romantica have what is essentially the same buffet as your appetizer. As buffets go, they are probably above average, but the food was at times underheated. Given the Rain Forest nearby, it was not surprising that the weather was overcast for much of the trip.

Suites were spacious and well-appointed. Housekeeping was good overall, but lost points when they forgot to restock our fridge the last 2 days and also for missing hand towels on a couple days. Other than that, the room was clean and well-attended. The pool area and cabanas were good. We never had any issues getting a good spot by the pool, but to be honest, the facility seemed to be lightly booked the week we were there, so we may have been lucky in that regard. The food and drinks we thought were quite good for an all-inclusive. Not five star as they suggest in their marketing, but not bad. We did not like Mirador, the outdoor restaurant -- and not because of the birds and bugs that many other people complained of. While these are \"issues\", it is an outdoor restaurant so that's part of the deal. We didn't like the staff there, they were standoffish and a little rude -- this was the only place where we found that to be true.

On one occasion with an 8:00 pm reservation we waited until 10:00 pm to eat only to find most of the employees went home and we had to find the manager and complain heavily to get food. We ended up just walking in past the maitre de at most meals because there is no communication between employees as far as table availability. Expect to wait an hour and a half past your reservation time and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only if they don't lose your reservation which happens frequently. This is a real shame as the hotel is beautiful as well as all the facilities. The employees are very friendly and helpful but all complain the hotel is badly understaffed and they are 100% right. On our first day I was very impressed until we went to eat lunch and were greeted by a beautiful indoor-outdoor restaurant with garbage on every single table. Not one clean table what a disappointment! We have been to many resorts in the Caribbean and know to expect service moves a little slow but this place is a joke. On our final night we were told we would have no problem with our reservation,guess what they lost it again which brought out the general manager who thought by handing his card to us would satisfy us, another joke. The General manager told our party we never made a reservation even though we had a confirmed written reservation from the hotel in hand. Whenever you complain they write it down and hand you a card like that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed to make you feel better. When I told the manager about the lost reservations he incredibly told me (after I refused to take his card again) that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the way it is here. To me that means if you don't like it tough luck! So much for the food, incidentally one night (with a 9:00 reservation) we waited until 11:00 pm to be seated, my dish came with only a small piece of fish as we were told there were no vegetables left. Do not come here if you like the ocean as you can't swim in it because of all the sea grass. If you want a chaise lounge be prepared to get up very early as they are all taken by 10:00am. The cabanas by the pool are great but never available unless you are there before sunrise. There are some good things, the bartenders are very attentive and the liquor is top shelve. Some in our party opted for the Royal service including a private pool which is great because the main pool has music blasting so loud I could not listen to my Ipod. My kids were exited to go to the talent show unfortunately it was is in Spanish. The Casino is small but ok, they are short on dealers. Friday night with the place packed there was only one Roulette table with a load of people waiting to play, I asked the manager to open another table and he told me he did not have a dealer. Upon checking out we were greeted by an employee who asked how our stay was. I gave her the information in this review and she told me she heard the same thing all week. I don't know maybe they had a bad week when we were there but I would guess we were not the first to experience these problems with the facility.

It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense if you have kids as they are banned from using the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Royal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pool, For adults it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great if you don't want the zoo scene at the main pool. Also you are supposed to have a butler for the extra $150 a day but nobody ever saw his or her butler after the first day!

This place was amazing! One of the best vacations I've ever had and I've traveled all over the world and have stayed at many nice resorts, plus I live in paradise in Florida so great review is something special! As for Restaurants you have to make all dinner reservations when you arrive. As for Breakfast & Lunch: Mirador is outside and very casual, El Caribeno is in inside and air conditioned both have great food, a little more upscale. For dinner...must try Romantico...super nice candlelite dinner. This is the only restaurant that requires a dress code, ie: kakais pants and a polo shirt are fine for guys...dress shirt and tie is not required. Very Romantic and a must for one of your nights. Bamboo is a great Japanese Restaurants with Teppanyaki (that's where they prepare the food right in front of you at a table, what a great show) or you can do the sushi buffett. In between Romantico and Bamboo is an awesome Martini Bar, go there before your reservation and have a cocktail. They make great martinis...I heard great things about Avocado which is a American Steakhouse that may guests raved about as well, though I didn't have enough days to check out. All the drinks were top shelf...and since you're in Puerto Rico you need to try some Rum Drinks, try the Rum Punch at the pool and Mojitos are delicious. Don Q and Barcardi are the Puerto Rican Rum Favorites. If you get the basic room you will be so pleased, we had a king bed and it was huge...all rooms are suites. This was my 3rd vist to Puerto Rico and I would go back in a heartbeat. I didn't do any Spa Services but heard they were execellent. This is a great place to visit on a honeymoon, anniversary, or just a get away and even with babies/kids. And if anyone is getting married there...wow you'll love it, they have beautiful area for a ceremony.

We had dinner at every single restaurant and they just got better per night. We do recommend you make dinner reservations for Romantico (best restaurant, food and service). The night entertainment was great and full of fun; the bartenders (specially Reynaldo and Luis ) were great. The facilities were awesome. Great pool with lots of space to have your own private corner; the pool bar was great and the bartenders there were very attentive and ready to suggest some exotic drink. The beach wasn't all that, so we didn't go in. However, the hotel gets busy on friday to sunday when the locals check in for the weekend.

It was great!! I was pleasantly suprised with the outcome of our vacation. (I was initially hesitant to stay at an all inclusive report. ) The resort is absolutely captivating!! The rooms were very clean. The pool was so so beautiful. Every where you looked was a beautiful view. The bars had everything you could imagine for your favorite drink. The food was pretty good. The buffets were satisfying. You must try the Romantico!!!!... It was my favorite restaurant!! The staff was great!! They were fluent in english and spanish. They were extremely helpful... a nice young lady at the concierge, Melissa, helped us plan a great \"local's\" day in old san juan. She went out of her way to do so. Our bell hop, Julio, was so kind. He always greeted us when he saw us and inquired about our stay. He even helped us when we were in dire need of a cigar. The restaurant's staff eventually started to recognize and address us by our names too!! Now that's great service!! There are a few things that the resort could improve on though... Check-in wasn't up to par. We didn't have to wait as long as others, but it wasn't a speedy process at all. And of course, they offerred a ice-cold beverage during the wait. They also provided a tram service to your bungalows.. it was nice, but was more readily available during their peak times (weekend). We had to wait for them to come around the rest of the time. There were timesthen we eventually got tired of waiting and waiked to our bungalow. Great for a romantic walk only if you are sober... different story if you have had a few adult beverages. They should list when each restaurants are open/closed, too. We had to ask daily which would be available for dinner. We absolutely loved Romantico and Bamboo. Advocado was ok.... my steak was over-cooked, but the appetizer buffet compensated for it. We were blindsighted as soon as we got to the paradisus shuttle bus at the airport. No one informed us that there was a $60 shuttle fee to and from the hotel. You just walk up to the stand and the girl tells you to sign before she explains about the fee. There was an AVIS car rental on site... but I would suggest renting your car from the airport. That is was we did. The drive is very scenic. Unfortunately, there is a daily charge to park/valet your vehicle. That shouldn't be the case with an all inclusive resort.

Our shuttle bus pickup from the airport was prompt and our driver did not drive like a lunatic. I was actually surprised that the bus was a real shuttle bus operated by Paradisus, vs. a van that most tour operators use. Check in took literally 10 mins for us, as we had FREE upgrades to Royal Service. There is a different area for Royal Service Guests. RS will give you vip concierge service, your private butler, snacks mid day, and access to the RS pool, where there are no children allowed. If you do decide to purchase RS, its actually only 25.00 per person per night. We did have a tiny problem with one of the rooms smelling very moldy/musty with damp bedding. However, that problem was resolved immediately. I must say that the rooms (we had an oceanfront RS room) are well decorated, spacious, and comfy. We also did not have a problem getting reservations to the restaurants. We were able to get reservations to every ala carte restaurant for a group of 10. The beach is really non existent, but the RS pool was so great that we didn't budge. Also folks, keep in mind that Paradisus i located about 45 mins from San Juan, so if you plan your day trips to old san juan/san juan ahead.

It started on a Monday july 24 where we were met by a hotel representative at the airport and taken to the resort bus. Being the only family only family on the bus was nice, but the driver thought he was driving a Nascar causing my wife and I hold onto the kids for our lives. Once there, the resort looked beautiful, marble floors to ceilings. Little did I know there was a line down the hallway and exposed to the humidity and heat of the day. After approx 2 hours was waiting with no forward movement and kids wanting to run around and starting to complain about being hungry. I saw several people in line drinking and having a great time in line. People began spilling drinks and leaving their empties on the floor and any place that will hold a drink. Well considering the floors were made out of marble with fountains all long the hallway, not to mention the humidity, turned the beautiful marble floors into a ice skating rink. Kids were slipping all over the place and keeping the kids from wanting to play with every left drink was also fun for next two hours. During this time my son had to go to the bathroom, and after locating the nearest bathroom next to the bar my next adventure started. The bathroom has three rooms, the entrance/sitting room, the washroom, and the room you finally use. Well out of the three stalls available, stall number 1 looked like someone did number 1 all over the walls and seat, stall number 2 looked like someone did number 2 in the trash can next to the toilet, and stall number 3 which appeared to reasonably clean had not toilet paper. After kicking the trashcan out of stall number 2 in order for my son to use the stall was an experience wont forget. By the time I got back the line that still did not move I was already calling continental looking for a flight to go to Disney in order to save my vacation. Unfortunately continental only flew to Huston and Newark. By hour four came around we finally got the front of the line and still looked like we will be in the line for at least another hour, we had it. After asking for the manager we were taken out of the line and escorted out of the lobby in order to voice our complaints to the director. Luckily my wife insisted on have the meeting in a air conditioned room because at this point all I wanted was to go home. After telling the director this story he attempted to satisfy the situation by telling us this was a busy day. After asking him if the incompetence was a management or front end staff problem, he advised me it was a little bit of both. He then attempted to give us 50% off the first day thinking it will make up for the now five hours I had to wait for a room. Needless to say we were given the first night for free because by the time we finally checked in and eaten dinner, the kids were ready for bed. Unfortunately the rest of our stay wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any better. The Italian buffet restaurant they made reservations for us horrible. You would think at an Italian buffet there would be some pasta! For breakfast we eat at restaurant surrounded by netting. It would take to long to get into everything that was wrong, but let me say it was dirty, the staff doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know enough to keep the floors clean so no one slips on the beautiful tile floor, and the food was terrible. When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not waiting on line, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother going to the beach. You would think after pouring all that money into the d\u00c3\u00a9cor you would work on the beach. Beach was unusable, full of sea grass, broken coral, and surrounded by huge rocks making it a challenge to get to. Luckily the director gave me his business card because trying to get reservations into a restaurant was impossible. How do charge almost $500.00 a day and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat where you want. Needless to say the director got us into the only two restaurants worth eating at. The Japanese restaurant was great, and the steak house was also very nice, but I could not help but notice that while eating in the restaurants I was told were full. The restaurants were half empty the entire time I was eating. Now the night before we left I saw only two people waiting on line at the front desk. I figure why not check out early for tomorrow. Well it still took 1 hour in order to check out and thank god we did because the next day the power and water goes out for some unknown reason. No one told us what was going on or when to expect things to come back on. Instead employees continued to walk around like nothing was wrong while I quickly gathered our luggage and headed to the lobby looking for the next bus to the airport. After eventually finding a bus that will take us to the airport I thanked god that the airport was far better and safer place to wait for our flight. Kids were able to run around without having to worry about slipping on the floors and the food was a lot better.

Do Not believe the negative reviews! The resort is absolutely beautiful, from the grounds to the rooms. My husband and I paid for the Royal Service and I would highly recommend that you pay the extra for it. We did not wait long at all to check in (there was one person ahead of us). I will say that the line was extremely long for regular check-in and we met a family that waited 2 hours to check in. Therefore, do the Royal Service if you can. Upon arrival, our butler (Manuel) drove us to the Royal Service pool, reserved a Palapas (wonderful \"hut\" w/mattress and pillows) for us for our entire stay, got us drinks and booked us reservations for dinner for our stay. You definitely need to book dinner reservations when you arrive. We found that they tend to say that the non-buffet restaurants are booked, but if you insist or just \"show-up\" you most likely will get in. We ate at Romantico twice and really enjoyed it. The food was very good and the service was excellent. The other night we ate at Avacado which was quite good, too, though not as good as Romantico. We ate breakfast and lunch at Mirador and contrary to what others have written, my husband and I enjoyed our meals there. It is not gourmet food and a lot of it is their local cuisine, but the food is perfectly good. It is an open-air restuarant and views of the ocean are wonderful. Every morning we asked them if they would cut us a fresh mango and they never had a problem with it. We has excellent service there, too! The Royal Service pool is quiet and our bartenders (Pedro and Leslie) were excellent! They would check on us quite often and bring us drinks. Both bartenders made great rum drinks! If you are truly a beach person then this may not be for you. The beach is very rocky and there is a lot of seaweed and what not at the shore. We did take a kayak out one day and we were able to get out of it and swim in the water further out. The ocean water is warmer than the pool! We never really ventured over to the main pool. It was very crowded while we were there (there were 2 conventions). There were many activities going on every day (salsa lessons, water aerobics, karaoke, etc). My husband and I were there for relaxation and that is exactly what we got! I did get a massage at the spa and it was wonderful! If you have the time and the money, I would recommend it!

But I'm happy to say that was just about the only wrinkle (if you can really call it that) in our whole stay. We traveled with friends and they agree that this was a perfect getaway. Each family had a 4 and 6 year old child. They enjoyed the experience as much as the adults. To give some perspective on the food, the two families are from Northern New Jersey and we have dined in some of the finest restaurants in the north east. Frankly with the exception of the scrambled eggs EVERYTHING we ate ranged from good to wonderful. Breakfast and lunch were as good as breakfast and lunch could be. Avocado was our favorite dinner spot.

For months I read the comments on the tripadvisor and had very mixed feelings about the resort. Well, overall I have to say that we enjoyed our stay very much. Service was very good, friendly and helpful. We got all the dinner reservations we desired and the times we wanted. On the first evening, since we arrived around 6 PM, the concierge desk was already closed. But we went to the Toscana restaurant and were welcomed and seated within minutes. The buffet style Italian food was very good and offered a nice variety and the wait staff was excellent. That was a promising beginning!!! The front desk could not honor our request for a king-size bed room (reason was never explained), but offered us a room with two double beds pushed together (which was acceptable) in the Royal section without the royal service. (The rooms are basically the same in the royal and non-royal section). Yes, the beach is nothing, also the water is clear and warm, but the coral and coarse sand and rocks are not nice. I brought my aqua shoes and spent every day a bit of time wading knee deep in the water, seeing quite a few fish. The pool is large and busy the whole day long. We found an umbrella shaded area (bed) every day, since we were at the pool around 7:30AM. I am a bit puzzled about the remarks of another tripadvisor writer in relation to the pool bar. We usually requested our last drink at the pool around 4:30PM and never had a problem with it not being honored or even having to wait. We never ordered drinks while in the water. Like I said, the staff was great everywhere. We were able to eat in all restaurants and the food was excellent. Bamboo: great Japanese tepanyaki....the day we went, two seats on our table were empty. La Romantica: great food, a lovely ambience and an attentive wait staff Avocado: steak and fish dishes were excellent, service very efficient even on a day when there were a lot of large tables (convention) who required so much extra work. Carabena: breakfast and lunch buffets were always presented very well with lots of things to choose from. Fresh fruit every day, great salads and cold cuts (salmon and prociutto crudo) and a friendly wait staff to refill your water or drinks. I tried the scambled eggs and they were very good, not at all rubbery and dry as some reviewers indicated. Mirador: this was a bit disappointing, especially the evening meal there. It is buffet style and there is no Mexican ambience and the wait staff is the slowest. I would not recommend the Mirador for dinner. Unfortunately, the resort creates some of the problems with insisting of stationing a hostess at the door for breakfast and lunch buffets. One has to constantly wait for the hostess, because she is off seating people, and that creates a backup. We were at the Paradisus when there was a convention with 250 people and it tended to be crowded and loud during breakfast and lunch. Not 5star quality!!! One remark from a previous writer about no food available after 3PM until dinner time, is not correct. The Mirador, which is the outdoor restaurant close to the pool, serves snack food between 3:30 and 5:30PM. We went ithere once and were offered chips and dips, pizza, chicken nuggets and a few other things. So, there is always something to eat. We used the resort shuttle bus for transportation to and from the airport and it was efficient and quick. No problems other than upon arrival at San Juan airport the driver neglected to hold up a sign for \"Paradisus\", but had only a sign for \"travelocity\". When we could not locate the bus, I had to call the resort and then a staff member located us immediately and escorted us to the waiting bus. So, a bit of confusion.... but no harm done. The bell hop service worked great upon check in, but we called for luggage pick up upon check out and nobody showed at the appointed time. We wheeled our luggage to the lobby by ourselves. We did not use room service and did not frequent any bars other than the pool bar. If you plan to travel there with children, I think the activity desk does a lot to keep the kids entertained. There were always games offered and other activities and we saw a lot of happy kids. In summation..... the resort is beautiful and the grounds very nice. Would we go there again? .. probably, but given all the other places in the Caribbean, we tend not to go to the same place every year. If you have any questions, please feel free to send me an email.

We also thought we could (and did) get a good deal in the off-season (last week of June). After we made the reservation, we had some difficulty getting answers to some of our emails, but were still excited to go. Then someone suggested checking out Trip Advisor. Wish we had not. The reviews were negative, and just made us anxious about the whole thing. As it turned out, we had a great time. The food, facility, service, area etc. were all wonderful. We play golf, and the Resorts nearby were excellent (Coco Beach and Rio Mar). If you play golf, you must play the Lakes and Mountain Courses at Coco Beach, and the River course at the Rio Mar. The hotel will take you to the Coco Beach course for free, and pick you up. We did not run into a single unhappy person at the hotel, and everyone was wondering what provoked those negative reviews. As for ourselves, we have nothing, but good things to say. As others have said, you should make your dinner reservations for the whole week as soon as possible. Also be advised that if you rent a car and drive there, the self-parking is $10.00 per day. The area and facility are beautiful. If you do go, plan ahead for checking out.

Here are my observations: * Rooms are gorgeous, perhaps the best thing the resort has, besides the lobby. * Room service takes almost an hour, with a $3 charge (all inclusive?). Still, we decided to keep using room service for the reason stated in the following bullet. * Restaurants are not open all the time. They open at 6 or 6:30AM and then they close at 11-11:30AM. Then, they open at 12:00 to close at 3PM, and then you have to wait until 6PM for dinner. So, if you just decided to go to bed late because you kept hanging out or watched movies until 3AM, then you have to adjust yourself to their schedule so you get to eat something. Unless, you use cold-food room service. Then, if you are at the pool and suddenly you realize it's 3:30PM, you're [----] because you have to wait until 6PM (that, of course, if you happen to have a reservation for that time!!!!). So, if you're hypoglycemic, don't ever come to this hotel! Or, leave the pool, go back to the room, and ask for cold-food room service... again. * Reservations: They sell you this hotel over the internet and ads as a top class resort with amazing restaurants blah blah blah. But, the restaurants are always full, and you have to make reservations the day you check in, not before. So, you may have to wait until 10PM to get to eat to at the Bamboo (Japanese restaurant), which is amazingly great, by the way, but always full. There's always buffet food at the Mirador and Caribe\u00c3\u00b1o, but believe me, the food is not very good. The restaurants close before midnight, and there's no such thing as midnight munch like in cruises. Either you starve, or go back to your room (even if you're supposed to be out enjoying the resort lobby and facilities) and, guess what, order room service. * Bamboo and Avocado are the best restaurants. However, I have observed that now they are serving much less in restaurants than before, and the quality of the buffet food in general (especially lunch and \"dinner\") is declining. * The Pool is beautiful, kids will have a great time. * The Beach is probably the ugliest beach in Puerto Rico, by far. It's full of rocks, not much beach sand, and just ugly. * Bars/pubs: This is the must disgusting thing. There are only three bars at the resort, an ALL INCLUSIVE resort, and I will discuss each of them separately to send the message clear of what's wrong with this resort. - Pool bar: Pool bar is great, bartenders are great, drinks are great. Half of the bar is outside the pool and the other is inside (it is not very big, but nice). For some reason, at about 3 or 4PM they close the \"outside\" section of the bar, so if you are not inside the pool, the bartenders \"kindly\" tell you that you could keep ordering but by standing by the edge of the pool, screaming at the bartender, and finally bending over to get your drink; this is after having to compete with other people at the pool. I think this is outrageous. How could they just close one side of the bar when at least half the people at the pool are is outside!!! And they do this everytime, it is not that I stayed once, one day, and saw that... - Casino/Pub bar: This bar is OK. People can smoke inside and air circulation is horrible, so it stinks as bad as you could imagine. Furniture absorbs all the smoke smell, so even during the day the room stinks. Bartenders are great, they are not the problem (they are probably the only good thing - as far as service goes- the resort has), the problem is that at 1AM (or before), during the weekends, the bar is closed, as well as the lobby bar (the next in my review), so you, as a tourist in an ALL INCLUSIVE resort, have nowhere to go, but to your room?????? - Lobby bar: Lobby bar is on a nice spot. Bartenders are great, as usual. The only bad thing about this bar is that they close it shorly after midnight! Yes, you're on vacation on a resort that they sold you as an ALL INCLUSIVE resort, and before 1AM you have nowhere to go besides your room. No restaurants, no gazebos with food or drinks, no bars!!! They even shut down the lights and the fans at the LOBBY!!!!!!!!!!! Could you, for just a second, imagine this!!!??? You can't even keep talking to your friends, wife, or whoever you met that day, because they shut down the lobby, the only thing left open in this All Inclusive resort??? These people want to save it all! The funniest thing is, and this is true, if you ask for leaving the bar open, or for at least get a couple of beers out, they \"kindly\" tell you that you could order beers guess where?, yes!, from your room!!, and they limit the amount of beers you could order. It's so pathetic you have to laugh. With all I have told you, it would be hard to believe that the hotel is paying for a woman to sing every night by the lobby bar, but they do, only that she thinks that she is singing to her mirror because she is just only singing for her pleasure; she does not ever connect with the people around. She has a great voice, and surely has the talent to entertain the people better, but what she is doing now is just a show for herself; she even sang the Titanic song the last time I went... With the stinky casino/pub bar as the other option, I have had to stay at the lobby bar at night and listen to the most annoying singer I've ever watched in my entire life. When she sings salsa or merengue, there's only a few people dancing, and the only could be her. I've been to the Paradisus in Dominican Republic, and the singer(s) over there put a show that has the entire lobby dancing all night long!, and what do they play?, salsa and merengue!, and bachata too! To finish, I know Puerto Rico very well and there are many other places to stay which are far prettier, better, and funnier. There are hotels of all types in all metropolitan areas (San Juan, Ponce, Mayaguez), and \"Paradores\" (B&Bs) on most towns, where you don't have to be stuck in an all-inclusive resort that does not allow you to eat what you want, when you want, and tells you when to go to sleep. In summary, think well before making your decision to come to this hotel, and consider other options if you want to visit the Island (check tripadvisor.com for reviews of other places).", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cthe wrost service ever\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5446312", "Content": "I just found out that the Paradisus (or hell) resort illegally overcharged my credit card of $1745, besides paying for my room $1204!

The lobby d\u00c3\u00a9cor was extraordinary. I was very skeptical about staying at this resort because I read all of these negative reviews about it and because I was traveling right after the recent fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico. To my surprise there was nothing to worry about. The ambience at the Paradisus put me in a relaxed tropical vacation mood right from the start. Getting stressed out was impossible at this place. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe all of the negative reviews. I was a nervous wreck during my whole flight worrying about what was waiting for me at this resort. The service was excellent. The staff was extremely attentive whether you tipped or not (I forgot to tip a few times). The only service issue I had was that housekeeping removed the washcloths and towels from the room daily but they would only replace them if they removed them from the towel rack. I know, silly but true. I never put my washcloths and towels on the rack after I use them so everyday I had to request a washcloth and towel. That was annoying. The food was excellent. I enjoyed all of the restaurants with the exception of the Midori Grill. The Midori Grill is the day snack eatery. This is the place to go if you missed one of the other restaurants for breakfast, lunch, or dinner but you are still hungry. The food tasted good but \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.The Midori Grill belongs to the birds, literally. I am not at all comfortable dealing with birds of any kind. Because I am a native New Yorker, every bird is a pigeon. Those birds flew all over the place. They walked on the tables, they ate every piece of unattended food (including the buffet) and when they were done they pooped. Yuk! I only had to eat there on day 1 of my vacation because I neglected to read the electronic itinerary in the front of the resort that tells you what time everything opens and closes. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make that same mistake; you do not want to eat with the Puerto Rican pigeons. The food at the other restaurants was excellent and so was the service. I read reviews that stated that the buffets had many unidentified foods and that the eggs were not safe to eat. I eat Caribbean food often so I knew what the few native dishes were. The breakfast buffet had an eggs station. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care for trendy food presented with chocolate drizzle and parsley on the plate so I was satisfied with what they had to offer. I had no complaints at all. The Beach was very small and full of shells. It was not very appealing but I am not a beach person so that did not bother me. However, before I left the resort I toured the grounds with the Melia Club and I discovered that the Paradisus has a section for Royal Services. This section is cut off from the rest of the resort. It has separate villas, separate staff, a separate pool, and a separate beach which is beautiful. The common traveler doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access to the Royal Service facilities and for good reason. Those people paid $$$$$$$ to be isolated. So if you want to have access to the fabulous Beach at the Paradisus that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the way to go. But the pool will make up for the beach, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend that kind of money. The pool is phenomenal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge! It has a swim up bar, pool beds so you can lie down and be in the water at the same time. There are real beds (not sure what they are called) on the outside of the pool as well. All of the activities take place around the pool. You can have a drink in the pool, step out to have a salsa dance lesson and then get back in the pool. It was great! The spa looked nice from the outside. lol Unfortunately, I did not have time to take advantage of the spa. The live entertainment was very enjoyable. It enhanced the mood of the lobby. The casino was small and quiet. If you are a casino person, then you know that quiet is not good sign at a casino. The nightclub was nice. They tried to play a variety of music to please all of their patrons but they played mostly Latin music. Some nights there was a live DJ and other nights they played recorded music. I have a very nice time there. The movie theater was nice. I missed the movie that I wanted to see because of a misprint on the activities schedule but I got to see the facility and it was nice. The Paradisus was a great value for the money. I recommend booking off season to get a better deal. I would also recommend that you do a few things when you get there: 1) Make dinner reservations for every night of your stay all at once, shortly after you arrive. You can always change them later if you need to. 2) Have patience with the front desk. The atmosphere is very laid back so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect check-in to move quickly. 3) Go to breakfast early if you come late you will miss the egg station. I loved the egg station.

I tried to book a private Villa but they were all sold out. I booked a Ocean View Suite with Royal Service. We paid $660. per night for two people for this All Inclusive Resort. Billed as a 5 Star I was very disappointed. I understood their would be families at the resort but was not prepared for the multitude of kids all over the place. Children were running rampant in the restaurants with their parents oblivious to the noise the kids were creating. A 2 or 3 year old girl laid on her back in the middle of the restaurant and screamed until she finally tired out and stopped. No one stopped her. When I asked the hostess why they allowed it she looked at me sheepishly and said \"when we speak to the parents they get insulted and raise a fuss\". After Dinner the Lobby Bar had entertainment. After one song the Singer brought up 3 cute little girls to sing and dance with her. This went on for the rest of the show. A little cute goes a long way. We had dinner in Avocado the first evening. They bring you your steak cooked to order but everything else is Buffet. And Buffet food it was. Dry Vegetables, uninspired cooking. Paper napkins. The waiter asked me to hold my fork as he removed my salad dish as I \"would need the fork for the entree\". We are 5 Star but please hold on to your only fork. As there was no Break Plate my only option was to hold on to the fork or to place it on the table. At least it gave me time to not pay attention to the Romper Room going on around me. Dinner on Day two was going to be at the Mirador Grill. We got to the grill but it was closed due to rain. When I checked with Royal Service I was told it was moved to Toscano and I \"should have been informend\". I eventually found out that they had left a message for me but the light on the phone was not working.... 5 Star. The room was acceptable but by no means was it luxurious. The Jacuzzi was in fact a single jacuzzi tub that you would have in your home bathroom. I was very suprised by it as I expected it to be more of a two person Hot Tub. For some reason sitting in a single bathtub was not what i was envisioning when I booked the suite. I brought 5 movies that I had wanted to see for the past year but never could find time for and was told that the hotel could not provide a DVD player as it violated the contract with their in room Movie providor. The in room moview were $20.99 each and they were not the ones I wanted to see. I brought my favorite CD's to listen to but was told the they could not provide a CD player. As most hotels have CD players as part of the radio it never occured to me to bring my own. 5 Star. Royal Sevice Check in was a lengthy process and my room was not ready until 45 minutes after arriving. At 4pm when I did get my room key the housekeeper was still in the room cleaning. I waited on the Balcony for 15 minutes while she finished. I thought the staff was very very friendly and listened sympathically to my requests for a DVD or CD player. I even asked the one Royal Service person if someone could buy a TV and DVD player at a local store and I would pay for it but they never got back to me. The Assistant Front Office Manager Omeira was wonderful and very accomodating. After two days at the Resort I checked out and checked into Las Casitas Village at the El Conquistador Hotel. It was beautiful, Serivce was incredible, Food was delicious, my Casitia overlooked the Sea and the Balcony was huge. If you have children Paradisus is a perfect place for your family. Lots of food, and very kid friendly. If you want a quiet weeks vacation go somewhere else. The royal service pool was the only place that was kid free.

We opted for a royal service beachfront suite, and we just loved our time there. It was money well spent, in our view. What we liked: the huge pool and cabanas, the groomed beach, the weather (the place is magically protected from bad weather, seriously) the play area for kids, the babysitting services and the super friendly staff. Our balcony jacuzzi was sweet; your butler will run you a bath (I'm not kidding - a GREAT experience!) Room for improvement: the food quality at Toscano's (better to eat at El Mirador, outside) the availability of children's items in the gift shop (swim diapers, especially.) Wish we'd known: 1) Book your dinners as soon as you arrive-don't wait! I highly suggest Bamboo (benihana-like dining) and heard Avocados was good, though we never did eat there ourselves; Romantico is fusion cuisine-small portions of savory foods (no kids allowed) 2) Royal Service pool area is for adults only. Someone complained when my husband took our baby swimming there, so we spent most of our time at the (huge, beautiful) public pool 3) You can reserve Royal Service cabanas; cabanas by the main pool are first come, and usually occupied by 8 a.m. Overall we highly recommend the resort to couples with kids and would not hesitate to endorse the babysitting services. It's a great way for Mom and Dad to get out for a night alone and was worth every penny. We spent two nights in San Juan after leaving the resort and realized just how pampered and spoiled we'd been.

My only complaint is that the darn pool bar closes at 5pm!! Way too early if the sun hasn't even gone down yet & people are still out relaxing. Manuel & Brad made some mean drinks & were very accomodating. We had an ocean front room which was gorgeous with nice marble floors, stunning views & a huge bathroom. The resort doesn't have mcuh of a beach (very rocky & still being developed); but they make up for it with their large pools. The casino was fun, the food was more than edible (Bamboo, Romantico, Avocado, Toscano, Caribeno); we always found something good to eat.

It was easy to find and a nice day trip there is a town called Fajardo where you will find Luquillo beach and the 7seas beach, absolutely awsome and only about 15mins from the Paradisus. If you want to hike 5 mins to the El Yunke Rainforst, great hiking trails. The nice thing is that you don't need to leave the hotel.

Its a beautiful hotel, newer facilites, it has a fitness center. there is abundance of anything you want any time you want. All you have to do is ask. The staff is SO awsome everyone there rocks especially Santos and Alex the activies guys. They have entertainment at night and an AWSOME pool. If you enjoy snorkeling (like we do) they will take you out away from the shore and drop you off in this BEAUTIFUL sea of fish and coral and starfish and sting rays and squid its so cool. We saw a sea turtle during one of our windsurfing rides. The best part is, you can go over and over again. They don't mind, really. The food is unbelieveable. 5 Star quality.

I am 7 months pregnant and my husband and I wanted to take a last relaxing trip before I couldn't fly anymore and the Paradisius was a perfect spot for it. First, for anyone who's been pregnant, you can appreciate how important it is to have access to food at any time of day. And the huge pool provided plenty of exercise just swimming from one side to the other. It seems like all of the other reviews during the time we were there were all positive, and I think the main reason was because the resort was empty! The pool chairs and awesome little Bali huts were easy to get at any time during the day, check-in/out was a breeze, restaurants were fairly empty, and there were few enough people that we kept seeing the same people and met some very nice couples. I HIGHLY recommend going in off season and trying to hit a time where there are no conventions there - we were very aware of how different it would have been if there ware large and rowdy groups there. Even when people came in for the weekend, it started to get a bit more crowded and less peaceful (we stayed from Sun-Thurs, which was perfect).There were many families with small children and I was surprised at how well suited it seemed to be to them too. Food: We loved breakfast and lunch at the Carabeno and didn't bother going anywhere else. Great healthy salad bar and fruit options. If you don't like healthy food though, you probably won't be as happy - hot food wasn't all that good. But because it was so damn hot out, we loved all the fresh fruit and vegetable options. As for dinner, they can definitely use some help with the reservation service. The process is just screwy, but we were satisfied with all of our meals. And actually started asking for 9-9:30 reservations as it gave us plenty of time to nap/relax after the pool. We avoided the Mirador buffet as it didn't look all that appetizing. We did have an issue with the Concierge making some reservations for us, but turns out they were un/mis-informed so we weren't able to get to Vieques, which was our goal. They were supposed to send us to the Tour Desk to make any reservations (which we didn't even know existed). So just make sure to double-check plans and reservations and make sure you're working with the right people. All in all, we had a wonderful, relaxing stay, found the grounds and the rooms extremely comfortable and elegant (the lobby area is to die for), and the staff friendly, if occasionally underinformed.

The grounds were beautifully maintained, gorgeous landscaping, huge pool, secluded beach (although no swimming or snorkling because of shallow rocky waters), nice rooms, friendly staff, nice bars and entertainment, and great plantation like relaxation areas. The food varied - breakfasts and lunches at Mirador were OK. Decent selection, certainly edible. The birds flying around the food and eating off people's plates when they got up to get drinks was a little gross, but tolerable. I ate dinner two nights at Avocado and one at Toscano. I was impressed. It was much better than I expected based on the reviews I read. I thought I was in heaven. However, I woke up after my second night with three dozen welts covering my arms and legs. I did not recall receiving one bug bite when I was awake. I remembered reading that bed bugs are an increasingly common problem. After a little internet research, I found out that the bites fit the classic pattern of bed bugs. When I complained to management, they sent a maid to the room who spent 30 seconds scanning the bed in the middle of the day and concluded that there were no bed bugs. I have NO DOUBT these were bed bug bites. What had been a great vacation was ruined! I felt extremely self conscious going out to the pool area covered in itchy welts which still, one week later, have not gone away. Try sleeping knowing that there are blood sucking bugs waiting to come out! I know these things can happen in even the poshest hotels. That's fine. What bothered me was management's response. They completely blew me off, did not apologize whatsoever, and refused to even refund a single dollar.

The resort is beautiful, very lush and scenic. The staff very helpful but at times some appear to be understanding English and agreeing, but have no idea what you asked for. So, make sure you are understood before walking away. Take a cab from the airport... only $64 (opposed to resorts $60 bus charge), and cabs are plentiful. We got there about an hour or so before check-in at 3pm and were told it would cost $75 add'l PER person for early check-in which was ridiculous! The resort was very empty and that was uncalled for, so we opted to walk the grounds, which were amongst the most beautiful anywhere in P.R. Being that it was fairly empty, in our two days we ran across only two other couples along the vast beach and there were less than a dozen people in any of the lounges, etc. Now, the place can accommodate tons of people, and I don't know if we would have had such a great time if it was jampacked, but we truly felt it was our own resort. ALL of the staff was very friendly and helpful. FOOD: I love to eat, but also realize that inclusives usually consist of buffets which are mediocre. The food here was no exception. Not a great selection and 1/2 of it non-descript food which I couldnt even guess what it was! So, you're not going to get deluxe dining here. ROOMSERVICE ... Not matter how slow you talk or how you THINK you gave the order, three of 3 times roomservice screwed up the orders. They always made good on it within 15-20 minutes.

I wish I went with my first choice and went to Aruba. I cannot believe what a horror this place is. To start with, I booked my honeymoon with a travel agent back in October 2005 and my travel agent received a phone call from the Paradisus the day of our wedding (April 21, 2006) stating that they overbooked the hotel and that we would be put up at the Westin but our stay would be covered by the Paradisus. We were scheduled to arrive at the Paradisus on April 23, 2006 and stay until May 3, 2006. Once we landed we had to find our transportation to the Westin which was a disaster. We were sent to 3 different buses. Finally we arrived at the Westin and had to waste 3 hours trying to get our all inclusive status taken care of. NOthing was in the computer so Westin had to keep calling the Paradisus to get it straigtened out. We were only suppose to stay at the Westin for 1 night. Well the next day I call to confirm our transfer to the Paradisus and they say everything is okay. We go to the pull and go back up to our room only to have a message waiting for us stating that the Paradisus had us booked to arrive the next day. So again I had to waste another 3 hours getting that straigtened out. We finally arrive at the Paradisus only to have more screw ups. We were promised a room upgrade, never got it. We were put in a room that smelled like mildew so again had to be transferred to another room. The reservation manager, Wanda Rivera, how was suppose to assist us on everything, never returned my calls and when we went to the front desk to speak with her directly, never came out of her office. I wasted 4 days of my honeymoon just trying to get everything straightened out. On top of all of this, they had 4 conventions going on so that bar was completely swamped all the time. It took at least 20 minutes to get a drink. Because of the conventions we could get dinner reservations early then 9:45 p.m. The food was disgusting and the service was horrible. You would sit down to eat it would take a waiter at least 20 minutes to take you drink order and then it would take them another 10 minutes to bring it to you. I think the food was horrible because of the conventions. I really wish I knew that the conventions were going on because when asked if I would like to stay at the WEstin for the remainder of my trip I would have said yes. I can go on and on about the negative aspects about the Paradisus but there' s not enough room. Please save your money and go somewhere else. This place is horrible. Spend the extra money and stay at the Westin. They were hospitable, the service was fantastic and even sent us a bottle of champaigne for all of the confusion which is more than I can say for the Paradisus.

My NY steak looked awful, although it tasted like something from Ponderosa. Presentation was horrible. Waitresses always looked like they didn't care. Entertainment: N/A I can't comment since I didn't participate, but my friends tell me it was OK until 2AM. With enough alcohol, anything is fun. To sum up: I would never pay to go to this hotel again, not until they improve front desk help and dinner/service. Try ANY other Puerto Rico hotel or small inn, and I guarantee you'll come out satisfied.

DO NOT go to the italian restaurant it is def not the best italian food. it tasted like it was microwaved the onyl things good were the desserts. And caribeno, i didnt even eat there, it looked grose. THe food at romantico was excellent and also at Bamboo (Benihana/hibatchi)was good (how bad could it be, they cook in front of you). also the steak at avocado wasnt bad either. For breakfast all the restaurants basically serve the same things (dont eat the eggs they are horrible) all of the breakfasts are buffet. The mirador grill is not the best its really for youger kids(they basically only hav chicken nuggets and french fries, pizza, rice, chips, and salad and other foods, sometimes BBQ chicken). But for dinner one night they servd good food, they had shrimp, steak, chicken, fish, and lots of side dishes. surprisingly this restaurant was good for dinner. The Hotel itself.. The hotel was beautiful, everythign is marble, the lobby, the bars, the lounge, and the bathrooms in your room and in the lobby. The rooms are nice. you can get it with a king bed or 2 double beds and either room you choose, you get a living room with a coffe table, and a pullout couch. also they give u a table with two chairs with a coffee machine, and give you coffee bags and creamer...)the only reason i knwo they hav 2 different rooms is that we were given a room with 1 king bed and we are 5 people. so we called n they kmoved us to the other room. at the time it ws very annoying since we got there at 1am n had to switch rooms. we had also brought 2 laptops and they have an internet port under the desk by the fone. we had forgot ot bring out cord but one of the people who brought our bags (his name is Angelo) gave us a free one he had(usually you have to pay $15dollars to buy 1). When you hook up the interent it says you will be charged $15 dollars a day but, you dont it was free, also they have wireless interent in the lobby) The pool is huge,literrally it is about 4 times the size of an olympic size pool. plus it has a swim up bar, in pool lounge chairs, a kiddy pool, and basketball hoops. they also have kids activites an water aerobics in the pool some days. Also GOOO sailing, you have to make a reservation though) it is really funespecilal y when you feel like your about to flip over(dont worry, you wont) also they kayaking and petalboats to use. But for all this there is a consequence... (its not Cheap we paid $11,000 including airfare this was for 5ppl. ( 2 adults, a 14yo, a 12yo, and a 9yo.) Also it will cost you abotu 250-500 dollars in tips to get what you want. THey say that the restaurants are booked when they arent. we went to the iitalian resaurant at 800, we had reservatiosn for 630 and they said ti was too late, meanwhile there were abotu 13 tables (seriously). but when we slipped him a 20 oo suddenly thers a table!!!! it was redicuouls about the reservations. HELLO its a an ALL-INCLUSIVE. it should be first come first serve basis. Whoever doesnt make it should go to the next restaurant. also at the mirador grill they take about 20 min 2 seat you and when they do they sit oyu all the way on the other side when the food is right there, also there is abotu 20 tables near the food. Dont wait on line just go find a table its a waste of time.

Knowing nothing about the RIo Mar, and being that I was on my way to the airport, I hunted my poor travel agent down on his cell phone. He did all he could, but the Paradisus had screwed up so badly that there was nothing he could do. We had paid for an all inclusive vacation and that was what we wanted... not even knowing anything about the Rio Mar. We arrived at the San Juan airport to be greated by someone from the Paradisus... making all sorts of empty promises, that EVERYTHING would be included and not to worry about a thing. The Rio Mar was gorgeous, they had a beaultiful beach, which by the way, the Paradisus does not. The staff was incredible and tried to accomodate us as much as possible.... There were a least 100 people in our situation... all greeted with 4 drink coupons a day and named the 2 restaurants we could eat at per meal... A FAR CRY FROM ALL INCLUSIVE.

It was everything we wanted. This was our first experience at an all-inclusive resort, so I have nothing to compare it to. I read all the reviews before we went and decided to go anyway. It was unfortunate that many people had bad experiences, but they provided us with the information we needed to make sure we did not have the same problems. One thing I think that helped was the timing of our trip. We arrived the Saturday before Easter Sunday so there were no conventions. It was all families. A couple of conventions came Thursday, but we were not bothered (although I heard that many others had their reservations changed to accomdate the convention and were very upset). Here is the breakdown of our experience: Arrival: The shuttle was waiting for us when we arrived and the driver loaded the bags. It is supposed to leave every hour on the hour, but apparently we were the only two so it left at 20 minutes after the hour. We were offered refreshments. It was a long drive, but we just sat back and enjoyed the scenery. Check-in: our bags were unloaded and we headed to the check-in. (We got to the resort at 12:20 - the official check-in is at 3:00). We waited about 10 minutes in line to check-in. The process was quick and painless and the clerk was friendly and happy to answer questions. We were told our room would not be ready until 3:00, but were shown to the hospitality room where we could change into our swim suits. We were provided with the resort wristband and told to enjoy the facilities. Our luggage was held up front for us. At 3:00 we checked to make sure our room keys were activated, grabbed our lugguage and took the trolley to our room. (we learned from previous reviews that luggage takes awhile to get to the room so we took it ourselves - no problem). Grounds: Beautiful. The palm trees, various flowers and the buildings were all beautiful. Even though our room was in the last building we walked to the pool daily just to take in the sights. Pool: Extraordinary! Even thought the resort was apparently booked full, we did not ever feel crowded in the pool. On the first day we chose two chairs with an umbrella direclty across from the pool bar. We sat there everyday! The poolside chairs and cabanas do get snatched up early. However, we are early risers so everyday we got up, got our stuff together, walked down to the pool, put our stuff on our chairs and went to eat. We were usually done with breakfast by 7:00. We never wanted a cabana (we were there for tans!) but, I think the cabana people get up at 3:00AM to out their stuff out! My daughter and I practically had the the pool to ourselves until 10:00 most mornings. Our one complaint about the pool area is that the pool bathrooms were disgusting most of the day. Yes, there should be more staff to clean, etc., but the other guests caused the mess. It is hard to believe that people pay to stay at a beautiful resort like this and leave the bathrooms the way they do. I will not provide details, but by the end of the day the bathrooms smelled like an outhouse. Poolside activities: there is an activity hut by the pool. They play fun music all day. It is probably loud if you sit near that area, we couldn't hear it where we sat so we were able to relax. We played water volleyball and basketball, participated in the daily dance lessons, water aerobics, bingo, and pingpong. My daugher played beach voleyball. There was a ton more to do. The staff at the activity hut is amazing! Upbeat and energetic ALL the time. The dance lessons were surperb! Bars: all bars were great with excellent service. Liquor was top notch and they were not stingy. They knew how to make all types of drinks. Food: Breakfast and lunch were always buffet. Mirador and Caribeno were usually open at the same time although Caribeno was closed for a couple of days during the week. Caribeno is the place to eat breakfast and lunch if you have the choice. The breakfast is hotter and the fresh fruit selection is outstanding. Lunch always has an amazing salad bar. Service is fantastic. Mirador is so-so, food is not hot, there are birds flying around and service is lacking. The ONLY non-friendly person we found at the whole resort was the hostess at the Mirador. We had no problems at all getting reservations at all thesit-down restaurants. We went to the concierge the day we checked in. All of our meals were amazing at Bamboo, Avocado and Romantico. Reservations are also needed for the buffets at night. Maridor did surprise us with their evening meal and show... it was great. surprisingly, our least favorite was the Italian buffet at Tuscano. Service was good, but food was bland and oily. Rooms: really nice and cool. The maids did a great job everyday. Beach/Watersports: we went kayaking and paddle boating. It was fanatastic - I nice was to truely see how beatiful the water is. The beach is not good for swimming becuase of the seawead growth and it makes the water look brown. However, the water is crystal clear and wonderful. If you take time to paddle down the beach (or walk) you will find quiet little spots with nice areas to take a dip. Even on the busiest of days there were NO people at some of the most beautiful spots on the resort. Bottom line: we loved every minute of it and did not want to leave.

We were told all the full service restaurants were booked for the rest of the week and could only eat in the buffet style restaurants. What a way to start the vacation having to argue with this person and demand to see the manager. We eventually did get the bookings we wanted. What surprised me was that these \"fully booked\" restaurants were only 75% full when I was there. It became apparent that the hotel staff are instructed to push as many guests to the buffets instead of the full service restaurants. They'd rather you eat at the buffet because it costs them less. You won't find lambchops, sirloin steak or fresh fish at the buffets. You'll only find these at the full service restaurants. Additionally, just about any \"hot\" dish I had at the buffet was never hot. It sits there in a large metal tray on steaming water. This does not keep the food hot. It barely keeps it warm. The overall service from the waiters is shameful. Some try hard, but there's not enough to attend to the guests. I had to wait 30 minutes to get a cup of tea... 20 minutes to order a second drink. Need a spoon, forget about it... help yourself if you can. Overall, the place is beautiful, has plenty of activities, but the food situation, and overall service is hit or miss. One day my room was not even cleaned by the maid. Even after calling the front desk, nobody was sent. At 10pm after going to the front desk, someone was sent. They compensated us with a free massage.

I was at the resort from March 23 to March 27. GETTING TO/FROM THE RESORT - The hotel runs a shuttle bus from the airport to the resort and from the resort to the airport. The charge is $30 per person each way. It leaves every hour on the hour and the trip takes close to an hour. Shuttle is a modern air conditioned vehicle that can take at least 25 people. The hotel has a representative at the baggage retrieval area at the airport. The representative will escort you to the bus. He will give you a receipt and you will be told to save the receipt as it will be needed when you board the bus for the return to the airport. This system is well organized . ChecK IN - It was a relatively slow process but not because of inefficiency. People have questions and this is time consuming RESORT GROUNDS - Truly beautiful. It is, in effect, a botanical garden. On a scale of 1 to 10 this is definitely a 10. RESTAURANTS - There are six restaurants, three serve buffet style and three are sit and be served and these are open for dinner only. For these you must make a reservation and that poses a problem since there is no way the resort can accommodate all guests on a given day. I was told the three restaurants can only serve 400 people a day. For a hotel with a capacity of more than 1000 lots of people can not get reservations and that makes for a lot of unhappy campers. That issue is the source of most of the complaints made and rightfully so. FOOD - The buffets are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The buffets were adequate but not as good as the buffets you find on most cruise ships or at other hotels. The ambiance at the sit down restaurants was very good at all three but the quality of the food varied. The best was the Japanese restaurant. The other two can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be rated much better than Fair. The service at all three was very good. POOL - The pool is large and there appears to be enough lounges for all. There are a number of huts that have thatched roofs and are open on all four sides that are available if you want to get out of the sun. Unless you get to the pool early you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find any vacant huts. There are about 20 of these placed around the pool. Other than the huts there is very little shade in the pool area. BEACH - This beach may be one of the worst in Puerto Rico. The beach is a narrow strip (15 to 20 feet at most) with poor quality sand and plenty of small rocks and pebbles that make walking, barefoot, painful. Further you have to go through sea grass to get out to where you can swim. I never saw more than four or five people swimming in the ocean at any given time. This is not the place to go if you want to swim in the ocean and refuse to go into a pool. They do have kayaks and paddle boats for guests. There is no charge for using this equipment. . ROOMS - The rooms are located in two story bungalows. The rooms are large, clean and well appointed. Each room has either two double beds or a king size bed. There is a sitting area with a sofa. Every room has a coffee maker and a refrigerator stocked with bottled water and cans of soda. You can get beer if requested. Each room has a terrace. A shuttle that operates all day is available to take you from your room to the lobby. There is a safe in the room and an ironing board but no iron ROOM SERVICE - Room service is available 24 hours a day. There is a $3 charge each time you order from room service. I used room service once. It took 35 minutes from the time I ordered to the time it was delivered. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find that to be an excessive wait since the kitchen is located a fair distance from the rooms. SERVICE - General service was good. All those workers I can in contact with were very pleasant and it was apparent they wanted to be of service if needed. ENTERTAINMENT - There was a show every night that featured dancing. The same performers appeared every night. The shows were entertaining CONCLUSION - On the whole it was a pleasant, restful experience. I am not a finicky eater so someone more discriminating would probably take issue with the food served. I went there because the price was right.

Here they are. If you expect 100% perfection...don't stay here. If you want to see Puerto Rico, this is a great bet. Overall, we stayed here and one other place and toured the entire island. Service is an issue in PR, period so either get used to it or go somewhere else (i.e. Mexico). At the Paradisus, I will concede that as we were traveling as a group, we received better treatment and had reservations in every eatery every night. The resort was 100% capacity during our stay. The biggest downside to this place (Paradisus and PR in general) is the location. Travel time from SJU to the resort is at least an hour because of traffic going to the NE part of the island. This appears to be a problem no matter where you stay. Transfers in PR are expensive. To get to and from the Paradisus is $60. To get to Fajardo it is also very expensive so getting transfers with your excursions is a must. Renting a car here or in San Juan is also not easy as parking is almost non-existent and is $15-25 per night at some places including the Paradisus. ROOM: Some of our group (3 of 17) had problems with their first room. Moldy, musty or dirty. Ours had a problem with the A/C leaking and the bathroom had not been cleaned well. They changed us immediately to a perfect room. I cannot complain as they fixed it. One thing I have learned is that in tropical climates, mold happens. It is a problem in MANY places I have visited, not just the Paradisus. GROUNDS: The grounds are immaculate. The lighting, architecture, layout, etc are all perfect. BAR: I NEVER waited for a drink (much to the dismay of my head!). I tipped $1 every 3rd or 4th round (multiple drinks in many cases) which even though it is all-inclusive, I do not see a problem. It became where they made my drinks as I walked up or asked if I wanted the usual. No problems with service at ANY bar in the resort. The locals make an average of $7000 per year per tourism websites. A $1 tip does alot for them. FOOD: Bad service at some places. This is the only reason I gave 4 of 5 stars. Quality in sit down places was just OK for me. Avocado served us cold food but that was the servers fault entirely. Mirador Grill, Toscanos (great server there) and Caribeno were all just fine. As for birds eating from the buffet...never saw it. I did see birds eating from empty tables outside. You cannot stop that and if it bothers you, go inside. OVERALL: We visited the rest of the island and frankly, there is not a ton to see. The Paradisus is just fine and we would go back there but most likely to a different island having seen it all. OTHER NOTES: Some did the rainforest and said it was OK and overpriced. I did central PR in a car in the mountains and had much better views without the tourists. We did a charter on the Salty Dog (saltydreams.com) and they were great. I would highly suggest a snokel trip as we saw many things that we have not seen before like Barracuda, puffer fish, Lion fish, Octopus, Squid and nice coral (for now). PR questions or comments?

Each day we went to the pool in the morning and stopped by the concierge to make a reservation for that night. If you do that there will be no problems.

The company I work for flew us to the Paradisus for a corporate escape. The hotel is beautiful but unfortunately several things made the trip somewhat disappointing. 1. A representative from the hotel did not meet us at the airport right away. We had to find our way to the \"pickup spot\" which was on a lower level of the airport. Unfortunately we had to carry our luggage down a set of stairs to get there. The buses took some time to arrive and when they did, several porters arranged our luggage while we were allowed to board. We were then counted and away we went. 2. We arrived at the hotel around 1:30 PM. The porters unloaded our luggage in the lobby and started labelling them with the name of our company. The hotel representative told us our luggage would be transported to our rooms shortly. 3. The staff greeted us nicely and wrapped an \"all inclusive\" band around our wrists. They told us our room was not ready but that they had a little snack waiting for us in the main lobby. We also had access to the bar while we waited. The first estimate they gave us was \"about an hour\". This was bearable as our vacation was paid for by my company. However, when the hour passed their next estimate was 3:00 PM. The front desk manager told us, \"we are working with housekeeping to have your rooms ready but we have been running into delays due to some guests that have checked out late.\" This seemed somewhat reasonable since our group included about 400 people and the hotel only had 500 rooms. We kept drinking and checked back at 3PM. Still a \"no go\" and the manager was singing the same tune. My wife started to get irritated as she also works in the hotel industry. She argued with the manager that our rooms should have already been prebooked and arranged. The manager recanted her earlier statement like a script in her head. She suggested that we could use their hospitality suite to change so that we could go to the beach. She told us to go check with the concierge to find our luggage. 4. We asked the concierge for our luggage. He pulled out a clipboard, found our names and told us our luggage had been transported to our room. He also told us that our room was ready. 5. We went back to the front desk to get our room key. The front desk agent told us our room was still not ready and was being cleaned by housekeeping. We told her that the concierge had indicated our room was ready and that he had transported our luggage there. She replied, \"he has no right to tell you anything like that. I'm sorry, but your room is not ready yet.\" Luckily the hotel representative that had met us at the airport spotted us at the front desk - my wife was getting very frustrated. Magically, he handed us our room keys. The front desk agent looked dumbfounded. 6. Happily we went to our room. When we go there, a musty smell pervaded the place. My wife used the word \"moldy\" to describe it. However, since it was 4 PM and we didn't want to wait or complain anymore, we changed and went to the beach. 7. Although the manicured grounds of the hotel were beautiful and the pool well kept, the beach left something to be desired. Patches of seaweed blocked access to the waves and the sand was hard and spotty with pebbles. Also, an anonymous guest told us that they had spotted jelly fish which really turned us off. We went back to the pool to enjoy what remained of the day. 8. Two restaurants offered a buffet breakfast - the Mirador Grill and the Avocado. The Grill offered scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, fruits, yogurt and several types of bread. Overall not particularly fantastic but edible. The Avocado added freshly made omelets to the array. 9. Lunch and Dinner were very similar buffets at both places often repeating left overs from the previous day. The selection of sea food was excellent including shrimp, snapper, mussels, etc. 10. The hotel also included plate service once per week by reservation only. The Avocado, the Mirador Grill, Romantico, etc. all had different themes. The food and the service was excellent. However, the bus staff were fairly inexperienced and had to be reminded to get water and coffee. 11. Nightly entertainment was subpar. A lounge singer churned out popular tunes in karaoke style with the assistance of a piano player and track sequencer. My wife commented that the entertainment was for seniors only - not suitable for anyone between 18 and 35. 12. The hotel also featured nightly live performances with different themes. Only two of the ten performers were near professional quality. The rest seemed to be in learning mode, often out of sync with each other. 13. The Casino was small and had few tables open simultaneously. Caribbean stud did not include a progressive or big jackpot. Overall, though, everyone was friendly and we had a decent time. I believe this place has a lot of potential. The staff needs training and the daily activities need development. Also, something has to be done about the beach.", "Date": "April 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Beach Fl", "Title": "\u201cWould not recommend this resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4942026", "Content": "My boyfriend and I love to go to all inclusive resorts for our vacations.

It was a major plus to be part of the Royal Service, which gave you extra accomadations and an ocean front room.

It was clean and comfortable. There was a bit of a musty smell, but that seems to be unavoidable in the Caribbean. The only challenge we encountered was in securing dinner reservations in the restaurants. The hotel needs to devise a better system. We were not allowed to make reservations before we arrived and when we arrived, the concierge was taking a lunch break. With some negotiation we were able to get reservations for each night we were there. (This was not the experience of most other guests we spoke to.) Oddly, each evening when we ate, approximately half of the tables were empty. This was odd because so many of the guests we spoke to told us they were not able to get reservations. I would rank the quality of the food as average to above-average. The servers and management were friendly and provided good service. Most of the hostesses, especially at the breakfast and lunch buffets were not very friendly or efficient. The pool area is beautiful and clean. There is plenty of room and plently of areas that you can sit if you prefer quiet to people watching and interacting. The bartenders were efficient and friendly. The beach is not ideal for swimming, but is beautiful and great for a walk. We enjoyed sitting on the grassy area overlooking the water and walking along the beach. We swam despite the rocks and seaweed and enjoyed ourselves. The spa was lovely and relaxing and we enjoyed massages. The hot tub and pool areas were very nice and virtually empty when we visited.

(note to resort:when it is a holiday week hire extra staff to clear tables it will make a HUGE differnce in service) 2)My 17 and 13 year old daughter traveled with us. If not for the Lacrosse team from Westchester it would have been very dull for them (Thanks for bringing them down) (note to the resort: Add a Disco or some sort of club for teens vacation week if they are happy so are their parents even if nothing else is good. Its a great resort for the little ones. We even watched the clown a couple of nights he was pretty funny! 3)rooms were gorgous but can't seem to get rid of the mildew smell. All in all my husband and my thoughts were it can be a fantastic resort if they somehow fix the dinner reservations and put in some sort of club. I would go back in a few years.

They were late seating reservations so we actually were eating at 11:30 p.m.! Additionally, there is only entertainment on certain nights. We missed that because we were eating. Nothing to do but gamble or watch TV at night with buffet eating breakfast, lunch and dinner is not my idea of luxury or service. Though I usally gain 5 pounds on vacation; I lost 2 pounds in four days. The hot buffet foods were cold, the milk was sour. Consequently, my favorite items on the buffet were salad and bread. I sound picky, but seriously, they had crab cakes on the menu at dinner and were substituting chicken nuggets! We talked to several people who said they were going out of the resort to eat a decent meal. Guests at dinner were frequently seen getting up to go the waiter station to get their own drinks!

They seemed overwhelmed which made me uncomfortable. Should I feel badly for ordering a drink? Bottom line is that it wasn't terrible, but for the price it was not the level of service we have received in other travels. Don't bother to complain, they look sympathetic and do nothing to correct the problems.

The food is excellent across the board, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner, and the selections are varied. There are several different types of restaurants for discriminating tastes, including oriental, italian, and continental. We preferred the buffets, and the Italian restaurant was particularly good. The pool is vast and winding, and interestingly contoured. The scenery at poolside along the ocean is a thing of beauty, and comfortably laid out. The only problem we had is that we found that we had quite a few mosquitoe bites when we arrived home, so we would recommend protection. As for tours, we enjoyed the rainforest and its myriad types of birds, insects, vegetation and plants. However, our favorite jaunt was to the fortress at El Morro fronting the town of Od San Juan. The fortress was constructed in the mid 1500s to repel invaders, and you can almost feel the battles while walking through this massive, multi-storied structure. And don't forget to take a walk through Old San Juan, which has character and diversity, as well as good buys for interested shoppers. All in all, we had a great time.

The food is horrible - I have never been on a vacation before and lost weight from not wanting to eat the resort food. The buffets are just plain awful. The lettuce was consistently wilted and brown, everything was always cold, none of the food is marked - you have to guess at what you are about to eat, they didn't even replenish the food once it was gone, and on more than 1 occassion I saw the staff picking at the food (with their fingers) for themselves - gross. The service was pretty bad - no incentive for the staff to fulfill a request from a guest. After asking 3 different people for cream for my coffee my coffee grew colder and colder and I never received the cream. Room service was better than any of the buffets - the downside to that is you have to order it and wait an hour to get it. I wonder who manages the staff because they were always standing about chatting away to one another and were never in any rush to help someone who may need it. They eat and socialize all day long - no wonder they work there. Too bad for the paying guest. We made our dinner reservations when we first arrived and only were able to get into Bamboo and Romantico. Bamboo was the best meal we had in the 4 days - Ironic that we came to PR and enjoyed Japanese food better than anything else they had to offer. Although we couldn't get a reservation for our first night in any of the restaurants we saw many open tables and when we asked they said WE ARE BOOKED SOLID. We had no choice but to go to the buffet and try to pick through the unidentified food and wilted brown salad. I was just wondering why they would build a resort on the base of a rain forest? It rains there a lot. Pretty annoying when you just get relaxed and have to run for cover during the many many downpours that come. I thought the rooms were ok and I didn't see any of the bugs that some of the people wrote about. I was really happy about that because the bugs would have put me over the edge. We had a clean, ocean view room near the Royal Service pool. I was very disappointed in the transfer bus - slow, the check-in - slow (and I was part of the Royal Service plan), the service - slow to none at all, the food - awful and the drinks are NOT top shelf and they do not put very much alcohol in your glass. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and I would never go back. I'm giving this 2 stars only because my husband and I were trying to make the best of it. The Royal Service Plan definitely saved us because the private pool had good chair service and when it wasn't raining and the sun was shining we did get to relax a little.

We try to go to an all-inclusive because of the convenience. Two years ago we went to El Conquistador Hotel in San Juan (not an all-inclusive) it was wonderful. Let me start with the bus that picked us up at the airport to take us to the Paradisus. After flying in from Philadelphia we were a bit tired from the travel. They had us walk a distance to the bus pulling along our luggage. It turns out we were the only 2 people on the bus and they couldn't meet us at our airline...The girl who met us at the airport saw my mom was exhausted and finally offered to take her suitcase. They had us waiting on the bus for about 15 minutes as the bus driver socialized outside the bus. After 45 minutes we arrived at the hotel and checked in. Our room was not ready and we decided to eat lunch and make reservations for the restaurants. We knew from past experiences its important to do that immediately or else we'd be stuck eating only at the buffets. We were given a hard time making the reservation since we didn't have the key to the room even though we knew the room number. I wouldn't give in and we got our reservations. I asked for 7 pm and they said it wasn't available but the times we were given were from 6-6:45. The first night we went to the Italian buffet and had to wait 45 minutes for a table. When we were seated we saw alot of empty tables and a number of tables that had to be cleaned off. I was furious that we had to wait so long. We were not the only ones. If a party of 10 walked in the hostess would seat them first all others had to wait. It's amazing that one would have to wait for a buffet when you are getting up and getting the food yourself. It didn't make sense since the tables were available. Right from the start I felt that the hotel didn't care about the people. By the way the food was quite fair. Our first restaurant with a reservation was Avacado the food was just ok, nothing to rave about. The service was awful. I asked for water 3 times before it was finally given. The second night we went to Romantico, we both ordered lamb chops medium, it came to us cold and bleeding. We sent it back and I think they put a match under it. Needless to say we didn't eat our meal. The last night we ate at Bamboo and it was very good. At the first 2 restaurants as we sat there we saw a number of empty seats at 7:00 the time we requested and were told it was booked at 7pm. We didn't appreciate being lied to either. We were told there is entertainment every night which also bought us to this hotel. The first night they had a show but we were to tired to see it. We thought we would catch the other shows. To our surprise there wasn't any as Loreal was having a convention and they were to busy setting that up. Because of that the guests had to suffer. People just sat around drinking or going to the casino, which is where we spent our nights. Our room was nice but we had flying bugs so we had to have the room sprayed. They have service to get you around the resort, the only trouble is it comes every 20 minutes. We were lucky enough that we were near the pool and restaurants. We had waited for the tram at the pool and they told us to go to the front of the resort. When we got to the front they said go to the back. We didn't feel anyone actually knew what was going on. I also asked if they had a computer service and they weren't sure. The last day someone finally told me that it was in the business office. Maybe it was our fault but I was under the impression there was a beach and we could go in the ocean. My mistake. They had some lounge chairs on grass with the ocean as the background. The pool was dirty. They had what looked like a hot tub or whirlpool with jets in the center of the pool. I got into the water which happened to be cold and got to the whirlpool and found out it was just jets and it was not a hot-tub. I thought that was rediculous to sit there and have cold water jets on your back. There wasn't a hot-tub at the pool but for $28.00 a day you could use the one at the spa along with the steam room and sauna. I was wondering what happened to ALL INCLUSIVE! We called for bottled water as our house keeper forgot to to put new bottles in our mini bar. They told us that there would be a $3.00 charge to bring it to our room....my mom told them it could wait until later. That type of thing turns me off to a place to be so petty. We did confront the manager about our gripes. We felt something should have been done to rectify some of the things we told her about. She said she would tell someone the next day and they would get back to us. Of course that never happened.

There was 10 of us on an annual family vacation. This year we decided to really splurge and go for a 5 star experience. Our package included air from Newark, NJ to San Juan, PR transfers and all inclusive resort. The total price of our package was $2980 for a couple. I felt it was important for everybody to fully understand what is really happening at this resort. We arrived at Paradisus at 4:05 and waited 17 minutes in the lobby line to be waited on by an extremely unfriendly receptionist who checked us in. Check in time was to be 3:00. Our rooms wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ready until 4:30. She said that we go to the bar or the lobby restaurant and enjoy the all inclusive meal or drink. We asked to be compensated for our wait as we just traveled for 5 hours. She suggested that we could have a drink or meal. After we explained it was all inclusive and obviously we can have some food or drink, she stated there was nothing she could do. The resort grounds are very beautiful. When we were ready to go to our rooms, we were driven by a bus boy who was very friendly. Our room was musty and remained that way the whole time we were there. The rooms were clean and very nice. The most important thing for you to know is that the restaurants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 quality and service was extremely poor. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to get any reservations until 9:00 for all nights we were there. The first night we had a reservation at Avacado. Our reservations were supposed to be at 9:00 and they made us sit outside until 9:20, even though there were plenty of available seats inside the restaurant. We ordered at approximately 9:45. We had our apps at 10:00. Our meal finally arrived at 10:40, but it was cold for most of us. We were the last people to leave the restaurant, but it seamed that every waiter had their own agenda and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the last waiter who was waiting on us. He served us desert which took another 20 minutes and never asked us for coffee, but when we asked him it took another 15 minutes. The food was very poor. Second night we ate at Romantic and the service was worse. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leave this Restaurant until 11:30. We felt we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone as another party of golfers were extremely upset. The one guy customer actually got up from his table and went back into the Kitchen. He came out and approached our table and asked us if we were upset of the service. He told us that he was sick and tired of waiting and that he had a business party with him that were golfing all day. He told us that the waiters were just in the back \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hanging out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I must say the quality of the food was good. The third night we ate at Bamboo. We had reservations for 9:00, however, they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seat us until 9:50. The hostess was extremely rude and unfriendly. The food was good and we had a good time. The major drama that night was a scene at the next station. The cook accidently hit one of the customers with one of his shakers and it made a big splash in his soup and thus all over his shirt and pants. The cook didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acknowledge what happened and the customer threw a big fit in front of the whole restaurant. The fourth and last night we ate at the Italian restaurant buffet. The place was a pig pen. There were dirty tables all over. Although we only had to wait 10 minutes, the quality of the food was extremely poor. I must say that we travel on business and pleasure and have stayed a many 5 and 4 star hotels and resorts. We feel that we were ripped off and will never return to this place. I was a waitress for six years during college and I believe that the restaurant staff is not trained and not motivated. Our party of 10 people was dissatisfied because of the poor service and mediocre at best food. We tried to communicate our concerns during our stay.

I have never written a hotel review before but feel I have to in this case. We stay in 5 star hotels around the world and usually spend Christmas in one in Mauritius. We are a young couple and joined family there for three nights. The location is nice except it is very far from any town etc. if you wanted to try and escape to a local restaurant. The rooms were fine, large but not luxurious as one would normally expect with a five star. We were paying $1000 a night and for that it was a very average room. The (free) mini bar only contained water and soft drinks. While the water was welcome we would prefer a full bar and the option to decide paying for a bottle of wine. Our first introduction to the hotel was at a slow check in where we were told we would have to wear a wrist band for our stay and given cards which would allow us to get a pool towel each. If the pool towel was not returned at the end of each day one has to pay $30. I have never stayed in a 5 star (or any hotel for that matter) which didn't hand out towels at the pool. We felt like we were in boarding school! The next day we met the rest of our family who had already been there a week who confirmed it was really dreadful. In particular they complained about the food, the wine, the incredible system of having to queue to make restaurant reservations and the lack of a supervised childrens club. The had four children under 8 with them and the 'supervisor' just walked off one day and left them on a beach with other children. We decided to make the best of it and found the adult only pool which is part of a royal service package. For $25 each extra per day we could use it and avail of its relatively civilised atmosphere and its more relaxed towel regime - they gave you two towels! The pool staff here were very friendly and regularly brought around water etc. On the food all I can say is that it wasn't good. Breakfast was the best of the lot as there was plenty of fresh fruit. We avoided lunch after the first day. The salad bar looked as if everything had come out of tins. We ordered a bottle of wine and it came long after we had finished eating. With tips being included in staff's wages they have no incentive to be that attentive. Saying that we did meet some very pleasant staff. We tried three of the restaurants - Bamboo (ok), Avocado (bad) and Tuscana (very average pasta bar). There was loud entertainment in all three and constantly in the main bar area. The hotel is aimed towards large families with plenty of children where costs can be controlled with the all inclusive system and people aren't that interested in good food. It seemed ideal for teenage children and the main pool was full of life. It is not designed for couples at all. We were forunately only staying for three nights on a stopover before we headed on to another Caribbean island. The rest of our family checked out a week early and moved to the Ritz-Carlton in San Juan which they found very good - their main reasons for leaving being the food and the lack of fully supervised child care facilities. I am giving the hotel two stars as the spa was really magnificant. We used it every day. The massages were among some of the best we have ever had worldwide and we travel alot. The staff there were also excellent. The adjacent gym is well equipped but tiny for the number of guests in the hotel and was full at peak times. The casino was also well equipped and seemed to be well run. Finally the bugs - I should mention I got about 40 little bites in the 3 days we were there.

I stayed from 12/27-1/2 and the staff shortage was very obvious. While I expected a slight drop in service during a peak holiday week, the service level was totally unacceptable. I heard from some of the local staff that much of the service people walked out of the resort in early December because of wage issues. As a result, they are completely understaffed and unable to adaquately service their customers. To charge people $700-$800 per night and be told I cannot make a reservation in one of their better restaurants is unacceptable. If I wanted to eat at buffets all week, I would have went to Punta Cana and spent $300-$400 per night. While some of the positive reviews on this site occured during less peak dates, during the busy season this hotel either needs to close half their rooms so they can adequately service people or drop their rates by 50%! The turn over in management is extremely high and finding competent people to manage this hotel is very difficult.

I am surprised at a lot of the comments as we did not experience a lot of the negatives that others have experienced. Hopefully I won't bore you with the details but I will go into our entire experience there. First of all, due to research on the internet, we booked the Royal Service which was probably worth it in the long run but also the source of the few negatives we experienced. We arrived the day after Christmas around 1:00 PM (at airport) and had originally planned on taking a taxi to the resort which we figured would be faster than waiting for a shuttle at about the same price. when we got off the plane, a Paradisus representative was there waiting for other guests. We were able to take the shuttle which was $120.00 round trip. It did take an hour to get to the resort from the airport - seemed forever - but anything would have seemed forever after a 4hour plus flight from Chicago. When we got to the resort, we were asked our names as soon as we got off the shuttle and when they saw that we were 'Royal Service', we were immediately escorted to a special lounge where we were checked in. So, Royal Service saved us the longer check in at the front desk. While checking in we asked about different aspects of the resort and royal service and it was suggested that before our 'butler' (I use the term very loosely) would give us a tour of the resort and take us to our rooms that we should immediatly book our reservations for our restaurants. The butler took us to the restaurant line (one person was in front of us) and we were told that due to a computer problem and cancellations, we could only book that night and the next. I really didn't feel like coming back and while she stepped away to get a reservation book, I asked our butler about it and told him I would prefer to book our entire week. When she came back he spoke to her in spanish and lo and behold, we booked our entire week, got reasonable times (all around 7PM) and tried out almost all of the restaurants - Bamboo is the absolute best. This resulted in a nice 'extra' tip for our butler (since all tips and gratuities are included). Room - Absolutely gorgeous and no musty smell like some people have mentioned. Huge towels, robes, unbrella, mini rifrigerator stocked each night - just softdrinks water and beer. Balcony - ours looked out toward the mountain/rain forest. The four royal service buildings are very close to beech and to the main resort. And, they have there own private adults only pool around maybe 16 or so cabanas that can be reserved by the day. Do that immediately too ... the first couple days you may be on a wait list - they give them away if you don't claim them by 10AM. Basically we beached in in the AM and Cabana'd it in the PM other than the one day we took a tour of the rain forest which is absolutely phenomenal. The main pool was definitely filled with a lot of kids, but the beach was not nor was the private pool. The beach - Due to research on the internet we brought aqua socks which were a must if you wanted to use the beach as opposed to the pools. From what I understand, the beach is a 'natural' beach and can't be groomed. The beach itself and the views were fantastic. There is really two beach areas .. the first being the natural beach which is from the water to boulders that stretch out along the whole beachfron ... this beach was around 10 to 15 feet wide I would say. Then there are the boulders and behind the bolders, between the beach and the resort is what seems to be a man made beach area where a lot of people sunned and played volleyball, etc. The water is absolutely calm, as there is a sandbar maybe 200 yards out where the waves crash. The beach is rocky but with aqua socks, absolutely no problem. the other problem with the beach is the water where there is muich vegetation. However, with aqua socks and good vision (you can see where the vegetation is) you can find good places to swim and I was in the ocean every day having a ball. If we had our kids (now adults) they would have wanted some motorized fun (jet skis) but for us, it was nice and calm and beautiful. We kayaked some days we paddle boated others and just vegetated the rest. We felt no reason to take a cab to any other beach. BRING AQUA SOCKS! Restaurants and food - Breakfast and lunch were buffet - the 'outdoor restaurant was primarily for people who were at the pool and didn't want to put on shorts and shirt.. the indoor restaurants were for everyone else (including a few who didn't care to listen to the rules and came in barefoot and in swimming suit). Buffet was average. Breakfast, if you are an egg eater, have them make you fresh eggs... the scrambled in the buffet were atrocious. Also, I couldn't wait to hit O'hare airport on the way back to get a cup of coffee as there isn't a good cup in Puerto Rico! All in all, breakfast and lunch were good ... only real complaint was lack of fruit which I found surprising. Some days the fruit was out other days it wasn't. Dinner was for the most part above average. Bamboo great - this is the japanese style restaurant where 12 people sit around a table and they prepare the food in front of you. Nice way to meet people and food was great. Romantica was very good but service was slow and slower. Toscano is Italian but buffet style .. they will make whatever kind of pizza you want, or the pasta dish will be made in front of you with whatever ingrediants you want. Wasn't thrilled about a buffet for dinner but I found the food very good here. Avocado is the 'California' style restaurant and we were warned that the food sucked. We were there two nights and the first night the food was very very good - we had fish of the day and second night it was just ok. We did not try the Mexican nor the Caribbean. Royal Service - Helped us out at check in. Helped us out getting reservations to the restaurants. Didn't know where to get ice (machines are not in your building0 so we called and asked where the machines were .. they told us not to worry , that was part of royal service - they would bring us ice. 45 minutes later - no ice. called again... 45 minutes later we left for dinner, still no ice ... never got it. Next day called again ... no ice... called agian and was promised it in 15 minutes... 30 minutes later got a phone call making sure we got it and told them no. finally two differentpeople came with ice. They have robes in the room and if you want to buy one you call and they will send over a new one. On New Years eve, our last night, I decided that I would get one as a souvenier. Called thenumber and no answer. Went to dinner and stopped at royal service lounge .. they told me they would have one sent to room. Never got it... wasn't billed for it either. (By the way - check the tv account summary every now and then ... they charged me $400 by mistake and corrected it by crediting me $300.00. I didn't like their math and called - no problem getting it corrected. Part of royal service was getting a daily newspaper .. despite calls and a personal visit to royal service lounge, I never got it. New Years eve we called and told them what time we needed them to come get our luggage and take it to the shuttle (5:45 AM for a 6AM shuttle) and no one showedup. Finally after two calls, someone came. Neither did the shuttle. Finally at 6:30 they were able to scrounge one up for us and the other family going to the airport. By the way, return trip to airport on New Years day at 6:30 AM was only 30 minutes - no traffic. So, royal service was for the most part frustrating whenever we had to rely on someone to do something. Casino - Yes it is small - but dealers are very friendly and this was our entertainment. Basically the table games they had were roulette, caribbean stud, three card poker, several blackjack tables, late at night they opened a texas holdem table and then there were slots. We knew ging in it was a small casino and didn't have a problem with it although I would have loved it if they had a craps table. Entertainment - Lounge as nice in early evening - a duet with a piano player and a singer. Later a band that could get quite loud. And each night at 10:00 entertainment in the ballroom. We go on a loto f cruises and love going to the shows. We went the second night and lasted 20 minutes... never went back. If you are going for the entertainment - this is not the place to go. All in all, we had an absolutely fantastic time ending with the champaign and fireworks they provided for New Years. Would we go back - in a second. I would get royal service again but knowing now how they act, would stay on them a lot more about getting what I paid for. I would also book another excursion because I was getting antsy by the end. I am not used to totally vegetating and would haveliked another getaway. I forgot about the spa/gym. I can't tell you about the spa, but tthey had a very nice gym which was very busy. Around 6 treadmills, one eliptical, about three exer4ciswe bikes and a lot of weight machines. I should have used the gym more than I did because it definitely wasn't a break even in terms of working out and relaxing with a rum drink - but what the heck - it was vacation!!

I agree that it is a result of an all-inclusive deal. They have no motivation or incentive to provide 5 star service. The room was clean and the pool was enjoyable. It did seem a bit \"spring-break like\" at times but we sat as far away from the music/mc as we could have.

But on the other hand, they're big (with space for a full king and pullout couch and possibly a rollaway too), and the mattresses are wonderful. There are also issues with restaurant reservations. Very slow and your choice of restaurants is not guaranteed. The beach is very beautiful to look out on, and the water sports are fun, but it's not for swimming.

If you didn't see these meals as your last suppers, it was passable. Bamboo was fantastic, the food and entertainment. We traveled with children both under 7, and there was a lack of kids club entertainment for them, but the pools more than made up for that, and the beach was steps away, so they could run back and forth and still be supervised.

First, the resort is about an hour from the international airport in Isla Verde and transportation is not included to and from the hotel ($120 round trip for 2 adults). The building and the bungalows are very pretty as well as the pool area and the mountain view (it's the rain forest called Yunque that can be seen from the pool area) sadly, the outdoor lobby where the main desk is located is just simply too hot, I was sweating heavy while waiting in line to be checked in (also long line at check out since express check out from room TV was not available) and nobody offered us any refreshment or water, also the desk agents did not look very happy to be working in those conditions.

I had a good dinner at Bamboo (japanese) one night but was not able to get in for the rest of my stay. The buffet style restaurants( Caribeno and Toscano) are disappointing to say the least. The main bar was enjoyable and the bartenders gave good service while a lady sang spanish songs, enjoyed that very much and tasted a bit of the national culture talking to locals and watching them dance but this was the only nightlife the hotel offered since they have no live bands or dance club. My biggest complaint was lack of service, employees looked overworked and unhappy, all areas looked understaffed. Concierge was never available during the evening and the front desk was too overwhelmed with guests unable to help us at any time. There is no free shuttle bus to Luquillo Beach which is about 10 minutes from the resort and simply mediocre nightlife inside the resort and not much too do in the municipality or province of Rio Grande where the resort is located (you have no choice but to pay a taxi $140 to enjoy San Juan's exciting nightlife ).", "Date": "December 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice sized rooms, but ............\u201d", "Author": "LMRKW", "ReviewID": "UR4157679", "Content": "All-inclusives usually are a red flag for me, so our family went to the Paradisus with low expectations. Check-in was painless, and our luggage was delivered to our rooms promptly. We were pleasantly surprised at the nice sized rooms, not royal service but we were an upper floor which I think have larger rooms. It was warm & humid late in November in Puerto Rico, and maybe it's always humid here since the rooms have a slightly moldy smell. All the surfaces & fabrics felt a little sticky & damp from all the moisture in the air. The shower/tub in our room had a slow drain, meaning by the time you got finished with a 10 minute shower you were standing in a foot of water and after you got dressed left the bathroom 5 minutes later the tub still had not drained yet. This problem was made somewhat somewhat better after we complained, instead of 12 inches of water you stood in 2 inches of water. We were a large group so all of our dinner reservations were made months in advance. \"Bamboo\", the japanese hibachi style restaurant was decent. Very limited menu. \"Toscano\" - is as horrible as everyone else says it is. Italian buffet without even one decent italian dish. Only edible food item here was the cookies & cream ice cream which - thank goodness came ready to eat from Breyer's. The service was the worst here. \"Avocado\" buffets for breakfast & lunch were good bets. Did not have dinner here, but I think it's always buffet style regardless of the meal. \"Romantico\" has an ambitious menu, and the menu descriptions raise your expectations for the food. The food was decent but certainly does not deserve a rating much above \"Bamboo\". Ask about the policy for young children at \"Romantico\", this restautant is supposed to be Paradisus' premiere dining place so they discourage very young children from eating there. Most alcoholic beverages are included in the stay rate, but there are premium liquors & wines that can be obtained for an extra cost. I personally did not eat at the \"Mirador Grill\" buffet by the pool, the children in our group were ok with it since they had burgers, but the adults in our group catergorized the food at the \"grill\" as slop. Silly one towel per guest policy at the pool, and you had to remember to bring your towel card with you to the pool in order to receive a towel. Many lounge chairs had black mold on them. Invisible biting sand flies or something in great abundance by the pool areas and in the grass by the beach. I have been back from Puerto Rico over a week and am still scratching at 75 -100 bites. Front desk management/service was great. Support staff service, ex. waiters, housekeeping, bartenders, etc...., were not so good, we suppose because of the nature of all-inclusives there isn't any incentive for the staff to put in any more effort than is absolutely necessary. All in all, we had a nice time because of the company we were with.

They could only do 2 manicures and one pedicure, each seperately. All meals are buffet with 3 nights of ala carte at restraunts made by reservations. On our 3rd night the restraunt was closed and we were never advised. When it is off season you only have the option of eating at one restraunt which is buffet style.

There weren't too many choices at the buffet for breakfast or lunch, but dinner was excellent, especially the hibaci at the japenese restaurant and the beef at the el romantico. We took a tour of the rainforest (15 minutes away) that was interesting for $45 each. The only problem was I was bit all over by some small bugs by the pool bar that I think came out of the grass.

For the 5 days of our trip that overlapped with the CSI, the services available were limited to almost nonexistent to individuals who were not part of the event. The entire 8 days we were there, we were forced to eat at the same restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as all other restaurants, excluding the 2 restaurants open for reservations only, were only open for celebrity events. In addition, on Friday evening, the large pool and beach area was closed off completely to guests who were not part of the CSI. My husband and I complained to the royal service staff and to the General Manager, and although they were concerned about our unpleasant stay and frequently checked on us, nothing changed. If it would have not been for the excitement of seeing all the celebrities, my husband and I would not have had a pleasant trip. The tours available through the hotel are limited and short, and other than hanging out at the bar or the extremely small, 1-room casino at night, there was absolutely NOTHING to do there....no events for the non-celebrities at all.

We went to the front desk and were told that we were a bit early, as they only take guest in at 3:00 PM, but that we could check in an hour and a half early for a fee of $100.00. I declined and sat down to wait in the lobby. I then tried to wander around the grounds but was stopped by security because I didn't have one of their arm bracelets identifying me as a guest so I returned to the lobby. At at little past three I went to the front desk to inquire on the room and was informed that it was not ready but they were working on it and that it would be available in another 20 minutes. I was then given a guest bracelet and allowed to have a drink in the lobby bar. At around 3:30 I returned to the front desk and again was informed that the room was not ready but that they would be glad to put me up in a Garden View room that was available, I declined having already paid for an Ocean View room and asked what the hold up was. They weren't sure but were sending someone to the room to see if service had cleaned it. Many apologies later they informed me that the room had been ready for some time because it had been vacant for a number of days. We then walked to room 924, about a quarter of a mile, as the golf cart trolley was full and no other cart was available. I arrived at the room but none of my luggage was there. Called the front desk only to be informed that the luggage had been misplaced but that they were looking for it and would have it to our room as soon as they found it. Many apologies later the luggage arrived and we were off to our first day of fun. We found the following during the next few days: Not all of the restaurants were open because this is their low season. So we had a choice of the \"Bamboo\", Japanese or the \"Romatico\", their Seafood and Steak and only by reservation. The Avocado buffet was available for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. The Caribeno, Mirador and Toscano were closed. The food was sub-standard, except for the Japanese Sushi Bar within \"Bamboo\" which by the way only has seating for six on a first come first serve basis. There are only two bars for the common guest. One in the Lobby and one in the pool. The other two bars are only available to guest who purchased the \"Royal Service\". I inquired about that and they wanted an additional $200.00 a night. The mini bar in the room only contains water and Coke and they do not re-stock unless you ask room service to re-stock it. The beach is unusable as it is full of seaweed and non-friendly marine life. It also does not have sand but a course gravel. No one uses it. Activities were Pool aerobics at noon, Yoga in the morning and the piano in the lobby at night. I was not aware of anything else happening so the pool and the pool bar is about it for entertainment. They did have sailboats and kayaks but I saw few guest using them because of the beach area is unappealing. The guest shuttle between the main building and guest rooms seem to travel very infrequently so I only took it about 4 times during my entire stay walking the 1/4 of a mile to and from the pool and lobby. I considered this the Paradisus exercise routine. They do not provide Free Internet Access but charge $14.95 a day for its use. They will also charge you an additional $15.00 if you do not have your own Ethernet cable. Dial up Internet is available at a $2.00 a minute charge and are happy to rent you a WIFI card for $25.00 a days if you wish.

However, getting clean towels was extremely difficult and at times i found myself forced to use clean undershirts as towels because the staff and front desk was so unresponsive to my requests for fresh towels. I also made the mistake of trying room service which was fine if your able to eat disgusting deli meat or enjoy a portion of 4 over cooked buffalo wings. 2) Pool - The pool was gorgeou, spacious and suprsingly clean. Although my feet were covered in disgusting corking I didn't mind cleaning them after I got out of the pool because at least the water was clean (to the naked eye). I did enjoy the swim up bar until I was struck in the face by a young adult with a ball who thought it would be funny to hit someone with a drink. By the way if you can't swim dont go in the pool till saturday because the pools aren't protected till then. 3) Nightlife - If you like going to bed early and being surrounded by locals and drug dealers than you are in for a treat. The most exciting part of the nightlife at this resort was seeing that nobody was having fun. 4) Restaurants - They are all equally bad, but some have nicer staff than others. I ate at the Bamboo restaurant 4 times I enjoyed the food but found myself to only have a good time when I was able to finish off my mandatory 3 bottles of wine per meal. Drinking to create sanity is never something that should be a necessity on vacation. By the time you get to the hotel you will realize its too late to go back. Enjoy the beach while you can, seating for 6 on a beach sometimes can get really crowded. However, by the end of the week I found myself laughing hysterically at the situations around me and realized that I did have fun.", "Date": "August 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced for an average resort..more like a 4 star\u201d", "Author": "Aristah23", "ReviewID": "UR3747499", "Content": "This review is kinda longer but worth the read. I am an avid recreational vacationer who usually stays at 4-5 star properties that are AI. I'm not super-picky, all I ask is that I get my $$$ worth. I stayed at the Paradisus during July 2005. We went as a family of 6 and went with the Royal Service. For a vacation that cost us $15K, it definitely wasn't worth it. I saw NO difference between the usual guest and the Royal guest (besides the use of a lounge and a pool that my 8 year old couldn't use anyway). The food was just OK...not gourmet. The restaurants seem to be understaffed. When you ask someone a question, you'll get 6 different answers. I had to make several calls to housekeeping, and Royal Service just to get enough towels. I was on the phone at the least twice a day asking for something (the minbar was never refilled and I never had enough bath towels). The rooms were absolutely beautiful and the grounds are amazing. The staff at the Royal Lounge tried their best to help you out but senior management seemed unresponsive to guest problems. When I checked in, I was told that one of the oceanview royal suites I booked was not available and they insisted that I never booked an oceanview to begin with. After proving my case with documentation from my travel agent, they believed me but couldn't get me the room. I opted for a refund for the difference b/w the rooms and was told that I'd get a letter of refund at the end of my stay to show my travel agent. As if that letter was ready for me upon departure! I had TO WAIT for the letter to be drafted while my airport transfer waited for me! The butler service was OK and it seemed like I'd get problems resolved faster by making the calls myself. What did I pay extra for? As for reservations at the restaurants, I really didn't have much of problem (the resort was fairly empty for the most part of my stay). On the weekends, they allow locals to use the pool area (which is totally inappropriate). If you want to go into town, open your wallet! It cost almost $30pp to get into town via shuttle. And if you want to go to the rainforest (which you can see from the resort...that's how close it is) is $50pp. Speaking of being ripped off, the cherry on the cake of this vacation was when I received my cell bill when I got home I found unauthorized calls to Dominican Republic on my phone while I was there! Apparently someone in housekeeping helped themselves to my hidden cell phone to call their family! HIDE YOUR CELL PHONES IN THE SAFE OR TAKE THEM WITH YOU! This resort has much room for improvement. Perhaps I'll go back when they get their act together. If you get a good deal on this resort, I'd try it.

The hotel grounds are very nice especially at night all lite up. There really isn't a beach, but you sit on like a step up from the beach that has grass and sand in different areas. Not bad. The water is clear and very warm. The food was very good, but if you make reservations before you go, make sure you double check them when you get there. The girl had them written in her book, but not in the computer and it took some time to find them. I was worried about the staff from reading some of the reviews, and they were right. The staff is a little slow and new. You get different answers from different people which is the most frustrating. For example I called down to the desk and asked if you need long pants for the one restaurant we were going to in the evening and they said no. Well when we got there the host said you need pants, but she let us go. The casino was nice, but I would like to see $2 tables and not all $10 and $25. They did have nickal slots. The kids will like the arcade room. It's just about 9 playstations and xbox set up to computers. The drinks are all top shelf and the pool bar is cool. Instead of a high rise hotel, this one is spread out on the grounds in 2 story units. Some are pretty far, but they have a tram car that runs back and forth that is not always easy to find. What I really wasn't happy with is that on the weekends this place is open to the public and they have local company party's here. So if you can imagine Thurs and Friday this place was empty. Running about 24%. Then Sat and sunday it was packed. The pool was packed with mostly all Peurto Ricon's and there familys including kids. We enjoy meeting people from around the world, and I really didn't see that many here. The Perto Ricon's were very nice and friendly, but they mostly keep to themselves. There are enough lounge chairs also even when it's packed. Also the place is so big that even if it's packed, mostly around the pool, you can walk to a area that's empty. I was worried when we first got there and there was one person checking people in and we were in line for about 20 minutes. Also we were suppose to get all these coupons for things like massages and casino chips and I had to ask for all of them. The girl really didn't know. We rented a car from the hotel for a day and drove to old San Juan which was nice. Another thing that the hotel needs help with is the disco. The disco in located in a auditrium. The dance floor is in front of the stage. At 11:00 the disco lights come on and terrible music that is prerecorded is played. There was never anyone in there except for one night that we were in there with the guy who runs it and he was showing us new dances. They really need a didicated room with a bar and dj. They need atmosphere. We enjoyed dancing till dawn at Jamaica and missed it. All and all it was nice, but I don't think I would come back.

We are professionals who travel 5-6 times per year to locations near and far (Italy, Greece, Croatia, the Caribbean, Mexico, Hawaii etc) and stay at high end resort and hotels. We are avid cruisers, fitting in one or two cruises per year, mostly on premium or luxury level cruise lines (Radisson, Seabourn, Princess, Celebrity). I write this review in order to share my experiences with those that visit this forum for truthful and useful information. These are observations of my experience My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in June from the 25-30; at the suggestion of many tripadvisor posters we paid the extra $$ and got the \"Royal Service\". I don't know if it was worth the extra $$ because we did not speak with any others who were not in \"RS\" (not by choice) it just seemed everyone we ran into was in the \"RS\" area. I won't go into too much detail about the grounds as others have done a great job of that on this site already, sufice it to say, the grounds are spectacular. The pools (both Royal Sevice and main pool) are beautiful, the beach is kept natural and clean (and many many times we were the only ones there so it is private and peaceful as well). The rooms are quite spacious and for the most part comfortable (more on this later) The staff we encountered were, mostly, helpful; of course you will encounter the employee who won't be helpful in any situation this is not the resorts fault it just is the way some people are. I will add that tipping was definitely expected any and everywhere we went. How much and how often you tipped certainly paid a great part in how good your service was. Overall, I have no major complaints about the resort staff or grounds. My issues: BATH TOWELS- were threadbare and had holes in them on more than one occasion (i would not have made a point to speak with management for one isolated incident) In deference to the staff in Royal Service they attempted to resolve this issue (i was there when they called) but two days later nothing had been done the dirty robes were still in our room and the towels with holes were still being placed in our room. Maybe housekeeping took offense to getting a call from Royal Service?? I don't know but i am sure if the general manager had called this would problem would have been resolved and quickly. SHEETS- had holes BATHROBES-one had a huge coffee stain runing up one whole sleeve, the other had numeorus stains all over. NIGHTLY TURN DOWN SERVICE -only happened once during our stay. RESTAURANTS-Paradisus tout themselves as having 6 restaurants; of these six there were only two open during the day (one really and it is buffet). This would not be a big deal if you had some variety in the food, but both areas (they are not really separate restaurants but two connected areas with different names) had the same things day in and day out and it was usually picked over and poorly presented. I swear if I had to eat fried chicken one more time I was going to cluck! There was no variety even for dessert, Flan, Chocolate cake, ice cream. Evenings were not that much better- Romantico we ate here two times during our stay not so much becasue the food was good but because the other choice Bamboo was so bad (more on this later). Avocado-(which actually had good food), was only open twice during our stay (and we were not able to get in the first day because they were \"booked\" . All the restaurants were supposedly booked yet we saw 10 tables at Romantico sit empty for over two hours while we had our dinner. This is not counting the tables that were left uncleaned throughout the night. and yes Romantico was \"booked\" the night we were there . Bamboo-was a bad hibachi experience which might have been saved if the staff at Bamboo had offered some information on the sushi and appetizers available in the other room (even though we and another couple waited 45+ minutes at our table with nothing to eat before our \"show\" began). I believe I saw desserts on the menu but I could not tell you anything about them because after waiting 1/2 hour after our meal no one came to ask if we wanted any we all left. Poor restaurant management? maybe, sneaky expense management? more likely. My observation was that corners were being cut in the food department and many many people were unhappy about it. Unfortunately, none of the people I asked with said they had or planned to complain. The staff was without a clue, asking 5 of them what restaurant was opened on any given day resulted in 5 different answers (sadly all wrong). Spa-Overpriced for the service which was ho hum, nothing to write home about but certainly nothing to complain about. Again tips were defintely expected Car rental- we reserved a car week before we arrived, we checked once at the resort on Monday she confirmed that she indeed had our reservation for the Thursday returning to the airport. On the Wednesday we went to the Avis counter to check on our car (we had nothing to do) only to find out that they had no cars for us becasue they were short in SJU airport so they took all the vehicles. Now we were stranded! the only suggestion teh woman had was that she could refer us to a local rental agency but they only had one location so we would have to bring it back to them! so what good was this doing us! upon bringing this to the attention of Royal Service staff i was told that for $60 they could have the shuttle bring us to the airport to pick up a car. So now we have to pay $60 on top of the $60 per day the car was costing us just to leave this place! the least the should have done was to comp us the shuttle to the Avis counter at the airport. My biggest complaint? Lack of response from Sr. management These issues mentioned above could have easily been resolved by the manager whom we attempted to speak with on several occasions to no avail. It is so surprising to me that a hotel general manager would ask to hear their guests' comments and even take the time to respond to these Tripadvisor reviews but when presented with the opportunity to resolve a valid issue first hand before it gets to a review point; can be so totally clueless. Had Mr Lapp taken the ten minutes or to speak with us and listen to what we had to say I am sure he would have felt as did his other management personnel (who did attempt to to resolve these issues to no avail) that this was not acceptable anywhere in the world but even less in an alleged 5* resort. We paid good money to stay here, we were asking for nothing more than what we paid for, the quality were were promised and the quantity were were promised; 6 restaurants, clean robes non threadbare towels and sheets with no holes. We were not looking to get more than we paid for, but we were certainly looking to get what we were promised!

When we first arrived, we were very pleased. The resort is beatifully decorated and the pool is lovely. However, our excitement was short-lived! Our room smelled dank and moldy (so much so that my luggage and all my clothes smelled like it when we got home), and the toilet was not working properly. Our sheets had stains on them and the bed was not very comfortable at all. After spending about 30 minutes at the pool, we had had enough! The hotel overbooked the rooms due to a convention that weekend (we were told by a staff member that there were more than 4 people staying in a lot of rooms). The pool was extremely crowded and got dirty quickly - the guests were leaving plastic cups and straws throughout the pool area and they were floating around the water. The staff did try to clean it up but there was just way too many people for them to keep up. It was also impossible to get a drink at the bar, and when you were finally waited on, they were often out of whatever it was you wanted. The bartenders also seemed put out to take your drink orders. If the beach was beautiful, I would have been just as happy to spend the day there, but as another guest had said, it was non-existent. What little sand they had was covered in broken rocks, making it impossible to walk along and shallow water was covered in patches of sea-weed, making it impossible to swim in. The restaurants were mediocre at best. Romantico was the best food by far, however they classify themselves as fine dining and fancy with their dress code. They will not, under any circumstance, allow a male to dine in their restaurant with shorts on. My husband and I went to dinner, he was dressed in pressed khaki shorts and a button-down shirt and they would not allow him in the dining room until he put long pants on. This would be fine if this was their rule, however, they classified ripped, baggy jeans as long pants. While they would not let us in, they were allowing guests in baggy, ripped jeans, white tank tops and sneakers to eat in their dining room - fancy restaurant, I think not! One of the better nights we had was spent ordering cheeseburgers from room service to avoid the noisy crowds in the lobby and restaurants. This, too, was short lived, as the cable for the second night in a row was not working. After we complained and suggested they allow us to order a free movie they did, which was the right way to handle the situation. However, we got about half way through the film and that shut off, and was out for the rest of the evening. As I said, the resort itself was beautiful, but they need to improve their hospitality skills. There is no way this resort is a five-star, I would like to meet the person that rated it and find out how stained sheets, mediocre service, dirty pools and mildew stained lounge chairs can ever be classified as five star.", "Date": "July 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cParadisus- Locals only club\u201d", "Author": "jrfalso", "ReviewID": "UR3636592", "Content": "Five star resort, I think they do not know the meaning of 5 star. They need to have management /staff stay at a real 5 star resort such as The Ritz and take notes. Do not go for more than 3 days, you will be bored out of your mind! At first we were nervous because the Paradisus was off a main highway that thankfully led to the ocean. We relieved when we got out of the $60 per person shuttle (TOTAL RIP, $30 more reasonable) and arrived at the lobby. I will make this report short and sweet. I only stay at 4/5 star resorts when we travel. -The hotel ammenities were very nice. Marble floors and nice decor as far as having a drink in the lobby( antique furniture etc). -The rooms were nice, but mine smelled like a public bathroom. There was a stench that was not very pleasant. The maid service was good, no quams. - Could not get reservations at their \"gourmet\" eatery's, they said they were booked! Are you kidding me, I payed this much money for an all inclusive and I cannot eat where I want? Ridiculous, happened on more than one night! - The grounds were nice and well kept. - Good place if you like chaos, tons of kids and locals are welcome to pay a minimal fee to use the pool and resort facilities. Was soo crowded with locals on the weekend. This is suppose to be an exclusive resort, not even close. - There was nothing 5 star about the service! The bar tenders would serve their local buddies before they served customers. It was pathetic, you wait at the bar and they walk past you 4 times without serving you. Seemed like the staff was miserable except for a few nice people. Basically, if you are not from Puerto Rico you will not get any attention from the staff. - The food was ok if you can get a reservation, nothing gourmet as they proclaim. Romantico was actually good, the others were buffet style. Bamboo is a hyped up Benni Hanna, but they call it Asian Fusion ( there is no fusion). Paradisus likes to hype up most of their services, they are trying to hard to be something they are not - 5 star! - Cable was out for two days, not the hotels fault but atleast they can apologize. They did offer us a free movie which cut off half way through playing. - If you want a beach area, this is not the place to go. Big mistake by this resort, they should work on their beach area. It is all Rocks and little sand, could make the hotel alot better. - Pool was nice, except on Saturdays when all of the locals and their kids take over. Ridiculous, if you proclaim to be 5 star then act like it and remain exclusive. I paid alot of money to go there, these locals do not! Bartenders at the pool bar serve their buddies first, then eventually get around to paying customers. They were rude and had no etiquette, they need to get a clue! * All in all, Paradisus has along way to go! There is no way Paradisus is a 5 star resort, more like 3.5. They have to realize that it is not just the grounds that make a 5 star resort, but more importantly the service..which is a far cry from other 5 stars. Beware! I may sound like a pick tourist, but when I pay alot of money I expect good service! I will not go back or would I recommend this place to anyone.

What really needs to be done is break down the categories and rate them. Price - 3 out of 5 stars - We were very satisfied with the cost even after upgrading to the Royal Service - which is a must. Service - 4 out of 5 stars We upgraded to the Royal Service. If you are are not a Royal Service guest, the service will be poor. We were mistaken for non-RS guests and had to wait 45 minutes for someone to come to our room and get our luggage. Most employees were very nice - especially those assigned to RS guests. The resort was fairly empty so we were moved to a ocean front suite immediately. Food - 1 out of 5 stars The website states 5 star cuisine - not even close. You must make reservations to avoid the toscana and carribean grill. Avacado was only open 1 night ( we were there 6 nights) - The Bamboo the japanese fusion (which is really just a hibachi steak house) was open, but the staff never told us there was an appetizer menu with sushi and sashimi on it. Pretty lame not to do that. The Italian buffet style Toscana was horrible and the carribean buffet was only a little better. This place is not kid friendly in terms of food. The outdoor grill and eating area was never open when we were there so it was either eat inside after having to change your wet swimsuit, or eat lunch outside in 90 degree heat/100 percent humidity away from the shore with no breeze. Also there are no kids allowed in Romantico the French restaurant - thus eliminating another choice for our family. So for 5 of 6 nights, there were only 2 restaurants available to us. Beverages were plentiful and readily available - house wines were drinkable. There really was no afternoon snacks - all deep fried food. Beach - NONE no stars A dead reef surrounds the swimming area and although quite beautiful in a natural sort of way...the water is not what you would expect from Puerto Rico. Swimmable and clean, but not pleasant. No snorkeling. Catamaran, kayaking and paddle boats were fun though. Ground and Pool - Pool is great - grounds excellent 4 out of 5 stars Kid friendly - 0 out of 5 stars The Kids club is a small playground. There is no staff to organize any activities - except adult aquarobics - There is a baby sitter available if you need it. Activity packages - 0 out of 5 stars Since Paradisus is 50 minutes - 1 hour from San Juan with no traffic (and not the 35 minutes the website boasts) Most excursions outside the resort cost $60 - $100 per person. We rented a car for $60 and went on our own. Driving is no problem. The only kiosk is an AVIS rental (which is funny - because the resort package we purchased included a large discount for HERTZ - so if you took the resorts shuttle - you couldn't rent-a-hertz! ) Definitely do the rain forest and old san juan. If you rent a car an need to park it over night, you get charged $15 to park your car at the resort you're staying at! That was unbelieveable. The Spa is way over priced - even for a resort Room - 4 out of 5 stars - Room was beautiful with a jacuzzi on the balcony - though there are no doors or any separation between the 2 rooms of the \"suite\". View was lovely from the balcony. Oh by the way, we left an old worthless SLR automatic camera at the restaurant one night...never to be seen again - no one turned it in...good thing I didn't leave our digital camera.", "Date": "June 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cMust visit Paradise, I mean, Paradisus\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3617091", "Content": "My wife and I just came back from 4 nights at Paradisus Puerto Rico and had an amazing time. We have travelled and stayed at luxury resorts in the past, and we had a great experience here. I was certainly concerned before going after reading some of the earlier reviews, but for the most part was pleased. Pros: The resort setting is gorgeous. The grounds were well kept with plants and flowers. It was clean. The main pool was fantastic. Despite many people in the pool, it was large enough were you could find your own quiet corner. Swim up bar and partially submerged lounge chairs were a plus. The covered cabanas were great and provided some needed shade from the HOT SUN. The food was very good. Breakfast and lunches were mostly buffets, but the quality of the food was great. Dinners were very good. Service was a bit weak (see cons below). The beach was actually great. Not the best for actual swimming, but nice to sit out and use the kayaks and paddleboats (included). Royal Service was a must. Nicer rooms. Made a jacuzzi on your balcony for you each night if you wanted. Access to private pool. Cons: A bit of a drive from the airport. The service in the restaurants was still a bit slow and not as responsive as one would expect at such a resort. They didn't fill water glasses promptly. When asked, they would say ok and not come back. You would have to ask several people (often the manager) to fill the glass. When you went up for seconds (or thirds, fourths, fifths) of food, they didn't take away the dirty plates. It became a bit comical after a while. The reservation system for dinners still doesn't quite work. I had heard that they improved it by allowing you to call before you arrive. When I did (the day before arrival) I was told they would hold the time slot and to call when I arrived with my room number. I did, but was told that the reservation time wasn't available and had to chose different times (not the ideal ones, but oh well, we were on vacation). However, when we did arrive for our 8:30 reservation at Bamboo (had called and asked for 7) they told us that it would be at least 30 minutes more. We ended up not staying and just going to one of the restaurants that didn't need reservations. The only other con would be that in the evening there isn't too much to do. They close the pools at 6pm (seemed kinda early) and at 10pm had a typical resort show. The lounges are open but aside from that there was alot of activity. We ended up sitting on our jacuzzi on our balcony, cetainly not a bad thing.... Overall, we had a great time and would certainly recomend Paradisus.

If I were considering paying $700 per night myself to stay there, I would probably look elsewhere. Prior to our stay, I researched the property quite extensively. I learned that the restaurant reservation process was very unorganized. Upon our arrival, we were told that most of the restaurant reservations were already taken. I explained to the hostess that I was aware of the poor reputation of the reservation process. I mentioned the tripadvisor website and suggested that she read some of the reviews. She claimed that she already had! My husband and I just stood in front of her desk while the line behind us became quite long. Within about four minutes, which seemed like an eternity, we had dinner reservations for each night of our stay. The quality of the food was very \"cruise-shippy.\" I wondered if fighting for our reservations had really been worth it. However, after a day in the sun, we were very hungry and we thought the food was quite tasty. Please avoid the lobster bisque . . . it tastes like cold pumpkin soup!!! Our favorite meals, however, were not in the \"nicer\" restaurants. We enjoyed the relaxing lunches at the outside Mirador Grill. We had a great table with a view of the ocean and enjoyed lots of choices at the buffet. We did have to contend with some hungry birds, but we were able to have lunch everyday in our swimwear, without having to go back to the room to change. The Royal Service was really wonderful. We relaxed each morning at the Royal Service pool. Ed, the bartender, had our drinks and our chairs waiting for us each morning. He also learned that I needed an umbrella because of my very fair skin. Ed had it waiting for me everyday! The larger pool was very beautiful and we spent a great deal of time there, too. The staff was very polite and friendly, except for the dinner reservation lady. We found very quick drink service in the bar just off of the casino. It was much less crowded in the evenings than the main lobby bar. My husband's company had rented almost all of the rooms at the resort, so the staff was very eager to please anyone from our group.

Reservations at the restaurants were so easy to make. Please remember this property has only been open for a year, they are still learning and trying very hard to please everyone. They are listening to comments and are trying very hard to improve. You can make advance dinner reservations for all the restaurants upon arrival, we were able to make all of our reservations the first day without any difficultly. We were even able to change them later in the week without any difficultly. We found the service to be very good, your in the Caribbean so mellow out and don't except them to be at your every beck and call. Go with the flow and relax if you have this type of attitude and I'm sure you will enjoy every moment. They had a wide varietly of restaurants, menu options, exquiste presentation, we thought the food was very good. If you really want to be pampered pay the extra for the Royal Service, they go above and beyond to accommodate your request! The concierge pool is quiet and relaxing and has private pre reserved cabanas. We weren't in the Royal Service level, but I found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. The main pool is beautiful and has many private cabanas, , more cabanas than I have seen at other resorts. When the property is full they are somewhat difficult to obtain, early bird gets the worm. The pool activities building has plently to keep you busy if you want to, if you don't like the loud music that some complained about on other messages then you're too old and need to move to the other end of the pool. There were a few times that you would have to wait about 5-10 minutes at the swim up bar or the lobby bar, but again this was at peak time when the property was full. Within a week this happened maybe 3-4 times, big deal we were on vacation and had lots of time and weren't in a hurry to go anywhere. We were at the resort when they were filming the Sports Invitational for Fox TV, there were about 50 celebrities there such as Kevin Costner, Chevy Chase, Kelsey Grammer, Matt Dillion... if it's good enough for them than it should be good enough for you! Beach- ok so you know that the beach isn't white sand, the water isn't a tourquise blue other than this the resort is beautiful. The beach is wide and great for exploring. I have been to many other worldwide resorts that offer better beaches, but I knew about the beach prior to arriving and was perfectly content with the beach. I personally think it is hard to find every single aspect of a resort, property, destination that has 100 % of everything that you might be looking for.

But, this time I was pleasantly surprised! First off, let me echo what countless others have said in their reviews... the grounds are AMAZINGLY beautiful. You really do feel like you're entering a corner of paradise when you see this place. We had an ocean-front, Royal Service room (the ONLY way to go if you stay here). Our favorite part of the room was the sunken jacuzzi tub (for two!) outside ON the balcony. I've never had that experience before... and, drinking a glass of wine overlooking the ocean in a tub of bubbles is the BEST - especially after a day of baking in the sun. (Oh, by the way, they CHANGED ALL THE BEDS in the early Spring, 2005. So, we went expecting HARD mattresses due to other people's comments and instead had a week of TERRIFIC sleep on the new, perfect mattresses!!) Ahhh... baking in the sun. The main pool was glorious. Since we came on a week that wasn't very booked, we felt like the resort was our own private plantation. There were only about 4-6 other people around this HUGE pool at any given time of the day Tuesday - Friday. The built-in \"chairs\" made laying in the sun a dream because you could stay cool, covered by an inch of water from the pool on your legs and feet. It was an amazing, relaxing experience on those days... (I'll save all my negative comments for the end of this review!) Another great part of the resort is the top notch spa and workout area. Although we didn't have any spa treatments on this trip, we did take a complete tour of the spa area and everything was very relaxing and pristine - including the indoor and outdoor massage tables. (You can get a massage in the tropical garden area by the spa pool - or even at the edge of the ocean if you choose!) We did use the exercise equipment on three of our vacation days - and it was great! (Air-conditioned and aromas from the attached spa made it smell fantastic!) THE NEGATIVES: 1- The food was just \"ok\". Typically, we go out to eat quite a bit - to a variety of top restaurants. Going out to eat for me needs to be an experience - not just about the food. (great atmosphere, good wine selection, excellent service!) So, I was really looking forward to both the Japanese steak house on the property as well as the French restaurant that everyone raved about. But, this is where is was disappointed... Our first night at the Japanese steakhouse was pretty good but the second time the food had little flavor. (It all depends on the cook you get that night. The second night our cook was new.) As for the French restaurant (Romantico) - not so romantico... very boring actually. The place was EMPTY!! And, we were seated at a 2-top in the center of the restaurant with no one else really in the room we were in. There was no background noise so we felt like all \"ears\" were on us and we talked very little. As for the food at Romantico - I think they're favorite ingredient is Nutmeg. The Lobster Bisque that came highly recommended from our waiter was really creme de Nutmeg (I think they may have dipped a Lobster claw in the broth at some point but there wasn't really any Lobster to speak of in the soup.) As for the Filet Mignon main course - dry and tasteless. (I'm spoiled with Midwestern Beef.) 2- Be prepared to age 10 years waiting for a drink. Now, I know what you're thinking... \"she's so impatient - she should just get used to the Carribean pace.\" NO WAY. I have been to Sandals in the Bahamas and other resorts in the Carribean several times and I have never experienced bar \"service\" like this. Let me break it down... There are about 4-5 bars around the resort (not including the restaurant bars) and NONE of them stock the same inventory. If you find one that knows how to make a drink you like, the next bar will say they don't carry that liquor. It's crazy! I wanted a Vanilla Stoli and Diet Coke and the waiter from Romantico had to walk out to the main lobby bar to borrow their stash of Vanilla Stoli. But, MORE importantly, the service itself is very bad at the bars. There were two guys at the main lobby bar that had drinks in front of them and were deep in conversation with the bartender when we showed up. (Other than those two guys we were the only ones there.) We sat patiently for at least 5 mins - ignored completely. Finally, I got up and walked around the bar right in front of the bartender and asked him, \"Is this bar open?\" \"Oh yes, miss...\" and then he took our order. The pool bar is another story... none of the bartenders had any drink suggestions whatsoever. So, if you didn't already know the tropical concoction you wanted top of mind - you were out of luck. And, not surprising, they were just as slow and unattentive as the main lobby bartenders. (To contrast, the bartenders at Sandals were FANTASTIC! Not only was there a HUGE menu hanging around every bar with 10-20 different drink suggestions, but the bartenders had their own specialties that they would reveal to swim-up bar regulars.) Personality is KEY to staffing great bartenders... and, they still have a ways to go there. 3- The beach is filled with broken shells and sharp stones. So what? It didn't really matter that much to me, since I'm a pool person anyway. It was still beautiful to look at out of our balcony every morning and every night from our JACUZZI!! But, if you are a beach person this would probably be a drawback for you. 4- ... and, then there was SATURDAY. Remember how I wrote that Tuesday through Friday at the main pool were fantastic?? Well, on Saturdays, they open up the resort to locals. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!! Saturday was a nightmare at the main pool - total chaos. Seemingly thousands of screaming, running children and salsa music so loud it only inspired the kids to scream louder. After 15 mins at the main pool on Saturday, we retreated to the Royal Services pool area for some quiet cocktails and romantic pooltime. That is one of the reasons you should DEFINITELY choose Royal Service if you go to Paradisus.... the option to use that private pool area as well as other niceties.

We came as part of a group from my husband's company so it didn't cost us anything. But after reading some of the reviews, I was a little concerned anyway. We stayed at an all-inclusive before which was beautiful but had no beach at all and the food was mediocre, at best. This trip was free but, being a huge beach lover, I wasn't thrilled about the prospect of coming all that way and not being able to walk on the beach. We ended up coming a little early and staying in San Juan at the Intercontinental for several days just in case. (See separate review). My fears were unjustified. The Paradisus was wonderful! The food was great! I wasn't expecting that and gained a pound or two! The pool was beautiful. There are small, roofed cabanas set all around the property with big mattresses and pillows on them. When we got tired, we just took naps on one of those. It was incredible. The staff were VERY friendly and helpful. My husband forgot his key card one afternoon and he said security was there in a matter of minutes to let him in. It rained off and on the whole time we were there and we were surprised to find an umbrella stored in our closet. It came in very handy. The rooms can be a bit of a walk from the pool and restaurants. But they are very private and they have a tram that drives around offering rides. Our building was one of the farthest away but we never felt the need to catch a ride, even when it rained. And the grounds around the rooms are incredible. The pool staff offered activities throughout the afternoon but they kept it towards one end and we didn't find it bothersome or overdone at all. We didn't have our 5 kids with us (thank goodness!) but, if we had, they would have enjoyed it. They had a Kids Club next to the pool with a swingset and activities. I walked by several times and the staff seemed to be genuinely enthusiastic about what they were doing. And, more importantly, the kids were enjoying it. There were plenty of chairs at the pool and the pool itself has tile lounges built into it so you can tan while sitting in the water. Very nice. The staff was very friendly but we ended up going to the bar for our drinks ourselves, most of the time. We were only asked a time or two if we would like anything brought to us. Now the beach...I was grateful for the warnings about it. I love a big, wide sand beach with waves that you can walk on for hours. And I am glad that we came early to San Juan so that we could experience that. But, this beach was beautiful. I took my chair down there and laid in the water every day. It is very pebbly and I did not bring water shoes. I wish I had because you can walk the beach. It curves around the resort. We could have walked from our room to the pool on the beach. But it's not so great barefoot. I still did it. It's in a natural state and it is very pretty. The water was very blue. It's like a lagoon because a reef breaks up the waves. Almost nobody was down there. I loved it. It was very quiet and secluded and very picturesque. It was different, but not disappointing. But if you want the big sweeping sand beach with waves, you might want to stay somewhere else. Our room was very large and very comfortable. We could see through the trees to the water from our balcony and also had a good view of the mountains. And it wasn't a royal service room or anything like that. And our bed was awesome. The lobby and restaurants were gorgeous. The resort seemed intimate to me. There are a number of rooms but it didn't seem huge. My husband and I wouldn't necessarily pay to stay at an all-inclusive. We loved not having to worry about paying for something every time we turned around. But we don't drink alcohol or eat three and four meals a day so I think we might end up losing money there! And Paradisus was asking $500 for an extra night. But if you're not as cheap as us and would make more use of those things, go for it! This is the place!

I considered changing my plans to the Ritz Carlton if the reviews were correct and indeed had booked the Ritz tentatively if I decided to leave the Paradisus. Much to my surprise, the resort was extremely pleasurable. Specifically: 1. The hotel's appearance and cleanliness were terrific. 2. The staff was extremely attentive and polite. 3. The food was quite good. I never experienced any \"long lines\". (even though the resort was full) Especially notable were the restaurants Romantico and Bamboo. If you are flexible about your dinner times it is quite easy to obtain entrance into them. The Avocado was excellent for my perpetual diet. Indeed, there is an abundance of great fruit which allowed me to only gain one pound during the week. 4. The gym was sufficient and clean. 5. Spa was excellent. 6. Pools were great. Indeed at times I did have concern about the level of music but this was rectified simply by asking the attendant to turn down the volume. 7. THE BEACH Directly in front of the main pool it is certainly almost non existant. If you decide to walk approximately 200 feet to the right there is sufficient beach with an abundance of lounges. 8. The beds. They have all been replaced with very comfortable soft mattresses. 9. The lounge chair problem has been resolved with the purchase of many more. 10. SUMMARY Overall, it appears that many of the problems noted on this board has been addressed by management. Indeed, I did speak to management and they do review these boards in order to improve their facility. It is still a fairly new resort and certain problems will always occur as with any resort. Not every employee responds as desired and unfortunately can cause a problem. I did have to call room service twice on one occasion but management was very attentive to my complaint. That is basically what we all want---somebody who will listen and resolve the issue-- the resort does this. The resort is particularly excellent for family groups, small conventions or small groups who need to spend time together without wondering where they will eat or meet at nite. It keeps people together. It is certainly infinitely better than any other place in Puerto Rico! I do have one compaint though, and that was with the price of a round of golf which I thought was excessive. I did price other courses in the area and they were all about the same. Maybe the resort can have a \"golf package\" price.

We just returned from a long weekend and found much of what has been said (both good and bad) to be true. We had several choices of hotels in San Juan and decided to try the Paradisus on the strength of its reviews. Based on the suggestions of others who found it difficult to get into certain restaurants, I decided to call the day before to try to make arrangements prior to our arrival. I was told that reservations can only be made if you know your room number, which unfortunately is not revealled until you check in. I also asked for driving directions from the airport and was emailed them promptly. The property, while it may be only 20 miles away from the airport, took about an hour to drive to in bumper to bumper traffic. We decided to rent a car based on the fact that the hotel shuttle charged $30/per person one way, so for the two of us it would have been $120 round trip. The driving directions are somewhat confusing, and we had a few wrong turns that only delayed our arrival. We also found out that they charge guests $10/day to park (not mentioned anywhere), which is crazy since the lot is huge and very underutilized. Since we were there for 3 days, the $30 added onto the cost of the rental car came out a little over $120--no wonder the hotel priced it's shuttle that way! Upon arrival, there were a lot of bellmen, none of which offered us any assistance with our bags. Check if was very efficient, but as was noted by other, we were left on our own to find our room. When we went back to the bellhops to ask about transport to our room, they said that no one was available to bring our bags, so we should take the trolley since the room was \"very far away.\" We went back to the front desk to inquire about closer rooms and the woman at the front desk was very apologetic and reassured us the room was not that far away and even walked us to the trolley (which is located at the back end of the lobby), and we rode to our room from there. I must say that the property is spectacular and well kept. The employees are polite, but do not go out of their way to be helpful. Rather than ask the concierge to make dinner arrangements for us (since there was only one concierge and a line of about 10 people needing assistance), we walked directly to the restaurant and asked about tables. We found Bamboo to be difficult to get into and the surly hostess did not make things easy. The host at Romantico was much more accomodating. Bamboo is a down market version of Benihana, but entertaining and they offer you a lot of food. The atmosphere at Romantico is very nice and the service good. They also offer a surcharge wine list, which has very good wines at New York restaurant prices (about twice retail) -- but it beats what they pour for free. We went to the gym daily, which is virtually always empty, and very clean. The attendant was friendly, and it turns out that he will teach aerobics, but only if enough people show up. He also told us that there were pilates classes at the Activities Center that did not exist. The Activities Center is poolside and there is a list of daily activities posted. Unfortunately, no one seemed to know what activities would occur the next day, so it was difficult to plan things. The pool is great. There are a lot of areas to sit around and plenty of chaise chairs and cabanas on a first come first serve basis. The cabanas are definitely the way to go as the sun can be fierce. Poolside salsa lessons in the afternoon were a lot of fun! Beware that the drinks at the poolside bar are very weak, and one should always ask for an extra shot! The rooms are very spacious and the oceanview rooms offer a wonderful, romantic setting to watch the sunset off your balcony. One thing we found lacking in the amenities were hair conditioner and a sewing kit (you only figure out what you forgot to bring when you need it most!). It turns out that there is something called Royal Service which functions like a Club Level Room in other hotels. They have personal butlers and a private pool and check in service. It is significantly more expensive than the already pricey rooms, and I'm not sure it is worth it. All in all, the place is beautiful. The food was good for an all inclusive, but not great. My overall impression is that this five star hotel would match up with a middling three star place in Asia or Europe and a four star hotel in the US. They really need to improve their service, especially since it isn't cheap. I think that there are numerous other options to consider when choosing a San Juan hotel that (technically) isn't in San Juan.", "Date": "April 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cStay Away - no beach, no service, not much at all\u201d", "Author": "gsmarko", "ReviewID": "UR3311793", "Content": "The Positives 1. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance and the grounds are absolutely beautiful. 2. The beachfront dining at Mirador provided spectacular views of the ocean. A wonderful, tranquil dining experience. 3. The tennis pro was excellent. 4. The spa, though small, was very pleasant. My wife loved it. 5. Dinner at Bamboo was very enjoyable. That said, this restaurant should not be described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Asian fusion with Thai influence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is, quite simply, a Japanese Hibachi style restaurant with a very limited menu of sushi. 6. The swim-up bar in the pool was great. It was one of the few areas in the resort which was properly staffed. The Negatives 1. ABSOLUTELY ZERO BEACH. The beach is about 12 feet wide from the grass to the water. The limited space is filled with rocks and broken shells. There is no sand to sit on and no place for children to play. The resort was full when we were there but no one at all was on the beach. Also, the water sports are extremely limited. 2. The pool is large and nice, but could be cleaner. Since there is no real beach and little available activities, I would think the resort would put more effort into keeping the pool clean and in tip-top shape. The water at times was cloudy and often contained drinking cups and debris. Furthermore, for our entire stay, the hotel was full but there was never more than 1 lifeguard on duty covering a massive pool that often contained > 150 people. I was astonished. 3. Seating by the pool was inadequate. At one point, this lead to a shouting match between guests over seating space. If the pool is the main attraction of the resort, should seating be inadequate? 4. The restaurants were booked from the time of check-in and many guests could only get into the buffet restaurants. This was ridiculous since the restaurants were only about 60% occupied when you went inside. The only explanation I can think of is that the resort was inadequately staffed. This is shameful considering the expensive price of the resort and the large # of guests. If you can not get into 1 of the 3 non-buffet restaurants for dinner, you are stuck at one of the 3 buffets. The quality of food at the buffet restaurants was sub-par. My dinner at Toscano is best described as a bad night at Macaroni Grill (not even a good night at Macaroni Grill). Not a great deal for $750/night. 5. Even at the buffet restaurants there was a long wait to be seated. We waited 30 minutes to be seated at Toscano. Once seated, we found that 60% of the tables were empty. When we asked why we waited 30 minutes to get into a largely vacant restaurant, we were told that they did not haven enough staff to clear the tables. This is shameful. 6. The concierge desk is woefully inadequate. There was never more than 1 person working. You often had to wait 20 minutes to speak to someone. You could not call the concierge desk since they were too busy to answer the phone. 7. Service is extremely slow throughout the resort. Room service is particularly bad, often taking > 1 hour. 8. The beds are as hard as a rock. This is a frequent complaint among customers. It appears that the resort is trying to purchase new mattresses to address this problem. Negatives that really messed up our trip 1. We arrived late at night with a 3 year old. We needed bedding for the couch. We had to call housekeeping 5 times. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes to get a blanket. The good news was that hotel manager wanted to appease us afterwards and suddenly the restaurants with no available dinner reservations had a spot for our family. 2. Room service consistently took too long and brought not only cold food but the wrong food. 3. The porters were not careful with our luggage. They arrived late to pick up our luggage, drove their little truck recklessly, and our luggage went flying out of the truck onto the road. 4. MOST IMPORTANTLY, our son got sick and required a doctor. The concierge desk, which was probably the single worst aspect of the resort, took 4 hours to pick up the medicine from the local pharmacy. This was clearly due to the fact that they were understaffed and they were prioritizing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over a sick, young child. This was disgraceful. Overall, I would strongly discourage anyone from staying at Paradisus Puerto Rico. The resort may look beautiful, but the terrible service, understaffing, and lack of a beach front are significant problems. This is not a 5 star resort, not a 4 star resort, and maybe not even a 3 star resort. Of note, many people we met on the island (away from the resort) were well aware of the many problems at the resort. This undoubtedly explains why the occupancy has been low and the cost of staying at the resort has dropped precipitously over the past year.", "Date": "March 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cI would return...\u201d", "Author": "Ski-Again", "ReviewID": "UR3307383", "Content": "Yikes, I don't agree with the last two horrible reviews there are some drawbacks, but there are many good things to report as well.

In Puerto Rico I have stayed at the El San Juan, the Hyatt Cerromar and Palmas Del Mar. As my title says I would go back, for a family vacation, as the Pros outweigh the cons and every hotel has drawbacks. As all inclusives go, this is a \"nice\" one. Pros- the setting is beautiful, the rooms are spacious (I liked the bed and did not find it too hard), the food was excellent, really too good so that you have to be worried about gaining weight!, the selection was great, the staff was VERY helpful with generally GREAT attitudes, the spa was small but lovely, the beach is full of pebbles which is lousy, but it is very long and wide and pretty and nice for running/walking - with sneaks or flip-flops - I have been to many places with short narrow beaches and this is not the case here, the boat rides, esp. sailing on a catamaran (they send you with a \"captain\" which was great) - but you have to get there before 10am to make a reservation and they go quickly, the pool is very very nice, the shows were good, though a bit late beginning after 10pm, the drinks were good - try the local lite beer with lime!, child care was OK, more on that below, the gym is small but nice and there is a trainer there all day who is very helpful. They had evening child care (5 and up only) from 8 to midnight and this was pretty good with moon bounces, movies and games - the kids enjoyed this more than the day time program. Cons - they are still new and not great with crowds, there were no chairs at the pool Easter weekend, the staff was weary and overworked, the hotel just seemed stressed out!, The kids camp is lacking - NOTE it is only 10:30am-noon and 2:30pm to 5pm NOT ALL DAY, NOT FOR LUNCH, no early morning care if you want to do sports before it gets hot, forget it. Kids camps at other resorts are much better, Hyatt, Ritz and other all inclusives. They play loud, loud music and make announcements at the pool all day, if you want peace you have to go to the pebbly beach, which is ok too, but it could be better. The rooms are far from the main facilities, ours did smell a bit musty and there are very few ocean view rooms, if you are not guaranteed, you won't get one. The restaurants requiring reservations were all \"full\", we wondered whether it was a scam to have them, but not let anyone in, they didn't seem crowded at all. If you complain loudly they may help you get in at a time they select. This is ridiculous. The hotel is 1 hour from the airport NOT 35 mins, except by helicopter. HINT - The Royal Service is very, very nice (we didn't get it, but wish we did) there is a beautiful adult pool, preference at restaurants, ocean view, special services, if your kids are over 5 or you are just adults visiting, this would be key to a relaxing, pampered vacation. I would not go back with my husband alone unless we had \"Royal Service\" accomodations. If you go ENJOY - don't be nervous this is a nice place, they care about their guests and you will have a good time! I was reluctant because of some of the bashing I saw here, which is exaggerated.

My husband and I expected to be there until two or three. But, to our surprise security was there in about 7 minutes. A word of advice. Do not put your key in the same pocket as your MAGNETIC name badge. Later found out about 5 or so couples had the same problem. We did have some issues: sand on the floor of our room the day we arrived. They lost the lugage of one couple. Located it an hour or so before our group dinner( inverted numbers on tag.) Handle fell into the tub while showering. We left it in plain view and it was fixed when we returned. (several hours later) We found out quickly why the Mirador was alway empty. It is the restuarant of the Birds. They could remedy this I was told by installing fishing line so the view was not obstructed and would keep the birds out. As I walked away from the salad bar a bird helped himself to the cheese I had just used. Our bed was turned down every night. Our last night there was no different except at 1:30 when we returned we had one wash cloth and not one towel. Called the operator and within 15 minitues we had our towels.

My daughter woke up this morning and wanted to go back! We found this hotel purely by coincidence, we were originally scheduled to vaction in the Bahamas on a remote island, but Bahamas Air cancelled our connecting flight a week before we were to leave. My wife and I scrambled to find another destination and found the Paradisus. They had availability for the exact dates and we booked it. We lucked out and loved our trip. Everyone who worked there, and I mean everyone, was extremely helpful and went out of there way to make sure everything was taken care of. As an example, I forgot my cell phone charger and asked the front desk clerk were the nearest Verizon store was and the front desk manager over heard this and offered up his Verizon charger. I borrowed it a few times and he always said no problem. This is just one example and I won't bore you with others, but everyone went out of there way. The food was very good for an all inclusive, but not like in a small gourmte restaurant. We were not expecting 5 star restaurants so we were very pleased, if you are expecting a 5 star restaurant go to one don't go to an all inclusive resort. The pool, grounds, rooms and everthing else is very very nice. The only negative is the beach. It is small and the water is not so great, but pretty to look out to. My wife and I take a vacation every year to the carribean and have been to many great beaches and new this was not going to be a great beach based on the reviews here and thus were not disappointed. We have small children who love the pools so that is where we were going to be anyway. All I can say is if you are a beach person you might want to try another hotel. Also, we noticed that the hotel never seems crowded even though they were at capacity. Price- My wife and I thought this hotel is an absolute steal for what you get!! We were actually wondering how they can employ so many people (always somone around to take care of every need) and deliver such great service for such a low price. One last note, we agree with other reviews about tipping. We tipped a great waiter we had for dinner many nights and our service was second to none. We did not ask what he made, but for a couple of $20s he went way out of his way and we had better service than in many upscale restaurants here in Chicago. We also tipped the bartenders by the pool and never had to wait for a drink.

Frankly I am not a fan of loud music and it was hard to escape the noise coming from the pool area..it made me nuts. The shows they had were first class from stage presentations to belly dancing. The food is excellent but their system of reservations for the restaurants is completely out of whack. They would say they had no room when they were half empty and people were rightly miffed at the way they handled it. They should have no reservations at all and it would work a lot better. There is a Mexican style restaurant there...skip it..not worth it. The public space, bars etc. is very classy with marble floors, fountains and comfortable and spacious. It is not a barefoot and torn jeans or wet bathingsuit type of atmosphere at all...more like a swank hotel. The aesthetics of the whole place are excellent and the people very nice and that is why I am giving it a four star.

I preface this posting by saying that my wife and I both work in the hotel/ hospitality industry for large hotel companies, and i must say that the Paradisus passes the test. The positives severly outweigh the negatives, and by reading many of these December postings, I have to believe that the Paradisus took the criticism to heart and \"fixed\" most of these bugs. This is an all-inclusive resort where tips/ charges are taken care of by your daily rate. But I must say, the staff treated us like royalty from the moment we stepped out of our taxi. The door/bell staff are very cheerful and make an effort to please. They socialize with you and offer assistance before you even have to ask. In the hospiatlity industry, we are expected to anticipate our guest's needs, and at the Paradisus, they do that. From the bellmen down to the maids, they make a sincere effort to make you happy. I happen to believe that, despite it being all-inclusive, it's Ok to tip a couple of bucks. There were times I didn't have change and did not leave a tip, and it was fine with their staff. They didn't seeme bothered or slowed their service because of this. Believe me, this happens at many resorts (Cancun and Domomican rep. come to mind). I received terrific service on my first day through to the fifth day. My wife was there for a conference and I just tagged along and had fun. The lobby bars are very good. You get top of the line liquor and you get your drink refreshed before you're even finished with the one y0ou have in your hand. There was a waiter, which I cannot remember his name, who must have swerved around 50 people in this one area. He was efficient and very friendly. I watched as he filled everyone's order (correctly) and quickly. No one tipped him. Not one. But he came back and gave the 100% service time and time again. I live in Chicago and let me tell you, I can go 15 minutes without having my drink refreshed or even have trouble getting the waiters attention. But at Paradisus, you almost never have to wave a waiter/ waitress over to you because they're already there. I disagree with the assertion that the pool bar/ waitresses sucked. The days varied as far as occupancy ( ranged from 40-75%), but I received great service in the pool. I had a waitress ask me at least every 15-20 minutes if i wanted something. Yes, she did her rounds. Best of all, when i was just snoozing, she didn't bother me like some resorts do. Enough has been said about the restaurants. They're all good, even the buffet ones. Romantico, Bamboo and Avaocado were very good to good. You got to make reservations for them. Do so at concierge as soon as you get there. The Carribeno, Toscano and Madoro Grill were good. What can you say about buffet-style joints? The'ye are not going to be first-class al lof the time. If anyone can tell me a 5-star buffet exists, please tell me. All of the outlets had freindly hostesses and waitstaff. Again, we never had to wait for drinks or requests. Food was hot and fresh. The desserts were good as well. Yes, the beach is not much to look at. I love poweder-sugared beaches like everyone else, but it's relaxing. The sea is dark because it's winter time, so that's not the resort's fault. Also, the sea is cold. It's January for Gods sake. That's how it is. You can Kayak, windsail, paddleboat, etc. It's all included and the staff was very cool. The beach is empty--no other guests around. The entertainment was a bit corny but what do you expect, Vegas? The music was loud but not overwhelming, but I guess that'll be up to you to decide. They have nightly shows that are of decent quality and they have the casino, which i believe is adequately proportiioned for the resort. I won some cash, so maybe that's why I liked it. There are at least 50 slots, a roulette table, 4 Black Jack tables, Carribean Stud, 3-card Poker, Keno and Limit Texas Hold'Em. Again, if you're expecting Vegas, then you'll be disappointed. but the casino is big enough and is never crowded or packed. The dealers are very friendly and love to converse -- unlike many casinos where the dealers are robotic and not very personable. The spa and gym are OK. They could be better for a facility this large. I did not try the spa, but I hear it's expensive, but again...what do you expect? The gym has free weights, treadmills, etc. All the things you need to work out. Fresh fruit, water and towels are provided. There is also a spa private pool for use if you wish. They have two business centers on the property. One is for all guests to use while the other is a VIP/ Premeir Member class facility that has all of you bc needs plus comforts such as leather sofas, wide screen TV and a waitress to offer you cigars and drinks while you check your e-mail. nice touch. I have two small children but I did not bring them on this trip. They are 4 and 2 years old and I believe they would have had fun. They have a large kiddie pool and play area, and there were kid activites throughout the day. I guess it depends on whether there are lots of kids around the pool area for the activities to occur. There were board games available to use for the kids, pool toys, all sorts of balls to play with. Ping Pong and Billiards, Chess also available by the pool. And best of all, if you're hanging out by yourself like I was while the wife was attending her conference, the entertainment staff would play with you. Gift shop was adequate -- had everything you needed. You get fresh fruit/ wine in your room on a daily basis. Newspaper to your door. Shuttle guy driving around asking if you want a lift. I had a room close to the facilites so I didn't utilize him. He always offered and was courteous. Rent a car if you can. Taxis are outrageously priced. Aiport shuttle is expensive as well. One way cab is $66-75 and shuttles run $30 one-way. Rip off. All in all, this property should get better with time. I paid a group rate so, for me, it was definitely worth it. I easily consumed $200 worth of food and drink per day. But for $469 a night...I don't know about that.

During our stay the hotel was at a 37% capacity which was great. No problems getting chairs at the pool, service at dinner, etc. Although we had a lovely time we would be afraid to go back. Apparently (from talking to other guests and employees) the hotel was not even booked to capacity the week before we arrived and people were fighting for pool chairs and towels. We were told that there were lines at the buffets and it was hard to even get a reservation at a nicer restaurant. One of the problems is that the beach is awful. Although there are a lot of chairs to lay in, you can't even walk on there are so many bolders, broken shells and small rocks. The beach is protected by the government so they can not make it any better. No one, no one was on the beach at all; everyone was at the pool. The water is not pretty, it was mostly brown while we were there. If you are looking for a kids club, forget it. They say they have one but it is very disorganized (some days they have it, some they don't) no sign in for the kids - 5 year olds can just come and go. One of the attendents \"buried\" my 6 year old in a bin of old towels. He thought it was funny, my son cried. Not a comfortable place to leave your child. So ... if you don't bring kids, only like the pool and pay to stay in a villa or royal service room, go when it is not near capacity, it is a great vacation. Otherwise, it is not worth the high price. Also, we were told that they are building 300 condos to rent out and they, too will use the pool and dining facilities. That will be way too crowded.

So those restaurants really aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available to you during busy seasons. Also the reservation system is horrible with many reservations being lost. Even when the restaurants are booked, there are many empty tables. I suspect the capacity is linked to lack of cooking staff. Also, while there are plenty of choices in the buffet, the food is NOT 5 star.We were served our bread without butter at Romantico. It took a half hour and 5 requests to finally get it. 2) The music around the pool and expansive lobby area is way, way, way to loud. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think and the music is often annoying. I love loud music and concerts, but a pool side and lobby is for relaxed talking. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply a matter of turning the volume down. 3) The towel situation around the pool is out of control. People get up at 6am to reserve chairs and by 8am they are all taken. Granted we were there the week after Christmas but there has got to be a better way to manage the chairs and towels. 4) Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a beach, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one. The ocean frontage is on a lagoon though, so the free sail boats, pedal boats and kayaks are a wonderful option here not possible on a regular beach. 5) The employees are very friendly but ill informed about everything. Many do not speak English. 6) Take a cab to and from the airport. The cab fair is about $57 for four people. The hotel shuttle charges $120 each way and makes you wait \u00c2\u00bd an hour at the airport. All in all the problem is lack of training of the employees, lack of good cooks, and lack of quality employees. The computerized reservation system also needs replacing to end all the lost reservations. It's a shame to see such a wonderful facility end up so screwed up from lack of better management.

It's a new faciltiy with lot's of employees that needed to be hired and it's just going to take time to get it all organized. But better management could get it organized much faster then they have.

Tacky. -1 star rating. Although, there is another pool, catered to the Royal Service guests, which in my opinion that's how a 5-star resort ought to be, with well kept grounds, no loud and booming background music, towels waiting for you at your lounge chairs. I also found out later, that RS guests can have unlimited use of internet, newspaper and movie channels, whereas the non-RS guests get none of those, internet is $.40 per minute, no newspaper or newsfaxes, no single movie channel ($9.95 if you want to rent). Tacky. -2 star rating. The resort has no beach whatsoever, even though it is heavily advertised for its \"beautiful beaches.\" Misleading. -2 star rating. It does have beautiful grounds, which in my opinion was not so well kept with few places/areas where you'll see littering, with unattended leftover cups/drinks, plates, utensils, etc, causing all kinds of unwanted bugs and birds. Disgusting. -1 star rating. The staff was friendly (way too friendly, sometimes that is a sign of trying too hard to please). +1 star rating (not possible). There are six restaurants, and two of them are their claim-to-fame restaurants, Bamboo and Romantico (which I don't understand the fuss over them on getting reservations) are basically a la carte (Bamboo is like Benihara and Romantico is \"so-called\" French and the rest (besides La Mirador, which is also a la carte, Mexican) are buffet style and not so great. I think Las Vegas has a better buffet spread. Nasty. -1 star rating. The bed, well, way too hard (I think the floor was softer than the mattress), and beware of the bed bugs (and not Paradise), aka, fleas. Also, beware of the \"marble\" floors, they are \"SLIPPERY WHEN WET\"!!! The rooms are cleaned, superficially, they are not swept or vaccumed, and the terraces are left with cigarette butts from other guests.

I don't believe the resort deserves the status of the LHW, even though it is a bought membership, or a 5-star resort (if my math is right, this resort should be rated as -8 star).

Beautiful grounds, lobby and room 2. Bamboo and Romantico restaurants (two that need reservations) extremely nice 3. With some exceptions, buffet restaurants very good 4. Most of staff was very pleasant. A few (Lashaun -lobby bar waiter; Richard - lobby bar waiter; and Julio - shuttle driver) were outstanding b/c they were so responsive and friendly, and seemed to genuinely care. 5. Beds were great, but we like firm mattresses. 6. Showers in rooms had great water pressure. 7. Drinks were great. You don't get beer on tap in plastic cups everywhere. Medalla (local beer) is great. Also have Corona and Coors Light. Booze isn't well quality (i.e., they had Absolute vodka, Dewers scotch, etc.) 8. The built-in lounge chairs around the edge of the pool in a couple of spots are great. They're hard b/c they're concrete, but they keep you cool because they're a couple of inches beneath the water level. 9. We were with a corporate group, and alll of the activities and services associated with our seminars were great. NEGATIVES: 1. This is our biggest complaint. The open-air lobby is beautiful, with seating areas all over. The problem comes in with volume of the music and the activities. (My husband is 39 and I am 44, so we're not \"crabby old people.\") A lobby should have background music, not loud speakers that make it impossible to talk. In the evening, a female singer and a piano player perform right next to the lobby bar, and the decibel level is deafening because of the amplification system. Even if you go to the farthest seating area in the lobby, you still have to scream to be heard by the person sitting in the chair next to yours. They say that part of the problem is that the hotel is struggling (40+% occupancy when we were there the first week of December, which is the high season). As a result, they supposedly allow locals to use the hotel facilities. I'm assuming that it was local people who were dancing in the aisles of the lobby to the singer's music, encouraging her. There is another bar next to the casino, 50 steps from the lobby, called the \"Fun Bar.\" It has a stage, couches, disco lights, etc. We think this is where the live entertainment should occur. During one rainy day, a game of bingo was conducted in the lobby. Again, even though the players were all seated within 20 feet of the caller, she used the amplification equipment, so anyone else trying to enjoy the lobby in peace was subjected to her obnoxious screaming. Even going to the farthest point in the lobby didn't help that day. We left. At the pool, there are two stereo systems, one near the bar and one near the activities hut where you pick up towels, etc. They play different music, but you can hear both from almost all parts of the pool area. The girls in the activities hut constantly change the volume, stop and restart songs, etc. It's just obnoxious. 2. After the fact, we learned that each room is supposed to come equipped with two umbrellas. Ours had none. On the morning it rained, we sprinted to the \"shuttle stop hut,\" and waited over 1/2 hour for the shuttle to come. It never did. (It's supposed to make the rounds every 5 minutes.) When the rain subsided a bit, we ran to the lobby. When we told the porter that the shuttle hadn't come, he said he hadn't seen it in over an hour. He told us to complain at the front desk, which we did. 3. Staff at pool bar were lazy. Not very attentive to female patrons, if unescorted. Waitress one day sat on stool at bar, talking to bartenders and lifeguard and didn't even make rounds of pool area to take drink orders. 4. Much of staff seem young and immature. They play around with each other a lot, instead of tending to the guests. Probably has a lot to do with negatives 1. and 3. above. 5. There really is no beach. I thought it would be small, but people weren't even venturing into it. The sand is riddled with large rocks and broken shells. 6. This is slightly minor, but the stools in the swim up bar are too high. 7. There were mites running around the ice cream container in the Avacado restaurant one afternoon at lunch. CONCLUSION: While it was a very nice hotel, I wouldn't rate it a 5-star or give it membership in the Leading Hotels because it's just not elegant enough for the price ($600 per night). It's ambience is slightly forced and amateurish. At $300 a night, I'd stay there again, but, without that reduction, we'd try the El Conquistador next time.", "Date": "December 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201ca winner\u201d", "Author": "ohiocoalminer", "ReviewID": "UR2870102", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from 4 nights at Paradisus.

But they also weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shy about accepting tips (we limited tipping and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cheap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tip). We liked putting our lounge chairs in the grass between the pool and the beach under either the palm trees and/or umbrellas\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe then had the best of both worlds. It seemed extremely slow (customer-wise) which made it nice but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bet when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s busy slower service could really be a problem. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go back but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably go this time of year again (early Dec) when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not real crowded (and a little cheaper).

We were a little worried after some of the reviews, but decided to act on some previous tips left on this board and in some ways, altered our expectations. The property itself is beautiful. The lobby and common areas, restaurants and rooms were very nice. The beds, however, are rock hard. If you have trouble sleeping on a hard bed, don't stay here. The property is also very large, thus, request in advance a bungalow nearer the service areas if you don't want to have long walks to the restaurants and pools. The resort shuttles run regularly, but are not always there when you're ready. The restaurants were good. Before you arrive (5-7 days), call and speak with the concierge and insist on making reservations at the \"reservation only\" restaurants prior to arrival, otherwise, you will be eating at the buffet restaurants. Breakfast and lunch are buffets, food is okay, but not great. The reservation restaurants were really good. Drinks were non-stop at a variety of bars, but a little slow when seated at a table. At dinner, a variety of wine options were offered and all sampled were good. The pool area is great, very expansive. If you want to avoid music, the activities crowd and kids, you will want to reserve your room with Service Royale, which has a private pool and bar w/ no kids. The beach has water sports (kayaks, sail boats) for use, but it's not a swim/snorkel beach. The resort has a \"one towel per person\" rule as well that works through a card trade-in system, which for a high-end resort was a little disappointing. Nightime activity is a little slow. A \"cruise style\" entertainment show is offered each night around 10. There is a small casino. The lobby bar area has live music nightly and many guests mingle in this area. We rented a car since it was the same cost as the shuttle provided by the resort ($60 per person round trip). It's about a 30 minute drive from the airport. Rule of the road in PR seems to be that traffic lanes and lights are merely suggestions...drive carefully. The car was nice as the resort is about a 10 minute drive to the El Yunque rainforest, which makes for a nice day trip and we didn't have to book a package through the resort. The resort charges $10 a day for parking, which I thought was a little odd given there was ample parking available throughout the resort. I think locals use the casino and also the convention meeting area for private events, thus the charge. The spa onsite is very well equipped, but also very expensive. Take what you expect to pay at a normal resort spa and add about 50%. We enjoyed our weekend for what it was...a quick getaway. The staff is friendly, but not always attentive...they definetly run on island time. I did find that a well placed $5 tip at the bar or to a cocktail waiter would keep you in good drink more quickly...otherwise, all gratuities are included. For me, the food variety was wearing thin by night 3, so I could not imagine a week-long stay. For the price we paid ($435 room rate secured through lhw website) we felt it was an excellent value for comparable services and what would have been spent had the resort not been all-inclusive. If you do go, a few tips: - Make Restaurant Reservations for Romantico and Bamboo before you go. Politely insist via phone call to concierge. - If you want to avoid children and noise, book w/ Service Royale. - If you are wanting to enjoy the pool bar portion of the all-inclusive, seek lounge chairs near the bar. You're going to be walking to the bar quite often...the pool bar cocktail waitress is non-existent. - Footwear is a good idea for walking on the beach. The area is ideal for watersports, but not for swimming or snorkeling. If you're looking for those activities, this resort is not for you. - Don't expect Ritz or Four Season service, do expect courteous employees and a very scenic property", "Date": "December 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cpretty place, horrible food, bad service and has nothing to do at night for kids\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2854309", "Content": "this place looked nice and had a nice pool area, but it had a bad beach that was almost un-swimmable, the food was bad, all of the food was abnormally salty.

We found the location, atmosphere, amenities and accommodations completely to our satisfaction for a quick getaway in the carribean. The resort is very attractive with beautiful decorative pools, parrots and lovely open air sitting areas in the main building with comfortable, well appointed and modern sitting areas and decor. THe bathrooms are immaculate and quite impressive looking. The staff for the most part was extremely friendly and provided good service. We did the Royal Service level which from what I could tell allowed us to check in within a separate area furnished comfortably, an offer of a fresh towel, television and refreshments. Also our room faced the ocean and included a tub with jets (jacuzzi like) on the open patio which the kids loved after being at the pool all day. The turndown service and chocolates on the pillows were a nice treat. (one minor complaint - when I asked the \"butler\" about the gratuity situation he responded that it was included but we were welcome to tip whoever we wanted - I would have preferred he said it's all included and that's it.) WE stayed in one room which had a big king size bed (a little hard but comfortable) and pullout couch which was fine since we did not spend much time there. It was very comfortable and clean.. and included a small refrigerator stocked with juice, water and soda at all times. The bathroom had a huge walk in shower and enormous towels and nice bathrobes. The pool layout was our absolutely favorite part... big and inviting with a small baby pool attached and 3 and 4 foot deep areas for swimming. (The beach was okay.. kind of rocky and mucky in the water but the kids loved scavenging for hermit crabs). I loved the big covered canopy beds around the pool area for lounging as well as the lounge seating in the pool itself. We all loved swimming over to the pool side bar and sitting in the water to order drinks. My four year old became a big fan of virgin strawberry daiquiris and highly recommend the mojitos! THere is also poolside drink service but it was kind of sporadic and if you want something to munch in you do have to walk back to one of the restaurants. The \"activity hut\" was a center of things happening all day long for adults and kids. Music plays constantly and they announce different scheduled events including water aerobics, pool volleyball and basketball.. there's a ping pong table, pool tabel and oversized chess game as well as lots of different fun board games, float boards and noodles to borrow. They will watch children ages five to twelve also and have salsa lessons poolside in the afternoon. There is also a small playground area right by the pool with a table that had occasional craft projects in the afternoon. The only slight downside for small kids was the evening after dinner there was usually a show of some sort but not until 10 pm. I found out after a couple of days that they also had a fun kids \"disco\" and games at 9:30 each night but this was not well publicized. The staff were great with kids. Also one night we were told there would be crafts and activities before the show and it never materialized. Food-wise we were very pleased with the choice of six restaurants. We ate breakfast and lunch every day in the open air patio restaurant by the beach which is a buffet with lots of good healthy and not so healthy choices! Our favorite restaurant was Bamboo for a delicious beni-hana type meal. Make your reservations because it's worth it and they have a kids menu for an alternative. WE never ate at Romantico because children must be twelve or older but heard from many it was fabulous for french food, atmosphere and service. We were pleased by the other restaurants (all buffets), found pizza and an \"Olive Garden\" type menu at the Italian place and did okay at the Puerto Rican and California restaurant. WE also utilized the babysitting service which was reasonable ( $12 per hour for two children and a $15 transportation fee) to get away and play nine holes of golf which was also very nice. The woman was very friendly and loved children (Evelyn) and brought a bag of toys and games to play with! All in all a great getaway and change of scenery for people with our without children!", "Date": "November 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middletown, NJ", "Title": "\u201cThe good and the bad\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2825997", "Content": "After waiting for all of the opening kinks to work themselves out I finally visited the Paradisus 11/06-09 with some female friends, all in our early 40's. I am 20 year plus travel agent and searched out a great rate of $350.00 per night on Sol Melia's website for each room. The Positives: Absolutely beautiful property despite the lack of a swimmable or attractive beach. The public areas come close to any Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, great decor in all of the restaurants and lounges, extremely clean and well kept, stunning bathrooms, obviously money well spent in building this property. The rooms were lovely although mine had a mustly odor and they are a touch dark. The hard beds do grow on you after a night or two. The grounds are very nice and the landscaping is filling in all around. The food was very good except for Toscano, the Italian buffet which the staff tends to push you towards. Avocados has an excellent buffet for all 3 meals. Both Romantico and Bamboo were worth the visit, great food and service. Even though they say they will not take reservations before you arrive for either, insist on it, otherwise you will be dissapointed when you arrive if you're only there for a short stay. We had to jump thru hoops to get reservations at each once we arrived, but it was worth it. What the hotel is lacking in is available snacks with your drinks poolside during the day. The Royal Service Pool was a pleasure and the covered king beds around the pool were heaven, but many times during the day we kept saying some chips and salsa would be nice or some type of snack without having to take the long walk back to one of the restaurants. Service was spotty. The bar staff all around was excellent as were most of the restaurant staff but you found at least a couple of lazy workers in each restaurant. We made a habit of tipping the better bartenders and wait staff and found them to then be even more attentive, it's worth the $5 or $10 here and there. The spa was wonderful. I had two seperate treatments and found the facilities to be very nice and the therapists well trained, although their 50 minute treatments are more like 45 minutes. The Negatives: If you are 3 or more people don't bother with the Paradisus shuttle when you arrive at the airport. It runs $30.00 per person each way. We were 6 and the rep tried to put the 6 of us in a delapidated taxi-van at the Paradisus cost of $180.00 total. The taxi driver didn't speak the best English and was confused by the Paradisus rep's voucher. I asked what the actual cost was and found it was $66.50 plus tip. We sent the rep on his way with a tip for his trouble and paid the taxi driver directly. We did use the shuttle on the return as some of us had different flights and knew it would be difficult to get a taxi from the hotel. The beach is an unfortunate failure and from what I can see is unredeemable. The water is murky as far out as you can see and the sand is quite muddy. They do have lounge chairs spread around the higher level of sand which is still mostly dirt with broken shells spread throughout but there is never anyone in them or in the water unless they are taking a kayak or sunfish sailboat ride. The hotel is best marketed not as a beach resort and I think they are learning to take the focus off the beach. We were upgraded from the standard room to Royal Service rooms and were very grateful. However, checkin was very confusing, first I was told my 3 rooms was actually 1 for 6 people yet 6 could not stay in one room, obviously! After 1 hour of waiting in the lounge we were given our 3 rooms at 4pm but they weren't ready. We were shuffled off to lunch and at 5pm the rooms were ready but it took another 25 minutes to get our luggage. There were 2 large groups in-house and the hotel was sold out that evening, it showed. When I asked about dinner reservations for our 3 evenings I was told Romantico and Bamboo were sold out and we should go to Toscano. I had called the day prior to arrival and refused reservation and told we would have no problem when we arrived. When I informed the girl of this she got us dinner in Romantico for our 3rd night. Toscano is a beautiful restaurant but the food was mediocre at best. In addition, you wait 10-15 minutes to be seated in a half empty restaurant. People are lined out the door with many available tables inside. It's buffet service, no reason to keep you waiting for a table. After dinner I stopped back in the RS Lounge to insist on reservations for Bamboo the next night and after describing out unsatisfactory meal at Toscano I was told they would see what they could do. Later that night I had a message confirming Romantico for the next night also but still no Bamboo. It was not until an incident the next day that they finally obtained a 930pm reservation our last night and Romantico the second night. Watch your valuables. Put everything in the room safe. One of my traveling companions came in off her balcony to find a staff member going through the purse of her roomate who was at the gym. He lied to excuse himself and apologized but he unfortunately tried to cover for himself with management with a different story and in the end was not believed. The incident was reported and the management took the information and assured us it was a very serious issue but in the end the man was just suspended for 4 days, so we heard thru another employee. There was no further contact from management after the incident and it did not leave a very good taste in our mouth's. Fortunately nothing was actually stolen. Conclusion: For the rate we paid, it was a very good value. I did advise management that they have a long way to go before they can command the type of prices they are asking during the high season. There are still a number of issues with the property that need to be worked out. I think though despite the beach, this will eventually be a top resort for those just looking for a relaxing getaway in nice surroundings.", "Date": "November 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort but just a few kinks in 1111\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2697452", "Content": "We just returned yesterday from a long weekend here.

Dress code for men at these 2 are long pants and no tennis shoes. Food is average to good. We selected what looked good, tried a few new things and ate what we liked; didn't eat what we disliked. Breakfast and lunch are pretty much buffets so it is impossible to not find something good to eat. The grill on the beach is wide open with roof to ward off the sun and occasional showers. Very nicely done. Food is good. 2 in our party ordered hamburgers and 3 of 4 burgers were served very bloody. There was no problem getting the burgers recooked tho. We rented a car from Cabrera one day to drive to Old San Juan and the next day to El Yunque (rainforest). There was some overcharging the first day due to the employee at Cabrera not speaking English. Evidently she lied to Cabrera about speaking English. When I returned the 2nd day for the rainforest car, Cabrera reduced the overcharges and satisfied me. What the employee did not tell us is there is a $25 charge if Cabrera must pick up the car at the hotel. They were very fair in that regard after I told the 2nd day employee about the pick up charge. The concierge will arrange your hotel sponsored trips and/or the rental cars. Rooms were beautiful. All are suites. The royal upgrade we did not participate in.

First, the bed was the hardest I've ever slept on, but I actually loved it after the first night's sleep.
