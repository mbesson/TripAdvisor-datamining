Due to a mix-up at the airport, I needed to find a holiday, and quickly, as I was using an internet cafe. I found the Aldobrandeschi on Thomas Cook's website, and booked a week for myself and my husband, beginning the following day. We shared a taxi shuttle from Fuimicino with another couple. The driver told us it was a long way away, not wrong there, it cost us 60 euros! First impressions of the hotel, shabby from the outside but the reception area looked fine. We were given the key to our room on the 3rd floor and went straight up, after being told that the restaurant was only for breakfast and that meals could be arranged at a local restaurant, with a free shuttle. We went to our room and it smelt of rotten cabbage and the bed was solid, so we went back down to reception and asked for another. The room was on the 5th floor, no smell and the bed was a little softer. Anyway, to cut this saga short: Good points: Clean rooms Fresh towels daily Bad points: No free internet, internet was on computer in the lobby, 3 euros for half an hour Decor very dated No restaurant Breakfast average but coffee foul 1 small Peroni and 1 Disaronno and lemonade in the bar = 12.50 euros Miles from anywhere, 4 bus changes into the centre of Rome(or Metro which I hate) Minibar wasn't stocked until we asked, then on checkout (after paying city tax) was charged 6 euros for 2 bottles of water Invasions from coachloads of Chinese tourists every day - very loud and rude Asked for 2 drinks to be brought to our room and was told there would be a 5 euro charge for this - 1 Peroni, 5 euros, I cappuccino, 2 euros, room service, 5 euros = 12 euros, no thanks! This hotel was definitely not my idea of a 4 star hotel, and I think the rating needs urgently reviewing. Not a hotel to spend a week in, more like a stopover on the way to somewhere else. However, if you do stay here, make sure you ask the staff to book you a table at the local restaurant, fantastic service and wonderful food.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cFar from the city, old furniture, bad smell, rude staff\u201d", "Author": "Rossonerro", "ReviewID": "UR115839942", "Content": "First I have to admit that the price paid per night was 50 euros, so if you consider that accomodation in Rome in that period of the year is more expensive, I have to admit that it was a fair price. We stayed in Aldobrandeschi hotel for 3 nights, and tried to visit the most important parts of Rome. Positive things: - price Negative aspects: - Rude staff (when we told them that we are from Romania, they visibly changed the way they treated us). As an advice for Romanian tourists, in Rome, generally speaking, avoid telling anybody your origin or else you will be treated very bad... - Dirty everything: bathroom, towels, bedclothes, curtains etc. - Old furniture - Bad smell - Far away from the city. There is a bus that can take you in the city, but you have to wait 30-40 minutes. The bus goes until 22.30 and if you want to stay longer in the city...

Our students were very well behaved, but were constantly being looked at suspiciously. They bought sandwiches which were prepared by the staff, and then were questioned as to whether or not they had paid for them! The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night, and the students attempted to exit the buiding. They were blocked from doing so at the bottom of the stairs and yelled at by the night staff, told to go back to bed as the alarm contined to sound. I approached the gentleman and attempted to explain that we evacuate buildings when we hear fire alarms, and then he yelled at me saying the \"Americans cause nothing but confusion.\" and that he didn't have any problems with Japanese, Chinese... etc only Americans.\" He was extremely explosive and rude.

They staff also speak good English which was one thing that surprised me about the rest of Rome that very little English is spoken. I tried booking on the hotel website as the rate was slightly better, however had some difficulties with this so ended up booking via expedia. The rooms were fine breakfast was continental so very basic. There is no restaurant in the actual hotel but there is plenty of choice in and around the city. The hotel also has an arrangement with a restaurant nearby and can arrange free transportation if you want to eat nearer the hotel. The food is reasonable. The hotel is some distance away from the City and main attractions. If using public transport you can get a travel ticket for 11 euros for 3 days which i felt was good value for money. The Metro is very easy to use. The hotel is about 45 mins away from Vatican which is the nearest attraction. You have to get a bus outside the hotel No:892 to the nearest metro station Cornelia metro line A and then from the metro its another 15mins or so into the centre. A taxi to the city would cost about 30 euros. From the nearest airport a taxi costs about 50 Euros. If you do single journeys on the metro then the cost is 1 euro per 75mins.
