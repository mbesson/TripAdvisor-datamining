{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great value in Tokyo After suffering a week in a youth hostel with a sports team I was so glad to find a civilised clean hotel which was reasonably priced in Shinjuku Tokyo.It can be difficult to find hotels as they are not easily recognisable but the Presso Inn has a sign which can be seen from the street (providing you look up when you are walking). It is within walking distance of the South Exit of Shinjuku Station and is easy to find.It is immaculately clean although the rooms are small. All Tokyo hotel rooms are small. The price is very reasonable Y8400 single and Y11550 double or twin. That is really good value in Tokyo where hotels are expensive and it includes breakfast. There is a coin operated laundry and a convenience store in the hotel as well as the ever present vending machines. I would recommend this hotel. I have stayed in other places in Tokyo and this is by far the best.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR740494640", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jannuChristchurch"}, {"Content": "Budget room at a budget price Booked this hotel for a business trip in Shinjuko since it was right by my destination. English is spoken at the front desk so you can call and make a reservation. This is a small budget hotel, and accomodations match the price, which is very low by Tokyo standards. This may be a good choice for a quick one night stay, but not much more. This hotel is about 4-6 blocks from the local restaurants that speak English and Takashimaya Times Square / Shinjuku station. You should get a cab from the station to this hotel.This brand has no comparable US 2, 3, or 4 star hotel. It may equate to a motel.Room: Very small. Just large enough to fit the bed and TV table. The desk is not large enough to work at. Very little room for luggage. The TV has no foreign stations (e.g., CNN, BBC, etc.). Telephone usage is only available through the use of pre-paid calling cards which are available in the lobby. Internet access if available in the room. The shower is just large enough to fit a single person. The shower and faucet utilize the same water supply, so you need to select. The bed is large enough for a quick night's sleep. You get one small window. The room is very dark. The photo of the single room on their website is very accurate!Cleanliness: Very good.Environment: If you travel to Tokyo, you will find that they love to keep things warm, and this hotel is no exception. Even in the heat of summer, you will find the room about 80 degrees. Cooling system worked very well in the room, though the elevator and hallways will make you sweat in the summer.Check In/Service: There was always someone there that understood just enough English to get by. Very friendly staff.Overall: Not recommended for a business trip. May be good for a quick stop.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR702252959", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "brunob00"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d632544-r21889237-Keio_Presso_Inn_Shinjuku-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "632544", "Price": "$116"}}
