I never received the wake up call. I checked out and listened to the staff argue over how many nights I had stayed and If i had paid my account in full... I had prepaid weeks before I arrived. On that subject, I had to email and email and call 4 times to finally get the hotel to process the payment and issue me with a receipt. They eventually processed the payment. I then had to follow them up again for a receipt. Absolutely appalling customer service. The corridors are like a rats maze and the carpet is worn and Old. The lifts are scary and ridiculously small. To top all this off after 3 nights I developed what appeared to be a rash. By the end of my stay I went to my doctor who said the red spots on my arms and legs are bed bug bites.

I got the opportunity to go for short holidays in my ..well, my life, since I have professor's degree in English language and literature (second language). So, visiting London it's life changing experience. But, little I have known that this trip would be (almost) spoiled by this hotel I have already booked and paid. First of all, BELIEVE bad reviews. They do help. I did so, since I could not have money refund (it was the deal of day, but I did not look and this was MY mistake and my own fault). Old enough to admit a mistake when I make one. So, I stuck with this hotel in October, the day I booked it and they charged immediately. I know this was my mistake. But, luckily I am an old traveler who knows basic rules, that go as well in Hitchhiker's guide trough galaxy: ALWAYS TAKE YOUR OWN SHEETS AND YOUR OWN TOWEL! This literally saved my life. The room they gave me was not the room I have booked, it was triple basement room, which had so much dust on telephone that the room itself looked like never used before, the evidence of past use: the paper from candy left under the bed. Dead roach under the bed for third person (luckily again, I was alone) who has been there for God knows how long)...do these people have maids?? I've asked myself. But the next morning I discovered they do, since I found new towel in bathroom (I used my own towel as pillow sheet, and my own sheet as something clean to lay on. That morning I woke with tremendous stomach cramps. I thought it was just English tea, and my gastric problems. But the next morning I woke at 4.30 and to discover that when I get up, I do not feel any cramps, but if I try to lay down, my stomach is killing me. It was then that I realized the thing was about their sheet (I still used mine, but I put them on top, I didn't remove theirs), I smelled them and it was awful! As if someone died. I thought about Four rooms by Tarantino. So, I didn't sleep at all during my stay in London, thanks to this hotel that gave me this kind of room. And that horrible smell. I am really tolerant and I can take a lot. But, to call yourself a hotel with three stars and charge as much, it's really too much! I still like London, I didn't let that Hotel ruins my happiness for being in London, luckily I booked for two night only, it was not that cold, so I did not have to use covers (the bed was so grouse that I didn't even want to go in, but rather put my sheets on and sleep without any covers). As I am tolerant, I haven't said anything, and it was two night only. I am pacifist. BUT, in any OTHER CASE, I would rise war! If this hotel has good rooms, I haven't seen any. I will definitely go back to London and stay at the same neighborhood, but this hotel I will avoid in big circle. Positive: Location, nothing else. And Consigliere, very polite and helpful.

The problem seemed to be dealt with in an inefficient manner with it being handed from one member of staff to another, with no one seeming to take the lead. No apology was received for this error from any member of the staff, including the management. The lift to our room seemed to take ages to arrive. In fact it was at our floor but the door had failed to open. A passing cleaner noticed us and the problem, and banged the door with his hand opening it. Needless to say we had no confidence in the lifts after this. Furthermore if you are claustrophobic don't take them! Although the sign said it could take 4, it was a struggle for for the two of us to fit in with two medium cases. Our room was very small but I suppose it was adequate in size for one night's stay. The bed was uncomfortable and the walls were thin between the rooms. Consequently we didn't get a good night's sleep. The small shower room, although very small, was clean. Breakfast was poor. The croissants appeared to be uncooked. The tables were cleared in front of us, with the food waste being emptied straight into an open slops bucket. Not very appealing or professional in my opinion. The highlight of our stay was the ability to leave our luggage at the hotel after we had checked out, until the end of the day for only \u00c2\u00a31 per case.

Still I thought give it the benefit of the doubt. We arrived to check in around 3pm to find one of our three rooms wasn't ready (resolved after half an hour).In the twin room my mother found one of the beds had a soaking wet mattress, this must have been noticed when the bed was made as there were some towels under it in an attempt to dry it out. The occupants were moved into another room only to find out when we returned from the concert that this room had no electrics...you would think after the first room they would have made sure this one would be fit for purpose.So after all that they were moved into room number 3 at 1.30am.

Dirty spare blanket in the wardrobe (strange smell in there too), but no spare pillows. Two flat, stained pillows on the bed. Window latch falling off, window impossible to close without balancing precariously on the edge of the bed. TV very old and dirty, had four poor-reception terrestrial channels, no sound on any of them no matter how high the volume was turned, and no remote. There were NO fire regulations/directions anywhere in the room at all (every drawer and wardrobe was checked). I was under the impression that this was illegal/against regulations? No air-conditioning, and building work made spending any time in the room with the window open unbearable. We tried to grab some sleep that afternoon which we found impossible due to the building work. VERY noisy, building work and cleaning staff (believe it or not given the state of the rooms they actually have a cleaner, we saw her) during the day, guests crashing around and noise from the street at night. No instructions for phone, ie how to contact reception/other rooms. Back of radiator clogged with dust and dirt, and smelled bad. No lock on bathroom door, door handle didn't work properly. Broken/cracked tiles and very dirty grouting, particularly in corners. Floor very uneven. Toilet seat broken and wobbly. Pedal bin not working. On closer inspection realised this was because the lid was completely detatched and balanced on in position to make it look as if it was still attached. Toilet took at least three button-pushes to complete a proper flush. Larger persons squashed up (ie, actually touching both sides) of wall and shower cubicle when using the toilet. Water pressure passable. Taps on sink very stiff to turn, especially cold. Towels were clean, with a nice fresh smell of detergent, however the bath towels were minute. As I was taking all of this in in my husband found the crowning glory to our stay...A Rentokil Rodenticide trap behind the bedside cabinet. *shudder* Husband and I both slept fully dressed on top of the bed covers to avoid having to actually touch the horrible bedding. On check-in the receptionist was very helpful, and the lobby appears much better than in previous reviews, now being finished in white marble with leather furniture for guests and smart reception/concierge desks. Initial appearances give no indication of the horrors within. Concierge was surly and with (it seemed) very poor English. I skipped breakfast at the hotel (\"mouse traps in the rooms, what's going on in the kitchen?!\" mentality), however my husband's review: Had to wait 20 minutes for a table. No bacon in cooked breakfast. Poor toaster, had to put bread through twice to achieve a decent colour! Only one person clearing tables. No recognisable brands on display. Yoghurts not cold. During our stay my husband stopped in at reception to purchase two bottles of water from a fridge beside reception (water or cans of Coke, no prices on display). Member of staff behind reception charged him \u00c2\u00a33 cash, didn't ask for a name or room number. When it came time to check out, two bottles of water had been charged to room service on our friend's room next door. On trying to explain that we had already paid cash, we were met with a grilling on time of purchase, who did we pay, what did they look like, how much did we pay, suspicion and assurances that \"If the takings do not show \u00c2\u00a33 up, your booking card will be charged.\" Our complaints about the room and specifically the mouse trap were literally glossed over, our comments were not even acknowledged the receptionist continued the conversation with \"Thank you for staying, enjoy the rest of your day.\" Also the hotel attempted to take payment four days before we were due to check in from the card left supposedly just to hold the room until we paid on check-in. After putting the money \"On hold\" on the card (takes five days to get it lifted), staff then attempted to charge us again and deny that they could simply use the money that they had put on hold, despite us having an e-mail from the hotel confirming that this was possible. Badly maintained and badly run. Overall I was completely disgusted with the hotel, there is no way in hell this is a three-star hotel.

On the 16th I got into the shower at 8:20. at 8:25 the hot water stopped and did not come back for 80 minutes! This happened two other days, but the outages weren't that long. If you're an early riser, except in very busy times you'll probably be OK. Stuff that's not so bad: The inside of the shower is 24 inches square. To get fully clean, I had to lean outside of the shower. To sit on the toilet, you have to actually slide yourself under the edge of the sink. This is a bathroom for the semi-agile.

Noise from the adjoining rooms could be heard, but was no worse than any other budget hotel. There are loud groups in the street at night, generally around 11.

Bathroom was tidy and clean (although the door didn't close properly), and the shower was very nice. Was surprised with the room quality, it was actually very pleasant. The best thing about this place was the location. It was located literally a minute walk from Hyde Park, and there were two tube stations (Queensway and Bayswater) located within 5 minutes walking distance. There were also plenty of local shops (a Tesco Express next to Queensway) so easy to get access to food or pubs etc in the area. The reception area/hallways were quite old and this was evident throughout (save for the room which had been recently refurbished). The lifts were also very small and quite claustrophobic (we decided to take the stairs instead). The hotel IS being refurbished so I imagine it would be a lot nicer this time next year, though it wasn't bad by any standards. The hotel staff were very friendly and very helpful. I don't understand the negative reviews, as I found the staff to be really helpful. The lady behind the counter gave us advice on booking last minute theatre tickets and was very friendly. Continental breakfast was average - we didn't upgrade to the full-English (for only an extra \u00c2\u00a32 PP), but it was fine. Didn't expect to get breakfast, and it was included in the price and, although the variety was limited, there was choice available. One thing I would say is that there was very limited seating areas - some people that came after us had to wait for others to finish because they couldn't be seated. I would personally recommend it for people staying one to three nights. I think anything longer might be a little uncomfortable, but I guess it's all about what you're used to.

However, we knew we'd be out during the day and we'd literally just be using the hotel as a place to sleep so as long as the place was clean that's all we were really looking for. Check-in was swift with a pre-authorisation of a credit card or \u00c2\u00a320 cash to be left as a deposit (we opted for the cash option). Reception staff all spoke very good English and had a good knowledge of the area. As others have mentioned the 2 lifts in the hotel are small, one of them only just big enough for 2 people without luggage. Our room was on the third floor (308), thankfully one of the ones that had (recently?) been refurbished. The room was very small, slightly bigger than the double bed with a wardrobe, desk and en-suite bathroom. The bathroom was modern, tiled and clean with a shower cubicle, basin and toilet. However it was very cramped and there was little room to get dry after taking a shower. There's no A/C but the window opened wide and there's a radiator in the room you can control that got very hot, very quickly. Again, it's a budget hotel, we didn't expect A/C. The bed was comfy enough if a little bit creaky and the room also had a small flat screen TV mounted on the wall with terrestrial channels 1-5 available. However that's about as good as it gets... The fire alarm was constantly going off during the night. It seems they're very well rehearsed at diving across reception to stop the alarm as soon as someone presumably smoking in their room sets it off. We stayed for 3 nights and the alarm went off 4 times. The hotel was also very noisy, a small gap at the bottom of the door to our room let in all the noise from people walking the corridor and doors slamming. Having said all that, the hotel is well located with 2 Underground stations just streets away and Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park at the end of the road.

We booked this hotel as part of a theatre break and all we can say is that on the whole our trip to london was great but the hotel left a lot to be desired. On check-in we asked for a iron and iron board to be bought up to our rooms at which point the receptionist on duty gave us an iron (our hands were full with our luggage) and told us to get a board from the concierge desk. We maybe should have taken that as an indicator for the remainder of our stay. We went up to our room via two lifts as both of us and our luggage couldn't fit into just one lift. The one lift could hold just two people without any bags. The other was just slightly bigger. Both lifts are in desperate need of a refurb as is the rest of the hotel. When we got to our room we couldn't believe just how small it was. The room was the size of a single room with a double bed in it. If I wanted to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night I had to climb over my girlfriend as there wasn't enough space to get out of my side of the bed and walk around it. There were scuff marks on the walls, the carpet was grubby and generally the the room was in disrepair and in desperate need of a refurb. I also wanted to put some things in the room safe however I discovered that it was locked with no instructions on how to open it. I called down to reception and they said they would send someone up immediately. No one materialised even though I told them we would be leaving in a half hour. We went out to the theatre and upon our return we found that someone had been into the room and opened the safe and not left any instructions. We also noticed that there was no-one on reception when we got back (this was to be a common sight throughout our stay). Breakfast on all mornings was disorganised and chaotic with staff helping themselves to breakfast and eating behind the counter in full view of guests. They would also play on their phones and read the papers while the buffet was being neglected. The buffet was also nothing special. Two cereals, two fruit juices, tinned fruit salad and grapefruit segments, croissants, rolls, bread for toasting and tea and coffee. The toaster seemed to be faulty - it was on full heat, but you still had to put your toast through twice to just get a semblance of colour on it. The breakfast room itself was also shabby and how they coped with breakfast in that small room I don't know. It is best to get in first thing otherwise you might not have a table. The radiator in the room didn't have any means of turning down the heat, and there was only a very small window that could open. When we returned back to the hotel on the second night we found that reception was empty and the front door left unlocked. Surely that is a serious security problem. Also no-one stopped us at any point to check if we were actually residents in the hotel. On our last night, they neglected to put in a bath mat - we tried phoning down to reception every 5 minutes or so for more than half an hour, but no-one answered. We had discovered a sweets wrapper on one side of the bed, which wasn't removed at all during our stay. Another point to make is that they still use extremeley scratchy blankets to make up the beds - come on people! If you're going to make up the beds with blankets, at least use a better quality! We wanted to complain at the end of our stay - yet again there was no-one around. Checkout was rushed - gave our room number, then we were told \"everything was fine\", and the receptionist (same one who checked us in) turned to the next guest. They also advertise a business centre on their website - this consists of a computer and printer set up in the middle of the reception area. You wouldn't dare use it, as everyone is able to see on the screen. We could have accepted all of this as we now realise that it is a budget hotel however the hotels website is extremely misleading and I quote: \"Our aim is to provide the highest standards of service and hospitality, with the comfort and facilities you would expect of a modern luxury hotel, while preserving the traditional character of the property itself. You can be sure of a warm and friendly welcome at the Queens Park Hotel\" The hotel in my opinion doesn't adhere to anyone of these things and I can honestly say that when I go to London again I would rather pay extra and maybe stay with a reputable group.

We stayed in room 306 on the third floor which was a twin room. Yes the room was small, but you are in the centre of London in a budget hotel, but it had all the amenities that you would expect (tea/coffee, tv, hairdryer etc). The bathroom was also more than adequate, good sized, and a decent shower. Both rooms were very clean and presentable. The only minor faults with the room were that the back of the toilet seat had come off, and the sink tap was loose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but by no means does this mean I would mark the hotel as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcterrible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122! In other reviews there have been comments about noise from the street, but we slept with the window open (the room was quite warm even though no heating was on), and we could hear no street noise at all from the rear of the hotel (we were facing onto the gardens for the road behind). I would suggest that if this is a concern, to request one of these rooms, even though the road that the hotel is on didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be busy when we were arriving and leaving the hotel. Breakfast was a little chaotic, but we were seated straight away and there was plenty to eat. Would have been nice to have a little bit of table service (ie. someone to bring you toast or a pot of tea), but it was fine, and was basically just your \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbog standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continental style breakfast.

That was until that night when we got back to the room and got into the twin beds. You could feel every spring in the bed. it was rock hard and smelt fusty, and the pillow was flat. I tried unsuccessfully to get comfortable and in the end decided that I would ask for a move to another room. \"There were no spare rooms\", \"there were not staff to move us\", \"the hotel was full\", \" try in the morning\". These were the reasons we could not have another room. We were given a mattress protector (which smelled fusty) and I asked for 2 more pillows. We were given 1 (thats all they had!!!!!) without a pillow case on and it was stained and smelly. I was told to put it under my existing pillow. I didn't sleep at all and in the morning my back and neck were killing me from the springs in the bed! At reception, I was told by the duty manager (who didnt even look up from his paperwork) that they were full and he was unable to help me. This was a blatant lie as the maids were cleaning numerous rooms and large numbers of people were checking out at the time. I eventualy asked again (this time a young lady who was very helpful) if we could be moved, and the young lady went to plead our case (thats how it felt) with the duty manager, who incidentally didnt come out of the office. After much persuasion on her part he agreed we could have another room on the third floor. So much better - small, but clean and with a comfy bed. Without the young lady virtually begging for us to be moved I fear we would have had to stay in the original room as he could clearly be heard by us as he was saying to the girl, \"just tell them we cant help them - we are full\". My daughter has travelled the world and has said that hostel accommodation in some of the countries she has travelled to was better than this hotel. The bed was like sleeping on a bag of rocks and fusty smelling beds are not what I expect in any hotel let alone a british 3 star!!

Staff was friendly and helpful with all things I needed, even went out of their way to help me make overseas calls and use the in room safe. The tube stations were a quick (less than five minute) walk away and led to three different lines, so the location could not be beat, especially since Hyde Park and the Round Pond, Kensington Palace, etc are also a short walk away. Food shops line Queensway, so that is also easy. I would, however, call this a budget hotel, so here are the downsides: the breakfast area is small, and it does get crowded. Only on weekends did I have to wait for a table though. There are two lifts, and one is tiny (four square feet) and unfortunately during my ten day stay the larger lift was broken the entire time. There is also no air con, so don't be surprised by the amount of street traffic noise that filters in through the open windows. Now here is my only big complaint, and honestly, the hotel has no control over it. I will stay again at this hotel, but I will only do so if I can get a room facing away from Queensborough Terrace because this hotel has the unfortunate location of being right across from a yough hostel that allows its young (often drunk) guests to sit on the terrace (right under your open window) and scream, sing, shout, argue, etc until 3am. Several young men would sing drinking songs in Polish (I speak it roughly) and then for seemingly no reason stop mid sentence and scream obscenities in English. I recognized these voices after a few nights and was glad when they disappeared on the fifth night. I bought foam ear plugs and that helped tremendously, but sadly they were rudely and inconsiderately loud every single night.

He insisted that the room was fine and that we would be charged an early check out charge. We spent hours of our second day looking for another hotel we could stay and traveling to it. This hotel ruined our trip and was DISGUSTING!

And I would. Until I found out that someone had broked into mine and other 4 rooms on Saturday afternoon.

I was using the safety box inside the closet (the closet was unlocked but nothing there was touched) but, still, had 200 euros inside a bag kept in the suitcase, but miraculously they did not see it or took it! (they were too busy and had much to do in the room in front of mine: I looked back and found it with the door totally destroyed and detached from its frame (it was laid on the ground!) and they also had other neighbours\u00c2\u00b4 rooms to break into. On the other hand, they took away my watch I was fond of and some money from the German guy beside; he was not using a suitcase locker, differently from me (though it was useless). The clerk claimed that they did not take anything else from the others, that I was the only one robbed. They were looking for things with presumable value that would fit in a pocket . The hotel has no security at all and since in my week stay there wasn\u00c2\u00b4t a single day when someone from the desk asked me where I was going before entering or leaving the hotel. It was very frustrating to see that, besides the Portuguese guy on the desk during the night shift, who gave the minimal support and called the police, the manager was absent and unhelpful, since took two days to authorize the 20 pounds refund for the new ordinary suitcase I had to buy and to allow my second night in the hotel in front of the Queens Park they booked me into - he wanted me to come back and stay my last night in London in that total unsafe place, which I refused. For my watch I got only more 20 pounds. I talked to three different police officers, only the last one was understanding, but they were unanimous in saying that nothing else could be done, that they had already been there for some poor investigation they did (they wasn\u00c2\u00b4t even aware that my room was also burglarized, they thought that the thiefs broke into only 3 rooms and took notice that there were 2 more rooms by my fone call). Police added it was becoming frequent in the Bayswater region and that in Brazil would be the same (!). The hotel had no cameras or security system at all; there are two doors separating the elevator hall from the alleys, helping any sound to go through. It was very easy for a couple of guys to do what they did: one can be just checking the imminent danger while the other kicks each door he wants, close the curtains and do the service. They new sharply the room service schedule: at 1:00 p.m. I was there and so was the maid. The crime happened afterwards. I strongly recommend to keep away from this poor hotel if do not want to count on the \"luck\" I had in having only one good stolen. I have photos of the incident, which I have downloaded to this site.

Being newlyweds, we didn't have much money, and we didn't want to spend all of it on the room. We booked the trip through a travel agency, and they actually had us at a different hotel, but had to change the reservation at the last minute. We'd seen pictures of the other place, so we knew what we were in for with that hotel, but there were no pictures of this hotel to prepare us for the shock. The outside of the hotel was beautiful. It was clean and freshly painted, and in a lovely area of town, convenient to the underground and walking distance to several shops. Actually, if you've seen National Lampoon's European Vacation, you've seen the hotel. It's under a different name, and the interior is a set, but it's the hotel that the Griswold's pull up to on the British leg of their tour. Just a bit of useless trivia. We were pleasantly surprised that we were allowed to check in early, and not made to loiter around the lobby for the several hours until the actual check-in time. That was our last bit of good news. We both knew the room would be small, but we're also both the type that can live with pretty much anything as long as the room is clean and there's a private bathroom--which this had, thank goodness. We certainly weren't expecting pillow mints and turn-down service. This room wasn't small. It wasn't tiny. It was miniscule. In order to get dressed in the mornings, one of us had to stand on the bed (generally me, since I'm shorter and my husband kept hitting his head on the ceiling). We had one large bag and two carry-ons, and came very close to having to leave one of the carry-ons in the hall, just to fit in the room. The bed was large and comfortable. The room and bath were clean and nicely decorated. The lights worked when they felt like it--never all at the same time. The bathroom light went out, rendering the room pitch black, and maintenance said they'd get someone up the next day. That I could live with. The toilet stopped flushing, and maintenance said they'd get someone up the next day. That I could NOT live with. We ran out of toilet paper, and maintenance said they'd get some up the next day. COME ON! We constantly had to keep going to the front desk to get things like towels (needed one each), soap, etc. that should have been in the room each day. Two people can not go 5 days on one foil packet of shampoo. When I called down to let them know that the radiator was broken, the front desk employee actually SIGHED. Now, I'm one to look for the humor in situations, and I find it hilarious that on my honeymoon in London, I got three BBC channels, and not one of them carried Doctor Who. They were also all staticy. We did, however, watch Borat on our neighbor's big screen tv by looking out our window into theirs. I guess that's something. The continental breakfast is alright, but nothing to write home about. There are no snack or soda machines, but there is a Tesco grocery around the corner.

First off, I and my luggage almost didn't fit in the tiny, shabby little box of an elevator. It stopped either 6 inches too high or too low for its intended floor, before coming to a jolting stop. The \"B\" in B107 obviously stood for basement. My room was down a series of hallways with bad lighting and stagnant air. I was travelling solo, and I did not feel safe down there. I finally found the room and went inside. No, no, no. The room was dirty and the plumbing leading away from the toilet was a flexible clothes dryer exhaust tube. You know, the white plastic tubing that should never be used to carry urine and feces anywhere? Yep, that's what they were using for the outflow. I went to the front desk, and told him I needed a clean room that was on a floor with other people around. The next room had what appeared to be legal plumbing, but it was filthy. There was some sort of grease line on the wall just above the bed. The walls were so dirty with chunks of plaster missing, and the ceiling peeling down with mold and water stains. The window only partially closed, and the locking mechanism on the door could not be secured. It looked like someone had chisled the wood away *from the inside*. Acckkk! I called Hotwire long distance on my cell to tell them that I absolutely could not stay there and that it shouldn't even be operating with an illegal plumbing system like that. They were very helpful and very apologetic. I ended up in the Thistle around the corner for only $40 more. The difference was night and day.

The hotel is situated in the Bayswater area on a relative quiet residentilal street. We are familiar with this area as we stayed there many times. Here, the acceptability ends. The hotel has not been well maintained at all The owners have carried the idea of \"no-fill\" and its \"budget\" rating to the extreme. On entry, the guests are greeted with a well worn-out welcoming mat which is an eyesore, and then though an always opened paint-peeled door in hideious blue. On entry, the lobby has only a few uncomfortable wooden chairs along the wall for those who need to wait for the rooms to be readied, or to picked up by shuttle services. There is on another wall a well worn and didlipated and filthy couch which even the Salvation Army would likely refuse, While the staff are helpful and courtious, but their competence are wanting. Then along the counter there are a few drooping potted plants which would be much better off being discarded.The rooms are small and barely adequate, but the carpeting are worn and filthy. Gurests are well advised to bring their own soap, as the hotel only provides one or two packets of bath gel and shampoo, no facial tissues It's down-right dangerous to ge in or out of the bath tub which is set on different levels to the bathroom floor. The shower head is set so high, it take some stretching and reaching to bring it sown. As to the Continenal Breakfast, it consists of the basic .(white and wheat sliced bread,with butter and jam, rolls, two kinds of cold cereals, and apple and orange juices. canned fruits, coffee and tea. After six days there, it becames rather monotonous. Also, there's only one chair in the room .If the chair is occupied by wife who needs to make up to get out, the spouse would have to sit on the bed.. As our plane was delayed one night due to mechanical problem and the airline called ahead from Orlando to request the cancellation of the first night and extend anther night at the end, the hotel doesn't want to recognize this and was on the phone aurguing, which is annoying.

The first room we were shown 101,was awfull.it was tiny,with no natural light ,there was a window but this just look`d onto a fire escape,which made the room feel even darker,obviously a smoker had used the room before we got there because the room was very heavy with the smell of smoke.The bathroom was so small if you sat on the toilet you would have touched the shower cubical with your knees,no bath. my husband went down to reception and was given ,without question another set of keys. Room 112 was much better,although still small,it was very bright ,looking onto the main steet,there was much more space in this room even with a double bed,wardrobe,and dressing table,The bathroom was also much better having the benifit of the bath and shower.the general decor was abit dated but the room was clean. The continental style breakfast was very good,and there was plently to go round,The only improvement that could be made hear is possably the option of some cold meats or boiled eggs to go with all the other stuff on offer. The staff were good and im sure would be as helpfull as possible if needed. The best part of this hotel by far has to be its location,hyde park on your door step,a 5min walk to marble arch,queensway tube station 2 mins by foot,and a short bus ride to oxford street and central london (if fit you could even walk it ). On a whole i found this hotel to be ok.Yes it could do with some new carpets,Yes it could do with decorating in alot of areas (painters were doing lobby while we were there so they are trying to improve things) and yes the rooms are debatable on the one your given,as to weather sutable or not,but the rooms are clean and the for the price and location of this hotel i would have to say you get good value for your money.A 3* hotel? maybee not ,more like a bed and breakfast,so if you want 1st class service with wonderfull rooms,and views to match, pay the \u00c2\u00a3150 pounds pppn or more for that kind of hotel in central london,if your happy with a basic room to sleep in, great breakfast,and an exellent location,then this hotel will probably do you fine.after all its cheap as chips!!", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved the free breakfast (buffet style, continental)\u201d", "Author": "toronto_416_canada", "ReviewID": "UR7701511", "Content": "We are two asian male travelers in early 20s (ie university students). from Toronto and Montreal and stayed from May 7-10, 2007.

It was definitely a blessing! The Queen's Park Hotel was cleaner and more modern than the other place and the staff much more pleasant (if you want to know where the other place was that we were originally booked into - and stayed for one night - please feel free to email me). The good: Clean rooms with small but servicable bathrooms. Location was great - in an interesting part of London (Bayswater) with lots of action going on two blocks over, but the street the hotel is on is very quiet and charming. The tube is close by (although one of them was out of order and we had to walk a short distance longer for the other one - if you are there on a weekend or holiday, you may run into times when the tube is down for repairs). The not-so- good: Beds not particularly comfortable - a bit hard and lumpy The \"continental breakfast\" was a joke - cheap slices of bread, Costco-type croissants, corn flakes and rice krispies, coffee and tea and a watery oj (I think - maybe it was grapefruit - hard to tell). This may be an English thing - we ate the breakfasts because it was included and London is so terribly expensive that we figured it was better to fill up on something! Plus they tended to run out out flatware and cups and did not replace it. The lifts (elevators) are teensy - and slow - I tried to walk up and down stairs as much as possible. No wi-fi, but there is one computer in the lobby that you can rent for 1 pound fifty for a half hour. Suggestions, especially for Americans who have not visited London before: Be prepared for the expense! I had heard \"it's expensive there\" but I've visited NYC, Anchorage and San Francisco multiple times and I thought I understood what \"expensive\" meant - but I was wrong. Because of the weak dollar, it is even more so, but be prepared in many cases to pay up to 4 times what you are used to in the U.S. (eg, a soda or bottled water in a restaurant can cost $7 or $8!). The one thing that is reasonably priced compared to NYC are the West End shows - defiinitely plan to see one or more - they are Broadway quality and you'll have a great time. Buy a tube and bus combo pass - you can buy these daily unless you are staying for more than 5 days. It gives you unlimited access and the transportation system is really great. To get to the airport, there is a train called Heathrow Express which is about 15 pounds each. But there is a slower train (but not that slow), that is only 7 pounds that also leaves from Paddington Station. We found out about it by accident - our hotel didn't even seem to know about it - and this saved us quite a bit as compared to taking a taxi (we were travelling with our two daughters so multiply everything by 4!).

(we ate lots and saved even more money, it was also well presented, fresh and delicious too)All in all, for what we wanted in a hotel as abase, and what we paid it was an absolute bargain, yes you can pay double that and get a modern, spotlessly clean, pristine branded chain hotel, but unless you intend to spend your stay sat in your room, watching tv, why bother? In life, yes you get what you pay for, but I genuinely feel, for the location, service and price, we got a lot more than we paid or bargained for here and my apprehensive expectations were more than suppassed.My advice, if you want a swanky roomy big name branded chain hotel to lounge away the evenings and days in and moneys not a question, look elsewhere, if you want a smaller, friendly base to explore London at a bargain price you can do a lot worse than give the Queens Park a try.", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cSurprise surprise....actually quite good!!!\u201d", "Author": "Pellican", "ReviewID": "UR7010369", "Content": "Okay, this review may shock a few peple who have seen the pictures of this place or stayed there.... Originally, we booked to stay at the Bayswater Inn but, as these things always go, when we arrived there we were told it was fully booked and we were going to be shifted to a partner hotel...the Queens Park Hotel. Obviously this was followed by some disappointment and we weren't particularly impressed by the room we were given...it was tiny, the TV looked like it may fall off the stand any time soon and there was no view at all, unless you like external staircases. The bathroom wasn't great either, the shower was dirty and you couldn't sit on the toilet without banging against the sink. Pretty dire really. We went back to reception and told them, in a nice way of course, that we wanted to leave the hotel entirely. We were offered another room at this point. The guy at the desk explained that this was a brand new part of the hotel and so we agreed to look at it...they actually showed us TWO rooms. These rooms were located in the basement and there was still work going on around the stair area. However, the rooms were GREAT! [Okay, not totally 5* or anything but for the price we paid - about \u00c2\u00a355 per night, you would be hard pressed to find something that good in a central area]. I have uploaded the pictures and I am sure you will be able to tell them apart from the others. Everything was brand new and there was even an LCD TV. The only disadvantages were that it was in the basement so not a great view, but hey, we were there to sight-see so it really didn't matter. We did originally ask for a double bed but af you can see in the pictures we had two singles set together. The other nice room we were shown did have a double bed but we just preferred this room. Also, the walls are not very sound proof, but we didn't really bother about this. We were just extremely lucky with the room! Breakfast was included and it's stuff like cereal, toast, tea, juice...not highly amazing but enough to get you started for the day. Arrive on time as at precisely 10am [weekdays] they will whip everything away. The area is really nice, especially if you want a multi-cultural outlook. It didn't feel like London at all! Hyde park is just a minute away and Queensway tube is about 3 min walk, i.e. round the corner and very conveniently on the central line. Personally, we won't book with this hotel again, but that is not because we didn't like it. There is no guarantee we would get a great room again.

The hotel service was however non existent. The lifts were working prior to check in then mysteriously hand written notes appeared stating both were out of order. The stairs are very steep, I was grateful our room was ONLY on the 3rd and not the 5th floor. There appeared to be no visable sign of these being repaired. The complimentary newspaper was unavailable on request as was room service despite being advertised. The breakfast in the foyer looked ok however when we arrived 20 minutes prior to deadline there was an absence of hot drinks and the staff had disappeared. The location of the hotel is superb and to be fair we were hardly in our room at all, it was an annoyance that the service was so poor. I would recommend the bayswater area for excellent bars and restaurants, do check out the indoor shopping centre, great cinema and restaurants on the upper floors. It is a vibrant area and not expensive. As for Queenspark if you are relatively fit and indifferent to the staff give it a go,at a discounted rate only.", "Date": "February 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derbyshire", "Title": "\u201cSaved a fortune!\u201d", "Author": "boffpa", "ReviewID": "UR4413602", "Content": "Read all the other moaners- what do you expect for this kind of money?

I wasn't therefore expecting anything except an argument with the hotel about the dozen unacceptable problems that I anticipated. However, for the GBP 37.50 I paid (for a hotel in an excellent London location) for a double room including breakfast, there was precious little to complain about. The room (501) was warm, clean, freshly decorated, reasonably furnished and quite spacious. Ok, the carpets in the public areas were a little threadbare and the lift (one working out of two) was fine only for anorexic midgets but, on the basis of my experience this hotel represents good value for money.

Just trust myself and many others, do not waste your money or time or ruin a good vacation with a crappy room from this hotel. Ohh yeah, did I mention the elevator that is only big enough for 1 person (2 if your super skinny) at one time?
