We didn't check in until midnight but the night clerk was so helpful. He gave us milk and yogurt for my 2 year old so she would be comfortable and happy before going to sleep. He was very nice and friendly but I don't remember his name. The room was good size and very clean. The TV was older but everything was clean. I didn't hear a lot of noise from other rooms and we got a good night sleep. They offer a free buffet breakfast in the morning and I thought it was very good. Eggs were great and sausage was good. they had many fresh pastries and cereal and fresh juice. The staff was helpful in finding what we needed and answering any questions. I would definitely stay here again on a quick overnight stay.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly adequate\u201d", "Author": "ewparker", "ReviewID": "UR126965148", "Content": "This is a big hotel with lots of rooms and quite spread out.

I have stayed at a few other Comfort Inn & Suites in the past. This trip did not disappoint. The room we stayed in had 2 very comfortable beds. A flat screen TV with Cable. The kids were able to find something to watch why the wife and I relaxed after a long drive. The property has a nice small pool (heated) and a hot tub that is nice for soaking in and relaxing. When we arrived we were greeted by the counter staff, and check in was a breeze. The neighborhood the Hotel is located in is a bit industrial / commercial. This makes it nice because there are a few C stores around and a few places to grab a bit to eat. I wouldn\u2019t recommend walking around this area after dark, but I didn\u2019t feel like my car was going to get vandalized either. Keep in mind that this hotel is a good 20 to 30 min away from any of the Major Vegas Attractions. So if you are planning on spending time on the strip, and don\u2019t mind the drive take a look at this place. Otherwise look for something closer to downtown. What I did not like about this stay was the Breakfast in the morning. The selection of food was average, Eggs, Sausage, Cereal, and the standard waffle maker that seems to be in most of the hotels now days. The problem was the staff was not able to keep the items stocked. They would bring out 10 of an item (for a crowd of maybe 20 guests) then take a 10 min break before the next item was brought out. This ensured that everything was out and you were waiting up to 20 min for a replacement food item to be brought out. We played this game for about 30 min before we settled on a bowl of cereal and made plans to eat a better breakfast elsewhere. To sum it up. Great place to stay as long as you\u2019re not planning on using the breakfast in the morning.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "JAFLP", "ReviewID": "UR118454740", "Content": "Very clean, big room and comfortable bed/pillows--great room.

Since we are from Montreal, we live with cold and snow for many months. We were all so happy to be able to swim outside at 9:30 at night! The rooms were comfortable, clean and the hotel very quiet! The service was also incredible. The men who welcomed us was friendly and helpful. We felt welcomed and that is not always the case when you arrive with 23 teenagers!!

However, we had ants in our bathroom coming out of the wall the first night. When I called the front desk I was told there was only one person working and I had to go down myself and get the spray and spray myself. Then I tried to use two vending machines for bottled water. One ate my money and the other gave me pop. The front desk did give me my money back, but come on now. Finally, the TV in our room did not work. After the experience with the ants I did not bother trying to get the TV fixed. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle. Not too sure about the neighborhood down the street from the hotel, but that is part of Vegas. They did have free computer to use in lobby and that was nice.

No doubts about it. It's super quiet, away from the strip, the breakfast is good and the ambiance (lol) is excellent. I decided to stop patronizing the one on Paradise Road as I had seen several people walk right off the road and into the breakfast area, load up and leave. I let management know and they looked at me like I was speaking a dialect too difficult to understand. :) Anyway, I love this hotel and will always book here.

The breakfast was the usual toast, bagels, muffins, fruit, cereal, coffee, juice etc, which would have been fine if we could have found somewhere to sit to eat it. There was a school sports team staying whilst we were there and they took over every table and chair in the lobby area to eat breakfast, and even trying to get to the breakfast counter to choose something to eat was quite daunting with teenagers standing in front of all the food!
