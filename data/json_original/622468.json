Lovely spacious rooms with huge bed, great little kitchen, living room area and balcony with some lovely views and all done in an Oriental style was all amazing to me. And when I saw the rates for first week in Dec, this was too good to miss! What used to be exclusively executive Apartments for a long term rental/hotel style place to live, now has also entered the short term, which is a great thing. The quality of the rooms and building itself is fantastic and for 1,850 AED for 4 nights in a 1 bed apartment is something that is unheard of in Dubai considering the 4 star (maybe even 5 star) quality of the rooms and hotel. Yes the location is a little off the beaten track but we all know taxis are cheap and they offer free shuttle buses to various Dubai Locations throughout the day. A weeks car hire I got for \u00a367 so location isnt too bad considering what you get! Theres also the 30% off at WAFI Centre which has restaurants and bars which we used. Having returned there Its exactly how I remembered it\u2026in fact hadnt changed one bit\u2026which may be viewed as a bad thing after 4/5 years, but it showed no signs of wear and tear etc. Room was a 1 Bed Appartment (Room 606) and was fantastic! Couldn't fault that. High quality and always clean! Great Kitchen! And nice views of the City even though it was a back facing room despite me requesting a front facing room. Restaurant never used as having a kitchen we made out own breakfast and always went out for dinner. No bar but the Hotel next door (Arabian park Hotel) has one aswell as a restaurant and deli. The pool gets the sun most of the day and towels are supplied and bottle of water handed out too. The pool however in my opinion needs some work done on it as this shows signs of being run down. The tiles around the pool have had there day and need replacing really. Theres also an electric extension lead running from the side of the pool which is obviously powering something under a makeshift cover\u2026.surely not safe and the cover with wires and pipes coming out isnt very attractive. Pool isnt heated so can be quite cold in winter months. Staff were helpful, although one security guard was a little over the top when asking my partner who she was when entering the hotel in a rather aggressive manner. My partner told him room number and she asked if there was a problem and he replied \"No I just havent seen you before\" Bit rude but all other staff were ok for a 4 star Hotel. Over all\u2026great value for money\u2026.a great hotel if looking for quality at a low price. Don't be put off with Location either. Pool needs a bit of work but a great little hidden gem for Dubai.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kobe-shi, Hyogo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best places I have stayed in while in Dubai\u201d", "Author": "Rethabile M", "ReviewID": "UR122911603", "Content": "The online bookings manager whose name is Josephine was REALLY rude towards me when I called for some clarification before I stayed at the hotel.

I loved taking my hot showers and baths in there. We even had a balcony overlooking the small garden downstairs and the city skyline. It was lovely just sitting in there looking at the sky and stars at night. What I like a lot about this hotel is its location. It is only 10-15 minutes away from Sh.

There were five of us and we rented a one bedroom and a studio apartment...the rooms were spacious, clean and fully equipped with all the basic necessities, even the liqiud soap for washing the dishes was provided. The cleaning was done promptly and regularly, the 'ENTIRE' staff was extremely friendly and helpful at all times. Although the hotel was fully booked..it was very peaceful. On various occasions when my kids would go to the pool which they loved as it was very esthetically designed, they had the entire pool to themselves. The location was quite central. as it was close to all the major shopping malls, thus the taxi fares were not so much. The only thing was that at times you had to wait for a taxi for more than five minutes......but we took care of that, for when we were about to step out we would have the reception call us a taxi, so by the time we stepped down our taxi would be waiting for us. The hotel had a good shuttle service aswell and provided a discount a various award winning restaurants. I searched high and low for two months for a good hotel, price and location wise and I think choosing this hotel was an excellent choice. We made our reservations through booking.com for the first time and were extremely pleased as everything worked out better than planned and the rates offered through booking.com are definately cheaper and better than the actual hotel rates. Bottom line is that I would recommend this place to anyone and I for one would definately stay here again.

All the corridors were clean and the ambiance was quiet and relaxing. The staff on check-in were friendly and nice. Sadly it stops there. Breakfast was quoted to me as being 35 AED a day, but no mention was made that I would have to pay extra for sausages and other such items. The buffet was quite small on its own. I asked for 3 breakfasts, but upon checking out they tried to charge me for 4 breakfasts as it was part of a package I had no idea I had bought. I demanded to pay the 3 I had requested and so the Duty officer said he would charge the poor check in girl for this error. After I offered to pay for her, he refused claiming this would be her punishment. Any normal hotel would apologise and just scrap the 35 AED, then inform the girl better. I felt bad for this and I think this was his way of getting back at me. I tried to bring a nice professional Indian girlfriend I had met in Dubai some months earlier to see my room as I told her it was nice. She came all the way over only to have an over-zealous security guard run up to her demanding ID. It was very rude, and she ended up wanting to leave very shortly after coming as she felt unwelcome. This upset me also. I was told it was hotel policy, but I think it is ignored with certain nationalities. Upon checking out I told the Duty officer my complaint and he was initially concerned but then asked what nationality was she? When I said a local Indian girl he completely changed his attitude and seemed quite indifferent saying it was hotel policy. Since when did race or nationality enter the hotels policy on outside visitors??? I was even more shocked when considering he was of Asian background himself. Really he should never have asked her racial background when considering the hotels policy. This was the same guy who charged the check-in girl for my breakfast! I noticed the maintenance team were quick to respond when the Air conditioning controller display in my room stopped working. The air-conditioning still worked okay, it was just the controller screen that broke. He came with a ladder 5 minutes after the call and told me they would replace the faulty controller the next day. I never saw anyone after that and it was not fixed. I requested an ice-cream desert by room phone at around 10pm one evening. The person sounded reluctant and bored, then I was called back 10 minutes later to be told they didn't have that flavour ice-cream anymore. The gym and pool photos were deceiving. The pool is very pleasant and the staff were nice, but it is far more shallow and short than the photo indicates. I tried a late night swim before 10pm on the first night, but I had to get out quickly as 3 young men were screaming and shouting very loudly like idiots. It was not very relaxing at all and someone should have stopped them. The gym is far less modern than the photos try to present and I didn't bother using it. Fianlly the TV in the room is great except that when you turn it around to face the bed the channel changer doesn't work due to no line of sight. And no return answer to my email on all these problems.

The apartments are cozy, with plenty of space, excellent staff and close to key activities and landmarks. We've stayed here a number of times when we would come up to Dubai for the weekend from Saudi Arabia. Somerset Jadaf is situated in a way the it has direct access many of the main highways in Dubai. For example, it is about 5 minutes to Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa and it's about 5 minutes to Wafi Center and about the same to Festival City. To Jumeirah, it is about 20 minute drive and about a 10 minute drive to DIFC. The one-bed room apartment was spacious. Each apartment has a dining table, a lounge, two bathrooms and a huge kitchen. Each bedroom had its own TV with DVD player, in addition to the flat-screen TV with DVD player in the living room. The kitchen comes with a washing machine, dishwasher, fridge/freezer, coffee maker, kettle, basic kitchen utensils like knives, chopping board, cutlery, toaster, colander, drinking glasses and coffee cups. The two-bedroom apartment had its own laundry room. The swimming pool is of a good-size and is nicely situated. Breakfast was provided in all our stays. It's healthy enough, with a selection of fruits, cereals, breads and two hot items a day which rotate. The staff were always polite, friendly and helpful, and always greeted us warmly when we came \"home\".

Even though Jadaf is a pretty new area, it is near the airport (excellent for getting to the airport in case there are traffic jams) and getting around is easy with a taxi. Plus points for it being near the Dubai Mall, and Wafi City (where there was Wafi Gourmet and Paul- yum!). Shuttle service was also available to the Jumeriah Beach Park.

Managed to get a discounted rate of 900AED per night under Krisflyer PPS Program (details of promotions can be found on their website). Booking was done over the phone via the Singapore office and confirmations were sent across by email on the same day. Also arranged for airport limousine transfers (100AED each way) via the hotel. After we disembarked and started walking through the Dubai Airport, there were several meet and greet areas with people carrying signboards with guest names. This can be a bit confusing if you have booked for a transfer. We went past two meet and greet groups (who did not have our name) and stepped out of the air-conditioned area and found our hotel representative waiting for us there. It took about 10 minutes for our limousine to arrive as it was apparently stuck in a jam somewhere in the airport carpark. We arrived at the hotel in about 20 minutes and check-in went smoothly. I booked a studio and this was spacious and came with a living area, dining area for two, ironing board, hairdrier, CD player, clock radio, flat screen TV, kitchenette (complete with dishwasher, oven, microwave, toaster, kettle, coffee maker, fridge, pots and pans and crockery). The rooms are nice and new as the hotel only opened a year ago. There was also a complimentary welcome basket in the room which was a nice touch. This consisted of 2 packets of biscuits, instant noodles, milk, cornflakes, some dates and chocolates. Good if you arrive in the middle of the night and want something to eat. ). Mineral water, some soft drinks, coffee and tea sachets are also included. The hotel has a coffee house (called Majalis Caf\u00e9) which looked quite deserted when we arrived that evening (ie. 8pm). I think most guests venture out of the hotel for their meals. However, a complimentary continental breakfast is served there daily and you get a good selection of bread, baked beans, mushrooms, hard boiled eggs, cold cuts, cheese, cornflakes, fresh and dried fruit. If you ask for eggs to order, that will cost extra. You can also order room service from the Majalis Caf\u00e9 and they have a menu in your room. The menu offered quite a wide international selection. There is a complimentary shuttle service available to the airport, Jumeirah Beach and Wafi City several times a day. The hotel reception staff were very helpful, always offering to get us a taxi when they saw us at the lobby. My morning wake-up call went without a hitch. The only downside is the hotel is located a bit far from central Dubai. You cannot walk to any place from there so you would be relying on taxis to get around. Even Hyatt hotel complex is about 5 minutes drive away. In the morning, it took us about 20 minutes (25AED) by taxi to get to the DIFC. In the evening, it took about 1 hour to get from the Emirates Mall back to the hotel (because there was a road accident which slowed traffic down to a crawl). This hotel would be suitable for families and people who are on long-stay arrangements, and the distance from town isn\u2019t that much of an issue since taxis are quite cheap in Dubai. It is also fairly near the airport (about 20 minutes\u2019 drive).", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Park Hotel Apartments", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d622468-Reviews-Park_Hotel_Apartments-Dubai.html", "Price": "$77 - $193*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Oud Metha Road, Adaf Area</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">122161</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "622468", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fc/86/fc8624ec8e12b1eff7e86e0c83a41cc93large.jpg"}}
