I work late into the morning. Went to bed at 5:30am and the housekeeper knocked on our door early even though we had a do not disturb sign posted on the door. I sincerely hope that this is just a case of a poorly trained housekeeper and not a directive from management. Housekeeper did not speak English when I tried to question why she knocked. Otherwise.....I love this place. Free food and beer for dinner. The most amazing breakfast buffet of any of the chain hotels in America. They had fresh fruit aplenty, cans of V8 juice, lots of yogurt types including Activia, Breakfast bars, Eggs, Meat, Waffles, and tons of other stuff much of which is never seen at a hotel free buffet. They also have a large pantry with lots of fairly priced, make that low-priced items. Room was a huge suite with bedroom separate from living area. Two big flat screen TV's with lots of channels. Full kitchen. Nice very large desk and nice chair. Fold-out bed. Plenty of well-lit free parking. Lots of food choices nearby. Too bad that housekeeper cost the hotel a 5 star rating. We'll come back though. Hopefully this review is noted by management and the housekeeping staff is retrained so I can sleep next time.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHome Away From Home\u201d", "Author": "halpin1567", "ReviewID": "UR125809770", "Content": "This is our second stay at the Staybridge.

I immediately asked him to switch me to a non-smoking room with either two beds or one bed + a roll-away or sofa sleeper. He agreed to do it without any trouble, but suggested for future stays to call ahead and ask about the accommodations and pre-arrange the room. The hotel offers free meals in the afternoon midweek, with food and beverages (including beer) free of charge. The room had a full size fridge and microwave, a small stovetop, a toaster oven, etc. I liked how the bathroom was separate from the sink area, although the bathroom was very small. The beds were just okay, but after a big meal and few drinks at Cheeseburger Paradise next door... it was just fine. It was also nice to have the living room separate from the bedroom area. Other amenities of mention: -The hottub was nice, although the jets were pretty week. If you're into lap swimming, you could appreciate the lane built into the swimming pool area. -The fitness center was small, but you get into Lifetime Fitness just down the road free of charge with your room key. -Breakfast was very good. I was able to make breakfast burritos, enjoy some fresh fruit, and make my own waffle... all free of charge. They have plenty of milks, coffees, teas, juices, and fountain drinks available as well. The only hiccup we had was when the fridge woke us up at 8am. It was obviously going out and sounded as if a jack hammer was secretly thrown into it as a cruel prank to wake us up.

My business associate and I have been traveling for work for the past 4 months, staying in hotels every night and will continue to do so until next June. Cons: -We booked a non-smoking two bedroom suite over two months before our stay. We were assured that the request would be fulfilled. We called twice over the past two months to adjust the day of our departure and again asked that we have a non-smoking room... upon checking-in we were given a smoking room that smelled like Satan's ashtray. We asked to be moved but they would not accomodate the request. -We called the front desk and asked that the room be \"ozoned\" on a day that we were out on business. If they did it, it didn't help. There were no signs that any adjustments had been made in the room. Nothing like having luggage that smells like a ciggarette butt. -The wireless internet is HORRIBLE... at least in our room. We spoke to the manager about the problem and he claimed that it was an issue on our computers (we had three computers with us, none of which were able to connect to the internet for the duration of the stay). The manager gave us a tech support phone number, which we called twice. After spending well over two hours with the tech support, we found out that they could not remotely access the wireless routers in the hotel, leading them to believe that the problem wasn't our computers, rather it was the machines in the hotel. One nice worker did reset the routers, which worked for about an hour... and then went down again. It was a total drag... they advertize included high-speed internet...but you can never be sure. -The whole hotel just needs some updating. The wallpaper on our floor was coming apart a tthe seams. Both toilets in our hotel room were broken. Pros: -One of the better hotel breakfasts that we have had in the past couple of months. Not that the food was any better than any other place, but there was an ample supply, and the space was very clean. -The staff, for the most part, is quite nice.

My daughter and I have been in this hotel for 5 days, and it has been a very pleasant experience. My daughter has a life threatening medical condition and we drove from Columbus, Ohio for an (approx 30 day medical treatment at the Community hospital of Indianapolis). I was very nervous about coming to a city (I've never been to before) and having to stay for 30 days. The worry I had was that I would have to rent an apartment (to save on $$$) since it was a month long commitment for the medical procedure. I talked to various people at the hospital, about where we should stay for the month... everyone had a different opinion of where to stay. I researched the local hotels (I wanted one that was close to the hospial and it also had to be easily accessible to the freeway.) Well, I am very happy with the accomodations (studio with stovetop, frig, microwave, toaster, toaster oven along with pots and pans, silverwear, towels, and dishsoap too!) Free parking, free hot breakfasts, 3 free dinners at the hotel per week, free laudry room, free fitness center, free internet/business center with computers, faxes and printers.

The Staybridge Suites in Fishers, Indiana did not cater to my every need and did not fulfill my every desire for hotel lodging and yet I was happy that I stayed there and here are a few of of my reasons. Space: The hotel is big and that means greater comfort. The pool was available and not full of kids every time I wanted a swim. You don't bump into someone every time you turn around and the staff is freed up to assist you should you require it. Comfort: The room is not huge and was not a suite in the traditional sense. It was more like a studio apartment. One room with a kitchenette (full fridge, stove, sink, dishes, dishwasher, microwave, toaster oven...) Great for the person contemplating a longer stay. Small bathtub but good shower head. Nice towels. Queen sized bed which was fine, good linens. The pillows are the worst, and they give you lots of them so one might be tempted to either view this situation as the glass being half empty or half full. Is having lots of bad pillows better than having too few? All I can say is that I learned long ago that if you want to avoid pillow issues, bring your own. The room had a couch and a good desk with plenty of lighting and plugs. Free WiFi. Good WiFi as well. The fixtures in the room were a mish-mash of styles but that was a nice break from the homogenous decor you find in most hotels. It was comfortable, it felt like my own apartment, my own private place of refuge in a place far from home. Nice flat screen television with good selection of cable channels. A DVD player was hooked up to the TV and you can rent DVD's at the business center. Abundant free parking is available. In the courtyard of the hotel are grills.. yes, cooking grills. You can buy some burgers or a steak and cook it up yourself. There is an enclosed outdoor basketball court in the back. The pool was very nice with separate whirlpool and large swim area with lap lane. Clean towels are abundant at the pool and in the room. The room and the hallways were very clean. My major complaint is that smoking rooms are scattered about each floor of the building and if there are smokers checked in, you are likely to get a strong whiff of their presence in the hallway. In many ways it is an unremarkable hotel except for the extremely pleasant staff, the ease of access to all facets of the hotel, the complimentary coffee and beverages.

When I asked how that was possible when we had a reservation guaranteed with a credit card, the woman at the front desk explained that they were overbooked, \"like the airlines\". This is something I have never encountered at any other hotel. I can understand a business' need to maximize profits in a depressed economy, but to do so at the expense of loyal customers (we are Priority Club members) with reservations just seems foolish.

Ultimately we were able to persuade the front desk person to give us a room and we were glad we\u2019d stood our ground! We stayed in a studio suite and we found it perfect for our family of three.

Breakfast is reasonably good with decent selection of food Fully equipped kitchen in each suite Business services, inc internet were not busy and could be easily accessed. Laundry machines were free of charge Unfortunately this was offset by a number of negatives - We booked, and paid for, a king size suite. There is no way it was a king size bed. Reception staff insisted it was, stating maybe it seems small but it's king size. I asked to view another room to confirm but this request was refused, claiming the hotel was full and would be throughout our stay. There was no table and chairs to use for dining in the room. This enquiry was greeted with a suggestion that we sit on the sofa and use the coffee table. Apparently not all rooms have a dining table? - What's the point of a fully equipped kitchen if ou have to sit at the coffee table or the workstation desk? On Saturday and Sunday mornings staff seemed unable to cope with the numbers of people of breakfast. Basic items such as milk were not being replenished quickly. Standard housekeeping is bed making, trash removal and towel replenishment Monday to Friday, any other cleaning such as vacuuming, bathroom cleaning is only done on a weekly basis. Upon check in I was informed that weekend standard housekeeping was by request only. Well at almost $200 per night (presumably loaded due to the race) for the weekend rates I don't expect to make my own bed and do without fresh towels so I requested it. It was also pointed out that this was a holiday weekend. Nevertheless I stuck to my guns and we did receive weekend housekeeping. All in all we were disappointed. It's a decent enough hotel at the standard rate (we paid $116 per night apart from race weekend) however I'm left with a definite feeling that room 429 was not the king size suite we paid for and the staff did nothing to convnce me otherwise.

The suites are on the small side but stocked with tea, coffee, microwave popcorn, crystal stemmed glasses (!), and are quiet. The queen-size bed I had was comfortable, and best of all, the air conditioning/heating worked well, and didn't make a lot of noise. The hotel staff are incredibly friendly & helpful. What I really liked was that they gave me a card with my suite's direct telephone number to hand out if needed. I'd stay at this Staybride again in a minute!", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!\u201d", "Author": "julblaze", "ReviewID": "UR3654171", "Content": "We thought this place was great.

I would have given this property an excellent were it not for the soft, back breaking beds. Rooms were comfortable, although the heat was a bit uneven. Living room fine, bedroom cold. As with most other Staybridge properties, breakfast was above average. Great location, as The Fishers, Carmel area is more upscale than other Indy suburbs in the best part of Indy area. One exit south on I-69 is 82nd St with tons of shopping, including Mall at Keystone Crossing, with Saks and even a Cheesecake Factory. Ask if front desk can call ahead to put you on a waiting list to save time. One exit north to 116th St is downtown Fishers where there is an Original Pancake House. Skip the hotel breakfast one time and treat yourself! Hotel is 25 minutes from Indy airport, and 20 minutes to downtown.

Chose this hotel due to proximity to concert venue (Verizon Wireless Music Center - Noblesville 7 miles) and availability of 2 bedroom suites (we were travelling with another couple). Positives: TV in each room, full size refrigerator, microwave, 2 burner cooktop, 2 bathrooms, free breakfast, happy hour, room size, indoor pool & whirlpool. Negatives: Living area (not bedrooms) smelled funny, probably due to kitchen facilities & related spills, etc or pet policy. One bathroom didn't have a cover on the overhead light. We would recommend this hotel and will stay there again if we're in the area.
