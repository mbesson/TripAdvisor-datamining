We saw the reviews after booking and were terrified about what we would find on arrival. Although it was a 15 min walk from Earls Court tube, it was easy to find and only two mins from Olympia. The hotel was clean and the staff friendly. The room was spotless we even checked for bedbugs after reading previous reviews! It was perfect for a short and cheap stay in central London. The bathroom was beautifully clean and the shower looked brand new. There were three of us in a triple room and it was very small but this is to be expected in a hotel of its size and price. The breakfast room is incredibly cramped and the food simple but again in this location for the price it was adequate. A good value hotel clean and friendly. Please don't be put off by previous reviews as I think major renovations have taken place since they were posted!

You 'll have a continental breakfast in a very claustrophobic tiny room under groudfloor. No windows. Two strange women are stayng in a corner looking at you. They don't speak to you, they don't explain to you. If 2 guests want to help themselves there is no place enough not even to \"follow the queue\". Oh I have to tell you that if you are shorter than 164 cm you need a ladder to pick a cup or a plate up there! Besides as the owners probably thought that 9 square meter are enough to let 18 guest have comfortably their healthy breakfast they had the nice idea to stack some old frames in a corner behind a chair. 7) They write you can pay with credit card but if you don't pay cash they charge you 3% extra. 8) You have to ask for the received of your bill. 9) If you have to make the check in of your airplain and you can't find an internat point forget a help from the clerks!! A very kind hairdresser not far from the hotel very kindly helped me but not the staff. 10) As a conclusion: when you work in a simple hotel with an old structure you have to balance the problems with a warm, good, helpful staff.

We weren't fussed about a grand hotel, just somewhere clean to rest our heads. The hotel's location is alright, it's very near the tube- this is perhaps its only redeeming feature. Firstly we arrived at the hotel to be grunted at by the receptionist. Our room was o.k (at first). the bathroom was ok, mould everywhere. but the beds were clean. we tried to turn the tv on- it didnt work. it was hot so we turned the air con on when mouldy water began dripping down the walls into the tv and the hair dryer below. We ran to the reception as were we worried about the possible hazzards with electricity. The receptionist didn't care what so ever. when asked to speak to a manager she said no. when i asked for his name she shrugged. when i asked how i would dry my hair or plug in my other appliances she shrugged and finally said we could check out if we didn't like it. This was said in a threatening manner and being visitors we knew we would have to stick in this grotty hotel as we didn't know what else to do. She promised a maintainence man would sort it out, when we returned that night the new guy on reception said she had not even filed a complaint and knew nothing about the water pouring down the wall. he promised we would get another room the next day. the same horrid lady rang the next day to say we had another room, we re-packed and came into reception to be told we had to wait two hours for our room. this person was clearly taking the mick, and she was enjoying it! we left our cases and had a fun day in london and returned to a new room which was two singles instead of a double, the view from the window was what looked like a piece of opaque plastic! the air con in the room dripped not inside our room but on the outside instead! There was towels on the floor outside from all the water, which is very dangerous and worried us quite abit. we could not wait to leave. Our stay wouldn't have been so bloody awful had the receptionist said sorry, shown some sign of compassion or empathy for her fellow man! If someone inspected this hotel i have no doubt that it would get shut down. not safe at all. as we left we saw some other people complaining in the reception. they probably were put in our old room. no, actually i think all the rooms were no doubt just as hideous as ours. what a romance killer! never again.", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "bracknell", "Title": "\u201cCheap but not cheerful\u201d", "Author": "PURPLECOUPLE", "ReviewID": "UR34750446", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel because it is near Hammersmith Apollo.

I booked directly with the hotel and got a double room for \u00a370 per night including cooked breakfast. The hotel is very clean and comfortable and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. I cannot believe the review posted in December that the staff did not speak english - their english is perfect and most of them have been working at the hotel for several years. Many of the other guests were repeat visitors. The rooms are very well equipped and comfortable. Mini bar/fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, free WIFI access, an electric fan, toiletries and ample towels, Iron and ironing board, trouser press and everything you would expect in a top london hotel. The only negative thing I would say about the hotel is the size of the bedrooms, which is why I have not given this hotel an excellent rating. I asked for a room over looking the garden and was given one. However it was very small for a double room for two people and as there were two of us I asked if we could have a larger room. We were given one on the front of the hotel, (it really wasn't that noisy as we only slept there) The room was bigger than the garden room but the rooms at this hotel are small with one side of the bed up against the wall. However as before it was very clean and comfortable and the free WIFI and facilities in the room were excellent. The showers in both the rooms we stayed in were really powerful Grohe showers which was great. While checking out I did notice they have a suite for \u00a3125 per night which the lovely girl on reception said was much bigger than the bedrooms. Breakfast was cooked to order and there was a selection of cereals, fruit juice and fruit salad. The location is superb, just round the corner from Olympia and walking distance to Kensington High Street which has some good restaurants. I would recomment this hotel for value for money and location. It is charming and cosy and very clean. Last year I stayed at the Kensington Hilton, which is just up the road and had the most dreadful room with furniture falling apart and a leaking ceiling. It cost over double what I paid at Holland Court. I think you would be hard pushed to find a hotel in central london that offers all the facilities and service this hotel does for \u00a370 per room per night bed and breakfast.
