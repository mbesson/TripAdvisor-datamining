But for the prices being charged you can, I am sure, find much nicer accommodation in Istanbul. The one thing readers need to be aware of is the location - the Green Park Bostanci is in, well, Bostanci. In visitor or tourist terms this is the middle of nowhere. Don't look at a map and think that you can get in and out of the city centre in minutes - Istanbul is a big city and the traffic is pretty horrendous. Though there are places to eat and shop within a fifteen minute taxi ride, and there is a taxi rank right outside the front door, the area round the hotel itself is a real wasteland in food, drink, shopping and entertainment terms.

There is almost nothing entertaining to do on this side of town, and absolutely nothing worthwhile a short walk from this hotel. It's billed as a 5-star place, and maybe it was 10 years ago but it is getting a little run down now. The lobby and public areas are quite nice, but several aspects of my room were worn out. For example, there is a decorative metal stripe inlay on the headboard that was peeling away at one end. The veneer on the desk was peeling in a couple of places. The bathroom ceiling was peeling in the corner and the tub desperately needed re-caulking. It was absolutely clean and well-kept, but 5-star it is not. On the plus side, I have to say that the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've used in years and their buffet breakfast was truly fantastic. The service was great all around, all employees were extremely helpful. Most spoke decent English, which was great because I speak no Turkish.

Before leaving i have checked out this and other web sites, and was aware that the hotel was in a very middle-of-the road area, surrounded by the car repair shops and mosks, which broadcast calls to prayer at the wee hours of the morning on their loudspeakers. I did not think this was going to be an issue for me, and was correct in that regard. While I would have preferred to stay in a more touristy area with more nightlife, I was more concerned about staying close to work, and felt that this hotel would be a good compromise. As it turned out, one of the reasons my customers chose this hotel is because it allows alcohol (and there is a mini-bar in the room, as well as regular bars in the hotel), unlike some other hotels here, where owners, due to strict religious beliefs, do not allow alcohol on the property. Needless to say, my first impression of the hotel was very favorable - it is situated on a rather large property (for Istanbul), and has a decorative fense, and a gate at the entrance to the private driveway, complete with the guard. As this is my first time in istanbul, I was quite concerned about security, and this was reassuring. The front entrance is a nice rotating door, and the downstairs lobby is also clean and expensive-looking, with its marble decor. The front desk staff and the bellboy were very helpful. attentive, and friendly. However, from that point on, my impressions went downhill. As another review indicates, the \"Green Park\" likely reflects environmentalist aspirations of its owners. To that end, the hallway lighting supposed to be motion-sensitive - it normally stays off, until someone is moving in the hallway, at which time the motion detectors turn it on. While it sounds good on paper, the slow-acting motion sensors are combined with the fluorescent lights. As an electrical engineer, I know that fluorescent lights perform poorly in the applications that require them to frequently turn on and off, rather than stay on for prolonged periods of time, so it makes me wonder if environmentally this does more harm than good, having to dispose of mercury-filled bulbs. But I digress. The real problem is that the lights and detectors work so slowly that by the time the light starts flickering (as it heats up to turn on), you have already passed it. In addition, the rooms have a key-card holder slot by the front door, which requires you to insert the card in for the room lights to come on. I have trouble fitting the card into this slot, especially since once I reach my door and stop moving, the hallway lights turn off, so there is darkness both behind and in front of me. OK, I am not particularly afraid of the dark, but even to me it is extremely annoying. The room is rather large and is decorated nicely, at least visually. There is a wardrobe by the entrance, where you can hang up your stuff on hangers with non-removable hooks (I hate being treated like a criminal). However, unless your suitcase is very small, you can leave it either on the floor, or on top of a low dresser-trunk at the far end of the room - not very well thought out. The room has a narrow work surface, an armchair, a small round table and an upholsered chair. There is also a mini-fridge, with an LCd TV on top, and a bed. Having arrived late at night, and having to go to work the next day, I have given my attention to the bed first. It is covered with soft white linens (a bed-sheet and a comforter, and in addition to the two synthetic pillows, it has three more decorative pillows and a matching runner. While it looks nice, you have to remove the pillows and the runner from the bed to sleep in it. Herein lies the problem - there is no place to put them on, except on the floor. Of course, the next day housekeepers place them back onto the bed, which makes me wonder about the hygienics of this setup. Before falling asleep I wanted to plug in my computer - the front desk staff have given me a power adaptor; however, it fwas designed to adapt from the British three prong system, rather than from the american one. There is only one british-type receptacle in the room, by the desk, rather than by the bed, so if you, like me need to plug anything ini by the bed, you are out of luck. There are some european-type receptacles by the bed, but you will need to get your own adapter (next day). Still, this was a minor problem. The bathroom is relatively small, especially matched to a room this size, but adequate for a single person. Two people would have trouble maneuvering around each other. The low-flow shower head is OK, and gives adequate amout of water. The shower-bath tub has a sliding glass door, and it feels rather narrow, although when I look at it it seems to be standard width. The towels are thick and soft. Next day I came down for breakfast, which was included with the room rate (this is a fairly standard practice in these parts of the world), and was impressed by the spread. There was about a dozen kinds of cheezes, fresh cucumbers and tomatoes (both with the skin removed), a dozen types of pastries, smoked salmon slices, desserts, cereals, as well as a number of chafing dishes with various hot items (such as grilled halloumi (hellum, as they call it) cheeze, in addition to the omlette station. Over the next days I came to appreciate this breakfast even more. However, the staff, while generally friendly, sometimes seemed a bit overwhelmed, and on a couple of occasions ignored/disregarded/forgot about my repeated requests for a coffee - no big deal, I can pour my own coffe, but this is not a 5-star service. Next evening, after work I decided to check out the TV. While it has probably 2 dozen channels, most of them are in Turkish (understandably so). In addition, there are several German channels, a french, italian, greek channel. There is only one English language channel, and this is the deplorable BBC News. This is very surprising in a hotel geared for business. There is also a Russian-language channel, but it did not work - kept showing garbled video (although it was working in other areas of the hotel). There are also pay-per-view movies, but they are very expensive (around E20 each, or $26 USD). I would not spend this much money on a movie in a theater, let alone on a diminutive TV screen, and besides, I make it a practice not to watch hotel movies while on business- this avoids having the boss ask you suspicious questions, and the colleagues snickering, about the nature of the movies. This is also the case wtih all of my colleagues who travel on business, so I don't know of anyone who considers the overpriced moves a viable form of in-room entertainment. So I turn to Internet - the hotel does advertise wireless internet. Indeed there is a service; however, it is very weak (the bars are showing red) and expensive - E11 (nearly $15) a day, a little cheaper if you pay for a week at a time. In addition, like most elsewhere in Turkey. the connection is slow (no more than 15 KB per second), and it is filtered. You can not access any web sites of questionable moral stature, including YouTube, due to government-mandated filtering, and besides, location awareness prevents you from getting to your favorite US network sites (such as USAnetwork.com, which has full episodes of its various shows).On the positive side, I was able to make a VPN connection to my company's servers, albeit a very slow one. For all its good looks, the bed is extremely hard - I wonder if there are any springs in it. While the mattress does not feel lumpy, it has very little padding, and after the tiredness of the trans-atlantic flight wore out, I started having trouble sleeping on it. Also of note, the upholstered chair looks expensive, but its seat cushion has no support. So when you sit down on it, all you feel is the wood at the front edge of the chair - this ranges from uncomfortable to painful, after even a short time. The first few nights sleeping was OK - the room has funky windows that open two ways - either the top end swings in, or the entire window opens swinging to the side. The weather was cool, and the open windows did the trick, despite the prayer calls from the mosks, and the soccer games that some excited youths were paying just under my windows (I don't know if this field is a part of the hotel complex or not, but there is a lot of noise). There is also loud music playing outside, and occasional sirens blaring (there is a big hospital across the street). But all of the above are relatively minor peeves, compared to what followed. As the days (and nights) warmed up, the nights became more and more uncomfortable. It turns out that even though there was a thermostat in the room, adjusting it has practically no effect on the room environment. It looks that either due to their environmental zeal, or in an attempt to save money (I think \"Green Park\" has some meaning here, too), they put in an inadquate air conditioning system into the hotel. So when I had talked to the front desk, they spread their arms and apologetically said, \"we know, but we have a central system... Perhaps it will work better tonight\". I don't think I will be taking a chance to find out - I am checking out tomorrow, to move to a different hotel. Indeed, all the service of the staff means nothing if the visitors are uncomfratable ini the inadequate facility. Based on my experience, I would not recommend it, particularly in the warm seasons (probably may to October around here).", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "FranWilson", "Title": "\u201cdepends what you want\u201d", "Author": "FranWilson", "ReviewID": "UR27455314", "Content": "This hotel had some great facilities.
