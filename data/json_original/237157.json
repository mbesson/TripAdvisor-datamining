The hotel is situated in a little street just off las Ramblas and easy walking distance from Placa de Catalunya.We got the aerobus from Barcelona airport to Placa de Catalunya 5.20\u20ac each and walked down Las Ramblas- good fun in itself- enjoy the living statues! I had prebooked this hotel 7 months in advance as a surprise 60th birthday present for my husband. After trawling through many reviews for hotels in the area - I was totally hooked on the idea of this hotel with a view over the amazing Palau Guell. I emailed the hotel and told them about my plan and Monica was exceptionally helpful - not only did we have a room with a view of Palau Guell but we were on floor 5 with a balcony with two chairs, sun lounger and table. The hotel even greeted us with a bottle of fizz to celebrate my husband's birthday. The room - although not huge- was absolutely fine , very clean- with french windows out onto the balcony - there were also slatted shutters which kept the room cool and secure. We had no problem with any noice from the street but I assume that is because we were on floor five and the balcony pushes the room back from the road. The breakfast was fine - the usual selection of pastries, fruit, cheese, meat, scrambled eggs, 3 different cereals, yoghurts, bread rolls, bread for toast, a juice machine with two different juices, hot drinks machine etc- but of course you may still want to venture out onto Las Ramblas. My only issue is the lack of tea/coffee macking facilities and the lack of a fridge- which must be annoying in the height of summer. However the hotel has a small cafe where you can get snacks and drinks until quite late - there is also a vending machine for water and drinks on the restaurant floor. But anyway Barcelona is a city which carries on until very late - we had no problem getting a meal at nearly 11pm. The hotel is in an excellent location for exploring the Barri Gotic,Port Vell, the Cathedral and it was easy to pick up both of the tourist buses. Loads of nice little restaurants/ bars/ shops etc nearby. Enjoy an evening wathcing the world go by in Placa Reial- just the other side of Las Ramblas Palau Guell is well worth a visit- but the view over the ornate chimneys is wonderful. This is a great hotel for the price, very clean and in a great location. We found the staff very friendly and helpful - Monica especially brilliant- she always replied to my emails. We had an early evening flight back to the Uk but were able to leave our cases in a secure space at the hotel and also used the hotel public areas until we returned to the airport.

We booked because of the location and the good price offered by the hotel's website for our late-January stay. We were initially given a standard double room with a small balcony looking across to Palau Guell. We had two main problems with this room -- firstly, though deemed \"non-smoking\" it reeked of smoke, and secondly, we found the noise in the street below to be very irritating when trying to sleep (people were yelling and smashing bottles at 3am, and the noise really bounces around the narrow street). When we complained about these things, the staff was very kind and accommodating and switched us to a room with two twin beds pushed together and a balcony off the back of the hotel. Funnily, this room had a sign saying \"smoking permitted,\" as well as an ashtray, but it didn't smell of smoke at all. It was very quiet at night, which made us happy -- we'd rather have quiet than a fancy view. Breakfast was included in our stay, and while it was plentiful, we didn't enjoy it so much: as others have pointed out, the coffee, juice, bread, etc. are not of great quality. We did not try the hot foods on offer (eggs and such), but my husband liked the pastries. There are a few things that bothered me and would make me not return: towels that smelled very strongly of bleach, beds that are extremely firm (though some may enjoy this), pillows that are uncomfortably high, bathrooms that ventilate steam not with fans but with a little window opening onto a strange, dark shaft. Overall, the things that recommend this hotel are its kind staff and its good location.

The location allows you to basically walk any where. We did the sightseeing tour the first day and then explored by foot and bikes. We walked to many places, even to Sargada (that one i did by myself!). We walked to the Pier and rented bikes and explored the beach area. We walked to the acquariium and the whole pier.

The hall is very nice and has elegancy; not many people, a computer with free internet access, and the staff is friendly enough most of the times. My room was not very big, there was basically just a bed and no more space, but the bathroom was much bigger than i expected, and everything was very, very clean and with no smells. The breakfast is not very fancy, but basically there was all i needed - 2-3 types of meats, some cheese, eggs with bacon, toast, and some more stuff. Not a gourmet restaurant, but just what you need to get full before a long day. The sleep quality for me was perfect, because my window faced the inner yard. But i must say that the walls are thin, and you hear a lot of what your neighbours are doing.

We were so busy enjoying Barcelona that we didn't take time to explore the fitness facilities. The location is perfect - just off Las Ramblas, on the much quieter Nou de la Rambla. We were not bothered by any kind of street noise, but were within steps of the busy main tourist area, a few blocks from the metro station where we caught a train to the Sagrada Familia and the funicular to Montjuic, and about a fifteen minute stroll from the Barri Gotic in one direction and the Placa Catalunya in the other direction. Having read a lot about the pickpockets and street thieves of Barcelona, we carried our passports under our clothes, and locked our handbags with carabiners.

We visited lots of tourists attractions quite easily as after a short 5 minutes stroll to the Christopher Colombus Statue, all the Bus Touristics Hop on Hop off are there. They were brilliant, very convenient and stopped at all the major attractions. You can buy the Bus Touristic Packs at the hotel lobby where you will get a discount as well. There are also lots to see when you are just walking around each district, Hotel Gaudi is right in the middle of everything. There is an ATM machine just accross from the hotel just in case you need cash and lots of tiny supermarkets opened late at night next door to the hotel just in case you get the munchies.

Everything was very good in the room, large flat screen tv, powerful shower, large clothes presses, safe, air conditioning which you could set yourself. comfortable bed.

Room was cleaned everyday and sparkled, Buffet breakfast was very good, it opened from 7.30am until 11am with a large selection of hot and cold food, perfect to set you up for a day's walking around. There is a large \"living room\" beside the restaurant for people to meet and natter and watch football matches on the giant screen.

I booked a stay for myself and two other family members as part of a surprise Christmas present and I have never been more disappointed in a Hotel or its Staff before. When we checked in on Wednesday 16th January we were told that the Hotel had charged us for the first night of our stay the previous day to ensure that our Visa worked, I was asked to sign payment for the first night prior to seeing the room that the Hotel had allocated to us. When I was booking the Hotel I had added in the comments box that we would like \"a room with a view\" if possible - little did I know what I was in for!!The porter brought us up to the 6th floor of the Hotel and into 1 of 2 rooms on this, the top floor. When we entered I was so shocked, firstly one of the beds had not been made so he proceeded to make the bed infront of us, secondly, the heater for the air conditioning wasn't working in the room so a maintenance guy from the Hotel came into the room and proceeded to flick switches on a remote control. The room was not what was shown on the Hotel's website, I know sometimes this happens but this room was like a shack - freezing cold and no hot running water!When we complained the concierge did not want to know, he was very rude and told us he didn't have any spare rooms. We asked for a plug in radiator but were told that there were none available - we ended up sleeping in several layers of clothes in the damp beds and were cold through to our bones the next morning. We went down to reception the following morning and after the porter coming to our room and flicking the switches on the air conditioning and agreeing it was broken we were moved to a brilliant room on the 2nd floor - it was warm with hot water with better beds, we arranged to meet the manager of the hotel the next day to discuss what had happened and to be compensated for the horrible and upsetting start to our holiday. When we met the Manager he told us that because we had asked for the \"room with a view\" that basically this is what we could expect - when we replied that there was no hot water or heat in the room he told us the only thing he could do for us would be to organise to send a basket of fruit and bottle of wine/cava to our room - we told him this wasn't good enough but he insisted this was all he could do!Later the fruit was delievered to the room but we refused it (we had seen a basket of fruit being delievered to a room the previous day & we were told by one of the members of staff that a couple had complained a few days previously and that they had been offered the fruit and wine and had been happy with this - it must be a regular occurrence!!)Basically the staff and hotel were awful and although we really enjoyed our 1st trip to Barcelona I would urge you to stay somewhere with professional and helpful staff. We ended up getting a small reduction on our bill for the 1st night - but after having paid over 200 euro for our 1st night and being mistreated as we were a pathetic 25% off didn't go anyway near making up for their inefficiency.

People in the adjacent rooms sounded like they were in our bathroom, the flushing of others' toilets seemed inordinately loud, just the scrape of a chair in the room above was like nails scraping down a blackboard. Listening to other people lovemaking is quite funny the first time, but is a pain when you are trying to sleep.

Just off Las Ramblas 5 mins walk from the harbour, 15 mins to the beach, close to the metro and most of the 'must do' tourist spots within easy walking distance. Our room was spotlessly clean, with excellent bathroom facilities. The staff were friendly and we really appreciated the bottle of Cava left in our room by the management when they found out it was our 25th wedding anniversary.

I booked the hotel over the net so I wasn't quite sure that it would be ok? We were pleasently surprised, we were booked in quickly with a smile, our luggage was taken straight to our room. Also the receptionist gave us discount vouchers for meals in the city. We had booked a quad room and had asked for the room to be high with a view. Sadly the room wasn't with a front view we were at the rear. But having said that the room was very large, very clean and the beds were nicely made up. We had a balcony that over looked the police station and the roof tops of Barcelona. I have booked to go back to Barcelona but at another hotel. Not because we didn't like this one, but because I found a better standard hotel at at a better price, just off the Ramblas. But I would have no hessitation in going back to this hotel again if the was the price was right.", "Date": "August 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands, England", "Title": "\u201cgreat location..give it a try\u201d", "Author": "Crewy", "ReviewID": "UR3723306", "Content": "It was our first time in Barcelona, so we wanted somewhere close to the attractions. The hotel, although in a back street, certainly was close to the attractions..about 50 metres from La Rambla, but far enough away not to hear the late night goings on.

Harbour pleasant, La Rambla vibrant (watch out for pick pockets and ball/cup scams), must eat in the Hard rock cafe, cable cars scary (very high), boat trip along the coast a bit dull, must see Sagrada Familia..althogh it's a building site, Parc Gaudi wonderful, the beach is a good 30 minute walk from La Rambla.
