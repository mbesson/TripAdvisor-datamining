I was with my fianc\u00e9 and we gave the car to the valet guy once we arrived. Tea lasted for like two hours. When another valet guy drove our car out, we could clearly see a white scratch close to the door handle on the driver side. And there is some polish on top of the scratch. Even the valet guy said that someone was trying to buffer off the scratch. We waited for the manager to solve the problem but then after a while the receptionist told us that they have no manager on duty at the time. I mean what kind of hotel would have no manager on duty in the middle of the day! The next day, the manager called us and said their security camera didn't capture anything came into contact with our car so they can't do anything.

I love the \"Russian Tea Room\" -- red walls, gilt framed photographs of Nicholas II and his family, beautiful china -- although I did not get a chance to take afternoon tea there. The location for high end shopping could not be better -- Escada is across the street, Holt Renfrew a block or two away. Two small criticisms-- the the breakfast buffet was in a dark room, and I felt the waiters were much more attentive to middle-aged male guests in suits, than to this middle-aged woman guest in jeans. And on leaving, the bellhop and manager summonsed a cab to take me to the airport. There was a \"transaction\" between the taxi driver and the manager -- which I subsequently learned from the taxi driver was the hotel bellhop demanding a $5 kickback for the fare to the airport.

I stayed in the Toronto Four Seasons when it opened as the Hyatt, the current Hilton when it opened as the Hotel Toronto and prior to it becoming the Westin, and even the Westbury when it opened.

We have never had a better hotel experience, and we have each been staying in hotels for a long, long time. Location: The hotel is on a quiet street which nonetheless is just a block from the the shopping bustle of Bloor Street. Room: On arrival we were told we would have a complimentary upgrade to a suite. Our suite was very quiet, very comfortable and enabled us to entertain family in some style the day following our wedding. Our bed was extremely comfortable, with wonderful linens, though we thought the pillows a bit hard. There was a music system through all the rooms. The bathroom was spa-like, with a quiet whirlpool tub and a very good shower. (Unaccountably, the toilet flush was alarmingly loud, more like an airplane unit than anything you would find on the ground.) The living room was very comfortably furnished and attractively laid out. (The mini-bar not so good: very small and no ice-presumably most of the punters would use the butler service, of which more anon). One really thrilling feature to us was that the windows all opened a few inches. Very pleasant during warm September days and nights. Parking: The only parking is valet parking, and except for one mix-up it was always quick and convenient. There are unlimited in-and-out privileges. If valet is too steep for your taste, there are several public lots and garages near-by. Staff: The staff were cheerful, courteous and unerringly professional. There is an astonishing butler service at the hotel. On our arrival, the butler took us up and showed us in detail what our room had, how things worked, and he told us what services were available. Tell the front desk what papers you want, and if they don't have them, they will go out and get them for you in the morning. Every afternoon, a plate of bed-time biscuits is delivered to the butler's pantry in your room. Shoes are polished, glasses delivered, your room is left alone until you want it cleaned, then it's done promptly and well: it's all there. Our stay included a breakfast on the premises, simple but excellent. When my wife couldn't find just the yogurt she wanted, they made sure it was available the next day without being asked to.

Here is where the hotel fell flat: 1. Our suite was worn and dirty (and, yes, after a few days we complained to management whose remedy was to send the housekeeping supervisor and a cheap bottle of wine to our room): Much of the furniture had ring marks on it, certain items hadn't been dusted in months, the curtains didn't hang correctly (my partner fixed them himself finally), the sofa smelled like urine. . . 2. The bedding was nothing special: most hotels now have pillow tops and luxurious bedding. The Windsor Arms bed had no padding. We called to ask if they had anything and all they had was a foam top, which helped somewhat but not much. 3. Service in all aspects of the hotel was inconsistent: The housekeeper would sometimes leave a certain number of towels, sometimes not; sometimes there would be slippers and the customary mat by the bed at turn-down sometimes not. Sometimes they would replace dirty drinking glasses, sometimes not. 4. The restaurant is pretty subpar (only ate breakfast and lunch there) and, as another reviewer alludes to, there is this server that they must have hired from diner in the middle of the country.

Kevin and Olevia at concierge have consistently taken care of all my needs. I can tell you the lobby is quiet small, so with functions going on they may appear over crowded but it is all part of this place's old school charm. The rooms itself are furnished beautifully. Some are now equipped with LCD TVs and I think they should do away with the tube TVs in other rooms. Panasonic Tao might have been a big hit 7 years ago but getting rid of the bulky TV replacing it with flat TV will go a long way in keeping the hotel's luxury status.

The rooms are large, if a bit conservative (they would have been cutting edge 80 years ago when art deco was just emerging). The bathroom was very nice, but again, it left me feeling a bit cold. The overall feeling is of a hotel that was embalmed. The cause of this may be that they are stretching to make the hotel fee older than it is. The reality is that the original Windsor Arms was torn down: this is a copy of the original except for one fireplace that was retained. They talk about entering through \"our century old portals\" which are really about 10 years old. This effort leads to some laughably cheesy moments: the elevators are done up as a library. But of course there is not any room for books. Instead, they have cut the spines off of a bunch of old books and glued them to the walls. They then covered the spines with glass doors and locked them (to keep us for stealing the spines no doubt). Beyond this, I had the feeling that they see their guests as resources to be mined for every possible dollar. Regardless of how much money one has, no one wants to feel this way. As an example, I called down and asked for two wine glasses to be brought to the room. When I checked out, I noticed that I had been charged $9.32 plus tax for this honour. I was outraged. I stay in luxury hotels all the time, and I have never been charged for the use of a glass. I expressed my indignation politely to the front desk staff and he simply looked at me, without saying a word. I waited for a few seconds, expecting something. When I realized that he was just going to stand there and look at me, I signed the invoice. I now regret this decision. I should have taken a stand against this petty exploitation. I would far rather stay in the four seasons, Hyatt or the Germain (a truly innovative hotel experience).", "Date": "November 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cThey don't make ear plugs big enough\u201d", "Author": "hr2011London", "ReviewID": "UR3914823", "Content": "Needs to decide whether it is a luxury hotel or a night club.
