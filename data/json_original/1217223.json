We spent 3 beautiful days/nights being spoiled by a beautiful welcoming italian family B&B. The day always began with a large italian breakfast with real strong coffee warm croissant juice and more. The best part was to be served in the privacy of our room. From our window we could see over the Piazza (square) which was a good indication of its central location. In fact the La casa del Capitano is located in mitten of the OLD ROMA, minutes away from the superb TREVI Fountain or Lista di Spagna the spanish stairs Colosseum, and much more, all of which in short walking distance. The price was in actual fact a bargain considering that elsewhere we were offered to pay over 300 euro for a smaller room outside the centre of Rome. Fortunately after finding La Casa del capitano we were offered a much less fee which in my opinion was a true bargain as every aspect of our vacation exceeded our expectation especially the B&B and it's service, quality of the rooms , hygiene , cleanliness, breakfast and friendly staff. And the highlight was receiving breakfast in our room where my daughter was free to eat as she pleased while we were enjoying the view over the room windows of Rome waking up. And as a frequent traveller i have not hesitated at all to vote La casa del Capitano with a well deserved 5 star as i find it also very accommodating for family and couples as all rooms are very spacious and accommodating with their own bathrooms.....if you wish more details about it please feel free to write to me on drstiore@gmail.com. And after wonderful 3 days visit, we left Rome with our car where we parked in a safe garage located just 3 minutes away from the Casa del Capitano...", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. John's, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat accommodation for a good price\u201d", "Author": "sandi451", "ReviewID": "UR118798009", "Content": "When in Rome 2 out of 3 couples travelling together had the pleasure of staying in this accommodation for one night...they paid a little more but it was well worth it...the location, condition of the rooms and the pleasing hosts made it a very pleasant stay - no hesitation in recommending this place to other....we stayed on a weekend late Sept and there were no issues with noise outside at that time....there is a restaurant/pub \"Peppy's\" across the street but this did not disturb our sleep.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cAmazing B&B right in the heart of Rome\u201d", "Author": "V0lta", "ReviewID": "UR116747947", "Content": "Great place to stay, at piazza Barberini, one step from metro station, two metro stops from Termini railway station. Great hosts, great Italian breakfasts (I'm used to other type of breakfast, but for Italy these are very nice, with hot buns, croissants, jams, mousses, coffee/tea, juice, etc) served right in your room, very beautiful rooms. We had even two rooms actually - sleeping room and a sitting room with a table and a sofa. Only two faults that are not to blame on hosts. First - no elevator and it's 2nd (or 3d) floor. For us, young travellers - ok, but for somebody else it can be a problem. Second and the major one - very noisy street down there, and windows are old, so all the noise gets inside. Ok for a short stand or if you are sleeping very tightly. Exept two things mentioned, fantastic B&B and the location is unbeatable!", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "paris", "Title": "\u201cCharming, authentique, and perfect location\u201d", "Author": "z0hra", "ReviewID": "UR109796245", "Content": "Very pleasant place, perfectly located (5 min. from the Trevi fontana, Piaza Espagna...) to visit Roma by foot and to go out by night.
