Lots of stairs involved so if you're not happy about taking your luggage this way, look at alternatives. Wife & I with our 23 yr old daughter in a triple room (2 rooms, double bed & single bed) on the top (2nd) floor with a little balcony in both rooms overlooking the court yard and very sheltered. It was winter but we had the window open for fresh air and it wasn't too cold. As many others before me have stated the staff are excellent, its very clean, on the small side and only stairs up/down.

The exterior of the hotel is really charming and the reception was great (in English as well). The room itself (no. 111) is not large, but it fits a twinbed perfectly.

Fantastic location, a metro, a bus station, and an RER within 2 minuites walk. Walking distance to arc de triumph and champs elysses, but when we didnt want to walk, the 92 bus ran every 10/15 mins to the arc de triumph which was very handy. Most tourist attractions are accessiable from the RER (Pereire-Levallois, Line C) and Metro stations (Porte De Champerret, line 3) without having to make several changes. The hotel had a many resturaunts, a mcdonalds, a subway, a kebab shop, numerous bakerys, supermarkets, pharmacies, wine bars etc within 5 mins walk, which was handy after a busy day out when we wanted to grab some food on the way home. Bakerys were fantastic, bought breakfast, lunch and a drink each morning, and didnt manage to spend more than 4 euros!! The hotel was clean, beds made up, bins emptied, room tidied on a daily basis. The room wasn't huge, but there was ample space for three people in the triple room. Bathroom with bath and shower was clean. Television with English Chanels and free wi-fi in all rooms. Flower box on window, made lovely view! The staff at the hotel were extremley friendly, and gave lots of information on how to get around Paris, the best ways to get to attractions. All receptionists spoke English and were very helpful, and staff even left the hotel to help us find a shop that was open at midnight on a sunday. Couldnt have asked for better!

We liked everything: the cozy room for 3, the windows of the room went out to the small yard so it was calm to sleep and have a rest, the breakfast every morning, good atmosphere, polite and welcoming staff. The hotel is about 20 min. walk from the Arc de Triompe and the metro station is very near the hotel. Near the hotel we found some nice restaurants to have a meal so we were totally satisfied. I already recommended this hotel to my collegue...a great value for money and nice experience!", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kilkenny, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cexcellent-moreso if you are flying into Beauvais\u201d", "Author": "hmm_messiah", "ReviewID": "UR20623576", "Content": "3 in our group, inc. 70 yr old granny. We walked to the hotel after arriving at Porte Maillot from Beauvais with Ryanair. lovely clean rooms, window boxes etc. Granny thanked me often for booking her a lovely room. We did not bother with hotel breakfast , pastry shop, cafes just few metres away, as were some brasseries and restaurants. We arrived near 11pm and ate maybe 20 metres from the hotel. Same night we also walked from hotel to the Arc de Triomphe. Very very convenient location, so close to the bus drop off from the airport. and a matter of footsteps to a Metro stop. The staircase might be difficult for some one not very mobile otherwise I would highly highly recommend. They also accommodated us when we required an extra night due to difficulties with schedules .", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "twotwo", "ReviewID": "UR15694246", "Content": "We have just returned from a wonderful two night stay in Paris where we stayed at the Champerret Helipolis. We found this hotel to be a clean,friendly and cheap little hotel in a great location. The room cost 76 Euro per night and was a good size. Consisting of a large comfortable double and a single bed. The bathroom was modern and clean and the flat screen TV was an unexpected extra. There was plently of soft white towels for your use and shower gel etc provided. The room was cleaned daily and cleaning staff as well as reception staff were very friendly. The hotel has a buzzer system and we were always allowed access promptly . There is a small outside terrace area that looked very nice and a selection of magazines and leaflets were at the reception for your use. The area is also very good and it was great to leave the bustle of central Paris to come to the area which had plenty of nice bars,cafes and restaurants.We did not use the hotel breakfast but ate at one of the local cafes or got some pastries from the shop virtually next door. The Metro is also right out side so its very handly for everywhere. Its also an easy and pleasant walk to the Arc de triomphe. I wouls also recommed this hotel if you arrive on the Beauvais airport bus as it is an easy 10 min walk fro the bus terminal. All in all a great little hotel I can highly recommend and I will certainly be using it on any future trips to Paris. The bin men did come early -around 0630 at the weekends but hey its Paris whats more beautiful than getting up early and going seeing the sights before the crowds. You can sleep when you get home..", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Champerret Heliopolis", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d529905-Reviews-Hotel_Champerret_Heliopolis-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$96 - $156*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">13 rue d'Heliopolis</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">17th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "529905", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/88/fb/88fb1e334ecefcee0d89f8e267c55df43large.jpg"}}
