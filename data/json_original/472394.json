Except, a delayed wake up call on the first day nothing bad happened If allowed, I would make a suggestion for the breakfast time \"please, inform your guests that you are going to take away the products of the buffet 5 minutes before you do that\". A gentleman from the kitchen, started taking aways quickly products on time but then he had to stop because some people who were sitting already in therestaurant start getting additional things fromt the buffet quickly. Talking about the breakfast, we didn't enjoy it at all. Even if there was a great variety of products, most of them didn't taste good (but this is related of cource, with our personal food habits). We thank Mr Veyse (in the spa area) who was very friendly and professional. We cannot say the same thing for the other lady who seems totally unexperienced. What is more, the spa area was a cozy and clean place but there was some mold on the ceiling. Moreover, some people, would prefer a relaxing music instead of other songs in the spa. If possible, transfer the phone line in the reception desk when spa employees have treatments and are busy with your guests. I could stay again in the hotel or suggest it to friends but I wil not choose it next time because there are too many hotels in the area and i will look for a real 4* hotel.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dammam, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201chotel is terrible\u201d", "Author": "abulaila", "ReviewID": "UR82718141", "Content": "seminal hotel is not a 4 star hotel, i would rate it as a 2 star hotel. there is an ongoing constructions all around the hotel which cause a horrible noise in a degree we couldnt sleep well. the AC is not working in a proper way and after it was fixed they changed it into heat without informing us and when we called them they claimed its winter time although the atmosphere inside the hotel was almost warm and we couldnt open the window because of the constructions and street noise in addition they didnt give us the room as we requested (double standard room) instead the room was with three single beds (like twin rooms) the front desk staff were rude to us there was no non smoking rooms the room next to us was full of smokers filling the whole corridor and our room with smoke. generally it was a bad experience, wrong choice ans it was thw worst hotel i have ever been in. you could find better hotels in the same area with better prices", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cAcceptable but not 4 stars\u201d", "Author": "Lorca16", "ReviewID": "UR77302646", "Content": "A hotel which does not accomplish western european standards of 4 stars.

There was not even a tray for the hand soap whitch we were oblidged to leave on its packing paper every time we used it. The towels were of poor quality also. The carpet inside the room had several stains on it and the A/C did not work so we had to open the window and let not only the fuss but also the dust and the insects inside!

Not surprisingly, all these elements were present in this hotel. When we got up in our room we almost threw out as it was disquisting - the hotel did not clean the room and toilet (water was not even flashed). We had to wait in the room for over one hour (after 6 hours flights and transfer from the airport) while the cleaning man was doing the room before we could even unpack and take shower. We also saw the dirtiest and most terrible dining room where we refused to eat and had our breakfast in small cafes dotted around Taksim square.
