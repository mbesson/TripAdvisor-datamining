It is across the street from the Alameda, Mexico City's Central Park, and adjacent to Bellas Artes, places of culture and history. All within walking distance.

We had a great time in this hotel. During the 1970s, this hotel was clearly very plush. However, it suffered the effects of an earthquake and now everything wobbles a bit! But if you're young, want to see Mexico City, stay somewhere fairly OK and cheap, then who cares? Rooms are huge, fairly clean, and room staff are very good). Water is hot in the morning if you check in the previous evening ! The staff are very helpful, friendly and great fun. Reception staff seem to double up as lift staff, room service staff, etc.! Something odd happened to the guy in the adjacent room one night, and the hotel manager and his assistant knocked on our door at 3am and asked if we minded if they could walk through and enter the room by our adjoining door! This was very strange, we never found out the reason (but have enjoyed speculating about it!), and we have dined out on this story for a long while.It is a bit David Lynch (see previous commentator), but it was a great experience!", "Date": "Dec 29, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR722801853", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Hope you like David Lynch films Didn't stay here but did look at a couple of the rooms. They were large with very aged, Blue Velvet-esque decor. Intriguing but not exactly welcoming. Though it may well have been clean, the place seemed dusty- perhaps because of the huge ( noisy) demolition project next door (as of 05/03.)
