Much like the first time, I have nothing but positive things to say about this Element by Westin. I like it that much. This hotel is out near Summerlin, but from reading reviews, this doesn't seem to be a barrier for people visiting Las Vegas and the Strip. It shouldn't be, either. Whereas many, or nearly all, hotels in Las Vegas treat you like a sucker tourist, this Element hotel treats you like a human being and appeals to the proactive, independent traveler. You can still expect great service, but you aren't going to be subjected to gimmicks that many Vegas hotels use to get your precious dollars. In fact, I'd have no problem saying this is the PERFECT hotel for business travelers. The rooms are airy, bright, and clean. There is lots of lighting via overheads and lamps so you can get work done, but enough flexibility to dim the lights for a quiet evening. The kitchenette is fully stocked with cookware, glasses, and utensils so you can bring your own groceries and setup base like you're at home. The television channel lineup is very similar to what you'd have at home, and includes a few HD selections. The grounds are immaculately maintained and welcoming, while the staff are all friendly and helpful. I've always felt that my requests to the front desk staff were carried out in a very positive and hospitable manner. The location is prime if you have business on the west side of LV, and there is plenty of retail to the south (off Flamingo) and to the north (off Charleston). It drives me nuts that the hotel is so close to the more upscale neighborhoods in Summerlin as I hope to someday live in this area. Nonetheless, it is nice to drive by such nicely maintained neighborhoods that have very little traffic during most of the day. The morning complimentary breakfast is one of the best I've ever had. The standard continental items are always there, along with some select pastries, and each day there is a unique hot item such as an English Muffin breakfast sandwich, or an egg white breakfast burrito. The miniature smoothies in shot glasses are a nice touch that I fully took advantage of. There is also an evening reception that I have no doubt it just as good, but my work schedule prevented me from partaking. There is nothing more to say, except, give this place a try. I don't think it is possible to leave this hotel dissatisfied.

Upon check in, I was sent to a room that had the beds turned up against the wall and it appears they were airing it out. No big deal, they gave me another room. Beds were very comfortable and I slept very well. Staff was friendly and I enjoyed the free breakfast the next morning which were actual breakfast sandwiches instead of just continental items.

If you do want a casino, Red Rocks is not too far, maybe 5 minutes away. There is a fully-stocked kitchen in the room, and Albertson's is about a 3 minute drive away. The minor inconveniences were that housekeeping takes quite a long time to get to the rooms, and they forgot to restock towels (and they didn't vaccuum/sweep) The other minor inconvenience is that the pool was pretty cold and they advertised it as a heated pool. Red Rocks is very close as well, and we enjoyed a couple of wonderful days of hiking. Pluses definitely beat the minuses by a lot.

A wonderful continental breakfast is served M-F, including egg sandwiches, cereals, mini muffins, and the best smoothie shots. On weekends, trays of eggs, sausage and pancakes are added. Loved the breakfast! Only thing I would change is the addition of fresh fruit, but the dried fruit and smoothies helped. The rooms overlooking the pool were very quiet. We did have one night there was a party downstairs in the lobby area that had music blasting beyond loud. It was right below us, so we felt it through the walls of our room. We were so tired, it didn't keep us up, so we didn't complain. I think it ended at 10 pm, but I had earplugs, so I'm not sure.

I was really really tempted to take the pillows home, since i've been looking FOREVER for pillows like that. the blinds didn't work that well, which was sad because we shut the blinds when we took an afternoon nap after a long hike at red rock canyons, and couldn't get it back up to enjoy the view. that was rather disappointing, especially since we had a spectacular view of the red rocks against the blue sky outside our window. real nice to wake up to a view like that. there wasn't that much of a noise from the freeway though, except one of a police siren that we heard. also, the \"raining\" shower head wasn't working well either, it had some leaking problems so we just used the regular one. didn't bother us that much, though we were a tad disappointed. (i'd minus half a star for the not so functional stuff, though it wasn't that huge a deal) breakfast was pretty good, healthy to say the least. they had these fruit smoothie served in shot glasses that were snapped up pretty quick, everyone loved it. the eggs were meh only though. but the receptionist Chris, who checked us in and later granted us a later checkout, was real helpful and very friendly.

I'm in Vegas at least once a year to visit the in-laws who retired to Summerlin. This was the most comfortable I've been on any of my visits. Have stayed on the Strip in the past, but more recently at the Suncoast and J.W. Marriot. While the Marriot is swanky (if a little ragged lately), the whole resort setting is very tiresome to me. The Element offered much greater ease overall - easy to park, easy to get to the room, easy to get (free) breakfast, easy to work out, easy to get to the in-laws' place. Spare, economical room furnishings - very West Elm, or maybe Ikea. I liked the layout of our one-bedroom suite: ample kitchen space, tidy living room with shelving space for books, magazines, phones, etc., comfortable bedroom. Plenty of non-traditional space to store clothing in a cupboard. I liked the flooring - not carpeted in the living area. Bathroom was adequate, shower was nice. Wished there was a tub to relax in, but not a big loss that there wasn't. Little issues: soap dish in bathroom was cheap plastic and made an awful squeaking sound when moved. Windows (which actually open a bit to let in fresh air) did not seal tightly - latches were broken, windows were off their tracks). When wind was howling it was an issue. Traffic noise from freeway was steady - might bother some, but was mostly white noise to me. Housekeeping only left one regular coffee kit until we asked for two, and neglected to leave dishwasher soap after we'd used the only one there. Plusses: great lobby with a great breakfast and a delightful woman staffing it most mornings; roomy work out area with free weights starting at five pounds (thank you! many places start at 20 pounds); ability to hook up my computer to TV in room and run Netflix and Pandora through television speaker; easy location to get to - 10 minutes from airport, 10 minutes to the Strip, 15 minutes to the in-laws, 15 minutes to Red Rock Canyon (go - really - and take the Calico Tank hike). Right across the street: wonderful spot called Rachael's for alternative breakfasts and sandwiches; new wine bar/Neapolitan pizza joint (didn't try); serviceable Japanese Teppanyaki Room.

It had the atmosphere of a spa with the nightly rate of a cheap motel. It was so clean, so fresh, and so beautiful that we contemplated changing our plans to stay an additional night. They are pet-friendly, but the rooms were so clean that you would not believe that other dogs had stayed there before. We were happy to have a nice hotel accept our four legged travel companion and respect our ability to clean up after her (instead of some hotels that give you the most disgusting room in the building). I was so impressed with the room that I even took photos of it to share with friends back at home. It was beautiful, modern, and (as I said before) sparkling clean. There was even a nice kitchen area to round out the amenities of the room. The bed was unimaginably cloud-soft while still providing good support. The outdoor pool was clean and refreshing (and cold, but the air temperature was over 100 degrees so the temperature of the water was appreciated). There was even free food in the lobby (a nacho bar) for us to nibble on while hanging out. Wait \u2013 hanging out in the lobby? I\u2019d never done that in a hotel before, but it seemed so natural at the Element. After a wonderful night of sleep, we decided to do something we had never done before\u2026 hang out in the room right up until check out time. We had places to go and things to see on our road trip, but the room at the Element was so refreshing that we just wanted to sit back and relax and enjoy for a few extra hours.

I wanted to confirm we weren't on the highway side of the hotel so I checked in with the staff. The guy seemed somewhat new or in training. He did a fine job but didn't confirm the rate, so I went back later as I was bringing my bags in to double check. The whole place is very unique. Four floors, two wings. One wing perpendicular to Hwy 215, the other parallel. The lobby has an open air look, and some fresh herbal kind of smell. Furniture is contemporary retro. Like those chic 50s/60s movies, simple geometric shapes. Subtle grays, whites, and muted greens. Very unique. The elevator was broken on floor four you had to use the service entrance to the elevator. We were on third floor, room 312. A studio king. Great to have the kitchen. Full size fridge, toaster, little sink, dishwasher, dishes, utensils, a sauce pan and sautee pan, 2 burner stove (no oven.) A safe I could fit our laptop into. No dresser, just shelves in a few places and a closet to hang your clothes. A functional desk for the laptop. I couldn't find a wired internet connection, but wireless was snappy (Did speedtest.net @ ~5 Mbit/s upload and download) and pretty much just worked when I found the unsecured network named \"element\" and connected. There is a \"media cube\" that you can connect RCA Video/Audio, 3.5mm phone jack, and/or RGB cable into, as well as HDMI. The TV just pipes in the audio video if you plug it in. We watched some Netflix watch now from our laptop without a hitch. The room has a DVD player so you can rent or bring DVDs or pay-per-view (though you'd be insane at 15.99 per movie for PPV!) There was a printed note on the \"media box\" that said they had cables at the front desk. We called about an audio cable and they said, \"Sorry, we don't have any cables\" - and they even seemed a little surprised. That wasn't good. It's okay that they don't have them - if they don't have official papers saying they do! We didn't use the pool but my brother and kids did. Despite the welcome sheet saying, \"our pool is 85 degrees year round\", it was NOT 85 degrees. In the hot weather, they had decided to turn off the heater, I think - because my brother and kids didn't use it for long. Also has a strange 6\" deep section that is like a 1/3rd of the pool, and it goes to about 4.5' deep at the deepest where it isn't the 6\" shelf. My wife made oatmeal on the stove with the saucepan, used their utensils, all purpose measuring cup, and dishwasher, worked like we were at home. Place has a nice big couch, wraps around the corner of the room with a sofa sleeper. The bed was marvelous. No cotton blankets which is what my wife and I prefer- only feather/polyester comforters, my wife was allergic to the comforter but they did bring us up a wool blanket when we called and asked. Bathroom was great. Good lighting, big mirror, a low counter with unique sink that sat on top. Rain-style shower with a separate sprayer on a hose. Only thing some might not like is that it is shower only and/or that the shower is clear glass floor to ceiling. So if you have a teenager that wants to shower without being seen, you must give them the whole bathroom. A/C unit didn't work quite right. Seemed to blow forever and never say it was colder but froze us. Couldn't figure out what was wrong, but we had to just turn it up/down depending on how we felt, just couldn't set it. The thermostat in my parents' room (a 1 bedroom, room 422) seemed to work fine. Bedroom door in the 1 bedroom suites is a sliding door, it doesn't lock. Most hotels have a booklet with detailed information on services and amenities. We looked all over for it when we showed up. They had little \"official\" scraps of paper around describing various things, and one letter size sheet with a sentence about each amenity. Quite the paltry documentation. The breakfast was good on Sunday (hot eggs/sausage/pancakes, Cereals/pastries/juices/breads/yogurt/fruit) and okay on Monday (same cold stuff, but only hot things were a breakfast burrito). They did offer a healthy alternative to the burrito - one made with egg whites and no sausage. SUMMARY: Service - The minuses were for the only okay trained desk staff, no audio cable when they said they have cables, for saying the pool is 85 when it wasn't, seemed a little short staffed. Still haven't fixed the elevators (there is an earlier post about that) Cleanliness - was impeccable. Location - A little out of the way, but on 215 for good access to west Vegas area. Value - With out AAA rate, the value was excellent. All annoyances were pretty minor, and for the price, easily overlooked. Rooms - There were a few quirks (blankets, A/C), and the contemporary angular furniture isn't the most comfortable, but the beds are great Sleep Quality - Excellent I would recommend.

There is free parking and a pool for guest to use. Checkin was a breeze and I was given a 4th floor( top floor) 1 bedroom suite. The room overlooked the pool and rear parking lot and had distance views of the strip. The room itself was very nice. It had a full kitchen small living room with sofa/flat screen and a bedroom with another flat screen in it. The bathroom was nice with a rain shower head. There is a buffet breakfast in the am and free internet with printer in the lobby. I did use the fitness center and it had treadmills/elipitcal and weights. I did not use internet in the room since I did not have my laptop with me. I was in Vegas to play in the WSOP. I paid $100 for the room and was very impressed w/ the quality and amenties that the hotel has to offer. The value propostion is there because if you want something away from the strip this hotel cant be beat. For $100 I got a great room, free breakfast, free internet, pool and gym.

We were saddened to hear they had problems during their anniversary trip. Fortunately, we had a very different experience. We found Element Las Vegas to be an exceptional property. The staff was helpful and accommodating. Our room \u2013 well, the entire property for that matter --was extraordinarily clean. The rooms have full kitchens equipped with cookware and dishes.

If cooking during your getaway isn\u2019t for you, no worries\u2026. all of the great casual dining venues of the west valley: Cheesecake Factory, Roy\u2019s, Fleming\u2019s, etc., are located along the Charleston BLVD corridor a few miles north of the hotel. The Element is Westin\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d concept. The environmentally friendly theme is found throughout the property. I can appreciate the responsible use of natural resources; however, the \u201chybrid only\u201d parking space at the hotel\u2019s main entrance was over the top, if not misguided and a tiny bit elitist. The driver of a gas-guzzling Hybrid Cadillac Escalade enjoys up front parking while the driver of a 40+ MPG, non-hybrid but fuel-efficient, Ford Focus must park with the masses of the unwashed. Beyond the clich\u00e9, a really cool \u201cgreen\u201d feature is the hotel room windows that actually open wide for fresh air. Unfortunately, our room faced the 215 Beltway so we couldn\u2019t take advantage this because of the traffic noise\u2026 oh well, maybe next time. Some minor drawbacks: 1) Kitchen Flooring. Because it is a hard surface, expect noise to come through the ceiling from people walking on the floor above if staying anywhere but the top floor. This strip of flooring runs the entire lenght of the room on one side. 2) WiFi. The signal in our room was weak. Bring an ethernet cable.

I checked in on Thursday, 10 June, and I am scheduled to check out on Monday, 14 June. We were staying there for our Anniversary trip. Our room was supposed to be pre-paid on 07 June in an amount of $467.04. On 12 June, we noticed that the charge for the room was not billed but an authorization for $722.80 was being held on the account. The authorization for $722.80 consisted of $467.04 for the room and $255.80 for incidentals. Here is the problem. The front desk manager told us that the Westin tried to bill our debit card on 07 June and the card declined. I know this is not true because I called my bank and the transaction never tried to come through and the funds were always there there anyway. I asked the front desk manager for a transaction number from the bank that was given from the alleged decline and she was unable to provide that transaction number. The other part of the problem is that the Westin alleges that since our debit card was declined on 07 June, they charged us a higher amount for incidentals. Usually, incidentals are $100 but when a card is declined this amount increases to $100 per day. This makes no sense because if the lesser amount, $467.04, was allegedly declined, then how can the Westin authorize the higher amount of $722.80? If the smaller amount was allegedly unavailable then the higher amount should have never been able to be authorized if, indeed, the funds were unavailable. The funds were always available. Also, if this policy is true this further makes no sense because if we were supposed to be charged a $100 per day incidental rate since the card allegedly declined, then why were incidentals authorized at $255.80 instead of $400 ($100 per day for 4 days, the length of my reservation). This is the bottom line, our debit card was authorized at a higher amount for incidentals since the room and tax amount allegedly declined. So, we were penalized for a decline that never happened. And, it appears that the Westin just pulled a figure for incidentals out of the sky since the higher/penalized incidental rate does not even match the rate in the Westin policy. The front desk manager told us there was nothing she could do since it was Saturday and she told us we could call the general manager. So, I called the general manager, David Smith, and talked to him about our concerns. David Smith was beyond terrible. He told me that he was not at the hotel, that he was in New York City and if the front desk manager said there was nothing she could do then nothing could be done. He proceeded to tell me that he would not do anything to address my concern and when I checked out everything would balance out. He told me that he would not make any calls to Westin at a higher level to see how this happened; he also proceeded to tell me that even if he was willing to make some calls nothing could be done today since it's Saturday. His unwillingness to even address my concern was appalling. Before I left the front desk, the front desk manager ended up calling higher level Westin and the authorization was released and she billed the debit card for the room and tax. Funny how she was able to do that when she and her general manager told me that nothing could be done. Technically, my issue was resolved but I am writing this review because of the horrible way David Smith talked to me on the phone. We could have taken our business anywhere, but we chose to come to the Westin. What a mistake !! Is this Westin policy? Does the Westin not train their management staff in customer service? My request was for the Westin to correct an error that they made and all I received was disrespect and lack of concern. I expected him to at least be willing to investigate the issue, but he told me he would not do anything. I don't work directly in customer service but I am expected to address the concerns of those who are impacted by what I do and the decisions I make. I try my best to be responsive and professional because that is my job and it's just common courtesy, This is a fairly new property and if the Westin continues to treat their customers this way they won't be around for long. At this point, we have no interest in ever staying at a Element by Westin property. We would much rather spend our money at a property where the management has a willingness to address concerns and/or operate in accordance with the policies and procedures of the organization. Perhaps that's why the customer service was so bad because there is no structure in the organization. We are so disappointed. We don't make a habit of paying people to disrespect us.

Yes it's a travel to the Strip but if your not planning on gambling all day every day the location works well. We went to a show one night and took our boys for a walk down the strip another night and just parked in the casino carpark with no problems. The rooms are very spacious, clean and modern, we could easily have the four of us in there for an evening without sitting on top of eachother which is what we would have had, had we stayed on the Strip. Only negative comment would be the air conditioner is quite loud in the bedroom and language issues caused some problems at checkout. Will definitely stay here again!", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cLike a hotel should be\u201d", "Author": "markobmf", "ReviewID": "UR45834478", "Content": "I think people like me were in the focus group when they planned this hotel concept.

Had never heard of Element, a new chain in the Westin Brand but they allowed pets so we booked. WOW! For less than $100 we got a mini-suite, queen bed room with FULL kitchen. Extremely clean and nicely furnished! Breakfast was free and lncluded the usual fare along with hot items (eggs and pancakes), yogurt \"smoothies\", and their \"signature\" english muffin sandwiches of egg whites, tomato and cheese. My husband usually runs in the mornings, rarely using fitness rooms as their equipment is usually so bad. Surprise...the equipment was new and of good quality! I also liked that they had hanging, locked shampoo and soap dispensers in the shower, instead of the plastic, one use bottles. The only issue we had was that their street wasn't in our GPS, so I called the hotel. The hotel is on Discovery Drive, a cross street of Town Center Drive, but the woman working couldn't tell us what \"hundred block\" of Town Center they were at, or which way we should turn from the road we were on, so we ended up turning the wrong way. I had to call the hotel again, and another woman tried to use MapQuest to help us find the hotel as she didn't know where we were on Town Center even after I gave her cross streets! FYI - they are near 3800 South Town Center.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cWOW!!

We checked in only 10 minutes after we booked at 11pm looking like something a cat dragged in.. The staff was welcoming and NOT snooty, a great start... And the room...wow... big, immaculate, brand new, bedding is nothing less than what I expect from a Starwood Hotel which means down filled duvets, feathery mattress pads and so many pillows!! Heavan!
