{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beautiful, special place This is a very beautiful and special hotel. Note it is NOT in Barcelona but about 30km further up the coast (near Mataro). The hotel is a beautiful old house on gorgeous grounds. I got goose-bumps as I entered the gates, it was so striking. It's just the place to come for a peaceful and restful few days near Barcelona and the Mediterranean but far from the bustle and the noise of the city.The village of Sant Andreu de Llavaneres is a short stroll from the hotel and has a few nice restaurants. The rooms are beautiful and the common areas, bars and restaurant are all very nice. The gardens are large and peaceful with a pool.I didn't eat an evening meal in the hotel but did have an excellent breakfast and tapas for lunch which were superb.I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "May 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR122403035", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "abc_def062"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d666555-r15970128-Vilaclara_Art_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "666555", "Price": "$172"}}
