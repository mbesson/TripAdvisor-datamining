The staff cannot do enough for you and will happily chat away with you for hours about their lovely country. Fors is a true 3 star, it gives you a decent bed for the night and the added bonus of a cracking breakfast. The rooms aren't huge, romantic or grand however they are cleaned daily (with change of sheets), have AC and good shower pressure (though the bathrooms are pretty small). When I travel hotels are purely to lay my head in a safe and clean environment and Fors fitted this perfectly. If staying there please visit the Hamman across the road (built in 1734) if your male - my husband had a 3 hour treat session for $40L (incl of massage) and wouldnt stop raving about it and this wasn't his first hamman in life. Unfortunately the female version was pants, it cost the same however the staff were rude and basically I washed, got a 5 min scrub, no massage and was told to go - start to finish less than 30mins. Pure rip off, pure dissappointment and if honest, was extremely gutted. If there wasn't so many other places I'd like to go, I'd return to Istanbul and definitely stay at the Fors. There's several supermarkets close by, a locals-only cluster of streets containing fantastic hip restaraunts and equally small cheap eateries. Pro's: Great value for money, friendly staff, fantastic location, rooftop terrace. Con's: room a little small, not for romantics.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Hotel\u201d", "Author": "artur0671", "ReviewID": "UR106138577", "Content": "I booked this hotel , to be honest I was very nervous, especially if you travel with an 18 months child and not knowing what to expect.

It is not a luxury hotel, but instead is exactly what it proffers to be. It is a small hotel in a central part of Istanbul with friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere. The rooms are clean and well kept, the beds comfortable and linen fresh. Even the small details are there, the fittings for the room are ornamental yet not gaudy and the bathrooms are bright and clean. Upon arrival we were greeted by the manager who provided us with plenty of information and leaflets about what to do while we were there and generally offered us a very warm welcome to his hotel and city. Eager to explore we asked for directions to the hippodrome. The only downside to this hotel is it is at the bottom of a hill, however, I think you will find that everything in Istanbul is on a hill. It is very very hilly. If you are disabled this may not be the best place for you to visit, as in general as we found accessibility lacking (although improving). The breakfast at the hotel is a continental breakfast and whilst simple is plentiful and well cooked and typical of this country. The staff are probably the friendliest I have ever met, and I have stayed in hotels more expensive than this one where you perhaps would expect to be paying for improved service. I arranged a pick up from Sabiha Gocken through Fors and this went without a hitch unlike my friends whose stay overlapped ours and went through their agent. I really can not rate this hotel highly enough, no it is not a luxury hotel and the price reflects this. However it is excellent value if you want somewhere you will be welcomed with open arms, and made to feel you never want to leave.

My standards for hotel is quite high as I've only stayed in nothing less than at least 4 stars. But I was willing to give it a go on my husband's wish. The location is quiet hilly and I would not recommend it if you don't like to walk much, but then again all of Istanbul is hilly. We had no problems walking to SultanAhmet street. The rooms are always cleaned no matter what time you leave. The bathroom is tiny but exceptionally clean and that is definitely the most important part. It has a hair drier, but you might want to bring along your own toiletries. There is a small fridge and some snacks. Breakfast is in simple Turkish style but enough to get you started on your day, with bread, boiled eggs, fruit, yoghurt, warm bread, sausages...etc.. I happened to love it. The first night our AC did not function properly. We mentioned this to the hotel management on our way out the next day. When we arrived back they had changed our rooms and every single thing was in its right place as I'd left it. I was thrilled. Unfortunately the AC in that room was also not functioning but the fantastic staff and brilliant part owner Arif offered us yet another room. We finally settled in and after the first two days our stay at Fors Hotel was magnificent. I have to admit I have not met such accommodating and fantastic people as the staff and owners of this little hotel. They were so loving towards our son and we felt so welcomed by their heart-warming greetings. We had great chats with Zaynel Abedin, the second owner, and Arif.

Our initial impressions were very good, we were given room 201. This room is directly above the reception area and next to the steps. We did not get a good nights sleep during the stay, the night receptionist had the TV on all night and other guests arriving in late at night keep you awake coming up the marble stairs. Bedsheets were not changed the whole week of the stay, floor was not swept or mopped. When we booked via the Fors Hotel website we clicked on the link to give us a price in GBP (\u00c2\u00a3) and printed this off. On the last night one of the 2 owners was on reception duty and insisted we had to pay the Euro price. We explained that we had printed the price in \u00c2\u00a3 and would pay in \u00c2\u00a3. The Euro price was \u00c2\u00a325 dearer. He basically said that we were lying, that you cannot gain a \u00c2\u00a3 quotation off his site, even though we produced the printed quotation, annotated with website address and date of booking. Even after having shown him that you can gain a \u00c2\u00a3 quotation, by logging on to his site he continued to argue ! After an hour of arguing he eventually phoned his partner who said that we were right and that we could pay in \u00c2\u00a3. This particular partner we dealt with speaks little or no English. To cap it all, the transfer we had booked with the Hotel turned up 20mins late. Be prepared to spend an extortionate amount of money in Istanbul, it is twice the price of the south coast resorts.

What mattered was that staff was extremely friendly and helpful (not just hotel-related, but helping find places, get info and get around). There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel. Nice Turkish style breakfast (although that may vary over time). There is a flatscreen satellite TV on the wall with channels in all possible languages (although no premium movie channels or even CNN), and mini-fridge with refreshments. There is a local Turkish bath down the street, and a couple of historical baths within 10 minutes walk. The hotel is in a residential part of Sultanahmet, so it's quiet, and there are a few grocery stores and restaurants nearby. As the description on the hotel's website suggests, it's close to everything if you can walk. Keep in mind the hills are pretty steep and streets are winding, so if you're geographically challenged, returning at night by foot might be an adventure.
