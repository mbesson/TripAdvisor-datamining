{"Reviews": [{"Content": "\"Loved it - can't wait to be back' The best thing about this hotel is its location - its right on Legion Beach, has a double level infinity pool which is gorgeous, lined with lounges and is the perfect place to lounge about on a lazy afternoon with a book and a cocktail or post breakfast. We were looking for a peaceful location, so this hotel was perfect for us and just a stone's throw away from small shops and restaurants. However, if you prefer to be in the middle of the action (E.g. something equivalent to Baga beach in Goa, India) then perhaps you should choose a hotel in Kuta which is about 10 mins by cab from Legion Beach. We stayed in a junior suite which was tasteful but minimistic in its decor. We loved the huge LCD television in our room which we used at night to watch movies! The staff and hotel employees were extremely warm and cordial and attended to our every need - they got really excited to know that we were Hindus. The hotel also has a wonderful spa (slightly expensive though) where we enjoyed a one hour aroma body massage. Breakfast is buffet and comprises a reasonable good spread and is served poolside facing the beach! Among the drawbacks - (1) the junior suites have small porches with deck chairs and a table where one can enjoy a smoke or drink at night (the concept is good) - however it is difficult to sit here due to the mosquitoes so it is advisable that one carry a mosquito repellant/anti-mosquito cream with them for the trip (2) mosquitoes can also be a problem if one leaves their room/suite door open in the evening/night.The room service menu is quite good and has a variety of food - I strongly recommend the thai prawn with flat noodles. Besides the minor drawbacks above, we completely enjoyed our stay at the hotel and look forward to returning soon.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR892509294", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Em_India"}, {"Content": "Bali Niksoma - overall a happy time       Lounge room of Suite room", "Date": "Oct 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR890040463", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Grrltrip"}, {"Content": "can't wait to go back to the Bali Niksoma!       the entrance to the openair reception", "Date": "Oct 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR619695284", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "regcam"}, {"Content": "An oasis to strip your normal life away My partner and I first discovered the Niksoma in November 05, and spent two weeks walking around in a loved up, blown away, magical daze.

Based on the positive reviews written for Bali Niksoma, I stayed there with my hubby for 1 night. We had booked 4 nights at USD 195 nett per night but checked out immediately the next morning cos I was very disappointed with the hotel for the price I paid!On my last trip there, I had paid USD180 nett for a 1 bedroom villa at the Kayana, which was fabulous. This time round, we wanted to stay near the beach, which was why I picked Niksoma. But boy, was I disappointed... We chose a Junior Suite at Niksoma. On arrival, was initially quite impressed by the pick-up at the airport (paid USD 15 for one-way transfer though). But when we were brought to our ground floor suite (all 4 J Suites are on the ground floor), I was sorely disappointed. The bedroom area was small, and room had a musky smell. Furnishings were old and look like they have not been well-maintained. Bed was rather creaky. Only thing nice about the J Suite is the spacious bathroom. It had 2 vanity tops/basins, and the one I used was clogged. Had to call the technician to come and fix it. The room felt more like a low class bungalow/chalet than a 'junior suite'. It did look like the picture on the website, except that furnishing were old and in need of an overhaul.My husband and I did not sleep well cos the air in the room did not feel 'clean'. Hubby kept sniffing the whole night. Had a blocked nose. Might have been allergic to some dust mites in the room or something. The next day, we decided to shift to another hotel cos we could not imagine staying another 3 nights there. They offered an upgrade to their suite (also on ground floor), but we had already lost confidence in the quality of the rooms, so we declined that. The good thing about the hotel was that they were very accommodating, and allowed us to check out only by paying USD100 as cancellation charges. Would have been USD195, but the supervisor felt rather apologetic for my husband's allergy and hence slashed the amount (without me asking for it). The supervisor also graciously helped me contact a few other hotels in the seminyak area to check for price and availability.We finally settled on Uma Sapna Villas (near Jl Laksmana or Eat Street) for USD160 nett per nite for a 2 bedroom villa with private pool and garden(!!). That was an amazing 'upgrade' at a lower price! We loved Uma Sapna for its price and location. You can check out my reviews on Kayana and Uma Sapna which I have also posted. Overall, though the service staff was helpful, I would NEVER stay at the Bali Niksoma again, not even if it was free! Think they need to do a major overhaul to their rooms and change the furniture and other finishings. But then again, I think reviews are subjective. It all depends on your expectation. If your expectations are high, and you have been exposed to better accommodation, this would be way below standards. Seriously, for the price you pay, you can get top villas (not at beachside though) wth your private pool and garden in the Seminyak/Kuta area. This is just not worth the price.But to be fair to Niksoma, we did take a stroll along the beach, and realised that it is indeed one of the top 3 iclassy hotels in that area - after Anantara and Outrigger O-CE-N, I think.", "Date": "May 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR106010458", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "darlenemel"}, {"Content": "This hotel is AMAZING.

Breakfasts are brilliant as is the Niksoma's restaurant all-day-menu. Poolside cocktails were a dream (you can't go past their Mojito!). Our room was magnificent, we were upgraded to a Suite after the first night but the Standard we were in was just as fantastic. The small touches unique to the hotel are wonderful (wait til you try the arrival cocktail on check-in and the nightly sweet the house-staff leave after turning down the bed). The pool area is ultra-clean with amenities close by and and the upper pool feels like it's dissappearing into the ocean. Lots of different styles of furniture to lounge on poolside and attentive, friendly service. Beach directly out the front making for an awesome sunset.Look out for Min, she's the hostess with the mostest and Donni our favourite pool guy (he'll keep you topped up with the complimentary garlic nuts and they are a winner).

We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our Bali holiday and could not have been happier. It is in a great location on the beach at Legian - a road separates the hotel from the sand, but this is a pedestrian access road only so it is very peaceful.First impressions were wonderful - a great welcome from staff and we were allowed to check in 4 hours earlier than usual time which was fantastic.We had a third floor room with a view of the surf - although there were buildings in front, we could still see the water and the surfers which was great, especially when you look at the other hotel choices along the beach. The pools were great and our 2 kids could not have been happier. The hotel even had noodles for the kids to use in the pool. We loved having lunch on our pool chairs looking out over the water. Great basic lunchtime menu.Despite the hotel being full we never felt overcrowded and could always find a seat at the pool, breakfast etc.We loved the spa - it was quite pricey compared to some others, but it is only to be expected in this type of hotel.The staff were absolutely amazing. They were so welcoming and friendly and helpful and made travelling with young children so easy - they absolutely doted on them and all remembered their names. We felt the staff took time out to chat to us, answer any questions and give us insights into their culture. Do I have any negatives ? Certainly nothing of any consquence. Would probably have been nicer to have more of a mix of nationalities - 90% were Australian like ourselves. We like to be able to meet others from around the world when on holidays. Only other minor one is that it is not really close walking distance to anything other than the street stalls, but taxis are so cheap that this is not a problem at all.LOVED our stay and will be back definately.

The first time (2005) was exciting, a nice hotel w/ direct access to the beach, nice pools (2 pools to die for), slick designed rooms.

Wrote a 2 page feedback to the manager afterwards. Stayed on the 3rd floor room.The 2nd visit (2006) was good, but not as exciting, rooms finishing have improved, the rest havent..that's ok, we did enjoy our stay though. By now, the hotel has became a chic place for the hip Jakarta crowds to stay in Bali (it even has a Facebook profile).Stayed on the 2nd floor room.Third visit (Dec 19-21 2007) was the last straw, nothing has improved, the rooms, especially the one on the 2nd floor upward are not well maintained, breakfast has gone worse, me and my wife were awakened by the sound of some construction workers working on the room next to ours 7AM in the morning, was very upset about this. called the front desk so they can stop, it did for 15 minutes before they started to work again. 2PM, had a massage in our room, the working  banging started again, called again to front desk, nothing happened, the banging continued.

Dark, poor facilities (including a TV which must have been plucked from a museum) and a small, old fashioned bathroom. The next day we were moved to something better, but still for the money it was poor.

Some of them couldn't even communicate in English, which obviously for Bali is poor.My advice? Come to Bali, and spend some time in the Sheraton or a similar 5 star hotel, or spend the (not much) extra on a villa hotel like the Elysian or Villa Jodie.

We booked a standard room because we felt by looking at the photos of both standard and deluxe there wasn't very much of a difference. After checking in you get the usual cold towel and welcome drink and we were taken to our room. The standard room was at the far side of the complex and looked like it was an old building which didn't really fit in with the rest of the rooms. Our room was on the first floor where you has to walk past a grotty cupboard where the maids keep there amenities. The maids trolley remained at the bottom of the stairs the whole duration. The room was dark and basic, the furniture was fine but the decor needed updating. The bedroom could have done with a lick of paint. The bathroom was extremely disappointing - grotty tiles, mould developing on the shower curtain, old towels and not of a standard you would expect from a boutique hotel. A few of the suites had little privacy as they were on the main walkway to reception. The pool area was fine but certainly no wow factor - nothing special and it took ages to get any drinks. Overall the common areas are stylish but it doesn't reach to the standard rooms. The staff were very friendly. It had quite a package holiday feel to it and I could have been in Spain rather than thousands of miles away - not what I expected.Disappointed!", "Date": "Jun 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR291053037", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Kaype"}, {"Content": "Unbeatable pool Just returned from 5 days and nights in Bali and staying at the Niksoma. The term 'sleek' is applies.Overall very pleased. The pool was absolutely beautiful and loved being able to order food and drinks from the deckchairs. Can recommend the Thai Chicken Salad and Calamari Salad. The spa centre in the hotel is lovely. More expensive than spas or salons on some of the main streets but to be expected and also a step above in terms of beautiful rooms, music, the works.Our Deluxe room was lovely though no drawers and issues with shower water draining out properly sometimes. Also the equipment in the gym died once or twice and air conditioning not very effective, but good equipment, TV available etc.Service good and certainly very polite and attentive staff. Service with a smile. Great buffet breakfasts and loved the Happy Hour (5-7pm two for one)My friend and I are happy to recommend.

WOW what an amazing hotel. We were greeted with drinks and towels after 17hrs travelling but was it worth it. This is a lovely boutique hotel and the staff and food is amazing.

I have stayed at many places around kuta, legian and tuban, but the niksoma is my absolute favourite.I have stayed at the niksoma 4 times in the past 10 months, and now the thought of staying anywhere else scares me. The accomodation is excellent, as are the facilities. It is small enough to still be very personal, and big enough to have all you need. The food is excellent, the pools are great, and the staff are first rate. I could not fault the hotel. Looking forward to getting back there in November. It is perfectly situated on the beach, and far enough away from the hustle and bustle of kuta. We always feel very safe at the Niksoma. Love it!!!!!! I must say though that if you have trouble getting around, the niksoma would probably not be for you, there are alot of stairs, and the pools are both rather deep, at 5foot 6inches, I can only just stand up in them.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR767438364", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "shitson"}, {"Content": "absolutley fantastic BAli Niksoma is a fantastic spot. Across from the beach at legian, close to great shopping and the hotel food and staff are excellent.Only thing about the Niksoma is that it is hard to get it to.

On arrival we were greeted some smiling balinese faces. The service provided by the staff at this hotel is just wonderful. We had booked a junior suite and were given an upgrade to a full suite which was very nice. The rooms are of a modern balinese style as they have all been renovated just recently. The pool and dining area are all very nice but could have a bit more shade so that you can get out of the tropical sun when near the pool and a bit more grass so that you do not burn your feet on the concrete when swimming. If you are early enough you can get one of the balinese bales that are very good for sleeping on during the day. I could strongly recommend eating at the hotel as the food is excellent and well priced. On a downside as much as we did enjoy staying at the niksoma i don't think that we would stay again because it is a long way from the shops and other nearby restaurants as it is a bit out of the way.", "Date": "May 24, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR645274765", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "excelente   showReview(22540427, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR650216529", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "viajeros08"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d566653-r23125272-Bali_Niksoma_Boutique_Beach_Resort-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "566653", "Price": "$206"}}
