The staff were friendly to us, but we were in Room 31, on the same floor as Reception, and heard arguments with other unhappy guests and reception staff. In fact we could hear everything in our room. I did not feel safe in this Hotel so I barricaded the door each night. If I had not been with my husband I would have left this Hotel and moved, but everything was prepaid so we stuck it out. There were no amenities in the room except a soap refill on the wall which was not refilled the three days we stayed. There was mould in the shower in easy to clean places. I cleaned the mould off with some toilet paper before using the shower. The sheets were thread bare and the bedcover burnt with cigarette stains. Breakfast was nice, breads, cereal and coffee. The breakfast staff were also the housekeeping staff and very nice. The location is great, we actually walked down from the train station but there are plenty of other Hotels in this area to try. The floor was lino and this made the echo problem quite bad especially on the same level as Reception.

Of the 2 guys, the taller Italian one was up for a stand-up row, arguing that the alternative hotel was just as close to all the places we'd want to visit. No it wasn't. What was so annoying was that we were given no choice: a refund wasn't offered, nor was a suitable alternative. If there really was an ill woman, she could have been moved out to another hotel and claimed on her travel insurance. It was clear that there'd been a double-booking, the hotel was lying to us, and we were simply the fall-guys. We were dealt with totally unsympathetically. There was no excuse for this.

We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the rooms, the clean roomy bathrooms and a beautiful breakfast room with delicious cappuccino each morning. Rented a triple room and a double; the triple fronted Via Nazionale with a gorgeous view and the double, though without the view, was wonderfully quiet. Great location, friendly staff - would definitely recommend without hesitation.", "Date": "November 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cGreat base for exploring\u201d", "Author": "fizzyretro", "ReviewID": "UR2667617", "Content": "Stayed in a twin room (80.000 Euros) for a few nights over the summer. Having lived in Rome we were looking for something central but far enough away from Termini Train Station to be safe and comfortable! The location is ideal (lower end of Via Nazionale, next to Piazza Venezia), you can walk it from the station in 15 mins providing you haven\u00b4t brought the kitchen sink or you can get a taxi for next to nothing. Hotel is basic but staff are friendly. The twin room was spacious enough and the bathroom was ample. I say this as someone used to European sizes, by US standards its a wee bit cramped...the shower cubicle is mini! We were able to check in early and leave our luggage there after check out, on our last day. This hotel offers no frills but the rooms are clean and the staff accommodating. We slept through breakfast so can\u00b4t vouch for that. I can sleep through anything which is just as well because traffic noise may pose a problem for light sleepers, especially if you are assigned a room at the front of the building.", "Date": "October 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but noisey\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1735520", "Content": "Over-all an enjoyable stay, mainly because it is in an excellent location for this 'no-frills' hotel. Very basic in every way (don't expect a hearty breakfast or exuberant welcome) but the room was clean and private, with en-suite, which was the main thing. my only real problem was the noise levels - the main road just outside, an the room was as close as you could get to the breakfast room, so clattering and talking from 6.30am. some ear-plugs soon sorted that out! And it was a little over budget. I would stay here again, but only if i could guarantee my room was in a quieter part of the hotel!!", "Date": "March 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant, Clean, Friendly\u201d", "Author": "teachertim", "ReviewID": "UR1428697", "Content": "Me and two friends stayed at this hotel in Late October 2003. We stayed in a Triple room, which was very very clean, good size, well decorated and generally very very good. Some reviews have commented on road noise in the rooms, ours was on the first floor over the road junction, and with the windows open it was noisy, but with the double glazed windows closed you can't hear a thing ! Rooms also have ac so there is never a need to open your windows. Breakfast is very nice, served by very friendly English speaking ladies. Reception staff are very helpful and speek good English. Another bonus at this hotel is that you can leave your baggage safe after you have checked out, leaving you chance to explore Rome before you have to get your plane if it is an evening flight. Would stay here again without question.

Breakfasts were some of the best we've had in Italy (pastries, bread, preserves, pate and cheese) served with excellent fresh coffee.Beware of the road noise from the Via Nazionale, if you are a light sleeper take ear plugs - as two in our party had to do.
