The entire experience was 1st class. Upon arrival at the Las Vegas Airport, we were greeted by our limo driver. Our limo driver was professional and helpful the entire time. The limo is included for guests of the Sky Suites. Guests of the Sky Suites arrive at a different entrance for check-in. The check-in process is quick and efficient. I had pre-booked some dinner reservations and the Sky Suites staff had prepared an itinerary that they presented at check-in. The room was exceptional. Floor to ceiling windows with a fantastic view. We were on the 55th floor and we could literally see all of Las Vegas. Each bedroom had a bathroom that you would like to find at a first class spa. Steam shower, soaker tub, double sinks, heated toilet seat, large walk in closet and bathroom supplies. The room has smart technology so you can listen to music in each room, watch television, etc. There is a goodnight button beside the bed that turns everything off and shuts the curtains for sleeping. The alarm clock actually does not come on with the dreaded 'beep-beep', the room lights up slowly and the curtains open automatically! What a nice way to wake up. The room also had a bar with a third bathroom, a dinning table that comfortably sat 8 adults, a sitting area for watching TV with very comfortable furniture and a desk for working with internet provided. There is a great lounge included with your stay in the Sky Suites that includes complimentary items such as water (Fiji and Perrier), assorted Juices, coffee, tea, beer, wine, fruit and at different times of the day exceptional pasties and chocolate covered strawberries. I can honestly say that the only negative part of the entire experience was leaving. There is top value for the dollar and I would highly recommend spending the money on this experience of a lifetime.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new south wales", "Title": "\u201cVery Good glad I pre paid For Suite in advance.\u201d", "Author": "uter", "ReviewID": "UR126890872", "Content": "We stay at the Aria for 7 nights in a 2 bedroom Sky Suite March/2012 on level 33 The rooms are spacious and come with modern cons the air conditioning is tricky to get right and you do hear the hum through the night,there are no opening windows you will wake up in the morning for the first few morning with a really really dry mouth keep water beside you bed.

Both bathrooms have a great shower and full bath in them,shower head is weak and covers a small area so you have to keep moving to stay warm. The 3 toilets are cool heated seats and a\" bum cleaner\" The combined lounge room dining are is large,lounge is small for 4 people,good size dining table to seat 4. Can hear other suites above you or beside you. 2nd mini fridge is good , room does not come with any plates,cups,cutlery etc can't make coffee as there is no coffee supplies or kettle have to go room service every time. Quick wifi and include in cost of room. Chauffeur service to and from airport very good. Front office is a bit slack with making changes or in handling problems. We pre paid for our suite Nov/2011 at at cost of $4500 when booking in front of hose staff tried to charge new rate of $6700 saying we had a balance of $2200 owing spent the next 45 minutes proving and for them to double check suite was paid in full really handled poorly offered a $50 credit on food tab - buffet breakfast for 4 is $76. The room is worth the $4500 for 7 nights really not worth the new rate of $6700 for 7 nights better value to be found else were. The Aria is set back from strip and is a 35/45 minute walking round trip to nearest Walgreens of Cvs. Floor staff are very polite.

We travel quite a bit to all kinds of hotels. Some 5 star and some other places. This is my first review but this place was so good, I had to share. We had a 1 bedroom penthouse at Aria Sky Suite. The space is perfect for relaxing and entertaining. The living room, dining area and bar are perfect for a gathering. The views are great. The staff are very respectful and helpful. The sky suites have their own \"front desk\" for check-in, check-out. They also have their own hospitality area that has a full compliment of bottled water, coffee, tea, and other drinkings...along with assorted foods...like muffins in the morning, and chocolate covered strawberries in the evening (along with wines). We were always stopping by for coffee, tea, and water.....very convenient! Back to the rooms...very high tech. The bathroom was outstanding. I can't remember having a walk-in closet. They also have a whirlpool tub, a great shower that has a steam feature, and a toiled that has a heated seat. The location is fine. There is a tram that will take you to Vdara and Bellagio. The price is high, unless you can work an upgrade. Overall, it exceeded expectations.

The in room technology was pretty cool, everything on a touchpad which was easy to use. My particular fvourite was the massive jzacuzzi bathtub! infact the bathroom and walk in closet were a dream. The bed is very comfortable and it was difficult to get out of it. The staff couldn't be anymore helpful and lovely, I had arranged dinner at the SW Steakhouse and the coincerage couldn't be anymore helpful. The same was when we booked tickets for a show.

No complaints here! The suite was spacious, with impressive views, modern lighting and quiet for a good night's sleep in the bedroom. Could hear neighbours TV/music in the rest of the suite at times. Wireless internet was good, stable and included in the price. Gym was also included, and was well equipped and serviced. So why withhold 2 stars? When I was moved on the third night, after extending by a night, the desk at Sky Suites screwed up multiples times. Sky Suites gave me a key to a room that was occupied, she made a mistake. After walking back down with luggage, instead of noticing her mistake, she successfully made the key work in the occupied room. So second time around, I walked into someone's occupied room. LUCKILY the occupants weren't there at the time. Her manager said she should have been able to see that the room was occupied to start with. My hands and arms were tired from hauling my luggage up and down. The manager's pathetic attempt to placate me with a $50 hotel meal voucher added insult to injury. Security staff at the Sky Suites lifts was not aware of the location of the star suits desk... how's this possible? Premium check-in front desk staff were unaware of free guest printing facilities from the Sky Suits desk. Was given a smoking suite, and despite the Ozone machine that I was told was used while I was out, the apartment still stank. Fortunately the bedroom wasn't as badly affected. Was informed that despite tripadvisor's associated website booking allowing a choice of a 'non-smoking' suite, the hotel treats this as no more than a 'request'. If you've not been to Vegas yet: all hotels allowing smoking in the common areas such as the Casino and lobby, as a non-smoker, I find this putrid and disgusting. I wish that the Aria would lead the way by joining the first world in the 21st century and ban smoking. Minor point: my room was promoted as a 'penthouse suite', but was only on the 31st floor, with many many floors above me.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cOur Quiet Corner in Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "Helper_One", "ReviewID": "UR125583034", "Content": "Loved everything from the Limo ride to the turn down service.

Wireless worked sometimes but wired never did. We didn't bother to call because it wasn't a big deal to us. My husband uses a CPAP machine and there is no place to plug it in, plugs behind the bed. The staff brought us an extension cord. The rooms were clean except for the windows which were filthy dirty. We could barely see our \"city view\". Our reservation included 2 free buffet per room but somehow wasn't applied correctly requiring a trip back to the front desk. The buffet was great. I would pay full price for it. Except for one dealer, a front desk person and a taxi stand attendant everyone working here seems to hate their jobs. Very few smiles or warmth outside the standard script. My son really wanted to go to the nightclub but was intimidated by the line and attitude of the bouncers. Looked pretty much like if you didn't have a group of barely clothed women with you, you weren't getting in. The only other thing worth noting is that it was difficult to keep our room cool and the elevators and halls were roasting [--] hot.

I have been to Vegas many times, but this was my first time at Aria. I will definitely be staying there again next time I am there. The staff was all very friendly and took accountability for everything. I was never transferred to a different person or put on hold. We were upgraded from a Deluxe King City View Room to a SkySuite as we were celebrating our first wedding anniversary at no charge. We also had some goodies delivered to our room. The hotel itself is amazing. Cleaning, pretty, modern, and fun. Even though smoking is allowed inside, it is very well ventilated, so that makes it more pleasant. Our room was non-smoking and very clean smelling. The SkySuites will be where I stay next time as well, even if I have to pay extra. The rooms include a lounge with complimentary soft drinks, teas, coffee, juices and snacks as well as wine and cheese in the evening. All rooms also include free boarding pass printing which was convenient. The room had real plants in it not fake ones. Very clean, and well laid out. View was amazing! The bathroom was also phenomenal. The toilet had a heated seat and a \u201ccleansing\u201d option. The bathtub also functioned as a Jacuzzi. There was a TV in the bathroom and dual vanities which was nice for my husband and I. The bed and linens were very comfortable and much appreciated after a day of fun and drinking. The room is also very technologically advanced. From the panel next to the bed you can control the temperature, music/tv, open and close the curtains, request service, and set an alarm which you can choose to be woken by music, opening the curtains, turning on the lights, turning temperature up, all at a gradual pace. It was definitely neat to see how integrated the hotel was! I see another review said complimentary airport transportation in a limo, but we were not offered that service. Perhaps it is only if you book the room, not if you are just upgraded. That would be a great perk as well! Never in my life have I been to a hotel where every single employee was exceptional.

I had booked a 2 bedroom Sky suite to share with another couple. We arrived at 3:30 PM and our limo driver met us at the entrance to baggage claim ( a perk of staying in the Sky Suites is free limo transport to/from airport). We had no wait to check in and we were given our room immediately. Much to our chaugrin, when we entered the suite, it reeked of cigar and cigarette smoke (supposed to be non-smoking). I called down to the concierge and was told another room would not be available for 4 hours. When I returned to the front desk to return the keys, however, the helpful staff at check-in just upgraded us to a penthouse 2 bedroom so that we wouldn't have to wait--great service to make up for a room that fell short! The suite was updated and clean, with every amenity you could ask for. I loved the control pad for all the lights, temp, curtains, etc in the room, and I didn't think it was difficult to figure out at all (if you use an Ipad, you can use the control panel). Whenever I called down to the concierge to make spa or dinner reservations, my request was handled promptly. The beverage and snack bar in the private lobby area of Sky Suites was also a great perk--I never bought breakfast while there, just ate the fruit and bran muffins provided. If you want a hot breakfast, though, you'll need room service or to go to the restaurants.
