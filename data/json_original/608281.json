{"Reviews": [{"Content": "We Enjoyed Pipon's and Rincon We stayed at Pipon's Resort for New Year's and really enjoyed it. The apartment-style accomodations were very clean and as expected -- no surprises. Perfect for spending several days, especially if you like to cook. Brand new grill right outside. Nice view of the Atlantic. Pool is great. Try to get an apartment above the garden level for a better view and a little more quiet (gravel walkway gets moderately noisy if people are going back and forth).The owners were really quite accomodating and helpful if we needed anything. They recommended several good restaurants and sent us to a couple who rent surfboards that were brand new. Perfect.We can't wait to get back to Rincon. Keep in mind that you should fly into Aguadilla rather than San Juan as the drive is about 3 hrs shorter! For nightlife, we liked the Lazy Parrot. Great bartenders. Chill atmosphere, although its expanding.Tamboo isn't bad, especially for events like New Year's when all the locals party til sunup.Calypso is a fun place too -- but what's up with the crazy owner lady? Steer clear of her and get some replica sunglasses in the adjacent shop while you're there.", "Date": "Mar 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR854914942", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BostonTravelerUSA"}, {"Content": "Excellent       Rincon", "Date": "Apr 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR134826770", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kmh316"}, {"Content": "Lugar bueno pero la playa adecuada no esta a 1000 pies ......   showReview(7838815, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR122101376", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Eljusto"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d608281-r6935371-Pipon_s_Resort-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html", "HotelID": "608281", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
