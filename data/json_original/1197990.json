This was matched by the man on reception as I checked in and within two minutes, I was in my room. Despite the late hour, the staff were very helpful in organising room service and ironing equipment. I had an attic room with a sloping roof and a wonderful view (as I discovered the next morning) of the Sacre Coeur at Montmarte. The quality of the room decor was high, with a luxury feel and a bathroom to match. The only down side of the room was that there wasn't enough desk space - leaving me feeling squashed into the window bay with my nose pressed against the window, a little bit claustrophobic. The next morning, after an all-too-brief (but very comfortable sleep), I opened the window to gaze on the Basilica of the Sacre Coeur basking in the bright sunshine - a sight to gladden the heart of any Paris lover. The bathroom's huge window, overlooking offices and apartments across the street were curiously without blinds or curtains (the second time I've recently had this in Paris) - just etched at the bottom as a kind of gesture to modesty. An interesting and amusing experience for the typically coy Brit :-) My stay here was all-too-brief. I'd like to have had longer to sample what else the hotel had to offer but what I did experience was of very high quality. This hotel was even closer to my clients' offices than the less comfortable hotel I stayed earlier in the week - so I know where I'll be staying next time I'm in Paris on business.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, beautiful decor, small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Pysiu", "ReviewID": "UR125843021", "Content": "Went to Paris for a romantic weekend get away and decided to splurge and stay somwhere very nice.

One just has to crept that. Important therefore to make sure that wherever you do fork out a couple of hundred euros you are getting some bang for your buck. I had been booked into Hotel Banke on Rue Dd Lafayette by a client. Good central location .Charming welcome by a truly excellent receptionist (Didn't get her name - but glasses and a great smile) who sorted out a problem over who was paying for the room (Not me mercifully) and dispatched me with a porter to my room. The porter was great too explaining the facilities of the hotel as we travelled up to Room 602. Remember the number....and avoid it. At 6'2\" I could only stand up in half the room as it had a sloping ceiling being in what I think is commonly referred to as the attic. A television round a corner could not be viewed from the only easy chair in the room, and the bathroom had one small pokey shower. The porter seemed slightly embarrassed by the room and not at all surprised when I said I was afraid that it wouldn't do. He rang down to reception and then he took me down to 302. This was much nicer, not huge, but a sofa at the end of the bed and a full length window. Admittedly a half size bath- shame as nothing more gorgeous than a long evening soak and this bath was not comfortable for that, but certainly better. Why do hotels try to palm you off with the worst room they have left? The room rate as printed in the room says this room goes for \u20ac480 a night!!!!! And half a bath!. Free wifi, which I consider a must in any hotel I stay in on business,so that is good, but unless everything is on expenses you'll be out of the room like a shot in search of a supermarche. Pack of 4 biscuits \u20ac6.80. Hamburger on room service \u20ac22....and half a bath. Nice toiletries - I'll be taking those I'm afraid at these prices, no in room movies, and the hotel corridors and reception are pervaded by s stygian gloom. Kept so dark no doubt so you can;t see how much money you're having to hand over at check out. I had a corporate rate of \u20ac230 but still consider that vey expensive for what one got...and of course that is without the \u20ac29 breakfast.

The hotel is well designed, but unfortunately we found the rooms to be dirty and poorly maintained. When we dropped our bags off in the room we noticed stains on the duvet cover (yes, they looked like THOSE kind of stains) so we asked the front desk on our way out to have the duvet changed while we were at dinner. When we returned from dinner the bed had been turned down but the stained duvet was still in place. We called the front desk and they sent a bellman up with a new duvet right away. Then I went into the bathroom to take a shower and saw probably the dirtiest shower I have ever encountered in a hotel. The grout between the tiles was discolored, dirty, and stained, but even worse there was black mold growing on the surface of the tiles! If the tile had even been wiped down with a sponge there wouldn't be mold on the surface, so you can imagine how dirty that shower must have been! I took pictures we contacted the front desk and requested a room move. We also asked to see the new room to be sure we weren't just going to another dirty room. We were told there were no rooms available for us. After a few minutes we called back and asked about a refund so we could move to another hotel. They said they'd call us back and they soon did saying they had a new room for us. They ended up moving us to a suite, which was nice of them, but really all we wanted was a clean room. The suite was nice, but had peeling caulk, soap scum on the marble tiles, burn holes in the sheets, and other issues that showed a lack of attention to detail. This hotel has a lot of potential, but they really need to be paying better attention to cleanliness and maintenance.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new zealand", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again - professional and clean\u201d", "Author": "tappz", "ReviewID": "UR116678149", "Content": "We recently stayed in 2 different hotels while holidaying in Paris, including the Banke. The rate for the second hotel was less, however, in hindsight I wished we had paid slightly more and remained on at the Banke for a number of reasons: *Professional staff: All staff, including reception, restaurant (breakfast and dinner) and cleaning were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Staff engaged with guests e.g. a consistent friendly greeting and acknowledgement whenever we passed by. Numerous times we approached staff for assistance and on eash occasion they very obligingly offered up help. Unlike other accommodation, staff didn't huddle, talk among themselves and appear aloofish. On the contrary, all staff we met engaged with us in a professional manner (without being intrusive) and were happy to share with us if we chose to. *Room size: We stayed in a standard double room. The rooms as stated by alot of reviewers, are small. However, not too small that we didn't have sufficient room to move with 2 large suitcases. I like space but didnt feel cramped at any time. The cleanliness, nice linen and modern-ness made up for the reduced space versus the 35sqm (standard) rooms we are used to in the Pacific (New Zealand). *Breakfast: Of all breakfasts served on this trip - the Banke breakfast was the best. Without sounding cliche-like, all food was fresh! The croissants were absolutely!fresh - buttery and flakey. I didn't bother with these at other establishments as they didn't come close to the freshness of the Banke pastries. The breakfast staff were super-efficient and there was very little delay waiting for eggs of choice, toast and coffee to be served. The remaining breakfast items e.g. cereals, fruits and pastries were available buffet style. *Location: This hotel is perfectly located to easy access to the big Department stores (3 minute walk) e.g. La Fayette and Print-temps and loads of Cafes - yummy crepe cafe right across the road. Our favourite was Rivoli (2 minute walk away). Alot of tourists frequent this cafe but not so much that it lost its feeling of 'local'. Reasonable priced meals and able to stroll on in up to 10:00pm. Our first few days were spent adjusting/catching up on french time so we would wake at 9:00pm and stroll on out to our fave. A 5 minute walk to Musee Opera. We have been lucky enough to stay in many hotels over the past years. Although cleanliness is a priority it does make a difference to stay in a property that exudes style and flair, subsequently, I usually look for 4-5 star accommodation. In this instance Banke met my expectations and feel their rates fairly reflect the property/service provided. Although, the bigger attractions i.e. Notre Dame, Eiffel and Louvre are not located closely to the Opera district, I felt this was a nice location that still manages to retain a 'local' feel despite the many tourists.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "londoner-reviews", "ReviewID": "UR116656188", "Content": "The location of Hotel Banke is perfect - close to shops, restaurants and sightseeing.

For anyone who is unfamiliar with Paris, you very rarely get hotels with big rooms, and for a hotel that has been converted from - well - a bank it is pretty obvious small rooms will be the norm. They do have some larger ones, and if you prefer a big room, then it is probably best to check out the standard you are booking first so avoid being disappointed. We have always stayed for two nights in a standard room and found it perfectly fine, as we are usually out most of the day. On our last stay we were there for longer so opted to pay a bit more for a bigger room. Of course it is expensive to eat and drink in the hotel - as it is virtually anywhere in the Euro zone these days, I would recommend anyone staying who is concerned with the price of a breakfast to venture out of the hotel, walk down the Rue Lafayette for five minutes in the direction of the Gare du Nord, to General Lafayette, get yourself a table outside, a coffee and a croissant and watch the Parisian world go by. It is such a waste to sit in a hotel restaurant, in any big city, you could just about be anywhere in the world. There is a photo on the site from a previous review which has 'dark, scary corridors', poor them, they have completely missed the point of a boutique hotel with subdued lighting. One tip.....We have over our four stays got better in speeding up our journey. If you have taken Eurostar, and have only got hand luggage you can walk to the hotel in about 15 minutes. You can actually stand in the taxi queue for that long, and then as the hotel is on a one way street you end up going the long way round, so if it it at a busy time of the day, your journey can take almost half an hour.

The hotel is a beautifully restored building in the Opera district, about 20 minutes walk from Gare du Nord (which is really convenient if you come in by Eurostar) and the rooms are fully sound-proofed and very comfortable. We travelled with our toddler and the staff gave us a room on the lowest floor (so that the baby monitor would work in the restaurant) and provided a travel cot. However, the weekend was a bit spoilt by two things. One being the air-conditioning in our room, which refused to work properly despite an engineer trying to fix it - the temperature reached almost 27 degrees during the night,. which made things quite uncomfortable. We had to open the window, which sort of defeated the whole point of soundproofing and did affect our sleep quality. The second, and more important, thing was the cost of food & drink at the hotel. On the first night we ordered a (very) small beer and a lemonade at the bar, and paid 20 Euros! Our evening meal, without wine, cost almost 150 Euros. Breakfast is 56 Euros for two people, without any hot dishes included (and goes up to 64 Euros for a continental room service breakfast).

Mosaic flooring in the foyer area, marble beams. Black chairs, black lift \u2013 everything is dark. No natural light. - Hotel could use fresh flowers in the foyer area as it is very cold and bland. The lounge is too open and does not feel relaxing as the seats are uncomfortable. - Lobby includes abstract, contemporary art-deco objects with strong colours used \u2013 red and black. - As with the ceiling height the building naturally feels cold and there has not been enough done to make the atmosphere relaxing and comfortable as the colour scheme is too bold. This \u2018cold\u2019 feeling goes on in the hallways and rooms. This is due to the lack of classic furnishings and texture \u2013 the interior is too corporate and dense. - Rooms are very modern and remind of a hotel chain as there is not much personality in the rooms. Some of the suites have a small walk-way balcony. The beds are white linen with 2 pillows and a bed-spread, no cushions. Although attractive, rooms are basic and very minimalistic and do not provide a luxurious feel. The hotel is too corporate and does not reflect a Parisian establishment but that of a chain, which it is, a Spanish chain. - There is a small spa/sauna with a very small fitness; however the area is not very private in its location of the hotel \u2013 first floor. - The breakfast area resembles a luxurious modern eating area \u2013 goes around in a circle. Fresh fruit and pastries on offer with the option of an American breakfast. However, as there is a hostess ticking guests\u2019 names off, she does not escort guests to a table nor does she explain how the menu works. Very confusing and frustrating for guests. - During our stay, there was filming taking place in the main lobby of the hotel and there were many cables etc. thus had to be careful when walking in and out. - Although staff is polite, they are slow and somewhat young and na\u00efve. A bit unprofessional and not completely sincere when dealing with guests; they seem very business like and do not seem to pursue good customer relationships. Furthermore, porters at the front entrance of the hotel seemed slack, uninterested, young and not maintaining professional posture. Their attire is completely inappropriate as it resembles a casual security look, not suits, and they were wearing trainers! Not exactly the image you would expect for a hotel that advertises itself as \u20184-star superior\u2019. Also, the hotel could benefit from small trees outside the main entrance as it is very plain and not totally recognisable as a hotel. - The general vibe from this hotel is very urban, cold and dense. The hotel does not reflect an empire-luxurious hotel nor would you know you were in the heart of Paris\u2026 In my opinion, it is far too overpriced (rack rates standard single 475 euros, standard double 580 euros, executive 685 euros, deluxe 970 euros, junior suite 1722 euros), it does not have an overwhelming hospitable environment, there is too much open empty space in the foyer area and the rooms are small. The building is beautiful, however, it has not been effectively decorated to provide a luxurious environment to guests; there is no identity.

The lobby is gorgeous and staff were ready to help with bags, printing out walking directions, finding cabs, and even providing umbrellas in the rain/snow. Booked a standard room and it was great. Fit myself and my spouse perfectly, little love seat, ample closet space, comfy bed, minibar, and bath with tub and also freestanding shower.

It was this attention to customer service that first piqued my curiosity and had me booking eventually. I said, if top management pays this much attention to Tripadvisor, surely they take well care of their guests indeed. I was not wrong. On arrival, Mr. Xavi Vega met us in the lobby for a very warm and friendly welcome. His staff were notably swift and helpful and we were upgraded to a deluxe room that overlooked the bustling street. The room was large, immaculate and charming, with an artistic flair that matched the legendary lobby. Space is obviously at a premium in Paris, so all that legroom was very much appreciated. The malachite green bathroom is serviceable and was a tad cold in design and feeling for my taste; but that's a minor point to the overall cleanliness of the place. The room might also use a few more lights or stronger lamps; the wan winter light of January begs for a bit more illumination. Free WiFi worked very well the entire time we were there. I had stayed the week before New Year's in a hotel around the Trocadero area...how I wish I had opted for this hotel earlier! The location is central and lively; it is a stone throw away from the department stores, perfect for our last few days in Europe for much needed retail therapy. The front desk were very helpful in giving suggestions on where to eat and where to go; they recommended Le Petit Riche for our last evening and it was a divine experience. There are plenty of cafes around the area too and the busy, festive Opera is around the corner for even more choices. We walked to most places, enjoying the hotel's central location, whether it was to the Vendome, the Louvre or the Tuileries. On rainy days, the guys at the door front were quick to offer an umbrella. Check out was swift and orderly. We decided to save a bit of our buck for the trip to the airport, opting to walk to the Roissy Airport Shuttle which was 5 min. away. I think it's a great idea as it only cost 9.80 euro per person, compared to what you'd have to pay on a taxi or even a shared shuttle. All said, I think Mr. Vega runs a tight ship; his efforts polish the hotel to spanking shine and the hotel justly deserves it's rising ranks on Travel+Leisure and Tripadvisor.

Location Location Location. Its a stone throw from the old opera house and located along La Fayette (where all the shops are). We walked from our hotel to the Lourve, Notre Dame and the Eiffel tower (make sure you pre purchase your Eiffel tower tickets on line or you will be waiting in the longest que ever). The Sienne is also close by and recommended as the route of choice. The resturants in the Hotel are very expensive but very French. You get what you pay for i.e it is very fine dining. I noticed there were local people who were not staying at the hotel also dining there. The rooms are amazing and the hotel foyer is really something. Suggest you google this and check out a few pictures. Anyway the French are nuts about good food. Here are my thoughts... go to La Fayette food department in the shopping centre for brekky, they open at 8.30am (rest of the department store opens at 9.30am) go to level 1 and have a coffee and a pasrty! while you are there pick up a picnic lunch and eat this in the gardens inbetween the Lourve and the Champs Elyees. Many Parisians grab a bottle and picnic dinner to eat along the Sienne.... I know this because we did a river cruise twice!!! Once during the day and once at night... this is a must do. especially at night its only 13 Euros... We made an effort with our limited French (i.e Bonjour) and its amazing how far you can get with a smile. If you are Australian, make it know as soon as possible. The place is full of English and Americians and being Australian is still somewhat still a novelty!!!

Based on that, Hotel Banke is a true 4 star hotel - it is amazingly clean and well kept by all the staff and the bedrooms and bathrooms are emaculate - no mould, dirt, funny smells, stains or anything to put us off at all. We stayed in an Executive Room, so cannot comment on the standard rooms. The Exec room we had was an ample size for a few days, but if you are staying for longer then you may want to upgrade for the sake of space and louge space. Although, there was a swivel flat-screen TV on the wall which was great so you could watch TV from any angle, however they only had one chair - very comfortable, but slightly too large for the room. The closet space is good - plenty of hanging space and shelves for shoes etc, which is very handy. I liked the way it was hidden away in the wall! The toilet is separate from the combo bath/shower and sink - I think that is such a useful feature when you are sharing a room and it even had it's own little sink. You can leave your toiletries at home too, as the hotel provide them all, albeit own-brand. Beds were very comfy too and you get nice slippers and robes to slip into. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and cannot do enough for you - especially Jose the doorman! He gave us an umbrella and map on our first day - very thoughtful! Now, the restaurant 'Josefin' - that deserves it's own review! It's pricey, but everywhere in Paris is to be honest, however the food is to die for!

It looked perfect for what I was looking for. I managed to get a suite within my budget which was great. Overall the hotel was nice, Clean and comfortable. The staff we friendly and it was in a good location. If i had to be honest about the negatives then the mini bar was way overprice. 8 Euro's for a can of Coke! 7 Euro's for a 250ml of water. I thought this was a joke. For this reason we didn\u2019t even entertain the idea of going to the hotel restaurant or bar. Oh also the cheapest bottle of wine was 45 Euro's. To beat this we went to the local shop and got 2 bottles of wine and some snacks for our stay. After leaving them in our room with the do not disturb on we came back to find them all missing like we had never been to the shop. I was very annoyed at (A) they went in the room with the sign on the door (B) that this happened in the first place. I have to say that they did handle it very well and apologised and replaced the missing goods. Lastly the hotel looks beautiful and it will certainly impress anyone walking through those doors BUT its way too dark, they could do so much better with the lighting. This is the only thing that really put me off. Oh and no one so far has mentioned the rumble of the metro every 4 minutes. Even throughout the night. Yes even from the 4th floor.

I found a special advance purchase deal at this hotel through the Small Luxury Hotels slh.com website for EUR198 a night, which is pretty good for a four-star hotel in Paris, with breakfast included and complimentary wifi Internet. I booked for two nights. The experience started badly from the start. I arrived on foot with two bags in two. There were two men standing against the wall in front of the hotel - neither wore anything that indicated they were Banke employees. (Whatever the management says to the contrary, I maintain that this is the case.) So as I made to enter the hotel and carry my bags up the stairs at the entrance, one of these men asked to help. I was very wary of the approach because there was no way for me to know if this person was actually a hotel employee. So I carried my bags up myself until I got into the hotel door. The check-in itself was okay but there was no care to confirm the rate and room type (executive double) that I had booked. The lobby itself was very interesting. The building used to be a bank. The decor may not be to everybody's taste, but it looked like a fun place and I generally found it appealing. Once in the room, I was somewhat disappointed. I found it odd that a room that is supposed to be for an executive had NO DESK or workspace. And the only place to sit was an uncomfortable bench built into the wall!!!!!! Otherwise, you had to sit on the bed!!!! Very weird. The room was large enough and so was the bathroom (separate from the toilet room). But again, the designer-itis (obsession with form over function) showed through. The lack of any proper workspace was one problem. The lack of any security peephole in the door so that you can check who is at the door was another. The owners seemed to not really think about the needs of the guest. Less than an hour after settling into my room, I tried to get on the Internet. I was told that the wifi was out of order and that a technician was supposedly on the way to fix it. This turned out NOT to be true. I was invited to use the Internet at the reception. I thought this meant the lobby. In fact, it literally meant the reception!!!!! They put me at one of the computer terminals of the front desk. NO CHAIR!!!!! The screen was too low. The keyboard was the weird French keyboard. This was simply no way to do work or even to check email. I asked if there was any other option such as a desk with a computer - No, I was told. This was simply unacceptable and I told the management so. Some manager named Stella offered excuses - the Internet problem was not the hotels. But the fact that the hotel could not offer an adequate failsafe option for the busted Internet was again a major fault, in my view. I decided to check out only after one night and demanded a refund for the second night. The hotel agreed but for some reason refunded me what had been charged for the second night minus EUR24. I emailed them to ask why and to demand the EUR24 back but NEVER GOT A RESPONSE. I stayed the one night, which was pleasant enough. The bar was quite good - I liked its arrangement. For a Friday night, however, it was dead! I went back the next night to check it out because I liked the feel of it, but it was similarly dead!!! In fact, the best part of the hotel was the bar - the two bartenders there... Michael and another young fellow...were great. On the Saturday night (after I had moved out), I chatted with them for a while and they were very accommodating and friendly. That bar and the bartenders deserve more patronage. After staying the night, I left for another hotel in the morning. I did have breakfast in the breakfast room in the basement. I don't get why they make you have breakfast in the dungeon where it's dark, rather than upstairs where you can get some natural light. The breakfast buffet spread was pretty mediocre - certainly not worth paying what they charge. So would I stay again at the Banke? Only if I could get another good package deal and the Internet service were working. On check in, I found the staff member there - some clean-cut French guy - to have been so frustratingly impertinent. He insisted several times that the staff member who met me at the door of the hotel had a hotel badge on. Even if that had been the case, which it wasn't, he should have let it go and just given me, the customer, the benefit of the doubt. He also refunded me less than what I actually paid for for the second night.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Espa\u00f1a", "Title": "\u201cI expected more than I found\u201d", "Author": "JJGM", "ReviewID": "UR57078748", "Content": "Rooms are small and impersonal.

Also it is far too hot, none of these are pleasurable sensations particularly at breakfast. The meal itself is fine although service is uneven. Why not leave a coffee pot on the table rather than having to attract the attention of the waiter who is more interested in looking at his own reflection. There is no indication that you could have a cooked breakfast but if you ask you can have eggs. A hotel of this standard should inform you of this fact. I think they would be far better off serving breakfast on the ground floor; there is plenty of room and it would give the impression of some life. They need more Parisians to use the bar and restaurant but then again these outlets have only recently opened so maybe in a year there will be more of a buzz.

We thought not.", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cTrying Hard\u201d", "Author": "shalders", "ReviewID": "UR46740853", "Content": "The Banke Hotel received a good write up in Australias Qantas magazine so this was the reason why we chose to stay at the Hotel. The negatives outweigh the positives so here they are; There was no iron in the room so we used the Hotel fast service, 3 shirts were given at midday and requested that they be returned for dinner & a show by 7pm that day. The Hotel staff said that this would be fine. At 7pm no shirts had been returned. Hotel staff said they would follow-up but we received no reply. The next day we asked for the shirts to be available by that evening - they weren't. So again we went out to dinner in rumpled clothes. It was only when my husband said we were leaving early the next morning and got cross that the hotel staff cared. The shirts arrived 10pm that night. We asked why there wasn't an iron anywhere in the Hotel, and were told they were considered dangerous. Pathetic. We were in room 317 - very difficult to get around the end of the bed and almost no area around the side when the 2 bags were placed on the floor. The air conditioning in this room is useless, again we discussed this with the hotel staff. They looked into this and solved it by turning it up higher. It just made the room even hotter. We solved it by opening our room door to let some cool air in. Unacceptable in a 4 star hotel.

If there is somebody in front of the mirror, watch out when opening the door. Why they didn\u00b4t go for a sliding door is beyond me. And then we experienced what every hotel guest dreds: flooding of the bathroom when taking a shower. That is a problem that can easily be fixed. Why they don\u00b4t fix it is, again, beyond me. We ordered room service 3 times: First time was just ice. They charged 6\u20ac for a glass filled with ice. Bit steep I would say. Second time was between 3-4 am --> very limited offer.

It is a part of Derby Hotel Collections based in Spain - developed with modern concept in mind. They have a quiet numbers of good properties - such as Claris in Barcelona or Hotel Urban in Madrid. Trying to branch out of Spain, Banke is their second properties after London (The Caesar). Flipping through my Hotel bookmark list for Paris, this belovely city only has around 25-35 hotels that I can consider as a 4 to 5 stars properties (from Geoerge V to small boutique Hotel Kappler), with rate starting around \u20ac200/night in high season. Hoel Banke got my attention not only because of its best location (especially for shopping) but also becaused its original building architekture and the most the promotion price offered which is very low. I decided to try one night stay at this property - only to get a glimps - see if this new property really worth 4 stars rating. Arrival was Ok, The bellperson were available upon arrival and did offered his assistance immediately. Check in went smooth - standard service, lack of personal touch (smile and warmness feeling of welcome). The room was small but well appointed. The bathroom is clean and has separate WC. My room has a few direct to Rue La Fayette, it gave more light to the room. I love the original High Celling struckture which give more roomy feeling. The hotel restaurant and lobby bar look wonderful but I did not try them . My overall rating for this hotel will be OK - Standard acceptable service. It will be in the 3,5 stars category of accommodation. This will be a good place for the business travellers or the tourists who don't need extra services and are please with good value offers, clean room and good location. The free Internet is a good added value to the hotel rate. Will I stay at this property again ? Depends.. Will they still offer the good Promotion Rate? For the good value and good location, I certainly can recommend this property.

For the area, the hotel is very nice and a good value. The rooms are nice, clean and modern. Aircon issues may have been a new opening issue, because they are fixed now. I have stayed in the Banke several times as well as many other hotels within walking distance as I have an office near the Bourse in Paris. The bell/concierge staff and the front desk staff are generally very good and friendly and one of the bright spots of the hotel. Be wary of the great deals and free breakfast referred to in many post- they were intro offers to get good reviews of the hotel and have now been discontinued. That being said, the hotel would still be a good value if not for the reasons below. I would not recommend the hotel, nor could I find myself staying there again due to a lack of responsiveness of the hotel management after I informed them that we had money stolen from our room. It was in my wife's wallet, in her purse, in her suitcase- so it took quite some attempt by the thief to get to it- a major concern that your personal items are not safe in the room!! Of even bigger concern was that the hotel management is apparantely not too concerned with theft from the rooms in their hotel. This occured on Saturday during the afternoon/evening and as I type on Monday afternoon, I still have yet to receive a response other than \"we'll look into it\". Nothing has been done yet, because apparently the general manager is the only on empowered to investigate, and they would not be able to get to it until the work week (which I still have not heard anything at this point). I'd expect theft to be a high priority- it is not. Safety and protection of my personal goods are the #1 concern to me in a hotel, thus all other good points(which there are many) are negated. Small time theft, I'm not concerned about the money, but the principal remains that the management is not concerned with this type of event.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "germany", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "bi17", "ReviewID": "UR34711363", "Content": "This is the first contemporary hotel in Paris.
