It was well worth the price. The room was spacious, the beds comfortable, and the bathroom fully appointed. The hotel (also know as the Hotel Villa Konstanz) is 7 KM southwest of the Brandenburger Tor. The closest Metro station (Konstanzer. Str.) is only three blocks away, so access to all areas of Berlin is easy. The hotel is 3 KM NE of the Grunewald, a huge forest with excellent walking/jogging paths. There is plenty of space for off-street parking (no additional charge). The street in front of the hotel is noisy but the double pane, well insulated windows cut out virtually all exterior noise. The breakfast buffet is excellent with numerous options. The staff was friendly and helpful. In particular, they took care of reservations needed to visit the Reichstag (3-day advance booking is the norm).", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cperfect stay\u201d", "Author": "186402Andy", "ReviewID": "UR108623608", "Content": "Lovely stay in this small but ideal, budget hotel. Near the underground, which runs out to the airport, and easy to get into the centre. Based in Wilmersdorf which is a nice area, well located for bars and restaurants.
