{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lovely hotel. Just spent three days and nights at the Hotel am Dom, Frankfurt. I am 73 and was with my daughter. The hotel was lovely, everything was beautifully clean. The breakfasts were extremely good and plentiful. The hotel was situated in a perfect position with regard to the Christmas Market and shopping at The Zeil and we heard no noise at night. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and couldn't do anything more to make our stay perfect. I happily recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "Dec 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR274991188", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "judyross"}, {"Content": "Great place to stay in Frankfurt.
