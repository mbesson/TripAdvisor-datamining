Obviously, I chose the hotel in large part due to its proximity to the airport and free frequent shuttle service. I was arriving at MIA airport around 10 pm at night and had a flight out the next morning. Everything started well. The hotel shuttle pulled up as soon as I walked out of the airport. On arrival at the hotel, I was impressed with the lobby and lively atmosphere. I was looking forward to checking into my room and trying out the bar/restaurant. When I attempted to check in, the clerk noted my name and attempted to find my room details in the stack of guest folios in front of him. He excused himself for a few minutes and returned to tell me that the hotel was \"oversold\" and there was no room for me. This was despite me holding an email confirmation saying that I had a \"confirmed\" room guaranteed by credit card. I accepted his news and did not put up an argument like most people would, in part because he told me I would just be staying right next door at the Courtyard Marriott. The clerk asked me to sit on the couch in the lobby for a few minutes. I did so. I watched other guests check in during this time. I have no idea why there reservations were honored by mine was not. The clerk then brought me paperwork for the free room at the Courtyard Marriott. He told me that the Courtyard Marriott was next door in the same complex and that I simply had to walk down the hall, take a left, and then take a right out the double doors and walk by the pool and I would be in the Courtyard Marriott. I did so. I waited in line to check in at the Airport Courtyard Marriott and handed over my \"free room\" paperwork. The Courtyard Marriott folks looked at the paperwork with puzzled looks and then told me the truth: I was actually being sent to the Downtown Courtyard Marriott, a 15 minute taxi ride away. The downtown Courtyard Marriott is an inferior property in an urban environment next to a loud, busy street. The Airport Marriott did pay for my stay there and the (one way) taxi fare downtown. However, I wasn't looking for a free stay at an inferior property far from the airport and one way taxi fare to get there. All I wanted and expected was for the Airport Marriott to honor the reservation that I guaranteed with a credit card, so that I could get a full night's sleep before my flight the next day.

Service is so-so.\u201d", "Author": "nsipod", "ReviewID": "UR122653519", "Content": "LOOK AND FEEL UPON ARRIVAL: I arrived here 2 days ago for a business trip. The front lobby looks great! I heard they went through a renovation, and the front lobby has a very \"cool\" and south beach/miami type of theme. I think a lot of people would be impressed. Unfortunately, the main restaurant and bar are open and appear to be part of the lobby. I prefer it when a restaurant is separated so I dont see incoming guests watching me dine. The Fire Grill restaurant that they have in the lobby is not that great and I dont recommend eating here. I had a gnocchi for $19, but it was probably worth about $12. The alcohol was overpriced as well. CHECK IN: The check in experience was not good at all. The line for check in was VERY long. There were only 2 people trying to check in a line of about 40 guests. The process took about 45 minutes to get through. If you are coming to this hotel, do not arrive between 6-8PM on a weekday. The staff was polite and very nice, but I felt as though they should be quicker and more accommodating to guests requests. ELITE MEMBERS: There is a lounge (evening snacks, dessert, and breakfast), but thats about it when it comes to benefits. I am an elite member and was not offered an upgrade. There are 3 levels of business rooms, and even when I asked, I was told nothing was available. Instead, I was placed in a \"Pure Room\", which I will discuss later. I know the place looked busy, but I also know that the place was not at full capacity. LOUNGE FOR ELITE MEMBERS: Weekdays, its open from 5-10PM, I believe. The first day, there was some chicken thing, 3 types of cheeses and saltines, pretzels, coffee, and soda+water. Unfortunately, the chicken dish had pretty much run out by the time I saw it, and no one refilled it for the 20 minutes that I was there (I figured that they were instructed to just refill it every hour or something, I dont know). The attendant was very nice though, and seemed to enjoy talking to guests and keeping everyone happy. The lounge is physically small and cramped. If you go for breakfast, be there early enough to get a table. There is only 1 computer as well, so be ready to wait your turn. Breakfast was a little disappointing. They had bagels, some danishes (once again, they had run out by the time I saw them), fruit (which was really good), cereal (lots of selection), juices, coffee, and oatmeal. Most of the marriott breakfasts I go to seem to have more options. The only real issue I had with the lounge was the small size and that the staff did not refill items very quickly. ROOMS: I am an elite member and was given a basic room on the 6th floor. This is a \"PURE\" room, which is supposed to be allergy free/etc. The room was clean and nice, and it had a good view of Miami. The bed was nice and soft, room was clean and had a good feel, and the bathrooms were clean and spacous. Like other guests have mentioned, the walls are a little thin and you can hear people walking around the halls. Unfortunately, on either side of me were families with little kids who were yelling and screaming all night. -- I had one major issue with my room as well. The KEY LOCK on the room ended up having a low battery. I first got into my room and it worked just fine. I put my stuff inside and went to the lounge, but when I came back, the key didnt work. I went to the downstairs lobby and got another key (I thought it may have been my fault). The second key didnt work. I went back down and got a third key. This worked and I was able to change my clothes for dinner. When I came back, my key didnt work again. I went to the lobby again and asked for another key. At this point, I also requested a room change (but was denied. Not sure why, and was more disappointed). I was told that, \"maybe the battery is low and security will come check\". I got another key and got into my room. Security called my room and said, \"are you in?\" Yes, Im inside. \"Okay, it works then. bye.\" Well, the next day, my key didnt work again!!! I requested a room change again, but was denied. The lobby person came upstairs with me, and even his master-key didnt work!!! I went back up to the lounge for a few minutes, and security came over and said, \"your key and lock are fine. there is no problem\". After 7 keys, I didnt believe him, but also didnt have the patience to deal with it any more. I just ended up leaving my room unlocked for the remainder of the time that I was there. It is very unfortunate that this Marriott has not learned how to treat their guests with a little more understanding and provide a quicker resolution. PARKING: Its always full and you need your room key to get in and out. Half the people who were there didnt seem to have working keys, so you had to wait to get out. This is the hotel's fault and they really should come up with another solution. My recommendation is to have one staff member there at all times. CONCLUSION: I might stay here again, but I would be very reluctant. I would NOT eat here again (Miracle Mile is 10 minutes away and has good restaurants - take a cab). Prior to checking in, I would call the hotel and verify that the room Im getting is on a better floor and away from kids with allergies. I would not use the pool (it is very small and shared with the Courtyard Marriott).", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cMarriott Miami Airport location\u201d", "Author": "Gendreauj", "ReviewID": "UR122186378", "Content": "Very nice hotel.

There were computer terminals in the lobby and fresh cold water by the elevator. There also always seemed to be an elevator waiting for me. When I got to my room, things were a little lower class but not horrible. The bathroom though was less than wonderful. It was indeed very small. The tub took up the bulk of the space. The ceiling tiles were stained and ill-fitting. I don't understand why a hotel would spend good money to redo some aspects and not others?! Get rid of the tub and put in a nice stall shower and you'd free up space in the bathroom making it much better. The gym was better than a lot I've seen but it was in a different building! This is not so bad going but the last thing I want to do after sweating for an hour is go outside while still wet. Internet was not free but ran about $18/day with tax.

I'm a Marriott Platinum and my stays are for business. This property has been around for many years, but is \"an Olde, but Goode\" and has been nicely renovated. It is a Very Good Place to Stay; obviously convenient to the airport , convenient to all highways, easy to get to the beaches if you want to break away and other places for some fun. Little Havana is easy to get to from the hotel. Go south and a left turn on 8th St (US HWY 41). You'll know when you get there. I usually hub out of this property when visiting clients to the south and to the north. Non-business stay should be cost effective and enjoyable too. They do have a very nice pool and various outside lounge areas that can distract and take you away from where you are actually staying, i.e. close to the airport. I think would works well for R&R for short term or maybe a week when looking for a full service hotel and not willing to pay resort prices. Staying at this property is always very interesting because of all the international guests that come and go It's almost as if your were staying in another country, i.e. South America for example. And that only adds to the enjoyment of staying at this property. The hotel lobby and the rooms have been very nicely renovated. I've never experienced any issues. The concierge Lounge and staff is always very nice and friendly. It's one of the few properties that doesn't lock the doors at 10PM sharp and so if coming in later you can usually grab a desert and coffee if running late. (not the norm and no guarantee, but they do attempt to leave the door open while staying to clean the lounge before leaving for the night.} The staff is customer focused. Close to the airport, but noise from the airport doesn't filter into the rooms too badly at all and I've never had a night where airport noised was an issue. Always a nice night's sleep. No guarantee that you can't get rude guests that come in and out every so often, especially more on a weekend stay than mid week, but that can happen at any property. Should that happen the staff is responsive to try to resolve any rude guests. The hotel restaurant is very good and the staff is very attentive. I've gotten to know Ira, who mans the bar and has been there for over 25 years. He's always friendly and makes my stay that much more enjoyable. I believe much of the staff are long timers. The staff is wonderful at this property and all seem very happy, which attests to the many who have been on staff for many years. The rooms are very nice, renovated and always maintained. Typical Marriott business hotel rooms. Nothing more to add here. I always stay on the Concierge level, as they always upgrade Plats, etc. Look for deals on the Marriott website that offer free self parking and it will save you a few bucks each day. Usually under a AAA rate or search the deals and promotions. The property is actually a compound or sorts and shares property with Courtyard and Residence Inn. There is a Fairfield Inn adjacent too, but is outside of the property grounds. This Marriott might look old from the outside and shows an older buildout Marriott Airport look, but don't get fooled... This is a very nice property and recommend it. Only giving a Very Good and not excellent rating because trying to be totally objective in that this is an older property and at the airport, but this is an excellent property all around in my opinion. Note: Le Jeune Road is usually very busy, so just be careful, especially when turning left out of the property and going south.

The facility is simple but very clean and has everything you need - nice pool, clean, comfortable rooms, safe and secure location, and seriously fabulous service.

The airport shuttle was quick and easy. The lobby is gorgeous and the room and bathroom seemed normal hotel size to me. I'm wondering if there are different sized rooms since there are so many complaints of small bathrooms. The bedding was also very nice and comfortable. All the staff from the front desk to the restaurant were great. The water dispenser by the elevators with fruit was a nice touch and was refreshing after coming in from the warm weather to be able to grab some water. Our rate included breakfast. It was good, but I probably wouldn't pay $20+ for a breakfast buffet normally. The food was good and the service excellent, I just don't eat that much for breakfast to make it worthwhile for me if it weren't included in the rate. Some others in our party ate at the little Cuban place right outside the front gate and raved about how good and inexpensive it was. We also had a lovely lunch in the Cane Fire restaurant that actually cost less than the breakfast would have! We also really enjoyed the pool area and some much needed warm weather! We had dinner one night at Champions in the Courtyard next door which was pretty good. Our server was a bit overwhelmed since there was some sort of big football game on and it was extremely crowded and loud in there. I would eat there again as long as there wasn't a big game on since it was too loud to have a conversation at the table. There's not a lot in the immediate area but there is a shopping center with a K-mart and a Walgreens within about a 10 minute walk. We headed out mid day on a Saturday to pick up some sodas and snacks. A word of caution here - the neighborhood behind the hotel leading to this shopping center is a bit rough. I'm sure there are much worse in Miami, but four of us walking (including two large guys) became uncomfortable very quickly. We stuck to the main roads on our walk back and they were fine so you might want to go that route when walking. Cruise shuttle the day of our departure was a breeze. We had tickets included in the cruise package and others in our group purchased them for $11 per person. The shuttle was right on time and an easy and efficient way to get to the port. Overall, I'd defintely stay again at the Marriott or at one of the other hotels in the complex.

It's approximately 10 mins at the most from the airport and there are regular shuttles to and from the hotel. The reception was very warm and we were dealt with very quickly and efficiently. The room was pretty spacious for an airport hotel and had a large, very clean bathroom with shower/bath, loo and sink. There was adequate wardrobe space a queen sized bed, numerous drawes and a huge T.V which had Sky. For an additional charge you could use the internet in your room but we didn't as there was free internet access in the hotel lobby and seating area. As there were three of us, we phoned down tor reception to see if they had an extra bed that could be placed in the room. Within minutes a huge rollabed was delivered and assembled by the maid. It was a proper bed and very comfortable indeed; when they had said a rollabed, I thought they'd bring a thick mattress!!! Maid service was speedy and they came everyday to replace shampoos etc and generally tidy and empty bins. All the hotel staff were wonderful and kept us well informed of any messages from our travel company as to when we might fly via face to face contact and phone messages on the two phones in our room. There was a pool at the back of the hotel which was well supplied with sun loungers and chairs and tables and there was a frequent supply of fresh towels too. The pool was shared with the sister hotel, the Courtyard, and we could also use their well equipped gym. We didn't spend lots of time in the hotel but the concierge, Luis, was very knowledgeable and arranged a trip to the Everglades for us which was about an hour's drive away. We were thrilled as we had spent 2 weeks in the Keys previously, staying at the Hawks Key Resort in Duck Cay which was totally awesome (see my review) and had felt that it was too long a drive to visit the Everglades from Marathon. The trip was excellent and we went on an airboat too! We had organised on our return to spend two hours at The Bayside Shopping Center; out of this world, and then the coach from the hotel collected us around 4pm and took us back to the Marriott. From the airport you could also get buses all over the place so we went to South Beach which was beautiful and the shopping malls and went on the city's metrorail which was free so we were able to see more of Miami. We also visited Dolphin Mall which was enormous; about 10 times the size of Gunwharf Key in Portsmouth! Also near to the airport was an outlet Village and a massive Nike shop which was well worth the visit. The food at the hotel was great too. There were two menus to choose from; a bar menu with dishes ready in 5, 10 and 20 minutes which ranged from $5.00 to $20.00 and a restaurant menu which had lots of choice and prices started at $8.00 for a starter to a maximum of $35.00 for a maincourse, though most were around $20.00. Drinks were reasonably priced too and they had refills on soft drinks and pineapple juice at no extra charge. There was also a Starbucks in the lobby which was open until around 4pm. The staff were very friendly and always happy to chat and make recommendations. I would recommend this hotel either for a one night stopover travelling through (which many people did) or if you are delayed in flying due to volcanoes!! We had a lovely time there and were so pleased to not only have an extra week of our holiday due to the volcano but to be able to spend it in such a friendly and well equipped hotel.

Ultra modern if you like that style. The food is really good at Cane's, albeit pricey. We stayed twice (pre & post cruise). the first room was in the concierge level since we're frequent Marriott members. They did not give us the King or extra pillows promised, but that was not a big deal. ( I had booked this room several months ago with my choices of beds, extra pillows). The second night, we got the king, but they sent us to one of their PURE rooms. It had one of those air cleaning machines. I have to say my hubbie does suffer allergies and cannot tolerate even slightly dirty A/C filters, but he rarely has a problem at a nice Marriott anyway. I think it's unnecessary. They say they have specially treated sheets. Probably use Frabreeze and/or, put the dryer on high. Actually, that's all they can do. Hubbie was as comfy in this room as the other. They did not charge us the extra $ for the room, lucky us. Problem is, I noted the room was smaller (6th flr) than the concierge level rooms so we lost out on the extra room-no problem, it was one night, it's just that there were several little things we were disappointed in. The pool and the jacuzzi were nice, but in the shade all day. The ice maker didn't work on our floor. I caught a floor person (not a room cleaner) and she sent me one floor up for ice, which, jeesh, had a sign that said no ice on that floor, so I walked (I use stairs a lot) 2 floors down for the ice then went back to my room happy to have hunted down the elusive icy beast. No biggee, just funny. CONCIERGE info: The concierge lounge is good in that it offers free internet. The coffee is less than fair and was cold one of the mornings, you will probably opt for the Starbucks in the lobby. The eggs were in the typical chafing dish and were horrible. They were so dry and rubbery that they were orange colored on top. There were other items, such as cut up fruit which was not fresh and mostly nasty. I could give examples, but you get the idea. There was cereal, pastries, and milk. The pre-packaged stuff was okay, but any prepared items were stale, over-ripe or cold. In the evening, there were drinks and cheese/crackers, old-ish cut fruit but barely anything very edible. There was one (same chafing dish) full of what I would call Beef a Roni. It was dismally bad. Even my easy to please husband hated it. When I called Marriott before I booked, they said the airport shuttle came every 10-12 minutes. Wrong, it comes every 1/2 hour, and it comes on the upper level, not down a floor, so beware. The cost to the cruise ship was $11 per person but no return. It now comes at 11, 12 or 1. Do tell the front desk and get a ticket. It costs about $24 for 2 by taxi. The shuttle forgot us the second time. The hotel blamed the shuttle company (a contracted business) and the shuttle company blamed Marriott. So, after a call from the mgr (?) they came by. No apologies, just excuses. They ended up being 25 min late saying the \"...ship wasn't going anywhere until 5.\" Seriously, not the point. To end all, when my husband talked to the mgr about the late shuttle, and suggested that the concierge needed some suggestions on cuisine, the mgr said he would add points to our stay. This did not happen. I do not know what happened there. (My husband is very gentlemanly and polite so he did not have an attitude, btw).

A Fairfield Inn sits close by, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share anything with the Marriott, Courtyard and Residence Inn.

No one wants to stay in a room filled with pollen and dust. The front desk clerk assured me all the rooms were dust free. The whole concept seemed confusing, but clearly a way for the Miami Airport Marriott to slap guest with a $20 upgrade fee if other rooms are sold out. As a Platinum member I got a free upgrade to a mini suite. It was very nice. It had a living room with sofa, two flat screens, large dining table, nice bedroom and huge large bathroom. Everything was perfect, except the lock to the door. Here's the hiccup! I was unhappy that the door to my room was open all day. I noticed this when I returned that evening at 6:30 pm. The key didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. However, when I leaned on the door to try to figure out what was wrong, it opened. I called security right away to investigate the situation. At 6:45 pm Mr. Kent from security arrived and checked the door. He tried the key and found it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. He then pushed on the door and found it opened into the room. He took the lock apart and noticed that a new lock needed to be installed. During the course of about an hour, Marriott security drilled holes in the door jam and installed a locking system that worked properly. This was an inconvenience for me as a hotel guest. However, I wanted to make sure it was fixed before we left to go back out. No one followed up to see if we were pleased with the outcome. General manager John Mulrey was unavailable. I later found out his is no longer with Marriott though his name appears in the room literature. Bad job Marriott Airport for not having an up to date management list in the Guest Services book. The front desk threw in some bonus Marriott reward points and free dinner at the restaurant for the hassle.

We always hope for the best, but anticipate problems. There is no such thing as a perfect stay, but this came pretty darn close. After a delay in our flight, we arrived in Miami at 11 pm. Upon arrival, do not go down to Ground Transportation. Instead, walk outside the doors and wait for the shuttle. It is a red and white shuttle bus that says Miami Airport South on the front. The driver was extremely friendly and helped us with our bags. A few more quick stops and we were at the hotel, which shares the property with the Courtyard Marriott. Upon entering the facility, you will be taken aback by the beautiful interior. This is no typical airport hotel as the decor is fashionable and high end. I arrived at the front desk and Alisa, the manager, waited on me. In the shuttle they had a continuous video about the Pure rooms so I thought I would inquire about it. Instead of going to the 7th floor Concierge Level, we ended up on the 6th floor Pure level. If you or anyone you are staying with has allergies or asthma, try this room. You immediately notice a difference once inside. The air is clean and I was excited about a decent night's sleep. Before bed we went down to the restaurant, Cane Fire Grille. Incredible -- really! It was late, but we were hungry so we had a few little plates and some drinks. The black bean soup was a large bowl -- filling and tasty. The yuca planks with 3 mojos was so good I wanted more. The Ahi tuna with tostones and avocado crema was delicious and served with a spicy mango salsa. I tried the Caipirinha - a Brazilian drink that was well worth trying. Went to bed and slept soundly in the comfortable and cushiony beds. In the morning, we were up early to work out. This, unfortunately, was not the highlight of my stay. The \"exercise room\" is in between the two hotels by the pool. It looks as if it is housed in a previously functioning motel. Can't think of another way to phrase that. The room was hot upon entering and never got any better. The air conditioning didn't work and the two small fans were no help. The equipment and the floor needs a serious cleaning and replacement of some of the used and dated machines. The treadmill by the mirror actually has tape on it and skids (if you have used an old treadmill in the past, you know what I mean). The elliptical felt like mud and possibly needs a tune up. Some of the machines at the back wall were so old and dirty, I tried (really I did) but gave up quickly and used the free weights. Additionally, the towels in the gym are the big pool towels. Why oh why can't you have smaller towels? We loved the size of the gym and the the amount of equipment in it, but it needs a good cleaning. After showering, we went down to breakfast in the Cane Fire Grille. Our waiter, Miguel, was an absolute angel and delight. He waited on us and checked back frequently without being overly intrusive or overbearing. The breakfast buffet is $19, but includes pastries, fresh fruit, oatmeal, eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, cereal, and an omelet and waffle station. The omelet and waffle station is manned and you need to request what you would like. Unfortunately, for the better part of our meal there was no one there so we didn't get a chance to eat any of that. However, the rest of the buffet was fantastic. Normally, we are used to dry eggs, rubbery sausage, dried toast, etc. The food was spectacular! Incredibly fresh fruit including blackberries and lychees; the oatmeal was yummy and had toppings including brown sugar and raisins; perfectly cooked sausage and bacon and they were even crispy; eggs florentine -- made constantly so the tomato was slightly cold and the muffin crisp (almost impossible to achieve on a buffet); the potatoes were cooked with onions and peppers and fresh, fresh, fresh; egg wraps with eggs, cheese, and meat (ham?); a European style layout of meats, cheeses, and hard boiled eggs; an assortment of cold cereal, milk, and yogurt parfaits. The pastries were truly yummy and not the hard as rock typical finds -- they had a little pastry that tasted like baklava. Yummy! Without the eggs and waffles, the buffet is $16. Breakfast for three including coffee and juice: $54. However, we had booked a room rate that included breakfast for two and was well worth doing so. The negatives: Although the hotel is under renovation and working hard to improve the appearance of the hotel throughout the facility, I wish the Pure rooms had a full renovation throughout. The 4x4 white ceramic 80's tiles are definitely dated. Additionally, using the hot water in our room required waiting about 5 minutes for the shower. I can get past that, but I imagine if I was here on business I might not be so agreeable. When we woke up we noticed that they were paving the parking lot below us. Not much noise, but when we returned from breakfast around 10 am, the noise was hard to miss. It was coming from above us and we aren't sure what it was, but I can assure you that had I been sleeping or trying to work -- management would have heard my mouth from my room. We weren't given any notice about the noise and it is loud enough to drown out the TV at almost the highest volume. Having said that, this is a great hotel and I intend to stay here in the future as a pre- or post-cruise hotel. They do offer a shuttle to the port for $11 per person, but we opted for a taxi instead. They also have a Hertz desk inside by the lobby, a nice large Starbucks, and a constantly updated airline monitor for departures.
