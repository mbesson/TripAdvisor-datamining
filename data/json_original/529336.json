The gentleman who checked us in was very accommodating when, after we were shown to our extremely tiny double room, I pointed out that I'd reserved a triple (my husband was joining my son and me the following night). He realized the mistake right away and asked if it would be okay to stay in the double for one night and that he'd switch us the following morning. That was fine with me, but I was worried I'd wake up in the morning and it wouldn't happen. Quite the contrary. It seemed the whole staff was alerted to the change. I'd repacked our stuff when the woman cleaning rooms asked if all our stuff was packed up so she could move it. The gentleman at the desk asked the same when we were in the lobby. When we returned from sightseeing, all our belongings had been delivered to our much larger triple room. We were very happy there for 5 more nights. Yes, the rooms are small. But remember, this is Europe and the buildings are old and converted to hotels. They're not like US hotels, built from scratch to accommodate us fussy Americans! If you can afford the triple room, it is much better than the double, space-wise. Room to unpack and to move around. The air conditioning in each room is controlled by you and works very well. Via Cavour is very busy, and our triple was in the front of the hotel, so it was a tad noisy. Not terrible, but when you're having a hard time sleeping anyway ... People also complain about the breakfast, which we found quite ample. They serve croissants, various breads, hard boiled eggs (depending on the day), milk, juice, and yes the coffee is from a machine. But they're not really set up to serve coffee to order, so it fit the bill. My 7-year old felt he'd died and gone to heaven when he realized he could go back for more and because they had little packets of Nutella. Considering how insanely expensive food in Rome is, it was great to have one meal a day for which we didn't have to shell out $40-60. The woman who runs the breakfast service looks a little put out, but the fact is she was extremely accommodating. We overslept our first day and missed breakfast, but because she was packing up, she let us grab a couple of croissants, which she didn't have to do. The young man behind the desk was the only one who seemed less than interested in being super helpful. He rarely looked up from his computer when you came in and out. However, when I asked if I could use the lobby computer, he told me it cost 7 euro for 3 hours. I told him I only needed a minute or two, to which he replied, \"Oh, if you only need it a minute ...\" and he turned the internet on for me. So, I can't really complain about him! Long review.

We asked for them to fix it, but were told nobody could do so until the morning, but you won't be surprised to know they didn't bother. Breakfast is served in a quaint/dirty little room under the stairs, which, if everything else was up to standard, you would probably like, but instead the breakfast maid sat in the cubbyhole and ignored us, other than dumping the breakfast bin on our table. Breakfast is meant to be a buffet, this could be a language barrier, but a coffee machine, a jug of juice and some slightly stale bread and pastry isn't a buffet in my book, like I say, this might be picky, but as the rest of the hotel is so utterly under par, it's hard to give the benefit of the doubt. The tablecloths, floor and walls were dirty too. The only time the staff showed any sort of interest was when nagging us to check out of the room, we had the gall to check out 10 minutes late and were harangued by calls from reception and the cleaner banging on our door. The final straw that broke this particular camel's back came at the moment of check out, when we were daft enough to ask if there was anywhere we could leave our bags while we looked around the Roman forums, in hindsight, a daft question, but for as long as I live I will never forget the old man's face as he looked me dead in the eyes and in perfect English said \"NO\". Cue the tears. According to this site, this is ranked 430 out of 1,308 hotels in Rome. In a funny way I suppose I should thank my lucky stars that I didn't book into one of the 878 hotels that somehow are worse than this one.

The breakfast room comprises a few small tables with a \"help yourself\" basic buffet bar. Breakfast consists of a selection of cereals, pastries, tea coffee & fruit juice, perhaps not what you are used to in England but adequate. The hotel's redeeming feature is it's location and reasonable room price. On arrival at the termini station (bus & train station) it's very easy to locate and only a 15 minute steady walk. From the hotel you can walk to the Colosseum within 10 minutes, and most other attrations and shops are close by (the hotel has a very good free pocket map at reception) Tips - Purchase a return bus ticket at Ciampino airport for the Schiaffini Shuttle bus, it is only 8 euros return, the bus stop is No. 1 directly outside the airport main building, no problems with getting on, they are very frequent and reliable. A taxi one way will set you back around 40 euros. At the termini staion, cross the road and stop at McDonalds for a quick coffee etc. (2 coffees, 2 cakes & 2 burgers only 5.90 euros). Normally I don't frequent McDonalds but the coffee is very good and the prices very cheap compared to most eateries in Rome! Leaving McDonalds turn left and walk up the road, turning left into the Via Cavour, the Solis is No. 311 on the right hand side of the street. Purchase an all day metro ticket from the kiosks in the stations, at only 4 euros each they are good value for money and will save you blisters on your feet! Check prices for coffees before ordering, most Italians drink coffee at the bar inside as they are much cheaper, a coffee in a tourist location seated outside can cost you up to 5 euros! The Sistine Chapel at the Vatican is only open on the last Sunday of the month, although open on all other days of the week. An excellent eaterie near the Vatican is the Tavola Calda Pizzeria on the Via Otaviano (53) - fantastic roast meats & potatoes.

The location is very good: it is a 5-10 max walk to the Cavour Metro station and a 5 minutes walk max to the Colosseum and Forum. My wife and I spent much time overlooking the Colosseum because we would leave the hotel, walk two blocks, and be there. There is also a good number of restaurants and shops nearby, many affordable and some not tourist traps. Our double room's decor was very simple.

I didn't enjoy the stay, but I guess it is as good as it gets with the price tag.. - Room: The dark-colored decor (wallpaper and drapes) made the room very dark, even after we turned on all the lights in the room (there isn't that many lights). - Safe: The room doesn't have a safe in it. This is the very basic thing we look for in a hotel and am disappointed they don't have it. It worried me a lot when we go out especially when Rome isn't the safest city in the world. - Vacancy indicator: There was this funny design on our door, where there is a light that indicates whether you are in or not, depending on if you put the key card on the power switch. We found this annoying because people could just walk up and see who's in or not, and potentially break into the rooms that are empty at that time. - Maid: It isn't a big problem, but the maid tends to overlook things. One day she didn't give us toilet paper, then another day she gave us only one bath towel. - Internet: There is in-room WIFI internet if you pay 5 Euros for it. However, it was broken on our last day, and the front desk didn't know how to fix it (or didn't even try to). - Location: Many people praised about the location of this hotel. It is true that it is right next to the colosseum. However, it is on a main street, and the area looks questionable and I didn't feel safe staying there. Personally I liked the area around the Spanish Steps a lot better, but I am sure the hotels are a lot more expensive over there. It is convenient, however, as the bus (I think it was 117) stops right in front of the hotel, and it goes to many tourist spots. - Noise: Noise is usually not something I complain about, but there were construction noise starting around 8 or 8:30am in the morning. It does get quite annoying if you want to sleep pass 8am. The safe is the most basic thing any hotel in major cities should offer.

I took my mum and we wanted to stay near the Colosseum. Unlike the other 4 star more expensive hotels which are near to it, this is about 5 mins walk away but nearer the other landmarks and I think, in a much better position. It is on the junction of via Cavour which if you look left can you can see the Colosseum, look in front and the Forum is straight opposite or look right and you are 5 minutes from the wedding cake building on the Piazza Venezia. This is situated at the end of via Corso (main shopping street) which, if you walk along for 10 mins (it will take longer if you're window shopping!), you will arrive at the Trevi Fountain - my personal fave!! So all the main landmarks are either within very easy or reasonable walking distance. This was fantastic because we were able to get great photos walking to Trevi on our first night then take amazing floodlit photos on our way back!! Looking at the other hotels positions, this was by far the best! There are a few nice little restaurants nearby if you've walked your feet off in the day and want to stay close to the hotel. The twin room we had was basic but very clean with air con (nice sized bathroom), breakfast was better than the last bread and jam effort we had when we stayed in a dive near the termini station and the staff here were pleasant and helpful.

The bus cost 13 euros for adults. Entry into the Vatican Museum (Sistine Chapel) was 12 euros each but the best deal is a guided tour round the Colosseum for \u00a320 euros each (inc fast-track entrance). This price also includes another guided tour of the Forum (no entry fee but a free tour's a free tour!) AND a further guided tour of Paletine and fast-track entry included! If you don't want to walk from place to place, there is a metro station, taxi rank and bus stops right outside the Colosseum.
