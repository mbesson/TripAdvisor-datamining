{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good value for money I stayed here only one night as it was part of a Contiki tour. The room was clean and cosy. I couldn't shut my balcony door so that was a bit irritating, but other than that it was a good stay. The elevator was small, and thankfully one of the guys on tour carried my luggage upstairs. The breakfast was also pretty decent, so no complaints here!", "Date": "Nov 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR585451701", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MMM_Toronto"}, {"Content": "You Get What You Pay For Stayed one night at Hotel Franchi November 2008. Hotel staff extremely friendly, will give you a map of Florence and instructions, wake up call, taxi call, etc.Close to airport but you can't really walk there with luggage and taxi charged us 18 Euros which we thought was high for a 1 kilometre drive.Elevator the smallest ever seen, we barely got in with our two bags.Room was clean and well appointed with huge balcony, three beds, flat screen TV, mini bar, and good bathroom.Problem with strong sewer smell in bathroom drains. Extremely noisy at night with trains, automobiles and noise from other rooms - paper thin walls.", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR951358044", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "KKat49"}, {"Content": "Good hotel! I don't really remember a lot since we were only there for one night, but from what I do remember, its a nice and clean hotel. Staff were nice. The only problem was the lift... if you're travelling with a big group of people beware!

This hotel is only 300 metres from the airport and a ten euro taxi ride into central Florence or you could use the shuttle bus from the airport or take the local bus from the stop fifty metres from the Hotel. It took us an hour and a half to walk it. There are local bars and pizza places close by or you can order a beer and pizza delivered to your room from Hotel reception for ten euros. There is no restaurant. However, there is a 24 hr bar in the foyer and a mini bar in the room. There is a TV but this only has Italian channels. Our double room was clean and adequately furnished. As Florence is not a very busy airport, there was little noise through the night. The availability of parking meant we were able to drive our hire car back to the airport the next morning before our flight. The hotel receptionist was pleasant and helpful and breakfast is provided for a supplement. This would be good choice for those who don't want to spend more than 90 euros and who have an early morning flight from Florence airport.", "Date": "Jun 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR463521702", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Teabag"}, {"Content": "H\u4e48tel convenable   showReview(16604481, 'full');", "Date": "May 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR768410618", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "hotel accueillant pour decouvrir florence   showReview(13200096, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR809770313", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Soprattutto cortesia e...   showReview(11380892, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR786820430", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "angenehmes Flughafenhotel   showReview(11663944, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR376456568", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "La struttura si trova vicino...   showReview(11380893, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR897669828", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Personale molto cortese e...   showReview(11380894, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR211877101", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d291691-r21672264-Hotel_Franchi-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "291691", "Price": "$140"}}
