{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Unit owner since 1995 My wife and I have owned a 2 bedroom unit here since 1995. We visit NOLA quite often and always stay here. Visitors to NOLA know that if quiet is what you seek, don't come here. It can get rather noisy and raucous at certain times, but that is the nature of the beast, excuse me, French Quarter (Veau Carre). On the other hand, the location is perfect. Drive into town, drop your bags and DON'T PARK YOUR CAR ON THE STREET. There are several nearby parking facilities, most with security. Everything that you want to see and do in the quarter is within walking distance. The staff is very polte and courteous, and Paul, the manager, is quite knowledgeable about NOLA and always willing to assist you in any manner that you might require, to include parking discounts if you let him know in advance. He may even be able to assist you with this after you arrive. Parking in the quarter is at a premium and a bit pricey, but I'm sure it is worth not getting your car damaged. This, I know from personal experience. The rooms are a bit dated, but very cozy and clean. One thing to remember is that the facility has to deal with certain legal restrictions due to the historical significance of the buildings. They are some of the oldest in the quarter, yet as I said, they are very cozy and comfortable. I and my wife wouldn't keep going back like we do if we didn't like it, and we do some world class traveling. Newspapers are provided each morning, the pool is small, but suits the facility perfectly, they do serve coffee, benits (sic) and bloody marys on weekends and BBQ pits are on the premises. I have always found that children of all ages seem to have a wonderful time here and the premises have touch pad security at the gate and door. All, in all, it's a pretty neat place.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR957047508", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Bamapilot"}, {"Content": "A great place to stay in the Big Easy Very comfortable accommodation  a helpful  courteous manager.The location is perfect as it is in the French Quarter which is the best place to be when visiting New Orleans as you can easily walk to all the attractions. The other staff are keen to please too  even do your dishes for you. The courtyard with the swimming pool is very restful  picturesque  they serve free coffee, doughnuts  Bloody Marys if you want them at 10am every day. This is timeshare which we chose as our exchange  we would definitely go back there again in the future.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR604863986", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "OrquediaEdinburgh"}, {"Content": "Stay somewhere else. Owner since it was built. The early years where wonderful, full of good times and long lasting friendships with staff and other owners. Since a change in management, our unit has been neglected with black mold around whirlpool tub, broken doors, uneven floors, even a hole in the floor covered up by carpet. Numerous water stains all over the ceiling. Loose entry doorknobs, we also have a broken sleeper sofa as well. Brown dirt stuff shooting out of the jets in the tub. When you report these to the front desk, on the first day, the claws come out, and the rest of our trip is full of false accusations that somehow we caused all this distruction. Our children are told they can't kick water in the pool because the churning of water creates waves that break the filter flaps when they swim. The kids where 3 years old. Also do not walk around the edge of pool because the bricks will fall off. Amongst all this, we have had items stolen and damaged in our room, with management not reimbursing or replacing it.Our family used to love coming to New Orleans, but with the treatment we get from the staff we seldom come anymore. We too will sell.", "Date": "May 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR363278498", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BeSoRowdy"}, {"Content": "Very Dangerous Area! The hotel clerk recommended that we park in the garage around the corner. Everything was fine until Christmas Day at 6 pm.We were broken into right in front of the hotel. I immediately drove to the garage and the car next to me had the windshield broken as well.Luckily, 2 brothers in the neighborhood stayed with the car until the police arrived. My wife was walking back with our 4 year old and saw the police and brothers at our car. The police left in a hurry with no offer of a police report.I discovered out tent and 2 bags of clothes were stolen ($800.00). Later (7pm) I hooked up my laptop and started searching for car window replacements. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shabby dressed man looking at my broken passanger window. He took out a notebook and wrote down my license number!I drove back to the front of the hotel and parked there. At 7:15 my wife came back down and we as she was talking to me, two men approached our car. We sped away with one of them chasing us.I think it is open season on tourists in New Orleans. We are a family with 2 young children and I strongly recommend that you stay in a big hotel with secure parking. I later found out that the garage with the security camera does not work. Thanks for the recommendation front desk. It is too bad this place is too isolated.

Courtyard very loud with partying in the evening (till 3 am one night), plan on bringing earplugs. And the rooms need some updating. Springs missing from roll-out bed and jacuzzi tub didn't work. However, the staff was super friendly and the rooms were clean. Not horribly bad, but I won't be staying here again.", "Date": "Apr 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR446185904", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "c22forever"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Spot!!! I just got back from a 5 day stay at the Chateau Orleans and have NO complaints. .The place was GREAT!!!!From the talks over the phone with the staff weeks before my arrival, to the excellent directions given from the airport, to the check-in, the room, the service, the helpful staff, to check-out.It is NOT a five star hotel, but it is a place that I would go to again and again.Great location (2 blocks from Bourbon) away from the noise. EVERYTHING is within walking distance. They can get you a parking card for the garage around the corner. You come and go as you please. They have 2 entrances that are fully secured. The courtyard with the pool was a really nice place to sit and have your morning coffee, donuts, and/or bloody marys, which they provide.The room was clean, neat, and fully stocked. We had the one bedroom suite that could have slept 4-5. The bathrooms were nice  clean. Kitchen area had microwave, fridge, stovetop, coffemaker, toaster, sink, cutlery, dishes, utensils, pots, pans. My favorite were the big windows that just flooded the place with light during the day.I just can't say enough about it. I've stayed at the W, Omni, and Hyatt on past trips to New Orleans. This place will be my lodging of choice from now on.BRAVO to Jim  Jeanie (hope I got that right)", "Date": "Mar 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR952152910", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "momawreck"}, {"Content": "Agradable y tranquilo       Zuania y Willy, nuestro mejor regalo en las vacaciones", "Date": "Apr 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR797884443", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "veronicaed2002"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d645291-r22085539-Chateau_Orleans-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "645291", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
