Overall, the stay was very pleasant and the staff very attentive (the manager greated us each morning at our breakfast table). The dinner menu at the restaurant was better than average - the breakfast buffet was simply average. Also, despite showing espresso based coffees on the menu, they had none and weren't planning to replace their broken machine. So if you are espresso junkies like us, you'll have to hike to to Bloor Street for your coffees. The fitness centre is decent and clean. The beds were comfy and our room had new, large TV's. The parking lot is pretty tight and nearby traffic from the Gardiner Expressway and Lakeshore Drive can be heard (but you get used to it). If possible, seek our a water facing room. The other rooms are about 12' from the Gardiner Expressway. I can't imagine how noisy they'd be.

Do not get me wrong the hotel itself is fine, the rooms are fine and clean but the location is terrible and the staff at is subpar and about useful as a self-check-in counter. Generally most people stay at hotel to catch some sleep away from home, or at least that is what I thought the concept is, this is not the case at this place. Do not be fooled by the stars, those are completetly made up this hotel is worse than a comfort inn or days inn hotel. You are better staying at one of those or a more expensive real \"starred\" hotel. The hotel itself is located about a ~20min drive to DT so that is why I chose it and for the price, however I should have stayed at a more expensive hotel as I ended up paying the same, or a cheaper one as you expect to comprimise for price . The first night my room was on the 3rd floor and NO exaggeration the highway was a meter away, I managed 2 hrs of on off sleep. The first thing I did after I had to given up all attempts to fall back asleep was ask for a room change . The only thing available \"so they say\" was a lakeview room for a $30 extra charge...I moved immediately, if it had not been the day of and I wouldn't have been charged that night anyways, I would have moved hotels. So in my superior lakeview room, that night I was up most of the night again with the parking attendants yelling at eachother to move cars in the parking lot chaos.- There are double if not more rooms, than car spaces so your cars are double or triple parked, not really an issue but that night again was awful. I also ordered in room service for dinner you are better off not eating or going to the gas station and finding something.. it was gross and for hotel prices def not worth it. In the end I learnt that this hotel should be ashamed to have the Sheraton name associated with it and that with all the extra momney I spent with upgrading and cabs, I should have stayed in a more expensive hotel or even a less expensive one closer to town and not overlooking highway.NEVER AGAIN at this hotel.

I was really pleasantly surprised by it when we got there. First, bring your bikes with you (my son was smart enough to do so, and he biked around the city). Right across the street is an amazing bike/ inline skate boardwalk that goes along the lake, with a special bike/pedestrian bridge. It's quite long, and my daughter & I didn't get a chance to walk it all (there's a walking part separate from the biking part). Really nice! They now have BIXI bike rentals, but we didn't do that. The hotel is outside of the downtown area, but was the perfect location for us. Parking was fine, never had a problem finding a spot, and the hotel was alot nicer than I thought it would be. The beds were so comfortable that even though the kids would set alarms for 7AM, they were too comfy to get out of bed before 10! The view of the lake was very nice. With it being summer and trees in full bloom in the park across the street, it was somewhat obstructed, but it was still a nice sight. The room was not noisy at all. With us being on the lake side, there's a street right out front, but I always keep the room's fan or AC on for \"white noise\" anyway, so we didn't hear a thing. The balcony was nice in the morning to bring my tea out & relax before starting the day. The staff was so very accommodating and helpful. Our fridge didn't work, which apparently was the case with other rooms. No big deal- we loaded ice in a bucket to keep drinks cold. We didn't have baby bottles or medicine to keep cold, so not a priority. My son called down to let them know of that, & asked if there was a microwave he could heat up something in. Within 10 minutes we had a microwave oven delivered to us- at night. This was really above & beyond. It really helped out, as we went to the grocery store & got micro meals that we ate (& saved $$ by doing). It was more valuable than the fridge! They didn't have to do that, & it was appreciated. They were very helpful in the tourist questions that I asked. The free WiFi was great (I saw alot of hotels in the city charged a fee for parking & WiFi). I purchased online tickets to Second City and was able to print them in the Business Center in the lobby, which was nice. I highly reccommend taking in a show there- my 19 & 22 yr old kids loved it as much as I did. We used the green public parking lots, which was cheaper than the subway or buses. Never had a problem finding a spot. The hotel is only a few miles to the CN Tower, Entertainment District, etc. Just go right down the Lake Shore Rd that's in front of the hotel, and it will take you most of the way. We parked at the Harbourfront ($12 for the day), and walked to the Entertainment District, CN Tower (great tour also), along the Harbor. I also reccommend the Distillery District (public parking again), and check out the shops, galleries and eateries in those buildings. It's a very charming place that they've made out of an old area. The sculptures around there are really nice, too. Also only a few miles from the hotel. The hotel room was a nice size-we had the double beds on the lake side, which are larger than the queen beds on the highway side. Nice in-room safe which our computers fit into (after reading another person's review tipped me on this), and the closets had alot of room as well. We didn't go into the bar or restaurant- the prices seemed steep, but it seems everything around the city was expensive anyway.

Based on the room I stayed in I would stay here again in a heartbeat. I did not nor have not read any of the reviews because I needed to be in this location for a specific event at this end of the city. The front desk staff couldn't have been nicer. Check-in was quick and easy and a new umbrella was procured in an instant when I requested one. I chose a king bed room with partial lake view and got one on the second floor. I could see the lake clear as a bell from my room so I am uncertain if the partial was accurate. There were trees but it was fall so no leaves. Perhaps in the summer, with leaves and 4 lanes of traffic, the view is more obstructed? The bed was very comfortable, the soft goods (comforter pillows etc) were modern and clean as were the two chairs facing the coffee table. The room safe was big enough for my 17\" laptop (free wireless internet is advertised and it was amazingly fast in my room) the t.v. was a huge, perhaps 42\" ? LCD modern unit with great sound. I found the room to be quiet even though we faced busy Lakeshore Blvd. All fixtures worked and nothing was in disrepair. The bathroom reflected the age of the hotel. It's small- built for one - and you won't find any marble here. But it was clean and had some amenities like hairdryer, lotion/shampoo/conditioner. Small, not fancy but clean. Oh, and If you are going to whine because there is only one elevator and sometimes it is going to be busy or that ice is only available on the first and fourth floors, don't stay anywhere. Just stay home. You really shouldn't be travelling. : ) I needed to be in the west end instead of downtown so the location was perfect. I looked up other choices and was truly thankful to have a decent hotel at this end of the city. As always, the room prices range dramatically depending on when you stay. In my own opinion I would be happy to have this quality in Toronto, for a king bed room for $159/$169 ish a night but the hotel is popular for the Royal Winter fair, the Cdn National Exhibition etc. so there are peak season prices and it is a Toronto hotel. If you judge a hotel on exterior appearance this hotel may not suit you. From the exterior is looks it's age but the inside has been kept up nicely. I wouldn't want to be in a room on the Gardiner highway (Expressway) side because I am a light sleeper but when I called the hotel they explained that only the queen bed rooms are on that side. Those rooms are at a lower cost so you get what you pay for. The ceiling in my room was not pretty. It looked like it had been repaired in patches by someone who didn't know what they were doing. lol. Again, if you care about that then you are really fussy and shouldn't stay here. Our room had a balcony which was a welcome way to get some fresh air. It had 2 plastic chairs which were - well - plastic. Not fancy but just fine. The surface of the balcony has suffered from age and it's exposure to the lakefront I suspect. I would hope the hotel has plans to put down some outdoor tiles to pretty it up but I wasn't sleeping on the balcony. I was sitting there for 20 minutes to relax before going out. The fitness center looked compact but well suited to someone to whom the fitness centre is not the be-all and end-all of their stay. For 3/4 of the year you could run/walk along the lake path right across the street from the hotel. Also, due to events, I did not have time to eat in the hotel but the food I saw being consumed as I waited for a cab certainly looked appealing. Hopefully other guests have reviews.

This was supposed to include a lake view, king bed, sparkling wine, chocolate truffles, in-room movie, and breakfast buffet. The first sign of a problem came during check in. I think I was the first person to ever book the \"Romance Package.\" Every desk clerk we dealt with during our stay (3) had NO IDEA what the package included, and had to spend several minutes reading the description on their computer screen. I had to watch all the staff read the details of our package over and over again because nothing was ready for us - I had to ask for each and every thing that was supposed to be included. The first desk clerk that checked us in was very friendly, and cheerfully told us that our room with 2 double beds was ready. When I said that I specifically booked a king room, she had to stop and read the information, and whoops! She was looking at the wrong name on her screen - we were indeed in a king room. Our \"lake view\" room was very generously named - it was on the ground floor, looking out on the parking lot. I could catch a glimpse of the lake if I stood on tip-toe. I could also enjoy the conversations of everyone who parked in the lot right outside our room - even with the windows closed the voices came through clearly. Who needs tv? My husband went to the front desk to request a room on a higher floor. There was a new desk clerk, who tried to go through the computer to find a new room, but was put off by the manager who stood behind her with her arms crossed repeating \"No! No! No! No! No other rooms!\" over and over. Surprisingly, the clerk was unable to find another room for us. The room itself was mediocre. The bathroom did not have any counter space, and only 1 drinking glass, which I found odd. The hotel also advertises \"free bottled water!\" Which consists of 1 500 mL bottle. I indicated double-occupancy when I booked - why only 1 glass and 1 bottle of water? We went out for dinner, and when we returned to the hotel around 9 pm we stopped at the desk to request that the sparkling wine and truffles be sent to our room, and to confirm that the breakfast was included in our rate. Cue another several minutes of watching the desk clerk read the computer screen. Again, this is a package that the hotel advertises on its website - it might be worthwhile to let the staff know about it. The wine was delivered promptly, and the manager also dropped off the certificate for the breakfast buffet. We never did receive the chocolate truffles, but by this point we were full from dinner and couldn't be bothered to ask, AGAIN, for something that should be included in our package. We watched a movie (\"Angels & Demons\" - pretty good!), as per our package deal, and called it a night. The next morning we found that our checkout summary had been slipped under the door of our room - and showed a charge for the movie. Which should have been included in our PACKAGE. I called the front desk, and surprisingly the clerk was ready for me this time - she said the movie was on there in error and had already been removed from our charges. Score one for the hotel. We went to the restaurant for our breakfast buffet. The service was lacklustre, and the food was pretty bad. Reconstituted eggs and stale pastries. The manager did come by twice to ask if everything was all right, and if we enjoyed our stay (a different manager than the \"No! No! No other rooms!\" lady from the night before). I was disappointed in our stay. I could handle the less-than-stellar room location, or having to follow up on every single thing that was supposed to be included in our package, or the bad food, or the rude manager, or the lone drinking glass, but all together they added up to a bad night.

The restaurant manager remembered our large party frm two years ago and was very gracious and helpful. The bar tender offered us directions and shortcuts to avoid rush hour traffic downtown.

So if you like fresh and new and modern, don't bother. But if you don't mind a little charm, then this hotel is just fine. Also, there is no swimming pool. There is a hot tub in the gym but our kids were disappointed that they couldn't swim. The rooms are spotless; the super-comfy beds are dressed in the traditional Sheraton duvets with feather pillows and soft sheets. (Although a request for a couple of foam pillows was granted, no problem.) Our room was on the second floor overlooking the parking lot, and we could see the lake--across the four lanes of traffic on Lakeshore Drive. A bit of a disappointment, but at least we weren't at the back of the building which looks onto the Queensway. We had a balcony with a couple of chairs and a fridge as well. Although we encountered two problems during our stay here, both were rectified to our satisfaction. The first was a lack of parking. When we arrived back at the hotel in the evening, every spot was full and cars were double, and triple parked! We were asked to leave our keys with the front desk and they would only move our car if need-be. We awoke the next morning to find our vehicle nicely tucked into a parking spot, just below our room. The second problem was a party of young guys in the room next to us. After a request by my husband for quiet fell on deaf ears, we contacted the night manager who promptly came up and \"rectified the situation\" (we heard him giving the guys a stern talking-to) and we also received a follow up call from the manager to make sure all was well.

The front lobby had a pleasant fruity type fragrance but, the hallways had a very old musty smell, and the rooms were so overpowering in the smell of some sort of floral cleaner or freshener that I had a headache within seconds of walking in and felt nauscious soon after. The walls were severely water stained and the wall paper was peeling in our room, there was no fridge, despite the fact that our booking included \"premium bottled spring water\" -none provided. Our room did have a balcony from which you could see the lake, but just barely as the hotel is only 5 floors high and the lake is across the four lane road and park. There were also no chairs that you could sit on to enjoy what view there was. There was absolutely a high definition flat screen TV in our room, but who goes to a hotel to watch TV? We booked a King room, the one plus is that the bed was enormous and extremely comfortable. We only had one glass in our room, kind of funny when a room with a king bed would normally be double occupency. When we requested a second glass we had to explain why we needed one before they agreed and brought one up. Note that we explained that we wished to have a glass of wine and were expecting wine glasses, but they brought water tumblers. We also discovered that despite booking a late check out of 4 pm our check out time was in their computer for noon and could only be extended until 1 pm. This wasn't a big problem though as we had no desire to remain any longer than we needed to. Upon our check out I noticed that the bill didn't quite match up with what had been quoted on line. When I asked about it we were informed thta there were some phone calls made on our phone. I clarified that we had only used the phone twice and both times for local calls. The girl behind the counter explained that yes, those were the charges for local phone calls. $1.70 per local call. I'm sorry, but that is just ridiculous, charging for a call that costs them nothing! We paid the bill and made it clear that we were not happy and would never book there again.

It seems that the majority of guests here were tourists in groups or business people from out of town. I didn't ever see any families with children. One final drawback: one time two of us each had our credit info stolen from this hotel. I guess one of the clerks or cleaners had a skimming machine to copy the numbers.

I arrived late on my first night, and first of all could not find one single parking space. I parked my car at the front door, went in, checked in and asked where I was to park. Someone came out and directed my to a little spot and had to squeeze in a small corner between a couple other vehicles. During check in, I was told my room was facing the highway and for an extra $20 I could get one across the hall and away from the highway. Since I didn't really know how close it was to the highway or even exactly what highway he was referring to I declined, thinking how bad can it be. Well, I walked in my room and the noise was absolutely incredible. It sounded like the room was sitting on the highway. I looked out the window and even though it was dark, I couldn't believe how close it was. Even at that hour, the highway was busy and very loud. I called down to the front desk to say I wanted that other room after all, but it had been taken apparently. So I turned on the TV to drown out the noise and the TV wasn't working. Went in to the bathroom and I think it is the smallest hotel bathroom I've been in. There is absolutely no place to put any toiletries as there is a small pedestal sink, no counters, no shelves. If you need to use the toilet, you must close the bathroom door, otherwise anyone passing outside will hear you. You can touch the door to your room from the toilet. After a night of hardly any sleep due to the noise from the highway, I called to see if I could get a different room for the second night of my stay. No luck. I had also asked for a wake-up call at 7:30 a.m. and even though I was up, the call didn't come until 7:45. I also called to report the TV not working. The next night I again arrived late and not one parking spot. They said they had closed an entrance and for me to park in the entrance. I went out and the entrance they referred to was not closed so I had to go back in and tell them it wasn't closed. They then sent someone out to put cones there so I could park. I was not happy at this point - it was one thing after another with this hotel. I finally park and go to my room and my room key fails to work. After several attempts I have to go back down and have them re-program my key. Luckily the TV was working and the highway traffic wasn't quite as loud (although still very loud) and I was able to sleep better.

They had 2 people already waiting at the Starwood Preffered Guest check in counter and only one at the regular counter, so I waited there. It took at least 10 minutes for the person in fromt of me to get checked in and when I finally got to the counter I wasn't offered even a simple apology for the wait. Then, I waited another 15 minutes for MY check in. The clerk had to ask for my credit card and address 3 times, even though I booked the hotel online through the Starwood site. Then she mumbled something about not being able to find a room. During this time she at least was somewhat cheery and apologized once or twice. After the long wait, no further apology was given or reason for delay was offered. I didn't expect any compensation, but having to wait a half hour to get checked in when there is only one person ahead of you is ridiculous. I am not exagerrating on these times, either. I arrived in the parking lot at the hotel at just after 5pm (I remember because I stayed in the car to finish listeming to the afternoon news report) and the clock in the room read 5:33PM when I got in...I made a note of it. I was placed on the top floor (Strarwood Preffered Guest floor) of this 4 storey hotel on the lake side. The view wasn't bad but was somewhat marred by Lakeshore Blvd that runs between the lake and the hotel. I don't remember really hearing much noise from the road in our room. The room also had a balcony, however it was closed for repairs. It was January anyway, so no big deal. The bed was very comfortable and was a King as requested.

I am pretty sure they're actually all the same beds and I'm seriously considering buying one the next time I'm in the market.

The whirlpool didn't work at all, the shower was broken, the steam room was switched off and the sauna was far too cool, with no ladle or bucket of water for the coals. Great!!! We ate at the restaurant and the food was very nice. The service was okay too but it was all a bit pricey by the time you finish paying taxes etc. The hotel was quite far out of town but the trams were quite frequent, which was lucky. All in all we would never stay at this hotel again - the least they could have done was invest in good solid triple glazing so their guests can get a bit of sleep.", "Date": "September 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brantford", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "jm06hc", "ReviewID": "UR5487885", "Content": "Ended up here on a Saturday afternoon, as our booked hotel turned out to be disgusting.

At $145 per night, the lakeview room with balcony was good value compared to Toronto centre prices. You do look over a four lane lakeshore road before you see the lake, but it was still nice view (from the 3rd floor kind of obstructed by trees, from the 4th floor excellent). Easy access to walking along the lake shore trail was also a perk. The rooms were nicely appointed, with good beds and bedding. All staff were friendly and helpful and we checked in about 6 hours early (we intended to store our bags, but our room was ready). Staff in the restaurant were unfriendly, service was slow, and food wasn't great value for the prices they charge. We ate out after our first breakfast experience. Transit (city trolley) was 1 blk walk away and it took about 20-30 minutes to get downtown, depending on traffic. Fairly convenient since trolleys came every 10 minutes. Overall the hotel was pretty good value, but not as upscale as their website suggests.", "Date": "June 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "akron, oh", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "keatingclan", "ReviewID": "UR5336444", "Content": "I can't believe I'm staying at the same hotel that the other reviewers did.

The staff were friendly and accommodating and I was thrilled to see that free parking was offered to hotel guests (a great find when you're in Toronto!) One down side to the parking though is that there are limited spaces available. If we returned to the hotel after 9 or 10pm, most nights there was no parking left and we were left to improvise. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a Starwood Room because I am a member of the hotel's loyalty program. Our room was clean, spacious and well-appointed. We had a lovely view of Lake Ontario and despite what others have posted on this page, the noise from the traffic on the Lakeshore was barely audible. The hotel offers free local calling and high speed internet. Our king-sized bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also very clean and stocked with plush, fluffy towels. Four Points Sheraton Toronto Lakeshore is a bit off the beaten path in the sense that it is between Toronto West and Downtown. There are no shopping or eating locales (other than the on-site restaurant) around the hotel, unfortunately, due to its location. However, a quick 5 minute drive up Windermere Avenue to Bloor West Village offers up great shopping and eating possibilities. Or just hop on the Lakeshore and it will take you right into Downtown where you can shop and eat to your heart's content. My one complaint: check-out time is 11am and housekeeping kept bothering us to clean our room. They knocked on our door twice on the morning of our departure - once at 9:00am and the next at 10:20am. We had a late night before and were trying to sleep in a bit, so this was a real annoyance. The price was definitely right for this property. If you don't mind having to drive in to Downtown and maybe having to search out somewhere closeby to eat, then you'll really enjoy staying here. The hotel's proximity to the Gardiner Expressway also made it super easy to get back to the airport for our flight. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBeuatiful Hotel Room\u201d", "Author": "randomhotelinspector", "ReviewID": "UR4333578", "Content": "As loyal Starwood guests, we were happy to be upgraded to a Suite at this hotel, which turned out to be one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in.

Based on previous reviews I had noted carefully my reservation requirements, and it turned out I had to threaten to leave if they did not give me a room on the fourth floor with a balcony. Well the fourth floor was closed so I ended up in 357 and from then on it was a perfect stay. I was up at 6 for a run along the lake - well lit and safe. There was free parking, free internet, the cleaning staff were there all day and nothing was a problem for them. The gem turned out to the the restaurant - they would cook you anything you wanted even if it wasn't on the menu. The chef tried to outdue himself each morning with an omelette. The regular breakfast was very good with all the fresh, ripe clean fresh fruit you could possibly want. The restaurant staff were some of the friendliest people I have ever met. The fitness room is small but it was all I needed as I had the lakefront to myself. The steam bath actually works. I looked very carefully and there are no rooms on the Gardner Expressway side so I don't know where that one came from. They all face the lake. Mine was quiet and most nights I slept with the balcony door open. I met the owner who lives on the 5th floor where we had our meetings. The 5th floor is where the conference rooms are. They also have a huge terrace overlooking the lake which must be fantastic in the summer. I think it is an underrated hotel and I will certainly go back.
