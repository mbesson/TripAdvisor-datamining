The kitchen was very small, but I cooked all of our meals except 2, so it is very doable! The condo was very clean, the towels and sheets were all provided and you could get clean towels every couple of days. They had a laundry facility on each of the three floors and there were 3 washers and dryers so it was very easy to do laundry. The staff was very friendly, the pool, deck and hot tub were great.. We really enjoyed playing shuffleboard and of course we really enjoyed the ocean! The beaches were clean and not very crowded. We were surprised that they allowed driving on the beach, something we were not used to. But it turned out to not be a very big deal at all, We would love to go back and highly reccommend this resort.

The pool was clean and warm and there are 2 gas grills in a pavilion available although we didn't use them.

The sleeper sofa is not real comfortable; the mattress is pretty thin. We could leave our room and be on the beach in about 3 minutes. The beach was clean and uncrowded. The condo is located a few miles south of downtown Daytona Beach so the neighborhood is a little quieter than the area around the boardwalk. I hadn't been to Daytona in 30 years and it has changed a lot but we all liked it. There are several restaurants within a 10-15 minute walk including but not limited to The Cracked Egg Cafe (real good breakfast) and Crabby Joe's (on the pier-food was pretty good but not great). The staff at Dolphin Beach was courteous and professional. Everything worked and I have no complaints.

If you're looking for a casual laid back resort with a nice pool and beach access you will find it here. Nothing fancy so don't expect the Ritz... our room was an efficiency (1 queen bed and sofa sleeper, one room with divider) we were staying with our 5 year old grandson, and although it was smaller than other resorts, there was enough room for us to get by comfortably.... after all we spent 90% of the time out on the beach. Might be tight with 4 adults. The rooms have recently been updated and the furniture and bed were nice, clean and attractive. Bed was comfortable enough for us. Kitchen very small but I was able to make Mac/cheese, sandwiches, etc with no problem, full size fridge was nice too. Also have gas grills in the pool gazebo for grilling out if you want. Beach resorts always tend to show wear and tear more so than other resorts but they look to be trying to keep this up and in good shape. It is nothing fancy though. Of course the best thing about this resort is the Beach... and second best is the pool and pool area. There was a nice mix of guests during our stay, some elderly people along with some families with younger children and teenagers and there were a couple of young adult groups and honeymooners, so a good mix. Not alot of \"planned activities\" but after all we are there for the beach. They did provide some pool floats, etc for the kids and Monday morning free coffee and donuts were nice too. The staff was friendly as were most of the guests. Very causal atmosphere. We were on the 3rd floor and had a great view of the ocean, pelicans and even a few dolphins. I am a Bluegreen points member and had leftover points that could only be used at a \"red\" resort which is why I chose the Dolphin Beach Club.

There are no mountains in Daytona. The actual pool is very nice and is right above the beach. During our stay, even though vehicles are allowed on the beach, the beach was uncrowded and beach auto traffic was minimal. The sand is very fine and when damp or wet, packs hard. Wet or dry, it is a great walking beach, even barefoot; no seaweed, trash, or hard shells to avoid. The resorts beachfront units face Southeast, and the pool is btwn the resort and ocean, so by 4:30PM the sun has crossed to the front of the building, shading the pool. Our unit faced the parking lot rather than the ocean. There is a gazebo bar with 2 gas BBQ grills for guests to use. There is also a hot tub and sauna. The unit was created by combining two motel rooms. There were 2 bathrooms, a bedroom, kitchen and living area with fold out sofa. The unit seemed clean and well maintained with the exception of the stove which had loose burners that wouldnt lay flat. Full fridge, micro, coffee maker, blender, toaster, small elec range and oven (stove top burners were loose and wouldn't lay flat), pans and dishes, dishsoap, and bath soap were included. The kitchen is only big enough for one person at a time. The living area is small because the standard motel room needed to include the kitchen, dining table, livingroom sofa & chair, end tables, TV and dresser. A lot of furniture in a small area. Overall, the unit is quite comfortable for two adults, and maybe an additional small child or two. It would be cramped for four adults. The staff is friendly and accomodating. Daytona Beach Shores is a quieter location than central Daytona Beach; fewer restaurants, bars, stores, etc. Walk a couple blocks and there are three fun eateries under the bridge to the mainland, providing waterfront dining. About a mile north of Dolphin, is Publix supermarket where we found what we needed for preparing our beachfront grilled meals back at the resort. The only significant disappointment was the humidity. Our unit had an air conditioner in the livingroom and one in the bedroom, but although we were able to create a chill in the room, we could not reduce the humidity to a comfortable level. It was so increadibly damp in the room that we could not sleep or get comfortable. We vacation in Florida regularly and we have never had a humidity issue like this before.

I had to move from one room to another this time - which was a major pain. The first one's bathroom was nice. The second one's bathroom was... disgusting and very old and in desperate need of updating. The kitchens are 'basic' and the utensils, etc are hit and miss. I had a 'studio' type room - there's a queen bed with an accordian-like room divider if needed. A sofa bed in the other half. It is comfortable for two people. The people next to me had FOUR adults in their room. (I have NO idea how they could manage that.) There is ample storage. I was fortunate to have a ground-floor room - larger balcony - the views were fabulous. However, the convenience of the beach/pool was fabulous. I walked the beach most mornings at sunrise, laid out in the sun all day, came back for a late lunch & shower, and then walked for the sunset. There is a couple of gas grills for use in the pool area - great added feature. Problem is that some people let their music go a little too loud. First week was like the retirement home's version of spring break. Was sort of creeped out by some of the older men staring and making comments when I was minding my own business laying out (in a tasteful bikini). The 2nd week (Labor Day Week) was completely different. Much younger crowd - woman about 200lbs strutting around in a thong. (There were children ALL over the place.) The dynamic of the other guests is quite diverse. The staff is amenable enough. The people that are in charge of the massive cleaning undertaking on Saturdays was... scary and colorful.

Well, when we got there we were surprised to find out that not all rooms are oceanfront, even though the website would lead you to think so. Only the studios are oceanfront, the one bedrooms are on the side of the building. Well, when we got into the one bedroom we were shocked to find it a mess. The one chair in the room was flithly and all torn up, The outlets were coming out of the wall, the water in the bedroom bathroom was so low that you couldn't take a proper shower and when we opened up the hideaway bed out popped popcorn and nut shells. The air could only be on low because it sounded liked a mack truck. By the next morning I was in the office because not only the condition of the room but the fact that we wanted a ocean view, that was the one thing we wanted for our vacation. After quite a bit of time they finally decided they weren't quite full and gave us a studio. This room was much better than the one bedroom, clean and in working order. I give props to Joyce in the office, she handled the situation very professionally when I was very upset and ready to check out. It was the week of Daytona 500 so the resort was very full, of old people. I would not recommend this place for families, only for maybe 2-3 people and you have to make sure to get the ocean view, there is nothing like it, we had the door open all night long listening to the water. It was fun to drive on the beach and collect seashells. I would go back but only with my husband and I in the studio villa. They were doing some upgrading so hopefully it will be in better shape if we return. One very important thing I noticed, there is no night life in Daytona Beach and very few places to eat.

The pool/patio area is very nice and the beach without rocks/shells/crabs is wonderful!", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cClean, no frills little getaway\u201d", "Author": "Madcat007", "ReviewID": "UR5341982", "Content": "We felt that this small resort offered a good value and it was clean. It is somewhat off the beaten path so you'll want to rent a car, however it is just a short distance from many fun spots and does have easy access to the major highways. The on-site pool is surprisingly large for a small resort. While it was fine for us, it doesn't offer alot of space inside. Your room choices are limited to an efficiency which sleeps 2 or a 1 bedroom which sleeps 4. All in all, it is a nice little place.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Dolphin Beach Club", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d249768-Reviews-Dolphin_Beach_Club-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3355 South Atlantic Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Daytona Beach</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32018</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "249768", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/11/19/7f/the-front-office-and.jpg"}}
