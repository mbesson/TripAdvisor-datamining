From what they mentioned to us they will undergo a renovation in the next months - it might be worth asking before booking. The gem of this hotel (besides its art deco architecture and interior design) is with no doubt the restaurant on the 7th floor.

I stayed there twice because of the excellent location in the lively galata area next to the tower and because of the amazing view on the Golden Horn you have from some of the (too tiny) rooms on the backside. Weak point is breakfast when you have everyday the same fixed mixed plate of salami, cheese, nutella accompanied by mini-yogurth and mini-fruit salad. A buffet breakfast would be a more appropriate and waste saving choice. But the weakest one is the irritating management that makes you feel as a walking wallet. The receptionist is thoughtful in convincing you to use the hotel services at extra costs (ie airport transfer or sufi dancers shows) but totally indifferent to any of your complains. On January 1st when there was an electric breakdown and the very noisy hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power unit run from 6 am to late afternoon just under my window none took care of my problem.

Shower, but no tub in the room. The staff could not have been more accomodating to my needs and the location of the hotel was excellent with a buffet breakfast in the hotel's rooftop restaurant included. All in all a great experience at the Anemon hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who asked. One quick side note. If you don't like climbing or walking, or if you want to be close to the main tourist attractions then this might not be the hotel for you. This section of Istanbul where the Anemon Hotel is located is in a very hilly area and although it's right next to the Galata Tower the location is probably two miles or so from the main tourist attractions.
