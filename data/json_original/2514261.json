More like Hostel!\u201d", "Author": "David R", "ReviewID": "UR123864517", "Content": "My girlfriend and I booked a double room at this \"hotel\" for a night after our 3 night stay in Venice. We booked it primarily for its location. Got there and I must say it looked lovely from the outside. Walked into the reception and again...lovely! Very clean, exactly what you see in the photos. Check-in was no problem. We were given the key to the room told how to get to it. We walked up the very narrow stairs to room 311. Opened the door to find one of the worst rooms I have ever seen in my life! The room consisted of double bed in middle of room, wash hand basin less than a foot from the bed, OUT-OF-ORDER shower, wardrobe with no door with a TV in it. No bathroom, as apparently it's \"SHARED FACILITIES\". The walls were grubby, the bed was not comfortable at all, and the taps were constantly dripping. Within minutes, I tried to access the \"free wifi\" to check other people's reviews, but couldn't get access. Using my mobile internet, we saw some pretty bad reviews. One description we saw, that I would have to agree on was \"A Shelter for the Homeless\". Enough said! There's a reason why most of the pictures are of the exterior and the reception. The room we were in was nothing like the pictures. I imagine those pictures were taken several years ago, and the rooms have just deteriorated over the years! Using my mobile we looked for alternative accommodation, as we could NOT stay in such meager conditions, never mind sleep there! We found the Premiere Inn round the corner. We took our valuables with us (not trusting the safety of the room) to the Premiere Inn, leaving the rest of our things in the room as they were tired of carrying all our stuff with us. After booking a nights stay at the Premiere Inn, we returned to the Belgrave to collect the rest of our belongings and check out. My girlfriend handed the receptionist our key, and said we were checking out. The man looked bewildered, as we had only checked in less than half an hour before. He asked if there was something wrong with the room, to which we replied only that we had found somewhere else, not wanting to embarrass the man. After all it wasn't his fault the room was in a poor state of cleanliness and repair. As it was booked under my girlfriend's name, he asked her to write and sign a statement to say that we checked out at no fault of the hotel. She wrote, and I loosely quote \"Room 311 has checked out, due to finding more suitable accommodation. signed and dated 19th January. My girlfriend and I are 23. We may not have much experience staying in hotels, but we do have standards, and The Belgrave was not up to our standards! For \u00a340, we weren't expecting 5* everything new and room service etc, but we did NOT expect what we experienced! Very cheap, but very poor standards! Dreary and dingy!

Peeling paint, tiny corridors and very dated decor continued all the way up the 5 flights of stairs we had to climb to get to our tiny room. We were allocated a cramped triple when we only needed a double, and the extra bed in the room just made it feel even smaller.

The tiny bathroom had a horrible 'wet room' style shower with a plastic mildew covered curtain around it and everything needed re-grouting and just a lick of paint. We are not snobby people about where we stay in hotels and generally are very happy with cheap and cheerful hotels... this hotel was indeed basic as we had expected but it just felt completely run-down and not looked after.

We spoke to her and she like us was not pleased with her accomodation or the way she was treated. If you are considering staying at this hotel be warned, Enter at your own wiil.

And as for my room, where do I start? Well, the photos I have attached will tell some of the story...a thick layer of crud on the floor by the door, an absolutely filthy window and a splotch of something brown on the radiator with what appeared to be a pubic hair stuck in the middle of it.

It was filthy, the ensuite smelly and the toilet seat loose, you could not see out of the windows they were so dirty and the bed linen looked not clean.

We decided to do the same, rather than stay in this hellhole. The German tourist had been given a refund but the hotel receptionist ~ quite rightly ~ said that, as our contract was with Last Minute, she could not refund us and in any case the manager was not there so she did not have authority. We managed to check in to a perfectly acceptable hotel accross the road and got a fairly good night's sleep. Next morning I rang the Last Minute Helpline who said they could refund if the hotel would agree. They spoke to the manager who declined to refund, so we were out of pocket on this, having had to pay again for the second hotel.

Its is just seconds away (on foot) from Victoria Station, shopping malls, bars/pubs, coffee shops, restaurants, theatre (for musicals, etc.), etc. etc. etc. Also close by (like a five minute walk or so) is Buckingham Palace and the Queens Gallery (please go see this Art work its AMAZING). So, for younger travelers or couples, this is a bargin and not only will you save money on your accomodations, you will save money on transportation too! PS Although we didn't get up early enough - breakfast is included in your stay at the Belgrave House Hotel too! That also saves some money! So, if you are wanting to go to London on a budget, this is the place for you. I've stayed at 5 star resorts in Jamaica before and at the best hotels, and really, as long as the bed is clean/room is clean, its safe, and in a GREAT spot, you can't go wrong. I gave the Belgrave an above average because you can't beat friendly service and a great location. The staff there let us stow our luggage and took it to our rooms for us (we arrived very early in the morning) so we could go site-seeing and not miss a day waiting around or dragging heavy luggage about. They offer any help they can give, and are very friendly and accomodating. The hotel is actually a large house/manner rennovated into a hotel, and lots of floors (no elevator) but not hard to find way around. Hope this review helps.

We were attracted by the good location and the no frills concept. Why pay more for all the friperies. Unfortunately, this hotel has got the basics wrong. For me, the minimum requirement is a comfortable and warm bed.... However, the bed frame screeched with every move, the matress had seen better days and I could feel the individual springs in my back, the pillow was approx 1cm thick giving my husband neck problems, and the sheet and blanket were insufficient to keep us warm through the night. After three sleepless nights, we were extremely happy to get back to our own bed. The rest of the hotel is fine - clean, but tired in some areas - very new in others. Breakfast was basic but sufficient. But I would not stay here again.", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lille", "Title": "\u201cDon't go there\u201d", "Author": "Missmelina", "ReviewID": "UR10196700", "Content": "Booked a single room on a website before visiting London.Worst hotel i have ever experienced there.Though it was mentionned on the website this hotel has been totally refurbished, i ended up in a small single room on the last floor with tricky stairs.Room was unclean and damp, with ceiling full of mould which was in a rather scary state, there was a noise of flowing water coming from room's next door al night, tv was not working properly, only one shared bathroom was gloomy and 2 floor downstairs.
