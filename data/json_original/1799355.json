Arriving at 10.00 pm on the Saturday evening it was pretty easy to find a parking spot on what would otherwise be a mostly Residents Parking street only. The receptionist was less friendly and informative than someone who actually had any interest in the business making a profit, rather than paying him a wage. There are 2 computers with pay for internet access in the reception. No free wi-fi. We had 2 rooms booked, one for my niece and another for my wife and I. The niece was in a room at ground floor level and this was the 1st room we all saw. I know that floor space is something of a premium in hotels in London so wasn't expecting the Ritz or even a Holiday Inn experience, however to say it was small was a bit like saying that Iceland has a bit of snow from time to time. I'll leave off with her room and get right into our own room. Up the stairs to a point midway between ground floor and 1st floor was room 101. The walls on the stairway were covered with either street artist renditions or scratch and scuff marks from suitcases being ha8uled up the stairs. I think the latter to be most likely. I mean the walls were really badly marked and if there was any attempt to clean them all it would have needed would be a bucket of hot water and a bit of a scrub with a hand brush. For those who may find stairs a problem, there's no lift. On the other side of the stairway was the handrail. This was really grubby with a distinctive covering of dust; the sort that goes fluffy when you leave it long enough. On entering the room I was immediately concerned that we had found our way into a cupboard or small storage room. It was tiny. I mean really tiny. The pictures will tell the story better. The beds, 2 single, not the double we had expected, were familiar with my past army days, that is iron frames and as basic as you can get. They were covered with a blanket of dubious colour. We still haven't decided if the pattern on them were stains that had taken residence, fading of the colour or just a really awful choice of pattern, I suspect it was a mixture of all of these. On the up-side, the actual bedlinen was clean and fresh though this is a prerequisite of any hotel. As you can see from the pictures the \"wardrobe -- clothes hanging cupboard\" or whatever name you want to apply was more like a partly dismantled pigeon shed. It was home to the safe and also a mini fridge below the hanging space that made for hanging long clothes a problem without them creasing. The fridge would be a good thing in the summer months I guess. The TV was something of a joke. Situated at around 7 feet up on the wall directly above one of the beds made it impossible to watch with any degree of comfort. In fact it was something of a puzzle as to how to work the damn thing since there wasn't a handset (buttons) to work it with. Only by sheer luck did I find concealed touch sensitive marks on the surround that turned it on or off and changed channels. The problem was that the aspect ratio was entirely wrong for any channel it was turned to so that everyone was short and fat. On visiting the bathroom, in other words taking a step to the left of the bed, I found that a newish shower had been installed. This was fine and was the best part of the room. The toilet was squeezed in alongside the smallest handbasin I think I've ever seen which measured around 12\" wide and 8\" back to front. The plug didn't sit in it too well though and it emptied almost as fast as you could get water into it. The shaver plug and the light above the mirror didn't work. At least the light didn't work, I didn't need the shaver plug although it's built into the light so may well have not been working. The most worrying thing though was the wet towel draped around the bottom of the toilet pan which appeared to have been placed there to soak up a leaking pipe or waste. Having driven 270 miles to get here it was a matter of getting to bed and just dying for the night, absolutely worn out and almost comatose, Around midnight some really loud continuous noise soaked through my brain and woke me up, in fact waking both of us up. You know the sound of an air-conditioning unit? Well it was something like that but very noisy, not just a drone in the background. I couldn't pin it down exactly but it seemed to be coming from inside the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom. I put it down to a very agitated plumbing system with water really gushing through the pipes. It went on for 20 minutes before stopping. Breakfast was as basic as you could get. Hard boiled eggs, toast, slices of cheese etc. Continental I suppose but lacking any attempt at giving a hearty start to a day. Make of this review what you want. We normally stay in a Holiday Inn or something like it which isn't as basic as this but when all comes to all, value for money is still with the Holiday Inn. On a scale of 1 to 10 for cleanliness I would be hard pushed to score anything higher than 2. If they can't do clean, then they can't do hotels.

A decent place to sleep, and that's it. Breakfast is just ok, very basic: tea or coffee, toasted bread, butter and jam. It's served in the basement, which is pretty small and gets hot and crowded fast. Staff are kind and helpful, although some hotel policies weren't all that nice, namely the 20\u00a3 deposit for the tv remote, and the 5\u00a3 fee (per room) on luggage custody, which in my opinion is a service that any hotel should offer for free.

I was dreading having to stay here as I had read some awful reviews about this place.. and besides, had we wanted to stay here out of personal choice, I would have booked it - but as it happened we were in the lap of the gods......... Our room was sort of ok; if I had to mark it out of 10 it would be a 4 or maximum a 5} It was clean enough but very vey basic. The lighting in the room was awful, bare low energy lightbulbs, and it lacked ambience There were 3 very small single beds in the room which I have to say were most uncomfortable. Sheets and blankets as opposed to duvets and the pillows too were most uncomfortable. We had a bad night's sleep! The walls are paper thin, so if you are a light sleeper bring some earplugs! There was no TV changer and when I called down to reception to ask where it was, I was told that if I wanted to use one, I would have to pay a \u00a320 deposit.. It took some while to programme the tv as it was all in Italian for some reason. The bathroom was clean and uber modern with one of those diddy little oblong basins, it looked good but that was about all it did. The semi circular shower door wouldn't close properly, but the shower itself was good and there was plenty of hot water. At breakfast the following morning it was like a rush-hour down there! Very busy but we managed to find a little table somewhere. All self-service and all a bit hickle-de-pickledy.. The coffee was good though! :o) The serving staff were pleasant So... all in all, it wasn't as bad as I had expected it to be - but would we stay here again? Out of personal choice - No Would I recommend it to anyone else? I'm not sure... But if you don't mind an uncomfortable bed and pillows or a room that lacks total ambience, but with a good shower and a diddy bathroom basin - then yes! It's in a fabulous position and location as far as Earl's Court is concerned - and all the venues in that area all KNOW this!!

We are so glad we ignored most of them!! There are so many negative reviews of this hotel it is unbelievable. People just seem to be so picky, want anything for nothing, or are just simply vindictive. We got there and were met by a very friendly night porter, who checked us in and told us how to get to the room. We went up the stairs, (which we were lead to believe were steep castle steps), they're not steep at all, I don't know what the problem is, and we went to the first floor, to be greeted by a pleasant twin room, albeit less than large, but very comfortable, with en suite and a safe, and also a fridge (fantastic!) which doesn't happen so often, which came in very useful. We also read reviews that there was nothing around this hotel re conveniences, absolute rubbish. Erm...go out of the hotel, turn right, then turn right at the end of the road and you have everything you want: Sainsburys, pubs, restaurants and shops. Whoever wrote that obviously turned left out of the hotel instead of right! The beds were comfortable and there was an extra pillow for convenience. We paid a good price for 2 nights in the Earl's Court area which was very good value for money. Breakfast was continental, and this consisited of juice, coffee, cornflakes, toast, cheese and boiled eggs. People that questioned boiled eggs in the review, why? I have had that plenty of times in hotels - If you're planning to be there a few days though, maybe take some of your own stuff to put on the toast, therefore they can't complain.......they have the deceny to supply fridges in the rooms, so use them and stop moaning! All said, we had a very pleasant stay and would not hesitate to go back. Oh, and the remote control fee...just get out of bed a trundle the 30cm to the tv and switch channels, and keep the remote deposit safe in your pocket if that sort of thing gets on your nerves.

The beds were ok and the sheets had been changed (always a big plus ;)). We were given a room in the lower ground floor, even though we had requested a room in the upper floors. So we had no view at all (a tiny window in the corner from which you could see rusty ladders) but it didn't bother us that much as we stayed for only one night. The lock in the door didn't work properly, apparently there was something wrong with the key so that the lock system didn't always recognise it. They did come to change it the next morning but we were already leaving then. The breakfast was ok - toast, tea/coffee, eggs, juice, cereals... but nothing \"fancy\". The staff workers weren't thatt enthusiastic about their job (so it seemed) but we had no problems with anyone. I can recommend this hotel to people who want a basic hotel with a good location and connections. There's only a 5 min walk to the Earl's Court Station and on the same road as the station there are many shops, pubs etc so if you want to have a bite to eat on your way to the hotel at night or whatever, you can do it. This probably won't be the best hotel you've ever been to but taking the price into account I think this is a good option for a basic traveller. PS. May I just also recommend the Marmara Mangal restaurant just a 10-15 min walk from the hotel. A real turkish restaurant with great service and amazing food. They actually cook a lot of the foods on real fire next to the counter which makes it really unique (at least I had never seen such a great thing before).
