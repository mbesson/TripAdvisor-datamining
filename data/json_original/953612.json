The Australian owner puts on a get together feast every 3 nights for everyone, great to meet other travelers and divers. Breakfast is also included and served in a lovely outdoors cafe under the villas overlooking the ocean. A bike or car is arranged for travel to the owners dive shop just down the road.This place is in an upper class compared to other resorts in Tulamben. I would highly recomend as been able to come up to everyones standards. A great trip and fantastic diving, very proffesional and helpful.", "Date": "May 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR429949361", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "australiajimmy"}, {"Content": "Macro Divers Paradise       Chromodoris Coi", "Date": "Jan 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR133717123", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DiveNut66"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469406-d953612-r17637134-Tulamben_Wreck_Divers_Resort-Tulamben_Bali.html", "HotelID": "953612", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
