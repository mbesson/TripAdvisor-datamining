The rooms were old & not well presented. Everything looked very dated & from the bathroom linen looking as having seen better days to bedrooms that were not appealing. the view from the room was into an apartment block, with people coming onto balconies or gardens to smoke. Breakfast was ok if you were up early, but if not what was on offer was not replenished quickly. Bar was very dis-appointing & did not live up to the photos on the website. The reception staff were very good & spoke excellent English & recommended some good restaurants & bars. Our room was raided & money was taken. When we informed reception, they told us that this happens on a no. of occasions, & that they themselves had also been attacked a couple of times. The safe deposit box only opens on a very limited basis & is in the reception area. I would not come back & would not recommend to friends or family.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cBudget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ashutosh1109", "ReviewID": "UR123685326", "Content": "If you are looking for a budget hotel in Berlin.

We were intrigued by the description of Savigny as an historic hotel but we were terribly dissapointed. Its just OLD and ugly. The lobby is worn down and even the staff looks worn down. Very old people in very old uniforms. But I have to add: The were sweet and helpfull. When we got to our room we were shocked by the small size, the crappy furniture and worst of all the bed. IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! We asked to get another room and we got it. This was much nicer, but the beds were the same. Lumpy and bumpy and we slept awful. Next day we complained and we were offered another room, but still: LOUSY BEDS!!! We changed hotel later that day. The Hotel Sylter Hof was EXCELLENT!

It was a wonderful stay. Housed in a pre-war era house complete with brass elevators, and high ceilings, it was a steal at Eur 60 pn for a triple with breakfast and free internet. The owners who run this place are extremely friendly and helpful. The old man is a war veteran from Iraq and was a pleasure to talk to. We had a problem with the bathroom door and within no time (inspite of being a Sunday), they got it fixed without a fuss. Breakfast was great.. simple and German.. lots of meat, cheese and juices. The german lady could not speak a word of english but understood our preferences easily. The location is bang opposite Konstanzerstrasse U Bahn and very very convenient to move around. There is a LIDL supermarket closeby where you can pick up some snacks & other stuff. The room was HUGE !! I mean massive.. I loved the place and my old parents did not have any problem with the hotel as well.

Once in the lobby, the smoke makes a non-smoker's eyes water and it does not subside when one goes to the room. Overnight, I opened the window for fresh air, but at 6am a waft of new tobacco smoke acted as an alarm clock in my room. I thought I had booked Sir FK Savigny Hotel, which is clean and new and nearby, with almost the same name. I was horrified when my taxi, given the address, dropped me at the shabby entrance to this run-down establishment. Others in the lobby also thought they had booked the other Savigny, which is brand new and clean. I called Eurobookings.com to complain but they insistedthat this was indeed the hotel I had booked online. I tried to find another hotel but the city was full, with two huge conventions in town. So I stayed four nights at the Savigny. On the plus side, the wifi and breakfast were included in the modest price, the sheets and pillows were white and clean, the bathroom likewise and the staff friendly and helpful. My room, which was reached by transit through a cleaning corridor with an old mop and a pile of aged rubbish on the staircase, was quiet. This is just another of many, many shabby budget hotels in Berlin, but OH THE SMOKE!", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVile\u201d", "Author": "leb30", "ReviewID": "UR21132203", "Content": "First impression, dirty, dull, depressing.
