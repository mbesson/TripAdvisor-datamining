He invited us to stay with him in his large apartment in the Colonia Condessa, one of the most popular and architectually beautiful sections of Mexico City. We thanked him for the invitation, but we wanted a full week in Mexico City and felt that we would be imposing. We asked him to recommend a hotel near his apartment, and he immediately mentioned the Hotel Stanza, a place where he stayed as his apartment was being readied for his occupancy. Whenever we travel, I like to do as much research on the internet as possible before we go. We were really excited about going to Mexico City this year, our eighth trip in a row to Mexico. Mexico City, however, came with a caveat, and that was that you don't go to Mexico City to relax. It's an incredibly exciting and vibrant city, and with so much to see and do, we were always going to be on the go. Therefore, we needed a hotel to fit our needs, a clean, quiet place, centrally located and reasonably priced. The Hotel Stanza was the perfect hotel in all respects, and we're already planning a return visit. Located on the Avenida Alvaro Obregon in the Colonia Roma, it not only has a perfect location, right near a metro stop, metro buses and available cabs, it also has one of the best street markets I've ever seen right outside, on the Avenida Alvaro Obregon, and it's there every weekend. As for the hotel itself, the rooms were modern, tastefully decorated, cleaned every morning and the price we paid was amazingly low for a full seven night stay. My recommedation would be to ask for an inside room, one off the street, because you can get a lot of street noise if your room is facing the two streets that border the hotel. The hotel has a restaurant, internet, room service, an exercise room that we didn't use since we were walking so much, and then the real bonus, a separate room on the top floor with three irons and ironing boards. The hotel also has a laundry service, but the top draw for me was how incredibly warm and professional the staff was, eager to make your stay a memorable one. We showed up on the day we arrived in Mexico City, planning to take a bus to the beach that night for a week and then return, just to check on our reservation. We hadn't planned for the fact that we were totally exhausted and needed to rent a room for the day. It was early in the morning, and we had no reservation for that day, yet they told us it would be no problem to find us a room. They directed us to the hotel's cafe for breakfast, and midway through breakfast they came to our table to tell us that our room was ready for us. The staff who ran the hotel were simply wonderful. I can't say enough about the Hotel Stanza. It really was the perfect hotel for our trip, and I couldn't see staying anywhere else when we return.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, California", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "BeaMM", "ReviewID": "UR118531139", "Content": "The hotel is well located not far from the subway station Cuauhtemoc.

This time we chose it for its levels of comfort and pleasant and attractive location. I thought it only fair to now update my earlier report. The desk staff was very helpful, especially Cristina, who is very fluent in English. They helped me to locate a repair shop when the earpiece of my glasses fell off. We had drinks and a snack in the restaurant, and they were fine. I had my laptop with me and it connected without a problem everywhere I tried it, including the restaurant. The first room to which the bellman took us was not to our tastes; smaller, a strange layout and seemed somewhat unkempt. Most of all, it faced the park, and we'd requested a room facing the interior when I'd made our reservation. No problem. He called the desk and they immediately sent up keys to two other rooms, one of which was very satisfactory. As an earlier reviewer wrote, there was no longer any smoke problem in the lobby and restaurant. The room was spacious, the beds and pillows comfortable, the bath quite serviceable. We were so comfortable in that room and overall pleased with the hotel, we also booked it for our return from the U.S. 3 weeks later.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frazier Park, California", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel with a fine attached restaurant.\u201d", "Author": "OnParleFrancais", "ReviewID": "UR59087146", "Content": "This is a fine place to stay if you do business in the neighborhood.

Otherwise a nice hotel with friendly staff, internett, Wings cafe, big rooms and bath, clean, good beds, cabel-tv, safe in the room and minibar, although we could not open it :-( The only problem was a terrible sewage smell that came and went, day and night (sometimes in the lobby, the elevator, and the room even when the window was closed). It was the worst smell ever. I'm not sure where it came from, but at the corner of the park besides the hotel the smell was constant and I could not even breath. I'm sorry to say, next time in Mexico city I will find another hotel, just because of the sewage smell.", "Date": "April 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for the Entire Family!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2124421", "Content": "During our first stay at Parque Ensenada, we experienced such a great time.
