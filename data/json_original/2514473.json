In fairness, the location is awesome. No doubt about that. That's the only nice thing I can say. Some of the problems- The bathrooms were not all functioning. There was no table, the main bedroom bed was broken. the majority of the rooms are tiny cubicles off a main hall with sliding glass doors. The effect is very \"prison\". The \"caretaker\" lives in a room that is really PART OF THE APARTMENT. She was perfectly nice, but we were sharing the bathroom with her. The apartment is not as large as advertised. Directly downstairs is a dance studio, and on the weekend they had a salsa dance party that was pretty cute, but kept us up until 4am. we made the best of it, and there were awesome things about the neighborhood, but the place is a scam.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Ill", "Title": "\u201cThis Loft was AWESOME!!!\u201d", "Author": "thebestguest", "ReviewID": "UR32413420", "Content": "I stayed at the Soho Loft with 8 of my friends for an engagement party.

My experience is based on the pre stay experience I had with this company. My stay was supposed to be Oct 5-11 2008 I booked this Loft because 1st- was in Soho, 2nd the pictures looked good, 3rd the price was good, 4- I was contacted immediately. I never should have done it. They require you prepay on a credit card and sign a \"lease.\" I should have known better by the tone of the emails. Unprofessional, Lacking in tact or intelligently written. The terms of the contract are short. Basically (but vaguely) It says cancelation policy is within outside of 6 weeks prior to the stay a refund of 75% will be given back if re-rented. I didn't think we'd cancel. Well, after reading all of the horrible reviews on Trip Advisor and other sites - I canceled. I immediately emailed the 2 people I dealt with told them about the reviews. One review stated that they actually book private partys in the \"commom\" space and they can go all night. The guests aren't allowed to be in that space during the party. As well it said, the party guests use the same bathrooms as the overnight guests. Plus, the rooms do not lock. One reviewer even said the day he arrived his bed had been used and sheets were not changed. Gross! This was not the mature, private, clean and comfortable arrangement I wanted. In my cancelation letter I mentioned and asked if there would be parties booked. I recieved confirmation that there could be a party booked. I was contacted not by the original people who took care of me( we'll call them kevin/sales and James/rental agreeme\\nt)But by the Director of the Loft. After some correspondence, the Director, we'll call him Leroy, stated that he might have a private apt. I was very much interested in it and wanted details. It would be easier to just change locations instead of cancel. He didn/t get back to me. I had to be the one to initiate all communication each and ever time. Plus it took 3 or 4 emails to get him to answer. He finally, after a week said he found a place. I wanted details. After 3 days, still no details. He kept sending one sentence emails like \"don't worry\" etc etc. After 4 emails and 3 days of asking, I finally emailed and stated that I wanted the address and details of the place by end of day. He emailed back and said\" don't worrry, call me at lunchtime tomorrow\" I did what he said - he answered the phone and put me off.. again. He said he was busy and to call him around closing time. I agreed. However after all of the correspondence, unprofessional behavior, abrupt and strange emails, I decided to cancel. His response?: \"No problem\" I had since sent 2 emails asking the status of my refund. No reply. I have a feeling even if they did re-rent my space - I may not see my money. Very very shady. by the way, this location was found through VacationRentals.com which in itself does not have a good reputation according to reviews. Do yourself a favor, stay at a well known reputable hotel. It's worth it. As of now, I have booked a hotel for the week and will have to shell out another 2000K.

My husband\u2019s first reaction was that the loft had been a former massage parlor. I have no idea where the people giving positive reviews of this place stayed. Our bedroom was a shabby, stuffy, 6X10 windowless room that barely fit the bed and a bowed dresser. The fan in the room made so much noise that we couldn\u2019t sleep. The walls are paper thin. Both nights we stayed, the loft also hosted parties of 30 - 100+ people starting at 5:30. We found out about the parties AFTER we arrived, and that the common room, (the pictures of it on the website was the reason that we booked the place), would be off limits to us until at least midnight. We were also warned to keep our room doors locked in case any of the party guests tried to get in. We also shared our bathroom with all the party guests. Good luck with finding toilet paper. Breakfast was Costco muffins, and dry cereal. The other guests arriving during our stay were as surprised and none stayed a second night. Management was unresponsive and rude. On requesting a partial refund, we were informed they had no refund policy and that their information to us had \u201cclearly\u201d indicated the loft was a \u2018multi-purpose facility\u2019. However, the website didn\u2019t indicate parties occurred during guest stays, no mention of them had been made at the time we booked our reservations (or we wouldn\u2019t have booked), and the \u201cwelcome letter\u201d (received after we left for NYC) mentioned that on occasion the common areas would be off limits due to other events; inferring rare and not five nights in a row. Management responded, \u201cIt\u2019s the holiday season, what else did you expect?\u201d Ken, the sales rep, also stated a refund was unreasonable because we had actually stayed there, offering no good reply when I asked what our alternative was when arriving for the weekend before Christmas.

This place is a disaster waiting to happen. We spent 5 long nights here in September.

The construction is scary; electrical wires without protective conduit, registers without air duct connections, a sliding glass door entry with a high threshold (a tripping hazard) NO LOCKS, 2 shared dirty bathrooms with exposed wires and hot water ONLY in one bathroom at a time. Additionally, one of the bathrooms had to have the hot water faucet in the sink running in order for the shower to work. The pictures taken on this website in the public areas do show the design intent, although most of the wonderful furniture pieces photographed weren\u2019t there.

The rest have cheap wardrobe boxes or hangers mounted on the wall, and one has an electrical/data closet being used as a closet. Each room has a double bed against one wall, thus the poor person sleeping against the wall has a challenge getting to the bathroom at night.
