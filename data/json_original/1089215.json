The next day the Hotel refused a refund of the second payment, now the one night is paid twice with the second payment at a high rate. I have yet to determine if this is a Hotel scam or not, tread very carefully.

It was not a pleasant stay, and was very expensive for what it was. The rooms were very small, there was really only enough room for a bed. There was no floor space for putting a case down, let alone anywhere to hang clothes up, so living here for a week was very difficult. There as absolutely no storage space at all. There was tiny flies flying around the room which appeared to have come up from the drains. The walls were very thin and you could hear a baby crying all night from down the corridor, in addition, work men began digging the road up at 8am. The sheets were changed every day, as long as you put the sign on the door, but often we received ripped, dirty sheets and they were very thin, as were the towels which were covered in holes. They also provided no handtowels nor a towel for the floor, which after a shower became very slippy. Under the bed was dirty and covered in bits. The internet was very pricey and the phones in the room was so bad that it was impossible to have a conversation as it seemed a poor connection. Overall, the I had to check out early, I was booked for 9 days and booked out after 6, incurring an early check out fee of 1 nights room rate. The staff on the main desk were not very friendly or helpful. I would advise people to not stay here, I will have a number of visitors coming to see me while I am out here and although this hotel is conveniently located for where I am, I would strongly suggest they don't stay here.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cThis should be your last choice- sorry not choice forced stay\u201d", "Author": "S_Pravasi", "ReviewID": "UR120371253", "Content": "Out of my numerous visits to Singapore, this stay was the worst of all. Not because of anything else but due to the booking in this hotel. It is lower then a budget hotel if you have any lower ranking. Cramped rooms, TV was placed above the bathroom door- you can imagine the size of the room. With light off when you enter the room, your leg get hit by something big - that's your bed. No restaurant. Lousy reception. I felt its for couples who need rooms for a couple of hours maybe.This should be your last choice- sorry not choice forced stay.

Had to wait for 45min. Counter staff was not cooperative, seemed like he was having a bad day. Paid $153 for plain room Slightly bigger than my own toilet at home. Only had 2 choice of rooms to choose for the same price, either a double or twin. Noticed that bed was nicely made, but bed sheet was very thin atop of PvC bed. Blanket was also thin with fleece-like layer above it. Pillows are so thin, I actually got a headache when trying to sleep on them. LCD tv only have sports channels n 1-2 local channels, the other 20+ channels are just static which was very irritating. No wardrobe available, only wall hangers. Toilet was weirdly put together. Toilet seat was actually located below the shower head, so that means you can take a poop n shower at the same time. Even the shower head was loose from its joints, almost got burnt by the leaking hot water when turning on the shower to bathe. Really need to reprimand my friend for recommending me this hotel.

About SGD25 taxi fare from Changi airport and SGD8 from shopping centre VivoCity (which is near Sentosa Resort Island). Hotel is convenient if you want to be near NUS or NUH. That's about it. That's the only reason I stayed there. Walking around the area, I saw another hotel called Santa Grand. Had a look inside the hotel and it looks better. Check in was uneventful. It was already booked online and charges were already deducted from my credit card. Do not expect any staff to help you with your luggage. Check in time is at 3pm. If you want to check in early, pay a charge of SGD 77. Absolutely ridiculous cos it means that the room was ready but they make you wait til 3pm. But you are willing to be ripped off your hard earned SGD77, then you get a room immediately. Rip off!! The rooms/corridors on Level 1,2 and 3 smell of cigarette although it is supposed to be a non smoking hotel. People will come check in for casual sex. Hourly rate is SGD20, minimum 2hr. So couples pay SGD 40 to have fun there. However, it didn't affect me cos I was placed on Level 4. So choose the right floor or be prepared to hear noise. Room was small. One queen size bed which is covered with a protective (against human bodily fluid, I think) layer of PVC then a super thin bed sheet. Even old torn bed sheets are still being used. Management choose to save environment by using cheap thin old torn bed sheets. Two extremely uncomfortably soft pillows. Toilet and shower all in one. Water heater functions well and hot water was not a problem. After shower, the floor gets very wet which I overcame by taking extra towel from the cleaners trolley. Bring your own soap. Hair dryer, kettle, complimentary water and coffee. Room is small but good enough for a single person with average sized luggage. Iron and board can be requested, pay a deposit of SGD10 and get it back after you return the iron and board. Difficult to do ironing due to the fact that the room is quite small. No fridge inside the room. Wall is paper thin. Every cough and sneeze can be heard through the wall. Difficult to sleep because of that and door closing was heard and felt in other rooms. Bring ear muff or ear plugs. Eating outlet nearby. Few restaurant, eg a 24 hr prata shop, two Chinese, one Malay/Indonesian, one Indian. Bus stop right in front of hotel. So relatively easy access to nearest MRT (Clementi MRT) which took around 5-7 min on the bus. Overall, I didn't like it. I moved out to another hotel after several days because I was NOT able to sleep peacefully. For young solo travellers, it may be ok but considering the price, I would definitely go somewhere else. I paid 153 per night. Not worth it.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBare bones, bring everything\u201d", "Author": "IbneBatutaLV", "ReviewID": "UR117725293", "Content": "TINY rooms, smaller still bathrooms.

If you put your big suitcase, its hard to walk in the room. Almirah is small enough to hold only 3 hangers and bathroom is also small.

In this room, bathroom gets even more smaller. Internet is paid for and very expensive. Room has got hair dryer, toiletries, tea/ coffee making machine.
