Taps, shelf's, shower, kettle, fan, few lights etc. Utter disappointment. (fan was needed even on the coldest of winter nights due to the room heated so much its just stuffy and uncomfortable). Room itself - livable for one night granted. Would have had a better sleep in Paddington station though. Walls are so thin you hear every rumble and squeak from the tubes (all hours), as well as the kitchen staff early hours (dunno what they were cooking/ doing as breakfast was a shambles, but that comes later) Rats - yes rats... payed us a surprise visit at 3am (multiple times). Must have came under the front door. (blocked it with a towel and this seemed to stop them...) Probably had free range of the corridors (even the kitchen's) seeing as though a basement door is left open to air the place out. Breakfast - (B+B would imply some breakfast), brilliant choice if you want stale corn flakes or stale corn flakes. That's literally it. Being crammed in a room catered for 5/6 people isn't pleasant after a long night of no sleep. Staff were very ignorant, We decided to eat elsewhere. Checked out first thing in the morning.

Needless to say we were very disappointed, yet glad we were only staying for a single night. We were in a basement room which had been 'newly' refurbished- the fixtures and fittings were very cheap shown by the broken shower door handle and the broken sink tap in the bathroom. On a positive note the room was clean but not to an exceptional standard. To save typing, here are some of the negative reasons, advising why this hotel should be avoided unless you're on an extremely tight budget: - The reception staff were impolite but rapid at taking your money from you (language barrier as the staff are not English) - The rooms are small and are a bit of a tight squeeze even for 2 people. -WIFI can't be picked up in the basement. - There is a rodent problem with the basement rooms (we got woken up at 2.30am by scuttling and rustling)... The breakfast room and kitchen are also in the basement so this raises concerns. - The breakfast is very disappointing (there was only a choice of toast or cereal) - The breakfast room is tiny and there is no space to move. - The catering staff are extremely noisy at 5.30am clattering plates, shouting and such, yet there's no cooked food in the morning. - The walls are very thin. - The place is like a maze of stairs and doors. - The location is not perfect. It took us around an hour to walk from Euston, then another 45 mins to walk to Regent street/Oxford street. If you plan on spending alot on taxis or know the transport routes then this may not be problem. Also I left an item of clothing at this hotel, I rang to see if there was any way of getting it back and the reception simply hung the phone up after telling me they would \"check to see if it was there\"... Still haven't heard off them.

Every time we needed to leave the hotel (even for five minutes) we needed to hand the keys to the room over and then ask for them back when we returned, which is something I have never experienced. The room itself was so small it was difficult to move around the bed, which routinely slid away from the wall it was against, making it difficult to relax. This was made more difficult by the fact that there was not a table or a single chair. On one side, the bed was pressed against a door that led to a dirty alleyway. Throughout the night, there was the continuous sound of running water and early in the morning the staff were noisy in the corridor. When my partner asked for an iron, he was told to go down a corridor (that was lined with various cleaning items) and get it himself, even though there wasn't a light in there.

When we arrived at the hotel the lobby area was decorated nicely and was clean and modern with lovely leopard print chairs, the man behind the counter was friendly and welcoming. Once we got into the room (a 5 bed room) we noticed the view was awful.. a ladder a door and a window.. The ladder lead onto the street above, although there was a gate protecting anyone from climbing up that ladder I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how safe parents would feel bringing their children into that room. The room had 2 double beds and a single, one of the double beds was clearly a camp bed and felt like concrete, it only had one pillow on (same as the other beds) and no duvet only blankets, there were more blankets in the wardrobe though if someone got cold. There were 4 towels for a five-person bedroom, 4 cups and 3 saucers, although washing supplies are provided. When leaving the hotel to go out shopping etc guests have to leave their keys with the hotel staff, this I assume is for safety reasons, although some people may not feel comfortable with this seeing as there is a sign in the room stating \" hotel staff will not be responsible for any lost or stolen property\". Also there was not hairdryer in the room as stated when booking the room so my cousin had to go up to reception with dripping wet hair in her pjs to get one! When leaving another member of staff was on the reception, he was really helpful when asking for directions etc but when two of the girls came back there was a weird comment made - 2 of the girls came back alone and the receptionist and his friend said \" you have one girl I have the other\", this could make people feel very unsettled, especially as they knew we were in London without any men, and it was a room of 5 girls, so to be honest I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep very well, not helped by the make shift bed making so much noise it sounded as if someone was trying to open our door. In the morning breakfast is served between 7.30-9.30 which I felt was really good as it allowed people to have a lay in, there is a choice from cereal, toast or an egg, the breakfast room is small but clean and homely. When we got in the room it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say if it was self service and as there was kitchen staff in the room we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know so my cousin asked one of the ladies who just ignored her, when asked again she replied in a moody manner, my cousin had to get her own water out of the kitchen which from studding health and safety I know is not suitable. The lady then made 10 rounds of toast which I assumed was for the guests (maybe that was me being lazy ) so when she placed the toast on a table I got up and went to get some, but as she saw me she picked up the plate and stood in front of me waiting for me to move, she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say \"excuse me\" or make any attempt to let me pass, she just stared blankly at me. Working with the public in my job I know this would not be acceptable in my job.

Perfect location, near 3 tube station (paddington, marble arch and lancaster gate). 5min form hyde park. However some points need to be said. 1. The other room offered was on the basement, with small window. The bathroom was small and without a separate area for the shower. That shows that the rooms have no standard, and maybe I had just luck to be in a good room. 2. the breakfast is horrible, only black coffee, toast, one cereal and milk, and boiled eggs. So, don't expect to much of the breakfast. It is better to eat somewhere else. 3. If you have any kind of disability, make sure you have booked a ground floor room. As the building is an old building, the stairs are hard!!!! I am young, but after go up to my room on the last floor, I was breathless. In the end, if you are going to london to visit the city and walk around, this hotel is a good value for money.

The towels in the room were threadbare. The shower pressure in the bathroom was excellent but the shower was on the same level as the rest of the bathroom so it was completely flooded when we washed. You needed a pin number for the TV. My friend opened the curtain in the morning and was greeted by a builders crack up on the ladder! Quite funny actually.

Had no place to leave my clothes, but a shelf. Shower had awesome pressure, always warm, good thing as the \"windows\" wasn't properly locked.

A lot of great restaurants in Paddington, bus to London Zoo by Lancaster Hall Gate etc etc. Quiet area, pretty safe for a 17 year old girl on her first trip alone. :) When I got back to the hotel the second afternoon the receptionist actually offered me a bigger room on an upper floor, which I politely declined, as I was happy with my room.

We went to book online and the whole thing locked up - a bad omen, or possibly a being greater than us warning us of the consequences of proceeding! Let me start with the positives - location, location, location. You really are a stone's throw from Paddington. Here endeth the positive feedback. Upon approach of the hotel, everything seemed in order - nice area & nice externals. Reception wasn't bad either. Although, I'm referring to the reception area with that statement - as the verbal reception we received was less than acceptable. What was supposed to be \u00c2\u00a3240 as a telephone booking weeks before magically transformed into \u00c2\u00a3265.20, as a questionable surcharge for using a debit card was applied. I was very very unhappy about this - also about paying in advance. First time I have ever paid for accommodation at reception in advance! We were given the roomkey and directed to the 5th (yes, I did say 5th) floor. The receptionist didn't attempt to move from his chair as we lugged our baggage up 5 winding, narrow staircases. As I opened the door I could have cried - the room was appalling. I do not say that lightly. Dirty brown curtains were drawn, which when opened exposed all manner of sins - heavily soiled carpets, filthy walls (upto about 5ft from the floor, the walls were covered in scuff marks and general grime) and the most awful crimson bedspreads I have yet encountered. Electrical sockets were coming away from the plasterwork which led to a blown fuse in the supplied hairdryer. Bathroom was modern, although a leaking shower soaked the adjacent floor. The supplied 19\" TV was easily the most attractive of the room's qualities. We booked a double room but were supplied with a triple. As soon as I so much as looked at the doublebed it squeaked...we were not long in coming to the stark reality that we would be spending the night on the single. The double bed was simply unusable. I have never experienced such noise from a piece of furniture. When provided with such a grim reality upon entering the room I was compelled to check this website...suddenly everything made sense. Had I ignored the positives we would have undoubtedly been in much more pleasant surroundings - whether that be in another hotel or most likely at home. All in all - avoid like the plague. The only comfort I could take was from the likliehood that we were in one of the better rooms, as alternative reviews have since suggested. This could easily be a holiday breaker.

And there would be a surcharge for credit cards. Ouch! We scrabbled together the cash and were then told where our room was - up FOUR FLIGHTS OF STAIRS (no lift). Of course we were not offered any help with our heavy bags or tired children. Our room had a double bed (a real \"double\" - 140cm wide bed) and two singles, one of which mostly blocked the door to the bathroom. Our bed was so close to the window (which was always open - either they were trying to conceal a smell or it was stuck) that I was worried I might roll over and fall out! There was a TV in the room but no heater/cooler and no phone. (This was important when we were exhausted after a day's sightseeing and really couldn't face the thought of walking down 4 storeys and then up 4 storeys again!) The tiny bathroom (toilet, sink, shower) looked nice, although the dark green tiles made it impossible to tell whether it was clean or not. The shower head had good water pressure, but unfortunately the drain was not big enough and so we could only shower for a minute or so at a time, then had to turn it off and wait 2 minutes for the shower cubicle to drain before we turned the water back on. Yikes! Breakfast was in the basement. The flight of stairs to the basement was beyond poky - I think it was about 90cm wide - and there was a huge queue from about 7:30, all the way up the stairs, because the breakfast room was too small. Breakfast itself was included but very basic - a couple of hard-boiled eggs on each table, two types of cereal and toast (I think 2 types of bread). There were also 69p tetra-packs of orange juice. The staff in the hotel were friendly but not really helpful, and the one time we actually asked them for anything (to ring a taxi) it did not arrive - maybe not their fault.

Whilst looking for a budget hotel in London, the reviews on Trip Advisor made it a complete and utter nightmare - most budget hotels have horrendous reviews. When I found this hotel, with mixed reviews, I decided to just go for it and I am extremely glad I did. My advice would be to make life easy for yourself and believe what the positive reviews say. NOTE: The pictures attached to this hotel must be old ones because the interior of the hotel has been completely modernised. I travelled to London with three friends for four nights and we had two non-deluxe rooms between us: one double and one twin - although both rooms had two double beds. For each room we paid \u00c2\u00a3216 through lastminute.com i.e. \u00c2\u00a354/night which is pheonomonal value and I believe you would struggle to find anything better than this hotel for under \u00c2\u00a365/night. The good things about the hotel: - Exceptionally comfortable bed. I have stayed in Hilton/Ramada/Marriott hotels and their beds and on a par with this hotel. - Maid service daily with fresh towels. - Swanky, modern bathroom. - Spacious rooms. - Flat screen TVs in all rooms, including the non-deluxe ones. - 24 Hour receptionist who checks out everyone who enters the hotel. - Security cameras in the hallways for safety. - Breakfast is included: Toast, Boiled eggs, Cereal, Tea, Coffee, Orange Juice, Jam etc. - Excellent location: 2 minute walk to Paddington Underground & Train Station. 4 underground lines run through Paddington so you can basically travel to anywhere in London from Paddington with a maximum of 2 line changes.Having 4 lines is also great as it gives you alternatives when lines are delayed or cancelled. - Lots of restuarants, cafes, shops, take-aways nearby. - 5 minute walk from Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. - Busy location at night full of tourists until around 1am i.e. safe to walk around/come home to late at night if you have been to see a show etc. The hotel itself I think is 2 stars, but remember stars refer to facillities and not quality. I really would strongly recommend this hotel and suggest that you ignore the negative reviews.

So I went ahead and booked with the friendly man on the phone paying \u00c2\u00a390 for two nights (Thurs night and Sat night). The location of the hotel is a three-minute walk from Paddington underground station, which was perfect for us and anyone with suitcases. The hotel is easy to find and a good location for public transport. There is an array of restaurants on the doorstep of the hotel if you don't wish to venture far. The area seems ok and safe. The exterior of the hotel was positive, however upon entering the hotel my heart sank, I was expecting fresh and modern, but I was received with, a poor lick of paint and cheap trimmings! The place had been refurbished but on a very tight budget. They have spent all their money I think on the many CCTV cameras found around the hotel. We were in room 9, which was a double; you could see it had had a lick of paint but not much else. The double bed dominated the room leaving little space to put your suitcase down. If you kept the light off the room looked ok, it was a far cry from the images the hotel websites provide. However the room was clean the carpets were stain free, just more time and consideration could have been spent on the over all appearance. You got the impression it was an unfinished rushed job. The bathroom was good, time and effort had been spent here, although it was very very compact. If you were of a bigger build you would struggle moving around the bathroom. The only thing was the grouting in the shower was cracking at the shower tray, which let the image of the bathroom down. We understand that rooms in London are going to be small especially if you are on a budget, but it was far smaller than I had expected. Our bed was the real down fall, every time you moved even slightly the bed would squeak. On the morning of our departure we lifted the mattress up to find that 2 metal slats were broken and a metal rung from the headboard was broken. This was unacceptable regardless of the budget; you should not be given a broken bed. The breakfast was awful; you had the choice of white or brown bread and or cornflakes or cornflakes. To drink you could either have tea coffee or orange juice. The breakfast area was untidy, orange juice was spilt over the counter and cornflakes littered everywhere. The staff were all foreign and had a 'I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not bothered attitude'. This is the most limited continental breakfast I have ever experienced.

I saw previous reviews saying this hotel has poor baggage storage service (where baggages are placed in the lobby or down the stairs). Thanks to those reviews I first got all the valuables out, then requested the staff to keep my baggages at the lobby without moving it and nothing happened.

I have stayed at this hotel on previous occasions (when it was run by the previous owners) & before the so called 'complete refurbishment' (which is a blatant exaggeration of the truth!) Since its takeover by the new proprietors let me point out a few details that may be of importance. The hotel website advertises a double/twin room at \u00c2\u00a370 per night, however on a couple of occasions I have called to book I was told the price was \u00c2\u00a395, when I questioned why, I was informed that due to special events or circumstances the price is put up! However, a mid week stay with no special events that I knew of cannot constitute the hotel adding an extra \u00c2\u00a325 to the price they advertise. It goes against advertising standards - BE WARNED of this little matter. The hotel website also claims that the hotel has been completely refurbished! That may be so for the reception area, but as for the double room I had the 'pleasure' of staying in, it was of a very sub standard condition. There was paint peeling, the decor was akin to something from the 1970's as were the curtains & bed sheets. The rooms are quite small, this I knew of from my previous stays, I am not after luxury, just something thats value for money & convenient. The pictures on the website were nothing like the room I stayed in. Dirty magnolia walls with paper peeling at the edges is something I would liken to one of those 'motels from hell' you would see in a horror flick. Next comes the breakfast room, which seems to be smaller than I remember. Forget a traditional English breakfast as was the case with the previous owners, all you have now is a continental breakfast which you have to queue for. There was no free tables when I visited between the given times of 8.30 - 9.30am, I had to queue as did other people & there was no clean tables or cups. I suggest the hotel proprietor rethinks the window on breakfast times as the one hour period just causes queues & chaos! The waiting staff, although I do not lay the blame with them, did very little to offer any help even though they saw people waiting for a table. Needless to say, I did not wait & went further up the road into Paddington for breakfast. I did make a point of this at reception, but my comments that were written on an A4 piece of paper will no doubt have found its way into the waste paper bin! In summary, I will NEVER stay at this hotel again & I feel sorry for anyone who has the misfortune to believe this is what British hospitality is really like. The standards of this hotel leave alot to be desired & I would suggest they be a little more forward with the truth on their website regarding price of rooms & the complete refurbishment of the hotel is quite obvious to me that they are not being totally honest with their customers.

The bedside table had a huge hole in it which rendred it unusable. When my wife and kids absolutely refused to stay at this place, the receptionist offered to show us other rooms, but these turned out to be even worse than the first room. Apart from this the hotel had a really creepy and wierd atmosphere and definitely not a place you would take your wife and kids to.
