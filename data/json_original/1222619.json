But in fact, it was just a tiny part of our incredible experience of staying in Petit Prince. It was wonderful, indeed! I mean, everything: the location could hardly be better, the apartment is nicely designed, roomy, pretty comfy and really 'warm' (both in terms of climate and the spirit), the facilities are comprehensive - everything you might need is there, from the nice fireplace in the middle of living area till Nespresso with variety of coffee capsules and the fridge, glutted with quality food and fresh drinks by the corteous owner, Charles. Charles is another gem of the place - the best host i ever met, he managed to cover us with a mother-like care all time of our stay. Starting from the intelligent instructions for our way from the airport, sent to us prior to our visit, any possible problems had been solved quickly and effectively. If you need any recommendations re your stay - attractions, places of interest, restaurants, bars, clubs, best way to do this or that - ask Charles and you get it. and what's important - it would be smart recommendations, depending on your own priorities. \"i just want your stay to be perfect\" - that's Charles's motto, and he manages to make it true! Our stay in Petit Prince was perfect and we are already dreaming about coming back to this place. So i recommend everyone to NOT follow my highest recommendations and avoid staying here - otherwise, we just have no chance to book it again ))", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisboa", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Petit Prince\u201d", "Author": "Jorge037", "ReviewID": "UR67474329", "Content": "I just arrived from Amsterdam where I stayed with my family and another couple in the two apartments of the Petit Prince. The house and apartments are great (the suite and the loft) and the location in the city couldn't be better. It's five to ten minutes walking away from everything you might want to see in Amsterdam. The apartment is great and the owner Charles is also great. He tells you all the great places to visit, eat, etc. The apartments are very well designed and decorated with some details that show that Charles is really loves the apartments he ents as well. In this place you get it all. You arrive and the kitchen is full of great food, you have a nespresso machine and Charles even gives you a special home made apple pie that he makes, and it's very good by the way. If you want to take some tours ask Charles. He will know how to help you. In resume, great stay and a very warm thanks to Charles. We will be back for sure.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cperfect apartment for perfect vacation\u201d", "Author": "kikush", "ReviewID": "UR46029593", "Content": "My husband and I loved the location overlooking Prinsengracht, and to seat by the window and watch the canal, the boats and the people in the evening was just perfect!, It is a very nice neighbourhood, with unique little stores and just 5 min. walk from the Dam square. The design was fantastic: luxurious apartment with quality appliances, huge bathroom, fireplace and fully stoked kitchen, and the personalized service provided by the landlord himself, Charles, that was really charming and baked an excelent apple pie . He gave us brilliant ideas where to eat and travel along the city (really special places which we didn't see before).
