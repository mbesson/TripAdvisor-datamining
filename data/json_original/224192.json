Okay, we deserved it, we took the bump from the airlines for the voucher, night before Easter and the airline would put us up. Cab drivers couldn't find this place, it is on the 4th floor of the cardiac care unit at the University Hospital. Problem was there were no hotels rooms in San Juan that nite (or at least the ones we called and that the airline did). 3 People, (2 adults and teenage son) we got a room with one double bed, they knew there were 3 of us. but eventually got a rollaway, which barely fit in the room.Spartan to say the least, but perfect if you have a relative having heart surgery there.Believe me, it wasn't worth the airline vouchers.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR269703552", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "The Absolute Worst Oh my goodness, this place is a HOSPITAL! They don't tell you that it is but its an actual hospital. Its located in the 4th floor and while ur in the elevator, you actually ride it with doctors and patients. It is so terrible. Its in the middle of nowhere where you cant go anywhere without a car or taking a cab.

The staff is rude and the amenities are zilch. This is really a hospital hotel -- really for those who have relatives who are hospitalized. For this purpose, it's fine. Otherwise, don't stay here! There are no restaurants (other than fast food) within walking distance, nor is there public transportation that is easily accessible.
