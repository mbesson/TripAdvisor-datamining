The location is brilliant it is about 10min walk to the Colosseum and about 30mins into the centre with Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps, the longest walk was the vatican which was around an hour, however there are buses and the metro but we opted to walk and see the sites on the way. It is like a bed and breakfast the staff aren't there all day just in the morning but they leave all the contact numbers should you need to contact them (we never needed to), the beds were comforatable and they made the bed and changed all the towls daily, I would highly recommend this hotel due to it's central location and the Inn was perfect", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cSmall Inn, Perfect Staff, great location!\u201d", "Author": "robphys", "ReviewID": "UR122424318", "Content": "THIS IS NOT A HOTEL!! please don't expect this, it is an unmanned Inn, I.E. you have a room and bathroom, but no staff in the place of residence during the day or night. If you are not happy with this then DO NOT STAY THERE!! So now that is out of the way, how do you find it. If, like we did, you come in by Leonardo express train (14 euro's one way and takes 32 minutes!) then the inn is VERY easy to get to. You walk down the left side of the train station to the Zebra crossing, then walk all the way towards the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. If you are stood in front of the church, you will see two streets. You take the street that is on the right, as you walk look very closely at the LARGE doors. the second one you pass will have the Merulana on the 3rd floor. You will be met by Judy, who is Brilliant, extremely helpful (she spent most of a day ringing the airport trying to find our missing luggage!) and very good with local travel advice, restaurants, the best canoli's in town etc. The breakfast is very basic, but its a buffet continental breakfast with bacon and scrambled eggs. and thats it. VERY clean throughout, rooms cleaned and made daily. As for location, for us reasonably fit and active, it was a 10 minute walk to the Colosseum. We also walked from the Vatican through the center of Rome and back. But you are also located 10 minutes away from the Termini (train, Tram and Bus station) with the number 40 express taking you straight to the Vatican. Bus tours also leave the Santa Maria Maggiore every 15 minutes, this will enable you to hop on and off at all the major attractions. We came back from the Inn, on the 31st December 2011 and spent 4 nights there with absolutely no issues (inc Wi-Fi. we would recommend it.

Hotel Management of the future? He can see you but you can't see him! Found online. Don't be fooled by the photos. We booked online using Hotel Club \"Rates to Go\". 170 Euros per night. The hotel is difficult to find, mainly because this is NOT a hotel, with any discernible building or hotel staff, but part of a floor run remotely by an unknown entity with video cameras (creepy?) and one staffer who is not there most of the time. Make no mistake, this is an experimental and unethical business venture, where a Manager without a name or contact number, who you will never see (but he can see you!), runs the business remotely from a secret location using technology to abolish practically all labour costs. Don't believe that insincere welcome. At 170 Euros a night, you are paying proper hotel prices, but will not receive any hotel services. You never know who you are dealing with....They have you full personal details and you will never know their name, address or number....... We went to the third floor and were met by Ms G. One of the first things she pointed out was the remote controlled front door. If necessary the unknown Manager can usher you in and see what's going on using the cameras installed in the ceiling...She took one of our credit cards for what we thought was a room guarantee (ie, for mini-bar - but there wasn't anything in the fridge). We only found out the next morning when we asked her, that she had charged the credit card for the entire 4 night stay, even though we had only just arrived. DAY ONE, first night....We needed to take a shower, but there was NO HOT WATER. Zilch. By this time Ms G. had left the building. There is a sign suggesting a number for emergencies. Whoever answers is totally disinterested. There was nobody to take action to fix what appears to be a problem they have known about for a long time...The hotel does not have and has never had enough hot water for its guests. So we decided that we had better eat. We made a point of booking a \"hotel\" that says it has Wi Fi due to its obvious uses on the road. There was NO WI FI, it simply did not work. When we got back we decided to watch TV. There were 300 stations, all in Italian. Ok we're in Italy. The walls of the tiny room we were given were battered, light fittings didn't work, the plastic bath looked like it had never been cleaned and the tap was hanging off the bathroom wall with silicon gel. When we eventually did take a COLD SHOWER the bath did not drain...The shower curtain was ineffectual and the entire bathroom flooded. Again, nobody we could report this to. Oh dear... DAY TWO. We rose to a another cold shower and a breakfast room full of disgruntled customers. None of them had hot water. While the breakfast was scheduled for 8.00am, Ms G. did not arrive until 8.45am. The breakfast is delivered the previous day and is basically white bread, some packaged croissants, a fatty manufactured sausage slice, plastic cheese slices yoghurt and tinned fruit and some bright yellow scrambled eggs that had been \"interfered\" with. There was foul tasting luke warm instant coffee in a jug and two carafes of coloured artificial substances masquerading as fruit juice. There were 12 people in the little breakfast room (it was impossible to all sit at the tables) ..... We questioned Ms G. abut our credit card being charged in full and she made us wait for a long time while another lady, presumably related to the mystery owner, came and dealt with this. It was clear that there was some tension between Ms G. and her employer, by their raised voices. Ms G. had changed from her jeans into a black and white hotel service costume. On a solitary positive note, we managed to get a temporary refund from the mystery lady. In the end we had a COLD SHOWER and went out to see Rome, at last. We went to use the taps in the room and this time THERE WAS NO WATER AT ALL. The WATER PROBLEM and the WI FI PROBLEM dogged us for the entire 4 night stay, including DAY 3 and DAY 4. The BREAKFAST continued to be TERRIBLE, and we were made to feel UNWELCOME by Ms G. ....We also noticed that in her spare time Ms G.was asking guests to leave positive reviews of the hotel. ...We caught her writing her own reviews! tsk tsk... CHECK OUT was a DISGRACE. We had a plane to catch and we tried desperately to negotiate a satsifactory outcome regarding the room rate in view of everything that had gone wrong. It was not fair that we should pay 170 Euros per night. The mystery video manager off-site was called. He instructed the \"receptionist\" to ensure that we do not leave. In a farcical routine, this woman attempted to take our backpacks out of our hands, with a view to holding them until we paid. Fortunately we were able to keep hold of our things as she attempted to steal them. We needed to meet our plane, so we left immediately. Our attempts to sort out the bill had come to nil. We have never in our lives been faced with such an unprofessional outfit. THEN WE FOUND LATER THAT THE FULL AMOUNT HAD BEEN TAKEN UNAUTHORISED FROM OUR CREDIT CARD. WE COMPLAINED TO THE BANK AND THEY LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION. THE MONEY WAS EVENTUALLY RE-CREDITED TO OUR ACCOUNT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.

This hotel was perfect for us, and a great introduction to Italian hospitality. Judy and the team here were wonderful. Merulana Inn is actually a bed and breakfast, located on the third floor of a residential apartment building. Like most of the places we stayed at, this Inn is discreetly located. No big signs or flashy neon lighting up the street with the name. Just a large double door (like most buildings) with a very small sign posted above a door buzzer with the name of the inn. Our room was beautiful, with a very comfortable bed, and loaded with updated features including a refrigerator, air conditioner and remote-controlled door shutters that roll down to cover the terrace doors at night. Yes, we had a small terrace outside our room. Our large bathroom was equally impressive. It featured modern equipment including a bathtub with a shower, new toilet and even a bidet. The bathroom also had a door that led to the terrace, with a manual shutter/cover. A delightful breakfast of Italian meats, cheeses, breads and croissants was served in the dining area each morning of our stay. The staff also prepared coffee and scrambled eggs with cheese and ham as well. Another great feature here was the free wireless internet service, which was very dependable. A nice modern touch was a small key card holder inside the room where you place one of your key cards, to activate the electricity in your room. This is a great way for the owners to control energy use, as you take your card with you when you leave the room for the day, and the electricity shuts off on its own. Much better than another place we stayed at where many lights and other electrical devices were on timers. Merulana Inn is located within walking distance (10 mins) of the Roma Termini train station. If you are arriving in Rome by plane, you will probably take the Leonardo Express train from the main airport to the Termini. We each had a large backpack and a small, rolling suitcase and were able to walk to the inn with no problem. There are also several cafes, gelato places, grocery stores and pharmacies in the immediate area, and of course churches. The best value in Rome is the Roma Pass. This pass gives you access to the city's Metro system for three days, as well as several museums and archaeological sites (2 free). We used this to visit the Colosseo and Foro Romano (Coliseum and Forum), as well as the Galleria Borghese. The pass only costs 25 euros, and you can purchase it online from the U.S. and pick it up when you arrive in Rome. I can't wait to visit Rome again, and will most certainly stay at Merulana Inn again, as well as recommend it to anybody who is planning to visit The Eternal City.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat !,\u201d", "Author": "Jfp91", "ReviewID": "UR116770033", "Content": "This was our first time in Rome and we are very pleased with our experience at this hotel .

Not a problem for us, but for older travelers or those with physical limitations it could be an issue. Also, because it is in a residential building you will need to be buzzed in the front door. The staff is only at the inn from 8:30am until between 2 and 3pm so if you arrive after that you will need to buzz the webcam to contact the affiliate hotel location and they will buzz you into the building and then into the inn itself. Both times, we arrived when the staff was onsite, so we didn't have a problem. This was an excellent hotel in a perfect location - about 10 min walk to the Colosseum, and 20 - 25 min walk to Spanish Steps. We took a taxi to the Vatican and it only cost 15 euros. Merulana is about 5 blocks from Termini Station, which we easily walked to and from with our suitcases in tow, and it's very easy to navigate with a map. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice hotel at a very reasonable price, in a prime location for site seeing in Rome.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poland", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for sightseeing Rome and for the relax!\u201d", "Author": "MerulanaInn", "ReviewID": "UR56732456", "Content": "Firstly, forgive me my English. I\u2019m not a native speaker. I spent couple of nights in this... Yes, it is some problem to call this place, because it isn't a regular hotel with 24-hour reception desk and staff and with a big neon sign with its name on the building's wall. You shouldn\u2019t expect all these things. It may makes you a deep confusion when you will arrive on Via Merulana 19. It is because I would like to start my opinion from writing some \u201cinstruction <<How to use it>>\u201d for the very first time guests. It is a type of \"bed and breakfast\" (Guest House), but without a doubt it has a 3-star hotel standard. And it\u2019s located in the regular, dark brown-color, beautiful apartment building. To get inside (after 15:00 hour) you have to have your own cell phone to dial the number you can see on the small table on the wall, just on the left side of the big wood door. The person on the phone will inform you what you should do, give you your room number and open the door for you (you will hear a buzz, so push the door to get inside; remember, after 15:00 hour there is no personal assistance for you!). Next, you have to take a lift and go up to 3rd floor, when you can see the door to our Inn. After that, owner should open this door for you (still full automatically, remote, no person assist or invite you). After all these things the rest should be simple: you have to find your room (there is just few of them inside, so it will takes you max. ab.2 minutes). You have to check the open-box close to the door to find an information inside with your name and white magnetic card, which you use to open your room door, the door on the street and the door on the 3rd floor, when you get inside the building. The rest you will learn after reading the information sheet. All these information above may decrease you confusion and stress after arriving, if you have no idea there is no a regular hotel. Personally me and many other guests were convinced that we reserved \u201cnormal\u201d 3-star hotel and what was our surprise on the place\u2026 OK. It was very important for all guests being there for the first time. Now, I would like to add my private opinion about this place as a tourist. Position in the city of \u201cMerulana Inn\u201d is absolutely georgeous! First, it takes just 10-min. walk from Roma Termini Station to Via Merulana 19. You have every most important monuments and parks just around you (Colosseo and Foro Romano is ca. 20-30 min. walk through the beautiful Parco di Traiano, to access Fontana di Trevi takes ca. 30-40 min. walk, same time you need to reach Piazza di Spania, in the next 15 min. you can reach Piazza del Popolo and a lot other interesting places. The rooms are very clean and comfortable (with air-conditioning, mini-bar, tv, safe, map of the center of Rome, phone), bed are superb, and of course bathroom is clean and very good equipped (big shower cabin, hair dryer, tissues, basic cosmetics). Just all you can expect from 3-star hotel. Even \u201cMerulana Inn\u201d is placed in the center of the city, I can say it is quiet place inside (any silence may disturb just some other unruly guests). Breakfasts are OK and enough for the next 2-3 hours sightseeing (I\u2019m still hungry, so maybe breakfast will enough for a longer time for other guests). Everyday from 6 in the morning to 3 in the afternoon (if I remember it correctly) you can meet VERY, VERY KIND AND HELPFUL PERSON, A GOOD \u201cSPIRIT\u201d OF \u201cMerulana Inn\u201d named MISS JUDY! You can always count on her help, whatever regarding your room and Guest House or even your own sightseeing plans. JUDY! I KINDLY THANK YOU PERSONALLY FOR YOUR HELP AND FOR EVEN SIMPLE CONVERSATIONS! KISS YOUR HAND, MADAME! If I will plan another visit in Rome, I will choose again stay in \u201cMerulana Inn\u201dwithout no doubt! You can thrust every positive opinion about this place!

Taking into consideration that Rome accommodation is on the pricey side the Merulana seemed to be good value. The hotel is easy to find from the station and only a few minutes walk (just look out for the purple wall plaque). The entry is not conventional as the door is activated remotely at a sister hotel. After a quick call to the sister hotel we were let in. At this point I think my boyfriend thought 'where the hell has she brought me' as the hall way and staircase is a little drab and office bocky. Then the door opened to the hotel. I then got the thumbs up from an impressed boyfriend who described the hotel as 'the best hotel we have stayed in so far'!

As noted by others, it is an odd little hotel/B+B. There is an attendant on duty every day from about 7:30 am to 3 pm. She sets the breakfast in the morning and then proceeds to clean all the rooms herself. We had the inn book a car for us from and to the airport. It was 60 euros each direction. Expensive perhaps, but probably not much more than a taxi - with the added benefit of the driver knowing exactly where to take us and the inn knowing exactly when we were arriving. I highly recommend emailing them after booking your room and arranging a pick-up. Just to illustrate how helpful that service was, my luggage didn't arrive in Rome when we did. I had to wait in a baggage office line for 90 minutes, with no way of informing the driver that we actually had arrived. We fully expected him to be gone by the time we exited the baggage area, but he was still there waiting for us. (My bag arrived at the inn the next morning.) The hotel belongs to another hotel nearby, which is listed in the folder that will be waiting outside your room when you arrive. Some other travelers have stated that the phones don't work - they do, you just have to know how to dial. Keep at it - you'll get it (dial two 0's before the 6, even though you might think you have to dial just one). There is no reception, just a cold marble entrance behind a big wood door. The building contains businesses - it's an office building, not an apartment block. Only the 3rd floor is a hotel. You'll likely not see anyone else there. The elevator is ridiculously small and ancient. Please remember to shut all doors when you exit the elevator, otherwise no one will be able to call it from other floors. Breakfast is terrible. The juices are all made from powder (the red liquid is NOT tomato juice, but rather a powdered berry juice). There are cold cuts and cheese, a syrupy fruit cocktail and a couple of types of cereal. You can also make toast in the world's slowest toaster. The coffee is horrible, so ask the attendant for a cappuccino instead. She's very helpful and happy to make it. Ten times better than the instant coffee in the Thermos jug. There are only 5 tables (seating 2 each) in the extremely small and narrow breakfast room. It really wasn't terribly busy, so we had no problem finding space (family of 4). Now on to the good stuff. The rooms are clean and modern. They have great HDTVs, but there aren't any English channels. Thankfully, the Beijing Olympics were on when we stayed there, so not much English translation was needed. There isn't a lounge, or a bar or anything. If you're a night owl like myself, you'll have to go elsewhere or give in and just go to bed early. The aforementioned attendant (a very nice young lady at the time of our stay) could not have been more helpful, but, as stated above, she was gone by 3 pm. At that point, big brother in the mothership hotel a few blocks away was watching on all the carefully placed cameras. No matter when you arrive, you'll be let in remotely - either by the attendant from the 3rd floor, or a clerk in the hotel a few blocks away. You just have to use the intercom and all should work out. If the attendant is gone when you check in, your room keycard will be posted outside your door. After that, you'll have your keycard and will be able to let yourself in downstairs and on the 3rd floor whenever you like. In the area - stay away from the restaurant directly across from the big church (Santa Maria Maggiore - read about it on Wikipedia - it's remarkably important) just around the corner from the Merulana on Via Carlo Alberto. The menu is great, the food was really good, but the prices are stupid. Instead, there is a great little unheralded restaurant the other direction down Via Merulana. It's called Tempio di Mecenate and it's located at Lago Leopardi 14-18 (close to about #60 Via Merulana or so - on a small side plaza next to Panne d 'Arte - a fabulous bakery). Tel. 06 4872653 - although you won't need reservations. They have an extensive Sardinian menu. The service is excellent and the prices are great. We found it completely by chance and ate there three times during our six day stay. (Note - the stupidly expensive restaurant is open from 5 am until 2 am, so it has that going for it, whereas Tempio di Mecenate may only be open for lunch and dinner.) There is another good restaurant almost right across the street from the Merulana (half a block away facing away from the church). It's called Scoglio Di Frisio (256 Via Merulana) and serves mainly seafood and pasta. It's an ancient, family run restaurant that's kind of cheesy (grotto theme, guy strolling around the restaurant singing cliched Italian songs like O Sole Mio and Volare - but he has a great voice and brought my wife to tears). The sole is about the best I've ever had anywhere, anytime. The lowdown - would I stay there again? Probably, but I'd keep my expectations realistic. We paid 160 euros a night for the family \"suite\" (basically two adjoining rooms). That's a pretty extraordinary price in Rome for two rooms. To get the same in a more traditional, fully-featured hotel would have cost twice as much.

Management arrived and said they would look into it. At the same time we also explained that the safe did not work. The next day our hot water was fixed so we were happy with the level of service. On our second evening, we came back to a note in our room saying please can you change rooms before the morning. We then had to move all of our gear and settle into a new room. No thank you, or apology for in-convenience. The next morning we had the same problem with no hot water and the heater in the bathroom would not work. Unfortunately the breakfast lady was not there so we had to call a number that they provide if you have any problems. This number was absolutely useless! It's a way for the hotel to hide away from any problems without facing you. We called numerous times, and we either got hung up on, or they said they were doing something about the hot water / heater and never did. After four nights, nothing further was resolved and we never heard back from them! We wanted to call the number to get suggestions for good local restaurants, but again, they either didn't answer or could not help. There is no wireless internet here from the bedrooms. You can get it if you stand in the hallway right next to the main computer. Because this hotel is so small, this really wasn't good enough. Overall, this hotel is obviously very new and their teething problems are far away from being resolved.

Being a bit of a \"Snob\", this has actually been the first time I have ever stayed in a B&B rather than a 4* Hotel. And to my own surprise, I absolutely LOVED it !!! Modern decor, comfortable big bed, lovely bathroom and spotlessly CLEAN. Here is a little bit of guidance for when you first arrive at the Merulana Inn: Should you arrive late afternoon as we did, ring the bell at the main door and it will open to allow access into a large hallway. At the end of the hall you'll find a rather nice oval stairwell and a sweet little lift. Now, despite fellow reviewers questioning the functionality of the lift we deceided to chance it ......and yes, IT DOES WORK. Just press the red \"C\" button to call the lift. Admittingly there's only room for 2 people, but once you're in you'll actually enjoy the ride up to the 3rd floor. We certainly did. To gain access from the 3rd floor landing into the actual accommodation, press the button to your left on the wall and the door open's automatically. You'll probably find that there's no one at reception to check you in ..... don't panic - it's all pretty well organised. There is a list of expected arrivals next to the key board on the desk. You'll find your name and allocated room number on that list. Proceed to your room and you'll find a welcome pack with your key card in a wall rack ,outside your room. Let yourself in and enjoy !! You can check in properly at breakfast the next morning. We would like to give A BIG THANK YOU to the wonderful housekeeper ( unfortunately we didn't get her name ) who was on breakfast / housekeeping duty during our stay ....she really looked after us !!! The breakfast buffet was constantly replenished, she cleaned our room every morning, to the highest standard - fresh towels, bed linen, topped up \"in room\" tea / coffee making facilities etc.and was extremely helpful, always with a smile. (also, I wish my Italian was as good as her english ) Finally, the Merulana Inn is a credit to the owners / management who obviously take pride in ensuring that guests truly enjoy their stay in Rome ! We will definately come back.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA hidden gem of a hotel\u201d", "Author": "mulholml", "ReviewID": "UR13310977", "Content": "Stayed here with husband, parents and my brother. Went through the hotels own website which did work out a little cheaper. Good email contact with the hotel before we left for Rome. The only thing is that on the website the address is shown as 46, it is not it's number 19. Rooms on the 3rd floor so 3 flights of stairs. There was a lift but we never tried this. No reception but cardkeys and info are outside your room on arrival. The Inn itself is beautifully deorated with a wonderful smell of 'newness'. The rooms have all you require for your stay. Beds are firm and very comfy, pillows are large and soft. The room has heat and AC, windows open fully and my parents had a room with a balcony so useful for the smokers. En-suite is large enough with shower only, towel heater which made this room very warm ant the shower itself was excellent. Flat screen tv, but ony english speaking channel was MTV, although not much tv was watched as you don't want to miss a second of Rome. Tea and coffee making facilities and mini bar which was reasonably priced. Breakfast was typical hams, cheese,etc but very tasty and this is the only time you will see an employee. You will not be dissapointed with this hotel with lots of friendly bars and cafes in the vacinity. Irish bar was across the road that serves generous helpings of JD compared to cola and was cheaper than italian bars. I hope this helps and enjoy, we loved it.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHidden Surprise\u201d", "Author": "FabFab", "ReviewID": "UR12981510", "Content": "This hotel had only been open a few weeks when we stayed there so everything was shiny and new!
