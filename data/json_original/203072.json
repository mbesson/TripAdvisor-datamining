The front desk was very, very helpful! They gave us information about sightseeing tours and were very friendly. I highly recommend using one of the tourist double decker buses to see Rome. It helps you see a lot, without spending lot of money or killing your feet by walking. You might feel like a cheesy tourist but its worth it....and Rome is filled with tourist anyway. The hotel is a close walk to the Vatican. It is parallel to a street that has many clothing and shoe stores. There is a great little restaurant/bar near by, dont remember the name...if you stand in front of the hotel facing the street...the place is on a street to the left, perpendicular to the street the hotel is on. I highly recommend the place! The bartender was super friendly, which we really appreciated since we had some run ins with a few rude locals in a couple of other cities in Italy (especially Firenze). Not only was the staff at the restaurant super friendly but the food and wine was fantastic and not expensive. We had the traditional pasta of Rome, aged meats (which is their specialty) and cheese, and wonderful red wine, recommended by the bartender. Back to the hotel....the rooms are decent. A little dark inside because of the dark wallpaper and black out curtains. The rooms were clean. There are great balconies in the rooms that open out to the street. You can hear a little bit of the street traffic but its not bad. The beds werent very comfortable, a little soft for my liking. We had two twins put together to make a king...which is what you get in Europe when you ask for a King bed, not bad, but hard to cuddle in. Pretty large bathroom. There is a step leading up to the tub...which isnt good if you are handicaped. Something we learned the hard way in Europe, is the U.S. dollar is worth less over there. 1 euro is equal to 1.50 U.S. Which sucks, so we ended up paying a lot more on the trip than we planned.

Regrettably my high expectations came down to the ground with a thud, as I was sorely disappointed by the standard of the accommodation.

The room (Superior Double) was kept immaculately clean. 3. Very convenient location for visiting the Vatican and St. Peters. 4. Free airport collection from Fiumicino (Leonardo da Vinci) Airport. Now on to the negatives\u2026 1. The room was small for a Superior Double, with little circulation space. 2. The room d\u00e9cor and furnishing for a Superior Double were substandard going on past experience of 4 Star hotels; the quality was in keeping with a poor to average 3 Star hotel: a) Use of fittings and fixtures to give the impression of a 4 Star room, but upon closer inspection, the materials used\\ were of mediocre quality. b) Bed base was wire and the surround made with cheap, wood that looked like \u201cbamboo\u201d with \u201cHessian\u201d texture pattern finish. c) Desk and bedside cabinet were made with the same wood. d) Only one working plug point available to charge mobile phone and it was difficult to push in and remove the plug. e) No digital room safe. f) The room door had key lock, not a \u201cswipe\u201d card. g) The bathroom had no place to hang the large bath towels to dry. When I raised this with the staff, the solution was to hang the towels back of the bathroom door handle! h) The hand towels were similar to tea towels, smooth with no pile. i) Shower head holder was too low on wall; I\u2019d say only someone 153cm could stand under it and I\u2019m 189cm! j) The wall bracket for the shower head was loose and the shower head kept dropping down when in use; unless you took great care to adjust its position. k) The Jacuzzi controls in the bath did not work and one control knob was removed. l) Two redundant plumbing connections protruded from the wall tiles. I asked a few other guests what their rooms were like; they also thought the standard was \u201caverage\u201d and had the same problem with the shower head bracket, which suggests complacency on the part of the owners regarding lack of proper maintenance. I did not eat any food in the hotel, so I can\u2019t comment on what was available. I think the hotel owners would benefit from: 1. Lowering the hotel\u2019s rating to 3 Star, down from 4, to lower the advance expectations of guests. or 2. Implementing an extensive refurbishment programme to bring the rooms up to a 4 Star standard. I do wonder what standard of hotels the people writing glowing reviews of the Atlante Garden Hotel had stayed in before; somehow I doubt typical 4 or 5 Star hotels. If further evidence was need why this hotel is not up to a 4 Star standard, I booked my third night at the Kolbe Hotel Rome, which comfortably deserved its 4 Star status \u2013 please see my review.

The spa jets didn't work properly either. We were on our honeymoon (informed them of this) and yet they gave us a room with 2 single beds! They did give us a complimentary bottle of prosecco though which we appreciated greatly. We had to wait for an hour and a half at the airport for the free airport shuttle even though we gave them all our flight details and were waiting at the designated area as advised.

The rooms are smaller and they charge for what should be complimentary. So let me give the the North American low down. 1) Don't expect a large room, or modern decor. The rooms are velvet wallpaper so its dated but it kind of works because all the buildings are so so old here. 2) Front Desk was very nice and helpful. 3) Keys are not plastic but real keys with a huge fob on the end you can't possible fit in your pocket. You are supposed to drop your key off at the front desk every time you go out. Weird and outdated but it was fine for us. Sometimes my wife just took the keys in her purse. 4) Internet is pay at some crazy rate and you have to go the front desk and by cards!!! uhhhh (first 5 min free). If you know how to modify your mac address you can get unlimited 5 min (I used my own dd-wrt flashed router to repeat to my families laptops and modify mac addres). 5) Breakfast is 8 Euro ($15 dollars) per person extra. Careful because expedia lists both with and without breakfast and its easy to confuse the two. 6) This hotel is 2 min walk to square and vatican etc. Very very convenient. Bus 81 leaves from square every 10 min to coliseum and costs only 1 euro per person. 7) Overall this was a great option price wise for our family to see rome. I give it a thumbs up but know about the points I have listed above. 8) Oh there are literally hundreds of little restaurants that serve pizza pasta and many other dishes and you eat on tables right out on the side walks... very nice at night or anytime. Pasta costs about 6-8 euros and 8-10 euros for nicer dishes. Watch out for the odd restaurant charging more. More expensive is not better in our experience. Oh one more gotcha... at this hotel its a free pickup shuttle from the airport but they charge 40 euros when you want to go back to the airport... and you need to book at least 24 hours in advance... and I think actually on expedia they said 3 days... so email them your itinerary asap.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cRecommended\u201d", "Author": "Richard W", "ReviewID": "UR117335299", "Content": "For the eight days I stay at the Atlante Gardens I found the staff very helpful and friendly particularly the three men who manned the reception desk.

Bathroom: although having what looked a new toilet, the bath area should have been retiled and grouted. The jacuzzi looked old and there were switches missing - I didn't attempt to use it as I wasn't happy about the hygiene of using someone elses bathwater (which is left in the pipes) but as there were buttons missing I can only assume it wasn't useable anyway. Sitting areas: A few 'nice' relaxing areas to just sit and 'chill' in were the bar area and a small reading room. Unfortunately though the furniture in the reading area consisted of another old settee with an old fastioned cover on it and the bar area furniture wasn't much better. It looked like it had come from a second hand shop.

Our room was large and had a walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom was also huge and had a jacuzzi. Our 4th floor room was tastefully decorated and our windows opened onto a central courtyard, so no street noise meant a good night's sleep. A good idea was the night light at floor level because of the differing floor levels from bedroom to bathroom. The only problem with the room was in the bathroom. The water pressure was extremely low and filling the jacuzzi took forever, especially when the plug didn't seal properly either. Mind you, taking a shower wasn't much better as it was only a trickle if you wanted hot water .. cold water, no problem! The breakfast was the usual and was OK as by the end of our trip we were over cold breakfasts of cereals, meat, cheese and cakes/pastries and very strong coffee! The hotel's service and the staff were great (thanks for the complimentary bottle of chilled wine on arrival). The hotel is in a good location to see the Vatican and is one street away from great shopping and one street in the opposite direction from good restaurants. The hotel has it's own restaurant but judging by the menu we saw, was quite expensive so we chose to eat elsewhere.

Prior to arrival I was a bit worried about the mixed reviews on the hotel, but once we set foot in the hotel all concerns vanished: we got excellent service and comfortable accommodation that really made our trip! Our flight arrived to Fiumicino around 10 pm and on the hotel website it said that the free hotel shuttle service ends at 10 pm. Nonetheless I booked the shuttle in advance, and received really thorough instructions on how to find the driver at the airport. We found our way to the meeting point very easily. At first the driver wasn't anywhere in sight (we were warned about this in advance) so I dialed the toll free number I'd received and surely enough the hotel receptionist confirmed that our driver was already on his way! We got straight to the hotel in about 20 min, easily thanks to this excellent service! Arriving to the hotel the staff had left a complimentary bottle of Prosecco in our room to celebrate my moms birthday, a really nice gesture and set our weekend off on a happy note. We had a triple room (one double bed, one single) on the 4th floor with two windows, the other to the side of the building and the other to the back facing a little garden with orange trees. The room was spacious, the beds comfortable and bathroom recently renovated with good taste. The decor was classy and everything was clean, even the carpet, which always scares us Scandinavians a bit;) True, the whole building did seem the shake when bigger vehicles passed by and the jacuzzi didn't work, but we managed to sleep well and there was plenty of hot water and the shower water pressure was good which I appreciated. Also couldn't hear any noise from the corridor of other rooms which was nice. The room did get a little chilly at night, but nothing a few extra blankets from the cupboard couldn't fix! All throughout our stay the service we got was very good, far better than in many hotels in this price range The friendly staff spoke good english, we got our bags carried to the room, the two receptionists were really helpful and helped us book a table for dinner, etc. Also there was a small lobby bar (that doubled as a breakfast room) with a really friendly waitress providing us with extra glasses for our rooms etc. The Prati neighborhood was really nice and seemed like a safe and quiet neighborhood but yet there were lots of good quality, value-for-money restaurants around so we didn't have to venture far in the evening. We didn't have breakfast included so we did what the locals do, grabbed a freshly squeezed juice, cappuccino and croissant at one of the many cafes nearby. Towards the Vatican wall and the little square next to the hotel prices were higher than a few blocks away. Also beware that if you sit down at a cafe you get charged more that standing at the counter. Location- wise the Vatican was a heartbeat away for the hotel and the rest the the major sights were just across the river so we could walk everywhere in Rome! It was also handy to be so close the the Vatican so you could hit the sights before the massive queues! Unfortunately the rooftop gardens were closed in both our hotel and the sister hotel Atlante Star but we did sneak a peek at the Les Etoiles dining room view of St. Peters and the view was stunning! Tip: Go on the street behind the hotel and towards the Ottaviano metro station, lots of good shopping on that route! Also note, that since the beginning of January Rome has started charging a tourist tax put towards developing their visitor services The tax is 3 e per night, per person and had to be paid when checking out. Overall, I've stayed in many hotels in European capitals in the same price range , but Atlante Garden really was excellent value for money. Really comfortable, great location and good service.

The confirmation e-mail from the hotel mentioned our terminal correctly, but somehow he was waiting for us at another one. Ok, we all make mistakes and after all he did arrive rapidly in a few minuted to pick us up. Unfortunately on foot so we had to walk with our luggage to the other terminal.

Not a lot of money, but strange change in any case. Now to the room. Twin bed and 2 extra beds instead of the 2 double beds that were booked. Windows and shades dirty. Later we tried the jacuzzi. Didn't work so we had a basic bath tub. The back of the bathroom door had instructions for the jacuzzi or how it had once been working. The 3 buttons described in the instructions didn't even exist adn had been covered with metal plates. I called the reception and they sent someone quite soon over. He did some tricks under the tub (which was in a absolutely horrible state behind a front panel). He got the pump working and instructed me to press the start/stop button really hard to operate it. Really hard meant REALLY HARD. I was the only one in the family who was able to start or stop the jacuzzi. At night we closed the inside and the very dirty outside wood panels on the windows. Still the noise was like we had been sleeping on the street. We could easily hear people talking while passing the hotel. Trucks passing made the bed tremble.

Once we got there, they were kind enough to let us leave our luggage with them until check-in time so that we could walk around (we went to Castel San Angelo 3 blocks away and then to the Pantheon, about a 20 minute walk away). When we got back, our room was ready and they kindly showed us our way. The room was small, by US standards, but it was cozy and clean. It was prettier than I expected and had all the things that I needed. The only minor thing that I didn't like about this hotel was that it was not near central Rome. It is by the Vatican, on the left bank of the Tiber River. In order to get to ancient Rome, you'd either have to take a cab (about 7 euros) or walk (about 30 minutes) or take public transportation (we didn't do this so I can't tell you how it is). Also, it is much quieter on the left bank of the Tiber than it is on the right bank (perhaps more so than usual since we went in August). Almost all of the shopping, good dining, and the tourist attractions (except for the Vatican of course) is on the right bank of the Tiber, and pretty far from the hotel. Luckily for us, we booked all our tours with hotel pick-up so none of this was an issue. Don't let me scare you though, the location is not terrible. It's not in the middle of nowhere. It's 4 blocks from the river, so you can get to the right bank by foot with no problems, if that's what you want to do. Also, a 7 euro cab ride to the center of the city is not bad at all, and we did it quite a number of times.

The breakfast buffet is a reasonable deal at 9 euros, not free but it was an excellent way to start your day, go early if you want a seat. The room was very large by European standards and well appointed. The only real issue was there was a pretty strong smell of mildew in the room that was bothersome but manageable if you kept the room aired out.

Only 1 of the 4 front desk attendants we encountered were helpful. Basics like shampoo and toilet paper were not replenished either. The cleaning lady was on her cell phone every time we saw her, so I guess she was too busy to do her job. Also, the skimpy continental breakfast that one of the front desk attendants told us was included was charged to us while checking out. Since we were already running late to catch our flight (because the front desk didn\u2019t follow through on the wake up call we requested), we had to pay it. 9 Euro per person for coffee and a croissant.

It's not a 4-star by any standards I am aware of. As other reviewers say, Hotel 6 might be better. The personnel was not exactly friendly, put it mildly. I called them few days before our check in to ask for separate beds in a room since we were traveling with a child. When we arrived, they put us in a room with a queen bed and upon my request to change the room they started showing me Priceline regulations and advised to call the company. After numerous debates the issue was escalated to a manager who finally knew English well enough to realize we were not looking for a double-room but rather for an extra bed. OK, we got one, but it was the first hotel in my life where we got two twin-size beds and no extra pillow/blanket/towel, etc. for a third person. My wife complained on the neck problems after sleeping there for just three nights. Also, b/c the hotel faces a busy street, you can hear noise 24/7 especially if you have a jetleg and get overly sensitive to the sounds. For whatever reason, the clerk at the front desk put the numbers of our passports into the system and warned us that this is for the police that may come and check the room. Are you kidding me? Police coming to check a room in a 4-star hotel or be it even a hostel. This is not a railway station or whatever, and I don't give a damn s...t to Italian police. Why would you want to come to my room? Anyways, this was the most bizarre explanation I have ever heard at the hotel but I believe everything is possible in Italy. The room was tiny and didn't look even close to what you'd expect to find in a 4-star hotel. There were paint stains, various wires, falling power outlets - you name the rest. Jacuzzi was not entirely clean but was acceptable except for the broken plug that wouldn't retract when you turn the handle. Of course, we discovered after we took a bath so I had to remove it manually which was not exactly easy given the bath was full. Sure thing, no one bothered to fix it. The room had the tiniest TV you can possibly find on the market. I was not even aware you can still buy it, but apparently this was a special order. The netbook size screen (perhaps 11\") was a joke. However, you won't need it anyways since it only had ONE English channel, namely CNN. The TV stood on the ugly receiver and both had a whole bunch of wires connected to the extension cord on the floor. For whatever reason, there was a two-inch metal bolt protruding from the door. I''ve yet to figured out the purpose of the thing, but it was quite annoying. The breakfasts were OK, but the coffee was terrible, which is quite unusual for Italy. One more thing that stroke me is that I was going to order a taxy to get to the airport and got a qoute of Euro 50 while I knew that there is a fixed price of Euro 30. I am not sure if it was a purposeful mislead since they said they prepay reservations and asked to pay directly at the front desk or the guy didn't know the price (which I doubt though), but in any case for a hotel pretending to be a 4-star such attitude is inappropriate. We ended up getting a taxi just outside which took us to the airport for 30 Euro as clockwork. Once again, I don't know why this hotel claims to be a 4-star establishment. It's a solid 2 1/2 stars, maybe 3 stars, but I'd be reluctant to give it more than 3 stars even if someone put a gun to my head. I believe that they followed all technicalities (jacuzzi, TV, room service, restaurant, etc.) but that was just it. Overall, I didn't feel like I was a desired guest there and I would definitely suggest you to stay away from this place, unless you make a blind bid. The location is great however, two blocks from the Vatican City (Saint Peter's and Musem), two blocks to Octavian subway and within walking distance from the center (Spanish steps, shopping districts). There's a bus/trolley car stop right outside. I suggest you to stay in a brand name hotel to get what you'd expect from a 4-star hotel. We used to Stay in Carlton in Amsterdam and Marriott in Paris and both hotels were top-notch, beyond what you'd expect to get.

Stellar service - When we checked in we mentioned to the gentleman at the front desk that we had an early flight and were worried about transportation to the airport. He said he would find us a car for that morning - he took down our information and said to check with him the morning we were to leave. The morning we were to leave - at 6:00 the front desk called and our car was waiting for us (I didn't have to check with anyone). We were at the airport in 20 muniutes (no traffic and a fast driver).

We were able to get to the historic downtown area in a matter of 15 minutes by foot. I am giving the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 because the front desk staff didn't seem overly friendly and once again a King size bed consisted of two mattresses stuck together which is no good whether your traveling with a date you want to be close to or someone you want to be separate from. Either way it is annoying and I don't know why they have to do it. I've seen in some cases where you can actually separate the beds but in this case they are stuck. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, especially someone who wants to be close to the Vatican. There are also restaurants and nightlife right around the corner.

We immediately went down to the front desk and asked him to call the police so they could file a report, as would we. At first, he refused to call the police and said that we would have to visit the police station tomorrow instead. My wife and I then insisted that the police come today to check for any evidence. The front desk used the excuses \u2018they can\u2019t speak English\u2019 and \u2018they won\u2019t come even if you call them\u2019. We then said firmly that if he did not call the police himself, we would. Therefore, he called the police and the police came 15 minutes later. They inspected the damages and the door in which the lock was not broken or appeared to have used force to open. This led to the obvious conclusion that whoever had stolen from us had a key to the room and knew exactly when we were out. The next morning we visited the police office to file our report and review theirs.

The rooms were older, with broken shower fixtures that seemed like they would fall on your head. The shuttle to the hotel was great, but we had to pay for a shuttle back to the airport. The TV was awful - tiny, with horrible service. And I can confirm: The hotel shifts groups from hotel to hotel with dubious reasons - a group picked up by the same airport shuttle was moved from one hotel to another, supposedly due to a trashed room. The \"King size bed\" is actually two beds pushed together. It was loud at night, but double glazed windows pretty much kept the street noise out. That being said, we knew what we were getting into.

However when we reached the front desk, we were transferred to Hotel Columbus because there was an issue with our room. Supposedly a guest staying above didn't turn off the bath tap and our room was filled with water. We were told that they would have another room ready for us on the 2nd night, and they will give us a complimentary transfer to the train station + free breakfast. We were also pleased when they said that we only needed to leave our luggage in the other hotel the next morning, and that they will take care of everything. On the 2nd evening, we went directly to Atlante Gardens and they gave us a room on the top level because they still didn't have available rooms. We were happy with the upgrade. In the room we felt that it looked nice, and had a balcony. However the room looked a little worn down, but we didn't mind since we already got upgraded. But I think this was more of a 3star hotel because we stayed at other 4 star hotel in Milan and found a huge difference in room standards. Basically, if you can find good deal for this hotel, it's OK, but if you are paying high prices like those advertised on the website and in here, just be prepared. Also, the hotel recommended us to this restaurant nearby -La Barca, and I wrote a separate review on it and you can just search for La Barca, Rome. Please be very careful of this restaurant as they exploit tourists. On our last night, after the not so good experience from La Barca, we decided to clarify with the front desk about our free transfer to the train station. And to our disappointment, the staff ( a different one on shift) told us flatly that he doesn't have any information of this sort, and pointed to the blank comments on our information from a file. So we explained ourselves again, and he said to us \"you know what, everyone says different things. just do what you like, I don't care\". That upset us but we asked what he meant so he just said \"yes, just come down tomorrow morning. we'll pay for it\" That marked the not so pleasant end of our 5 night stay in Rome.

The lobby is so unimpressive and dirty looking. It doesn't look very sanitary nor appealing. Our room was shockingly unattractive. We couldn't even think of romance nor relaxation because it just felt so dirty and dusty!!! To top it off, it was really dark/dim making it feel so much more sketchy!!! The bed had one of those gross and old beige blanket that look like they are never washed (or washed once a year). The sheets were so rough and I even found a tiny spider crawling on our bed. The carpet were so nasty I didn't even dare to walk with barefeet! We had to force ourselves to sleep here because we had no idea what to do or where to go that night.

I agree with the other reviewer here--people should be punished for false advertising! The hotel website made the rooms look luxurious, this is a BIG misrepresentation. They should have shown those ugly topper they have on their beds and the rusty handle in the tub! On a little brighter note--the one night staff was really nice and felt sorry for us.

The hallways of the hotel look like public restrooms because of the decor- again- it is NOT by any standards a 4 star hotel. 5. The Front desk staff is not helpful- you have to be very persistent in your requests. 6. And the MAIN problem. We booked the hotel 6 (!) months in advance- 3 rooms to be exact. When we arrived at the Atlante Garden, they informed us that the previous group decided to extend their stay and they did not have any rooms available for us there but they would accomodate us at their sister hotel Atlante Star which is about a block away. Now, I try to be flexible and yet I do not comprehend how it is our problem that their guests did not leave on time- they should have been moved at the sister hotel since they official stay ended. So...back in the transfer van and on to the Star. The driver of the van was so pissed that he almost ran over my husband who was still in the process of getting in the van. To summarize this storyline, I would reccomend to find some place else to stay. Next time I will stay at a 5 star- it is not worth the hassle and the disappointment on your vacation. And there is another lesson learned- there is a reason you see bad ratings, people don't post them for fun; they tend to be very accurate 99% of the time.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cGreat situation, great staff\u201d", "Author": "vinnyjonnes", "ReviewID": "UR23164394", "Content": "We went to this hotel in december with my husband and my 9- months-old baby.

The hotel is nicely located a couple of blocks from the Vatican in a fairly residential neighborhood which is perfect. There is excellent bus service, close to the metro, tour companies come to the hotel to pick you up and everything you would expect in a residential neighborhood is there - shops, restaurants, etc. If you walk out of the hotel, walk left and take a right at the first cross street, you will come to a delightful restaurant mid block. Blue awnings. Sponge painted inside blue walls. They make their own pasta and it melts in your mouth. Forget the place across from it - service there is terrible. If you walk to the right when you come out of the hotel, you will come to a piazza within a couple of blocks. You will see the Vatican walls. Shops, buses, and restaurants. The staff at the hotel are wonderful, friendly, and eager to please. I found that everyone on the desk spoke English. Lock your valuables in the safe deposit type boxes at the desk, there are no in room safes. The hotel is very clean, linens nice, warm blankets, good pillows, nice light for reading in bed, big window in my room opened. The small room with a big double bed had wonderfully high ceilings so it never seemed so small. Huge closet. Pretty striped wallpaper with matching draperies. Luggage rack. Desk. 2 straight chairs. TV on the desk - no CNN but other English channels. Bathroom very clean. Tile everywhere. Jacuzzi tub with hand held shower. Bidet. Lots of towels. The attractive carpet was sort of bumpy and there were some stains although it appeared clean. No fault to find with this room! Go to the fifth floor and walk out to the roof garden - wonderful! City views. Garden furniture. Flowers. There is a small elevator. On the ground floor there is a bar that is open for cocktails, a breakfast room, living room with a computer (charge) free Italian newspapers. The included breakfast is very complete and bountiful. Great coffee. Cold buffet foods, boiled eggs. Staff work very hard and keep everything supplied well. I was very happy in my home away from home in Rome. The hotel includes free airport pick up with your reservation - it is a shared van ride so you might have to wait a few minutes after you arrive. Don't panic. Excellent driver. Very welcome after a long flight. You can hire the service to return you to the airport if you like. If you like fine dining, by all means try the top floor restaurant at the sister hotel, the Atlante Star. The food is spectacular and you have views of the illuminated St Peter's Basilica while you dine. Walk out of the hotel, turn left, take the first cross street to the right for 2 blocks.

The staff were friendly and helpful, the one problem I had( air con not working on my first night) was rectified the next day, otherwise the room was fine. The hotel is an old building which has obviously had some recent refubishment but not a great deal of it, it looks a little dated and tired but is comfortable and clean. I was in room 139 on the first floor and although traffic noise could be heard all night you soon get used to it, after all this is Rome its to be expected. The hotels location is fantastic, its very close to the Vatican museums and Saint Peters, about a 10 minute walk. Its a great place for the metro station and bus service too which makes it so easy to get to the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and the Colosseum. But if walking to the sights is your thing than the aid of a good street map and some comfortable shoes are a must. The Atlante Garden serves a continental style breakfast which quite adequate with a choice of pastries and breads, fruit, cereal, eggs, fruit juice and tea/coffee. As for lunch there are plenty of cafes all over Rome so you wont go hungry, but be warned if the prices are not displayed you may get a shock when the bill comes, so ask about the cost of everything before you order, I learned this the hard way after being in the Vatican Museum, across the road is the Vatican Cafe( its not connected in any way to the Vatican), this place has got to be the most expensive cafe in all of Europe let alone Rome, and the food is not great. If you find yourself around the area of the Hotel and looking for a place to eat then take a stroll down Via Cola di Rienzo, a bustling street full of shops, here you will find designer boutiques and supermarkets, as well as the odd market stall. Via Cola di Rienzo is a wonderful place to watch Romans living their lives, take your time to look down the side streets too and you will find plenty of pizzerias and restaurants, and choosing wisely will ensure you get good food at reasonable prices. Always look for the places that the local people eat in, if it\u2019s good enough for Romans it\u2019s definitely good enough for everyone else. But if you want a tip on a fantastic place to eat than turn onto Via Orazio and then onto Via Plinio where you will find Raf (www.rafristopizza.com). This is a great place to eat, the menu is very good with a fine selection of food, the price are displayed on the menu and if you are unsure what something is you can ask the extremely friendly staff, who made us feel very welcome. After dinner take a walk along Via Crescenzio to the Piazza Risorgimento and stroll down the side streets to Saint Peters to see it all lit up, be warned the police close the square at 11pm so get there in plenty of time to take some photographs. I enjoyed my visit to Rome and my stay at The Atlante Garden, and would recommend the hotel to everyone, just be careful about what you believe on the website, read it carefully as the photos and services mentioned on the sites(yes theres more than one) can be very misleading, most refer to the sister hotel, the Atlante Star, which is a more expensive place.

There was dust and paint everywhere and the staff made no effort to help us through the debris and mess. We finally got into our room which was less than expected to say the least. The bathroom was very poorly constructed and the amenities were not satisfactory for a three star hotel much less the four star that it claimed to be. The pullout that they put in our room to make a three person accommodation for us looked shabby and at least 20 years old. The staff at the front desk was not friendly by any stretch of the imagination and make no effort to accommodate any special requests we made. Their supposed \"free transport from the airport\" is exactly that - FROM the airport only. If you would like a ride back to the airport, its going to cost you a whopping 48 Euros for each person!!!! This seems completely impractical considering they must drive there to pick people up anyways. The internet that they provide (at a very expensive price) was absolutely awful. Pages would load only once in a while and only after minutes of waiting. (This was not a problem with my computer.) The room was very poorly lit, which seems minor, but made the stay even less comfortable. The rooftop restaurant that they claim to have, and which they make every effort to showcase as part of their hotel is not even on that building. Its a couple of blocks away at another building of theirs, BEWARE if you are interested in eating there.

It does not deserve a 4 star rating in my opinion. That does not mean it is not nice - just that it is not 4 stars. We had two different rooms during our stay due to a flight cancellation that required us to stay two extra nights. The hotel accommodated us but of course it was not the Priceline price. At 100 Euros a night for the two extra nights it was still probably less than the regular price but I would not want to pay that for a longer stay and didn't pay nearly that much with Priceline for our first 6 nights. The first room (#240) was roomy and nicely decorated but a ridiculously small TV, irregular hot water, and low toilet pressure. The second room was larger with an extra bed and a sleeper couch with severely out-of-shape cushions but it had a nicer TV. The second room (#336) looked older and worn out with cracked sink and tile in the bathroom, in need of a general renovation. And the walls are thin so bring your earplugs. We noticed in more in the second room and could hear conversations next door and had to bang on the wall one night because there was so much noise. Some of the couches and chairs in the hallways and in our first room are covered with sheets probably because they're worn out. The windows have inside shutters that help some with outside noise but don't expect quiet. Our earplugs helped. The buffet breakfast is good and once you learn the bus system you can get to old Rome easily. You are about 3 blocks from St Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Museum. Old Rome (Forum, Coliseum) are on the other side of the river. You are a 10 minute walk from the Ottaviano metro stop. All-in-all it's not a bad hotel if you get a decent price.

Not sure, but got the impression the Atlante Star was slightly more up market. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, although personally, if I was going again, I'd probably try to stay the other side of the river, nearer the Spanish steps. If you do stay at Altante Gardens my top tips would be: 1) Arrange by email for the courtesy bus to collect you from the airport - it's a great service and they only charge for the return journey. 2) Take some trainers (sneakers) - the best way to see Rome is on foot and even flat shoes are no match for those cobbles! 3) If you're looking for restuarants near the hotel head south for the back streets between via crescenzio and via delia conciliazione - don't do as we did and head straight to via crescenzio, which is a great shopping street but has no restaurants.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cVery fine hotel showing its age\u201d", "Author": "Kartvelebi", "ReviewID": "UR12994881", "Content": "Got a great deal on this hotel through Priceline and was pleasantly surprised with the overall quality of this old grande dame hotel. This hotel was comfortable to stay at, well located and reasonably clean. You know how some great old hotels show their age very badly and are nowhere close to supporting their claims to five stars? Well this isn't one of them...not in January 2008. But it will be soon. Yes the room and bathroom were generally clean. But not anywhere close to clean enough to use the 30 year old jacuzzi bathtub. The furnishings were plush. The bed was one of the most comfortable and the Satellite TV had the best English offerings of any hotel we visited in Italy. The breakfast was among the very worst of any we experienced in Italy. This is one of the things about this hotel that makes it more of a three star hotel vs. their inconsistently claimed five stars. (Do you ever notice how the ash trays and towels say five stars and the literature say three or four stars?) Breakfast was so very bad that we skipped it after the first two mornings. Service was spotty. This is one of those older, larger hotels where the staff has so much to do that they're on autopilot...never really connecting to you as anything more than a commodity. The TV remote didn't work and the guy they sent was puzzled and it went unresolved throughout our stay. The hotel wasn't very helpful in finding us restaurants, except for suggesting their own very expensive restaurant. Based on our overall experience as well as their breakfast, I wasn't about to risk 200+ euros on their restaurant. I'd suggest you don't either. Don't be afraid of this hotel's Vatican location. You might think it's not convenient for the ancient sites on the other side of the river, but it is only a five minute walk to the Metro and you can see all of Rome easily from this hotel. I'd stay here again. We were comfortable here. But I'd rather try something different. This hotel was a great value but, I'd rather pay a little more and get a little more, too (which is not too difficult to do in January in Rome).

We waited 45 minutes for the driver at Terminal B, we had given our flight details on beforehand, we called the hotel twice to ask where the driver was and in the end he arrived from Terminal C where he had been waiting for us. Driving time to the hotel is 25 minutes. If you want the hotel to drive you back to the airport, it costs 45 euro for 2 persons while the Leonardo Express train from Termini station to the airport is 11 euro per person and it takes exactly 30 minutes.

The bathroom was also big but the jacuzzi announced on the hotel website is in fact a bath transformed into a jacuzzi but it did not work at all, 1 button was missing and 2 where broken. It was the same in other rooms. The only problem of the hotel is that it is located on a very busy street so it is really noisy at night. Also, they have only single-glass windows so it is also cold at night. The breakfast room is small (12 tables) with a small breakfast buffet: salami, cheese, mortadella, bread, cornflakes, cakes, and that's it. Coffee is cold, so either drink it fast or have a coffee somewhere else than in the other. Also, there is no tea/coffee facility in the room but there is a fridge (not electronic so you can put your own stuff in it) with 2 glasses. There is a supermarket close to the hotel: when leaving the hotel, turn in the first street at your left and at the end, you'll come in a street full of shops: cross the road and turn right until you see \"COIN\". This shop has a supermarket located in its basement. Take a bag with you otherwise you will have to pay for their bag. The hotel as 1 PC connected to the Internet. We paid 5 euros for 55 minutes.

The hotel is in a great location, the only place we got transport to was the Colleseum and that was only because we were feeling particularly lazy that day, otherwise we walked everywhere else which is one of my big tips because we found many little bars and eateries down the backstreets where the food was better quality than the more commercial areas.

The clerk looks perplexed. I explain I am paying only for incidentals - Phone Calls. Finally, he tells my the phone calls are 12 euros - I tell him yes, this is correct 12 Euros. So I hand him my CC. He proceeds to Charge 600 Euros on my check card!!!!. I look at the reciept and say \"No this is not correct.\" \"Canel This Charge or Credit back this charge\". He says \"This is impossible. I can not do this. Once it goes, it is done, you must contact bank\". So I dispute this and argue with him for 10 minutes until my employer comes down.

We were slightly concerned about the reviews, especially some negative ones regarding our booking method, so I emailed the hotel in advance to confirm our booking. I got a prompt and polite reply. We availed ourselves of the free airport pickup from Furmicino Airport - this consisted of a mini bus. The driver was waiting as we walked through arrivals and we got to the hotel in 40minutes, far easier than public transport. We checked in on arrival (11.30ish) and our room was already available which was nice as it allowed us to leave our baggage and freshen up before going sight-seeing. The room was their \"junior suite\" made up with four beds (not necessary as there were only two of us, but the room was large and would have seemed even more so if they had been removed). The room was oak-panelled and so very dark - some additional lighting would have been nice. There were two heaters which were necessary as the room got little sun light. The room was not street facing, but the traffic (as seems to be the case everywhere in Rome and to no fault of the hotel) was still fairly loud. We had the jacuzzi bath, which worked, and was lovely after a day pounding the streets of Rome. The breakfast was fine, the hot drinks could have been hotter but the selection of food was fine. We booked the airport transfer back to Fumicino which cost 45euros for the two of us. We were picked up at the arranged time and got to the airport in plenty of time. Although it may have been cheaper to book a taxi, since we got a free pick up we thought it was reasonable. Our only warning would be location. The hotel was within minutes walk of the Vatican however it was at least fifteen minutes walk (at a good pace) to the Piazza Navona. Its position is self-evident from the map so we knew there would be some walking involved, however I think that on any return trip to Rome we would consider staying the other side of the river. We would also agree that it was probably not a 4* hotel, maybe a 3* however this may be a difference in standards over the continent.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time\u201d", "Author": "newageuk", "ReviewID": "UR10769208", "Content": "We Stayed at the Atlante Garden hotel which is just round the corner from the Vatican.

When I did my search, only a few choices were left. Desperate, I chose the least expensive among the available hotels nearest to our desired location. This was Atlanate Garden Hotel and I immediately booked it without looking into the reviews of this hotel. After I had already booked the hotel, I started reading some reviews of the hotel and started getting worried. Apparently, there are some very good reviews and not so good ones too. When we got to Rome, I started getting anxious and was anticipating the unwanted glitches from the hotel. But the glitches never came. The driver of our free aiport pick-up service was already waiting for us when we reached the designated meeting point at the airport. We arrived at about 10:30 am at the hotel. Although the booking stated that check-in time was 2 pm, I asked anyway if we could check-in early. The reception staff immediately tried to find available rooms for us without hesitation. Fortunately, they found rooms for us and we can immediately check-in. There rooms were good with spacious bathrooms. On our first night we wanted to have dinner at the roof restaurant of their sister hotel, unfortunately it was already fully booked. But they were very helpful in recommending other nearby places to eat. The next night we had a chance to eat with a great nightime view of the basilica at their roof restaurant. Booking a transport service back to the airport with them was also hassle-free. Our service arrived on the dot so we had sufficient time at the airport. At the airport, we realized that I had left the charger of our video camera in our hotel room. When we got back home, I immediately sent them an e-mail regarding the charger situation and within minutes they responsed that they had indeed found a charger in our room and that they will be glad to send it back to me by post.

Upon arrival at the hotel we were informed there were no rooms available in the hotel and we were taken off to an apartment block close to the sister hotel around the corner. While the room was quite large it had a tiny bathroom and a funny smell which led me to believe it was not that clean. After returning to the hotel to complain I was told (quite rudely) that we had no other choice and would have to put up with it for one night before we could be moved to the hotel. The concierge very quickly asked what we wanted in return for staying in the sub-standard room for a night, which led me to believe that overbooking is a matter of practice for this hotel. Anyway, we did get a free taxi to the train station. The next night we moved to the hotel and the contrast couldn't have been greater. Our room was on the top floor and was clean and comfortable. The advertised jacuzzi didn't work but the lovely open terrace with table and chairs made up for it. If we had've moved straight into this room on our arrival we would have been extremely happy. The location is very close to the Vatican but the nightlife is lacking. There are a few restaurants in the alleys nearby though. Overall, despite the fact we ended up with a nice room, I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone in case they get shunted to some dodgy accommodation outside of the hotel.

We booked this hotel because it advertised a family suite with 4 beds in one room as my husband and I were traveling with our two sons, 17 and 19 years and thought this would be a good choice for our brief stay. Our overall stay was very pleasant especially after reading some negative reviews prior to our stay. Our only negatives were that upon arrival we were informed that a suite was not available (even though we have confirmed the reservation 2 months prior to our stay). I was highly annoyed at this and was then offered an apartment a couple of blocks away to look at instead. I had read similar occurences with other travelers as well. We were otherwise offered two double rooms for the same price on the same floor. We settled for this option which turned out fine. The only other negative comment that I have is that the websites for this hotel state that the hotel has room service which it does not, the outside photo is actually of its sister hotel, The Atlante Star (which also has the rooftop garden restaurant) and the jacuzzi tubs don't work. The website is therefore, misleading and doesnt' need to be because it is otherwise a lovely place to stay. The positives of this hotel were the airport shuttle which was at the airport when we arrived (I had e-mailed them ahead of time informing them of our flight information). The breakfast was very good and plentiful -- with an assortment of cold meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, cakes, beverages with a very attentive staff. The bathroom was large and roomy. Our room overlooked the street which brought some traffic noise but not too bad with the window closed and heavy drapes. The room was small but adequate/comfortable and the entire hotel had an old European charm to it. The elevator only holds about two persons but this I expect is also somewhat commen in Europe. We did not use the bar downstairs but it also had an old European charm to it. Aside from our initial annoyance that what we had reserved wasn't available, we had a nice stay and the staff were very polite, helpful and professional.

The Atlante Garden Hotel is on a long street only minutes walk from the Vatican where there are a few restaurants but mainly sandwich bars. Across the road is another smaller hotel and a tobacconist, further towards the city centre are a couple of bars but neither looked too welcoming. We arrived late on Tues 11 and while we walked our suitcases down the steps into the muralled entrance hall the bellboy immediately took them from us and after we checked in took them upto our room. It was a very spacious twin room and although we only stayed for 3 nights it was comfortable though more like a 3 star hotel. If you are looking for luxury then you should probably upgrade but brilliant for budget site-seers like us. The restaurant around the corner was a typical Italian, you walked down into it and although friendly the food left a lot to be desired. The best pizzeria is Pizzeria Baffeto, we found the address online and handed it over to the taxi driver and it had to be the thinest but most delicious pizza i have ever had. And bonus it was only 7 euros!! Word of warning about taxis; dont ask for the front desk to order one you can easily flag one down on the street if they are white with lights on but if you have reception order you one then it will cost more. We took taxis into the centre when we had been walking all day and it was very cheap, about 8 euros, 4 split between two of us. To get a bus you buy a ticket from a newstand or tobacconist and there are huge signs at bus stops detailing where they drop off. I recommend buying a guide book so you have a map at all times as well as cultural info etc. The room did get noise from the street and we couldnt open the shutters on the outside of the windows so couldnt see out but they were helping with sound, cnn was the only english speaking channel and we were unsure about the shower/bath situation so only used the shower head for a quick wash but it was so cheap that none of this mattered it was adequate. The free breakfast was brilliant, there were 3 types of cereal, every type of jam you have ever seen, rolls, pastries, orange squash, tea, coffee, water, eggs, breakfast meats...If you are going for longer then i would take a towel as they supply hard sort of tea towel fabrics but theyre fine for wiping hands but also the hair dryers are hard to use so bring one if needed. I desperately want to go to Rome again and for \u00a3150 this hotel was brilliant but to do again id pick a place more central as in the evenings there was nothing to do and we had to travel in for food that wasnt a sandwich. You cannot see everything in 3 days we saw the Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Roman Forum, St Peters Bascillica, Vatican Museums, Spanish Steps but there was sooo much more lol. Buses are cheap and easy though we got one from Via Nazionale (Shopping Street) at home time for workers about 5/6pm and although everywhere it says the bus should have gone to our street it went everywhere but including the bus shelter. It was packed more than a London tube station and although people were getting trapped in doors trying to hold on they have to stop at every bus stop where it was like the Titanic, people were pushing up against the sides and it was scary, we eventually (after 2 hours) got back off at Via Nazionale and got a taxi for only 7 euros back to the hotel which i would definitely take over a bus at night. Early February was an excellent time to visit as crowds at sites like the Colosseum were still there but we could make it to the front of a queue in 15-20 mins that would take hours in the Summer. Piazza Navona is full of excellent restaurants with menus that wont break the bank. While we were there on the same street as the hotel two movies were being filmed and we were stopped by a TV camera crew. Rome reminds me a lot of New York but around each corner is another wonderful building, monument or in some cases just a beautiful restaurant, the quintessential European place where you can sit, chat, people watch and experience some of the best cuisine in the world.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cFreindly and helpfull and very clean\u201d", "Author": "fivestar2007", "ReviewID": "UR7839149", "Content": "We have just come home from a lovely holiday in Rome. We booked it through lastminute.com. Having read a couple of reviews on this site and others I was a little concerned, but once you have booked there is not a lot you can do. When we arrived we were met by a very charming bellboy who took our cases with no fuss or bother, we descended to the basement reception desk and booked in. The staff were freindly helpful and welcoming from the moment we arrived. The hotel is very dark but very very clean, the furnishings were pretty and in keeping with the 'Rome' experience, and the room was lovely, so, so clean. Ok the jacuzzi bath didn't work very well, but hey, we were in Rome for God's sake who wants to spend hours in the bath when there is so much to see and do! We were at the front of the hotel and the traffic noise was loud, but the hotel is on the equivelant to Oxford Street in London, so again who cares. The room was cleaned every day and breakfast was fresh and unrushed (they even sorted a 'packed ' breakfast for one day when we left early for a trip) and also had no objection to us taking some apples for the daytime. There are also free street maps in the reception area which clearly mark out the attractions. If your fit its nearly all within walking distance, If you want to take the bus, the hotel reception staff allways seem to know which number bus and how much it would cost. The Vatican and St Peters square is a 2 minute walk away, and there is nothing more lovely than sitting in the square as the sun goes down after all the busses have left. It's quiet and perfect. I would definitely go again and use the same hotel, and yes there is no roof garden (it is at the sister hotel) but again it's a 30 second walk, and you get a reasonable discount if you book through the atlante garden. Just accross the road in the square there is a little caffe, called Pizza Paradise, its very small with yellow tablecloths and the Italian flag painted either side of the door. The staff speak litlle English, but smile a lot, the coffee in georgous and only 1 Euro for an Espresso, the pizza is fresh and weighed out for you so you only pay for what you want. It's served up on a wooden board, and they do fresh local beer chilled and cheap! Watch out for the larger restaurants down the alleyways,one in the Bogo Pio, called Trattoria Capalone (number 92) charged us 15% service, charged for bread and would not take no for an answer. We ended up with cold uncooked meatballs and awful pasta, the bill came on a scrap piece of paper and included the service charge it came to 54 Euros, we had no change so gave them 60, and waited for the change.... and waited, eventually my husband asked the waiter for the change, he refused then prentended not to understand us and then he turned his back on us. Never mind, it only happens once and you learn from it. I will never go there again, but the tradgedy is that we would not go to the street again, so the other restaurants missed out. Overall Rome is fantastic, it's clean and freindly, I felt safe even when we got lost at night. All the public toilets are clean (even the one in front of the Colosseum). If the is one tip i would give anyone it would be ...USE THE PUBLIC WATER FOUNTANS, they are fresh drinking water, we spent so much on buying bottled water when there was no need.

We actually booked the Atlante Star but, on arriving, found that we had been switched to the Garden. Not a problem BUT the room we had transferred to was tiny, and there was no jacuzzi, as promised. A polite word was had with reception who were fine about giving us a better room - with jacuzzi. The room was bigger but not huge - having stayed in Rome before, our conclusion is that there aren't many big hotel rooms in Rome. In fact, the staff were helpful and friendly throughout our stay. Probably the best thing about the hotel is the view from the breakfast room/restaurant on the top floor of the dome of St Peter's, which is very close by. Breakfasts average - the restaurant looked interesting but very pricey when there are a number of very decent trattoria nearby.

Nothing like a good Jacuzzi after a whole day spent tramping the streets of Rome, I promise you!

The hotel is twinned with another Atlanta, the Star, just down the road and if you want to spoil yourself and have a bit of cash to spare, the rooftop restaurant there with a moonlit view of the duomo of St Peter is really something else, and the food was quite beautiful. Drawbacks: the hotel has no restaurant itself and therefore apart from the breakfast (which was substantial and fine for our needs), you will have to and find one of the many local restaurants to dine in - not that this is exactly a drawback! There could also be a bit more information provided about local places to go, nightspots, services provided by the hotel, but this seems a bit carping given the overall level of performance. The car service they provide to and from Fiumicino/Ciampino is quite a bit more expensive (50-60 Euros) than, say, the bus, but Ciampino in particular is such a hole why make your journey any worse...?

The hotel seemed to be a great place for couples, not convinced it's hugely set up for families. Can't imagine what the other reviewers were complaining about: yes, there were slightly odd napkins in the bathroom, but there were also plenty of fluffy towels; the rooms are indeed dark if you keep the curtains and nets and shutters closed, but really aren't if you don't; Rome is just noisy, get used to it; and why on earth would having UK television be of any importance when Rome is on your doorstep? The rooms were clean, well-presented, and the staff polite and helpful. The hotel is hugely conveniently situated, and you can easily reach most places on foot. One useful tip is to buy a full-day bus pass (about four euros) and use it to get around. The 492 bus passes right by the hotel, and crosses the city, stopping in a variety of useful places for sightseeing. Do take advantage of the free pickup service as you arrive, as a taxi from the airport is about 50 euros.

Housekeeping - the first night all went well. The second night one towel was not swapped for a clean one. As well toiletries were not replenished and instead of changing the dwindling toilet paper, two refill rolls were left by the bidet. The third night we came home to find the bed completely unmade and every dirty towel we had left for pick up still on the bathroom floor. The front desk didn't seem to care all that much, did arrive half an hour later with a few towels and seemed a little annoyed we wanted them to take the dirty ones away. 2. Internet - This was not wifi since they supply a network cable. When I decided I needed it (for business) they announced the line was down. Instead I could use the computer in the small lounge which cost about double and meant I had to use an Italian keyboard which wasted a ton of my precious and expensive time. . 3.

The Hotel photographs shown on the internet are in most parts taken at the sister hotel which is definitely not situated next door and much nicer! The roof garden was also closed for renovation and had been for the past six months. I questioned the staff on reception on why this was not on their website as this was very misleading, they shrugged and said the reservations office was responsible for the advertising and they were not based in the hotel so not their problem. No apologies! I also agree with previous coment on the general unfriendlyness of the staff, reception staff at times were very rude and unhelpful the only smile was from the chamber maid! The hotel is still being renovated with mis-matched worn carpets on the stair wells, bags contiaining bedding to be washed stored on the stairs and repairs including scraping off of old plaster and paint repair in progress. The bar is tiny and placed in the overflow breakfast room in the corner. The hotel is situated on a busy street so a quiet room is essential to getting any sleep. Our second room (we were moved once because of the noise) was small but reasonably furnished but some updating needed. The bath had broken controls and the TV only had access to a few channels mostly european. The room was cleaned daily and clean towels provided Breakfast was generally good although the staff became a little flustered if everyone came to breakfast at the same time and had to be reminded to refill hot water, fruit and rolls etc There were quite a number of guests moaning about the service and how they felt mislead by the hotels advertising when they booked. The hotel entrance outside is dimly lit and there are a number of steps down to reception when you enter which are fairly steep especially handling luggage or if you have walking difficulties. One plus is the location just a few minutes wailk from the Vatican and reasonably easy to access to the other sights by foot. We have stayed in a lot of four star hotels in the past and the Atlante Garden did not match this grade.

BREAKFAST breakfast was fair, consisting of baked goods, plates of cold cuts, fruit, yogurt, and assorted condiments. the coffee was pretty bad, but it's preferable to go out to bars for cappucino & such anyway. SHUTTLE the shuttle from the airport to the hotel picked us up right on time. however, we weren't able to get a shuttle back to the airport when we were leaving because \"all the shuttles were full.\" we ended up taking a taxi that cost 55 EUR.

LOCATION for a first time visitor to rome, this is not the ideal location unless you want to spend a lot of time at the vatican. the next time i go i will definitely stay in the city center. the location was far from most of what we wanted to see, a 20-40 minute walk to main sights like the pantheon, trevi fountain, roman forum, colosseum. we stayed outside walking all day, which was quite tiring. it would have been nice to be able to take a break at the hotel in the middle of the day or before dinner, since restaurants do not open for dinner until 7 - 7:30.", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cRome in November\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4153791", "Content": "We have just returned from a 4 day stay at the Atlante Garden Hotel in Rome.

We stayed at the Atlante Garden Hotel from March 12th through March 19th, 2005, and it was JUST FINE! In fact, it was really very nice. Our room (room 238) was beautiful, very clean, with new striped beige and burgundy fabric on the walls. The bathroom was large and white marble.

There was hot water every time we wanted it, the cleaning service did a great job, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful stay and I would like to tell everyone that it is a great hotel. Here are the drawbacks, which, as any travelers knows, are pretty minor: 1. It took an hour to wait for the free shuttle pickup at the airport - hey, it's free, we didn't mind. 2. The hotel said a taxi to the airport would cost about 44 euros - it actually cost us 55 euros, but that's our fault for not asking the taxi driver before we got in the cab. 3. No room service, but there is a mini bar/refrigerator in the room. See, like I said, pretty minor. I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone.

It claims to be a four star. Initially having booked a double room I was shown to a dark \"cell sized\" single room. The staff changed me to a double room., clearly the insomniac suite. Situated facing the main road from Rome to the Vatican, the room window had single glazing and the shutters would not close, hence it was like trying to sleep in the middle of a motorway. I was again moved...others in my party were not so lucky and had four sleepless nights. The decor is dark and uninviting and the paintwork chipped and breakfast plain. This hotel is not worth the money. It is good to be home!!!", "Date": "March 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c4*, think not\u201d", "Author": "indiecritic", "ReviewID": "UR3272266", "Content": "I recently visited this hotel on 9th March and can only up-hold what has been said previously. The hotel decor was not to my taste and quite frankly wouldn't be too many.... the decor made the hotel dark and seem confined. If early mornings are your thing then this hotel's for you, either the hotel has an infestation of woodpecker's or the maids knock on doors at 6.50am. if they fail to make the grade, then the decorators ensured the drill was up and raring to go. I looked on the bright side and used the opportunity to beat the crowds to the major attractions. I didn't take advantage of the free transfer because i wasn't aware this this was available. So i transfered from the airport to the termini and caught a taxi from there, 40 euro's later, thought, 'there must be a better way'. There is, be brave, get on the metro, its 1 euro per ticket. Hotel staff were helpful and the maids efficiently sorted my messy room daily. There's no tea and coffee in the room, no iron either, but the hotel offers a next day laundry service at 3 euro's per garment. Location is every thing for this hotel, St Peters square is close by and for those energetic enough the furthest attraction the colleseum can be walked. 4* this hotel isn't, but its adequate....", "Date": "March 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redmond, WA", "Title": "\u201cgreat walking location for Vatican\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3231796", "Content": "We had a very favorable four-night stay here in February, 2005. What we liked best: very good location for ten minute walk to the Vatican, the Tiber River and the Castel San Angel; room was clean, well-stocked and comfortable (keep in mind a double bed is two singles put together); VERY generous breakfast buffet (cereal, many rolls, cold cuts/cheese, fruit, yogurts, etc....easily a $20 value given the costs in Europe these days) with a friendly staff. Desk staff was helpful (made a couple phone calls for me); free shuttle pick up at airport (took a little while to arrive but was friendly,safe and efficient...keep in mind the shuttle only works for arrival...but the desk can arrange a trip to airport for departures...it cost us 36 euros..which I guess is less than a taxi); just a 1/2 block walk to an ATM machine. What we didn't like quite as much (sort of noisy from outside but you ARE in a city), the room was a bit dark for our tastes and we missed any English tv channels (tv was in Italian and French). Overall: my wife and I decided the hotel was a very good choice for our needs and would stay there again and recommend to friends.", "Date": "February 26, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Atlante Garden Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d203072-Reviews-Atlante_Garden_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$125 - $302*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Crescenzio 78</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00193</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "203072", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cd/59/2c/external-view.jpg"}}
