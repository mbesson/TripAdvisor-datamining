The good news; location. Right off the strip but far enough away so there is not any traffic noise. The rooms are a nice size-we had space with a rollaway. But, the sleep number beds must be a cheap model because they feel more like waterbeds when you get up and down. The rooms were well kept but some rust and things were noticed in the bathroom. The hotel has a nice business center where you can print free-internet is also free so that is a plus. The pool is inside/outside. It was so dirty feeling my kids did not want to swim there. Plus, the hotel is supposed to be smoke free but they allow smoking by the pool-go figure. They assured me it was a clean pool with the levels being good but it just did not feel that way. The hot tub was lukewarm and small. The front staff is fine but they also serve as concierge so if you get stuck behind someone that wants a dinner idea you have to wait to check in or out. Also, they did not have much knowledge of Branson events. We wanted to see this certain magician (not Kirby) and they never heard of it but we found the show on our own and it was delightful. The breakfast is great. We paid a little extra (4.50) and got a hot breakfast which was plentiful. Free parking is very good also. We paid 89.00 per night so that was reasonable.

The front desk and concierge staff were prompt, courteous and friendly. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy, and the rates seemed reasonable ($139 per night and a $30 non-refundable pet fee per visit). The hotel is located just off the 76 strip, but also has a convenient back road exit to avoid the heavy traffic. We stayed in Room 246, which was a pet-friendly \u2013 BONUS!! The room was clean and d\u00e9cor had recently been updated. The bathroom was a little small, but sufficient. The room itself was spacious even with two double beds and a pack \u2018n play, which the hotel provided for our little one free of charge. Both double beds were sleep number beds, which we had been looking forward to trying, but we found them to be overrated. They are pretty much a glorified air mattress, whenever one of us rolled over, it was noisy and shook the whole bed. One mattress lost firmness throughout the night and was really noisy whenever we adjusted the number back up. That was really the only down side of our stay because we were not well rested at all. The pool area, although a little compact, was clean and refreshing. Fresh towels and seating were always available regardless of what time of the day we went for a swim. Our stay included a daily breakfast in the Wildwood Bistro Restaurant within the hotel. The food was warm and tasty and there was a large variety available: scrambled eggs, diced potatoes, biscuits and gravy, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, grits, French toast, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, pastries, bagels, coffee, and juice. Greg, the restaurant manager, was fabulous! We looked forward to chatting with him every morning. He was attentive and really worked hard to keep the place clean and keep the guests happy. The only other item that travelers should be aware of is the steepness of the parking lot and the pet area, which may be problematic for those that have mobility issues.

Boy, were we wrong. Upon arriving, we discovered that the parking was inadequate in the front, near the obvious entrance. We of course, parked in the rear lot, where it was like a centipede layout on an incline. After we had our kids and some of our luggage unloaded, we were juggling everything, scanning for a nearby entrance. None were obvious, other than an awning that points you into the restaurant. We weren't sure if this went directly into the restaurant, and didn't want to shuffle through everyone eating to get to our room. So we went uphill, and all the way around to the front entrance, all the while struggling to get the children and our belongings to the room. We entered the hotel, where we soon discovered that the ceilings were extremely short, the hallways suffocatingly hot, and the elevators mercilessly slow. I stayed in the room with our 3 children, and being pregnant, it was difficult to walk that far with that much to the 7th floor multiple times. My husband made several more trips, since we also had to get our coolers...the rooms had no microwaves and no refrigerators. He did start using the rear entrance, as it led patrons past the restaurant and not through it, although after hiking up several wide, steep stairs, you must walk through smoke clouds as this is where all of the smoking guests hang out. After many trips, a custodian/maintenance man for the hotel asked my husband if he was aware of a bell-hop service, which apparently would've been free. During our entire stay, the desk never mentioned such a service, nor were there ever any employees near the entrances to offer such. The bathroom was claustrophobically small, the sink had mold in the overflow drain, there was hair in the bathtub. The washcloths had stains on them! The sleep number beds were a joke, totally uncomfortable, when anyone barely moves on it the other person is bouncing all over the place. The curtains didn't close, only the sheer curtains covering the window for light blockage/privacy. The carpet near the bed had suspicious and disgusting dried liquid on it?! The swimming pool is ridiculously small, and filthy. Weird grime and hair, et cetera floating around in it. We didn't even bother with the restaurant, outside of ordering a pizza the first of the two nights we stayed. We discovered after we had already tipped the delivery person (an employee from the hotel restaurant) that they were happy to take our cash tip on top of 18% gratuity they had already added to the bill. We received a promotional code to be able to stay an extra night for free. The morning of the presentation we were required to attend, we finally discovered why we were all getting sick...MOLD, MOLD, and more MOLD....caked inside of the air conditioning unit.

I didn't rate the breakfast because I didn't see it or partake. My favorite part of the day/evening when vacationing is relaxing my tired muscles in the hot tub - something I always look for when booking a room. The first night the pool and hot tub were so crowded I turned around and went back to my room. Not the hotel's fault of course, that it was so popular. However, the next morning I went down to use the hot tub and it was closed and it didn't open again until the next day when we were checking out. I did think the shower was great, and there were plenty of pillows and towels. The housekeeper was at our door early the second morning, and on the day of check out was there again, so we felt rushed. I should have just used the \"do not disturb\" sign. One very interesting thing I found on my pointless trips to the hot tub/pool is that they have hundreds of pictures of veterans, veteran stories, and other US Military pictures and information on the walls of the hallways on the lower level.

I thought this was odd since I had read a previous review on tripadvisor stating that maid service hadn't shut the door completely. The first time it happened, we hadn't had maid service. My son got to the door before I had and was in the room. I immediatly shut the door from the outside and was able to open it again without a key. We notified front desk and they immediatly sent maintence to check the lock out. The next day, the same thing happened after we got back from breakfast. Again, we hadn't had maid service yet. We didn't say anything to front desk this time (not sure why). When the maid was close to our room, we were leaving and I let her know the door had a glitch in it and to please make sure she pulls hard on door when shutting it. Again, we come back from being away several hours and my son gets to door before we do and opens it without a key. I shut it from outside again and immediatly am able to open the door again. Maybe it is that room specifically.... ROOM 102. I went to front desk and notified them again of the issues. I told them I would like a different room. They also refunded us for one of the nights we paid for and gave us breakfast vouchers for the buffet. I appreciated the effort put forth to make up for the inconvenience. So, dinner in the restaurant..... Are there no adults working there? It is staffed by what seems to be teenagers. Not a big deal if they had been properly trained how to be a server. The first night we ate there, the food was good. Service was ok. It was our servers first night. So we let the poor service slide.... even though we were the only table in the restaurant. The second night we ate there, the food and service was horrible. I think it took about 15 minutes for the server to take our order. Again it wasn't busy. When our food was brought to us, the pizza was luke warm. The marinara that I asked for with my breadsticks was cold. When the server asked how we liked our food, I was honest and told her. She came back a few minutes later to tell me that the cook said the oven is broken and cook has to cook the pizza at a lower tempature. Seriously? Why even allow a server to put an order in for pizza if the oven is broken? Since when is it ok to serve customers luke warm pizza? I've had hotter pizza delivered to my door from Pizza Hut. The server dropped off our ticket and didn't offer desert or a to go box. I am not the most critical person ever. I promise. I am actually really easy to please. I don't expect to be catered upon, but I do appreciate good service. Another side note: Beds are full, not queen.

The problem was, 3+ weeks earlier when I booked the room there were king bed rooms available and I booked one. The desk staff was rude about the matter and did nothing to \"make it right\". It wasn't until days after our stay that I was able to discuss the matter with their management. After several emails were exchanged, they reversed charges for our stay. What prompts me to write this review is a desire to caution would-be guests to \"get your reservation room details in writing\"! One thing I was asked by the hotel's managment was \"do you have the size of the bed in your room, in writing?\" After reviewing all of the confirmation documents I had received, I noticed that they do not specify the size of the bed in the room. I guess that was by design and affords them the flexibility to swap guest rooms as needed. You see, when we arrived the place was packed. I asked the nice fellow who helped us with our bags what was going on and he said a big reunion had just arrived and had everyone hopping.

I have to say I would have never chosen this hotel but it was an unpublished rate on Expedia. Quick side note on that, it saved us a whopping $5 a night versus the published rate and we had two separate beds in our room, pick your own hotel. Pulling up to the hotel was impressive. It is huge. The outside looked fine and the location of it was great. The first thing we noticed though was the extreme incline of the parking lot. It's the type of parking that requires an emergency brake at all times. The lobby was well maintained and check in was hassle free. The elevator floor had cracked tile and was see through facing outside. While it was impressive at first even the outside view was a let down because every window on the way up seemed to get more dirty. One window you almost couldn't see out of. When we arrived on our floor we immediately noticed that they run no air conditioning in the halls. It was uncomfortably hot. It was 90+ degrees outside our whole stay so this never got better. Upon entering our room one of the two beds we had was half broken down and never finished. We put away our things and let the hotel know, they handled this problem while we were out and they were extremely nice about it. I am the type of person who wants to enjoy their room, not just sleep in it. Therefore it seems like I notice a lot of small details. The hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade. The floors in the bathroom are black and white checkered tile. The bottom of the tub was stained with dirt that wouldn't come up. The door to our bathroom was coming apart at the bottom. The one bed that was put together when we arrived had the bed sheet on inside out. The temperature in the room is controlled by a thermostat but doesn't have an only air or only heat option so when the room would get too cold we would adjust it up and the heat would kick on. That meant we had to constantly play with the thermostat to make sure we kept the perfect temperature. The final problem I had wasn't as big for me as it is for most people, maybe because I have worked in restaurants all my life. I found two bugs in my bed the morning we were leaving. I was breaking the beds down for the housekeepers and found one bug which I couldn't tell exactly what it was and another very small spider. I must say I never said anything to management because I'm not the type of person who wants things for free. I dealt with it and went on. A quick list of the positives of this hotel: It has an on site bar and the service was amazing. Their staff couldn't have been better. Our bellman on the way out was very helpful and every time I called the front desk I always got the help I needed. In closing, if you are the type of person who just needs somewhere to sleep while you are in Branson this hotel is not the worst choice. There are much more affordable ones though that probably fit your needs. If you are the type of person who enjoys coming back to a relaxing room that is designed well and updated, maybe even clean and bug free, you should not even think about booking this.

Parking is on a hillside and you may have to park uphill with a steep walk down to or back uphill from the main entrance but there are parking options on other sides of the hotel that offer a less hilly spot, maybe farther from main entrance but lighting is adequate.

The hot tub also small, too many people using it - water didn't look clean.

I found this hotel very uncomfortable. Here are my main areas of complaint: BEDS: I do not know if it was the \"Sleep Number\" bed they're promoting, but the beds are my very first complaint. They felt like someone jammed a bunch of giant marshmallows under a thin mattress pad, covered it with an old, scratchy fitted sheet. ROOMS: Extremely outdated. We felt very depressed in these rooms with older tvs (we don't even watch tvs; these were just a huge eyesore), low ceilings, poor ventilation and lighting, and outdated, plasticky and/or faux-brass fixtures. BATHROOM: Creepy. Basic plastic and tile. Poor lighting. Stains. A thin and flimsy PLASTIC shower curtain on PLASTIC hooks. The kind of thing you'd find in a roadside, bargain motel. Not a place that went for a discounted $109 on Priceline! LOBBY: Check-in unfriendly and inefficient. PARKING LOT: We are a young, fit couple, and the parking lot was even a pain for us. Just a warning, since I imagine many older folks, people with disabilities, or people who just want to relax on vacation will not like this. The hotel wasn't even *that* full but we had to park quite far and walk up an incline with suitcases and an infant. SUMMARY: I was extremely disappointed in my room considering the money paid. It's one of those places that just doesn't FEEL clean, even if it is. You get the impression it had a quick wipe with a wet paper towel and that's it. I went back to Branson a month later and stayed at the Marriott Residence Inn in a much nicer, newly remodeled, clean room for less money. (See separate review.) In summary, DO NOT think because it costs $X amount it's nicer than a Holiday Inn Express or even the Howard Johnson's. I have not been inside these hotels, but I am guessing it is not. In some cities, you get an idea of how nice or modern a property is by its rack rate.

That's a whole other review of it's own. So we didn't have a choice as to where we would stay when we booked. As it turned out, it was a good stay. We checked in on Thanksgiving Day about 10:30am. Thankfully our room was ready. Had a good view of the Branson strip and a non smoking room with King bed just as requested. It is basically your typical hotel room although it did have a sleep number bed which was awesome! Pretty good size room with a desk, a chair and ottoman, iron & ironing board, cable TV, etc. No fridge or microwave but did have a small coffee pot I think. Clean. Since it was Thanksgiving, we ate at the buffet they offered for $19pp. It was pretty good and we definitely got stuffed. They also have a pizzeria there but we never did see it open so not sure what hours it's open. They had an outdoor heated pool and believe or not, there were kids swimming both days we were there and it was COLD! But they were having a ball! The location is convenient on the strip. But be sure to take the back roads to get around (yellow to the hotel from the highway), traffic is horrible! Of course the shopping day after Thanksgiving didn't help matters. But it is not very far at all from the Tanger factory outlet mall. That was crazy! And the other outlet mall wasn't far either. We toured the Christmas light display, not sure which one it was (it must NOT have been the one that is rated among the top 10 in the US) but they charged $10 for a car load and that wasn't really worth $10. We went to the movie theater, not the IMAX one but the other one...Branson something. We went Thanksgiving night and it was BUSY! Saw 4 Christmas's and that was funny! I can't say much about the food in Branson. Seems all they offer is buffet's and I was tired of those. We ate breakfast at the peppercorn on the way out, and that wasn't anything to write home about. The breakfast buffet was only $4.99 but the coffee is $1.99 each, so it was still $15 plus tax for the two of us. The best meal we ate was the one at the Radisson. Overall it was a good stay.

I loved the mirror on the bathroom door--I could see the back of my hair without holding a mirror. There was no hairs on the floor or in the tub! I also love the bright lights in the bathroom-great for putting makeup on. Clean tub and fantastic water pressure with a good shower head. The sleep number bed was fun to play with. I did fine with it but my husband was on too high a setting the first night and slept better the second night after lowering his number. It gave us an opportunity to try one. We stayed on the 5th floor (548) which I believe had been remodeled. It was very crisp and clean. I love the light fixtures! Yes the parking is hilly but can't be the hotels fault--that's geography. We parked in the back several times and got the first places outside the door. There is a hill back there too. My main complaint about the entire place is that outside the lower level back door is a passage way where everyone congregates to smoke. There is little ventilation and it was terribly smokey. I am a part time smoker and it was awful to me. I had to hold my breath to walk through and felt like I could smell the smoke on me after walking through. They should really not let people smoke so close to the door. I'm sure non-smokers will really hate it! Every staff member we encountered was very friendly.
