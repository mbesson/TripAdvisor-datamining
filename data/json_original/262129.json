What a find! I discovered it on a website called roomforromance.com and I was thrilled to find so many great reviews on Trip Advisor before I went ahead and booked. It was a lovely hotel and I'm so glad we were able to stay there. I was recommended to stay in a 4 star hotel, as the advice was that a 4 star in Venice is like a 2 star in the UK, but despite this only having a rating of a 3 star hotel, I believe it was even better than most of the 4 star hotels I had looked at and as we were on a budget was also great value for money. The owners and their staff were very friendly and couldn't do more for you to help you enjoy and make the most of your stay. They gave us great advice using our map on which tourist attractions were a \"must see\" and great recommendations for good restaurants nearby - I thoroughly recommend one called Acquapazza in Campo Sant' Angelo for a last night meal and Enoteca Ai Artisti Restaurant in Dorsoduro region for an intimate romantic meal. Our double room was delightful with a comfortable bed and smart ensuite with good powerful hot shower. The buffet breakfast was delicious with plenty of food to give you the energy for all the walking and sightseeing you'll want to do. I also really liked being able to help oneself to complimentary tea and cake in the afternoon, as it helped revive one after a tiring, but very enjoyable long day. All in all, I would definitely recommend the Novecento to anyone looking for a quiet hotel away from the crowds and one that provides a very personal service.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "Flyvicky", "ReviewID": "UR127035117", "Content": "Highly recommended, position excellent, hospitality superb, hotel and room lovely.

The hotel property is located not on the channel and in the dark narrow passage but in the small quiet street. It has very nice stylish interior - despite the hotel is very small it still has some living space downstares and another very nice salon at the second floor. Room was spacious enough and very clean. Bathroom also quite big and no compromise on quality. Breakfast - Italian standard. The very comfortable location of this hotel we realized next day - we had only 5 min walk to all the major attractions on San Marco and shopping streets either. There is also one of the best restaurants on San Marco called A Beccafico in 1 min proximity, and also a very nice bakery with exceptional macarons right on the way to it.

We came there with water taxi, and found the location close to Accademia absolutely brilliant with easy access to the main parts of the city, to the water bus station at Accademia and to the less touristy area Doursodouro (with many nice restaurants). The service of the staff was also excellent. We arrived at luncthime, rather peckish, and when asked the hotel receptionist recommended a great little restaurant in Doursoduoro serving exquisite pasta dishes (Ai Artista). Furthermore, they offered us a complementary trip to Murano where we were guided to a short trip of a murano glass factory. Although this is very touristic, they were very clear when they told us that we were not obliged to buy anything. The trip out to Murano was also quite an experience, with the taxi driver driving like a true Italian. The rate of the hotel was also not bad (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 incl. breakfast, but in February).

We arrived by water taxi to the Novecento and were welcomed as warmly as the Venetian weather! It is only a few metres to the door of Novecento from the canal. Our rooms on the 2nd floor were lovely with all the comforts required. The decor is eclectic and very interesting and we had a pretty view onto the courtyard garden. There is a common room which each room leads into and it was great to talk and relax in. We were given a map with suggested places to visit and also good recommendations for the best restaurants. Guillaume and Frederico were very friendly and helpful at all times. Novecento's location is excellent as it is just minutes from Piazza San Marco and only a short walk to Accademia bridge and onto the Rialto. We also walked to the Zattere which skirts the canal and where the locals go to have gelato and watch the grand canal traffic. We had the best breakfasts here at Novecento of our whole trip! Nothing was too much trouble and the food was of high quality - great home-made savoury strudel and hot tea and coffee - plus it was served in the picturesque garden setting. We loved everything.

Our bedroom overlooked the pretty court yard garden where breakfast is served in warmer weather. A plentiful supply of fresh breads, cheeses, fruit salad, cereals, yoghurts , eggs and ham were available daily, but for a supplement, bacon and eggs could be provided too. The freshly squeezed orange juice was delicious ! The lady who provided breakfast for us each morning was so kind and welcoming - it was like being a guest in someone's home. I did a considerable amount of research for this trip and was certainly not disappointed in this wonderful find of a hotel. Although only 10 minutes walk to San Marco and the Dosoduro area, the location couldn't be quieter. We passed many hotels every day but they were either overlooking noisy canals or by restaurants and busy thoroughfares. Novecento certainly offered just what we were looking for - small and intimate in a great location with first class service.

Most of the rooms in this small hotel are for couples, not a family of four. We were accommodated most comfortably. We were met every morning by Marisa and had a wonderful European breakfast with excellent cappuccinos and hot chocolates for the kids. Our table for 4 was ready every morning with our drinks prepared upon our arrival. Novecento is ideally located on a very quiet street in San Marco, central to both St. Mark's Square and the Dorsoduro at the Accademie Bridge. We walked everywhere! The hotel is beautifully decorated and has very comfortable sitting rooms for reading and resting. We were able to check email and had every modern amenity we would expect from a large business hotel. The room was very clean and the bathroom, new and modern. The staff was helpful with all our questions, especially with dining recommendations. Without hesitation, we would recommend this hotel to any traveler to Venice.
