The rooms are fine. The \"shower in the middle of the floor\" thing is a bit quirky but gets old after a while. I occupies the room and gives you no room to unpack or lay out your luggage. Up until now I have not needed to do any work in my room so I never used the wi-fi. Well, the wi-fi on the second floor gives you \"five bars\" of signal in the hallway and between zero and one bar at your desk. That's helpful. I complained to the front desk and both the manager and the young woman on duty were helpless. And hopeless. They kept saying they'd reset the wi-fi. As if that is going to do anything. They did, and it didn't. They offered me another room on the 2nd floor which was the same. Then the manager leaves for the day right in the middle of supposedly trying to help me, and the woman at the desk wouldn't call him. Then they found a room on the third floor which for whatever reason has five bars of signal which is great. But to be honest, the last thing I feel like doing is spending fifteen minutes packing my bags, shlepping them up to the next floor, and then getting re-settled in. So I declined. I stay in hotels about 100 nights a year, and to be fair, you get your share of sub-standard experiences. But I am so frustrated by this that it compelled me for the first time ever to write a tripadvisor review. So, my recommendation is that if you want wi-fi or reception staff with a clue, don't stay here. Or else insist on the third floor without paying more for it.

The Thumbs Up: 1-Clean-it smells of green apple as soon as you walk in (can't see how though- we never saw a single candle,diffuser or anything of the sort to create a wonderful scent). 2-Tastefully Different- the decor is modern,clean and somewhat other world-ly.the reception gives a feel it's a spaceship about to take off.We love hanging out in the reception area. 3- Good sized room-We stayed in the 3rd floor and the space was enough for a small family. 4-Friendly Staff 5-Room Amenities-Molton Brown toiletries,an Essenza coffee maker in room and we love how you can control the lighting and the curtains with a flick of a button.Our baby enjoys watching it close and open. 6- Location-close to a lot of restaurants (walk towards Anson Road near the CBD area), a lot of eateries nearby.Orchard Road isn't very far either. Things they need to improve 1-upgrade the menu, as food choices are very limited.they taste good though. 2-the tv stations-hope you will include programs for kids.the channels we get are the basic Singapore ones plus few too grown up cable tv channels. 3-the room we were in had an outdoor veranda-problem was it was rainy half of the time and we don't wanna sit out because the lounges were sopping wet.maybe install a plexiglass roofing and a drainpipe? also the lounges were dusty.maybe changing them into waterproof ones would be less maintenance and would last longer as well.we really wanted to enjoy this veranda but too bad it was wet and half the time dusty.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel, location, and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "KamandHema", "ReviewID": "UR124637763", "Content": "We stayed in Singapore as a stopover for a couple of days.

It could be so much better and a few things let this place down. On the whole it was a disappointing stay. However, I have weighed up the Pro's and Con's of this Hotel. Design wise, it is ultra-modern, and has a very impressive first impression as you walk into the Hotel lobby. Checking in was smooth and a porter took our bags to be delivered to the room. We were checking in early (8am) and were told that early check-in would normally be an extra night charge, however gladly this was offered complimentary to us. We were also given our passwords for the Internet. All good so far then? The rooms, at first impression are impressive. We stayed in the 'Executive' room which was the entry level grade of room. It was clean, modern of course, and yes we were faced with the very 'trendy' Open Shower concept. Odd at first, but actually had no problem with this since we were a couple. After first 'wow' factor and novelty factor wears off though, it becomes clear after 3 nights of stay that a lot of the rooms features are 'style over substance'. The side tables for example are too far away from the bed (which is btw extremely comfortable). It means reaching for your water or drink from the bed is a bit of a stretch! Also, the lighting system is electronic and has various 'settings' such as 'Cosy', 'Night-time', and 'Shower'. All very cool, but awkward and fiddly when you want greater control over the lighting. Same goes for the curtains, electronically controlled which means opening and shutting the blinds or curtains are a bit 'trial and error' as no instructions are given as to what button controls what. As I say, the bed was very comfortable, one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, so plus points there. The Shower as mentioned was in the middle of the room in a glass semi-circle. This was actually quite cool I thought although a bit 'trendy for the sake of it' - It is a Boutique after all though, and 'Trendy for the Sake of it' is kind of a given at Boutique Hotels. The toilet, thankfully, is seperated by a door. However, it is in reality only a hinged sheet of toughened glass and is only partially frosted. This means, without being too vulgar, that you can hear pretty much everything from the bathroom. Despite my partner and I knowing each other very well, there are some spaces that should be somewhat sound-proofed and private - the toilet being one of them. On other plus points of the room, Free WiFi was fairly easy to setup and extremely fast once connected. A lack of a second plug socket on the desk though led to me having to unplug the wireless Phone in order to charge my Laptop/Mobile, again not ideal, and clear evidence that they have thought more about style than function. Service attitude, on the whole, was good. Polite and pleasant service staff who did tend to our needs very efficiently and with a smile. However, some things I felt we didn't need to, and shouldn't have had to ask for - On our final night for example, the night/bath gowns (although only thin silk types) had been removed from the room and not replaced. We did ask for them to bring some up and they did so very quickly but we shouldn't have needed to ask. As mentioned, they were only the thin, silk/synthetic types as opposed to full wool/cotton ones that a lot of hotels provide. These would have been a lot more cosy when relaxing in the room. On the services front, Room Service is only available until 10pm. This is a bizarre policy, as most hotels above 4 stars have 24 hour room service. If you want some food or even just a drink when returning home from Dinner, this is impossible on Sunday's as even the rooftop bar, Fabrika, was closed by 11:30pm on the Monday (it is meant to be open until Midnight but they decided to close early and lock the door!), much to the surprise of the Front Desk and much anger and annoyance from us as we found this to be extremely unheard of! Upon requesting, the service staff did kindly bring up to the room two glasses of wine upon request - at $15 SGD ($10 USD) each though these were not the cheapest of glasses of wine, although probably in line with Singapore prices. The bar was also closed completely the day before as it is always closed on Sunday's. Considering the Sunday was also Race Night of the Singapore F1, I think they missed a trick not opening as there would have been plenty of punters wanting further drinks post-race. Breakfast was ok, european, and again, could have been much better. The Western Hot food was good, and choice of eggs nice. However, the 'Scandinavian' breakfast was a little thin (small selection of fruit and small selection of Cereals does not qualify it to be a 'Scandinavian Breakfast was how my swedish partner described it). The bottom line with this hotel is that is largely style over substance, that with a small few changes, could be both.. So to sum up... PRO'S - Clean and Very Trendy Design - Good Service staff (helpful & Friendly) - iPod Dock in Room (in this day and age, a must for any decent modern hotel!) - Free Mini-Bar (although only 1 bottle of Beer, the rest juices and coke) - Nespresso Coffee Machine. But...the CONS/Improvements Needed .... - Poor Value for Money rooms - Fabrika Bar needs to open on Sunday's and for longer. If your opening hours state Midnight, then do not lock the door to customers at 11:30pm - Room Amenities could be better - namely Bath/Night Gowns, more Toiletry supply and improvements to 'practical' design within the room. - Room Service needs to be available for much much longer and 7 days a week. I shall not be returning to this hotel when I stay in Singapore again as I believe, for the room rate, I could stay at a different Boutique Hotel or even at one of the larger chains on the Marina. After 2 Years in operation, this Hotel should be much better than it is, and if it wants repeat customers, these changes will have to be made.

Generally quite a pleasant and efficient stay.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing stay at Klapsons.\u201d", "Author": "frozen_fire19", "ReviewID": "UR83772790", "Content": "First, just to save your time reading this review, can I just say that if you're thinking of going to a chic 'design' hotel in Singapore you're better off at Quincy Hotel rather than Klapsons? My partner and I booked a weekend staycation at Klapsons, having previously stayed at Quincy and enjoyed it immensely, we thought it would be exciting to try this relatively new and similarly styled hotel. The website looked promising, and the prices were relatively on par with Quincy ($320 for the cheapest room without meals vs $360 at Quincy with breakfast and dinner). However we soon found out that we should have just stuck to Quincy. Service was cold and awkward, making me and my partner feel equally awkward and out of place. I had the impression that the reception staff were not very experienced. There were only 3 floors in Klapsons, with 17 rooms in total, and yet my partner and I were showed to the wrong room. The room itself was clean and tidy. No complaints here. The windows were ceiling high and looked out onto the main road which was always busy because we were in the Central Business District after all. Almost everything was in working order - except that the hair dryer was broken, there was only 1 toothbrush for 2 people, no comb, no showercap, no shaver and no hot water kettle. For the intrepid ones who are still going to brave out their stay at Klapsons - beware the shower! It takes a long time to get heated up, which means you'll be freezing in the shower cubicle waiting for warm water. The shower for the smaller rooms is also, not very helpfully, stationed in the middle of the bedroom making it quite uncomfortable on cold nights. And once the water is heated its really really hot, plus its really hard to adjust the water temp, so.. well, its really the option of getting scalded or being frozen. The espresso machine was cute though. However 6 cartridges of espresso + 6 tea bags should = at least 12 sugar packets right? 4 is simply, simply not enough! We did get full complimentary usage of the bar fridge which had some soft drinks, mineral water and beer inside. Location wise, really, there's not much nearby except office buildings.. Its not even close to any MRT station - unless you are game for a brisk 20 minute walk. We did drive though, which was a plus because we could go to Chinatown which is a 10 minute drive away, or the railway station which is also a 10 minute drive. The hotel provides free overnight parking for in-house guests. We did not patronise Lucas, the in-house restaurant. Design-wise, well, I was actually looking forward to being impressed by Klapsons - it being crafted by Sawaya & Moroni and all. However it gives me great sorrow to say that I didn't find myself impressed at all. Nothing met my expectations. Perhaps I should have invested in one of the suites? Needless to say, my partner and I will not be returning to Klapsons. We shall continue to patronise our now-favourite Quincy Hotel instead.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ci'd skip it if i were you\u201d", "Author": "kylelsim", "ReviewID": "UR80746131", "Content": "when you reach the hotel, all u see is that giant silver ball in the lobby that holds the reception desk. it looks modern and fantastic, and my expectations for the hotel went up a notch. i mean, its quite cool. but thats where everything started to go wrong. i booked the oasis suite, and had called 2 weeks before to check with their sales coordinator if it would be able to hold a small party of around 15-20 people. no problems she said, it would fit up to 30 people. so imagine my surprise when i reach the hotel to find out that to hold a party i would have to cough up $300 (non-refundable) MISC FEE just to use the room. utterly ridiculous, apparently it is to cover 'damages that the hotel may incurr' wouldnt a deposit suffice i asked, but no. MANAGEMENT RULES was all the duty manager had to say. after considering it for awhile with my partner, we paid the 300 on which they slapped on an additional 7% GST and went up to the room. the room is decent, large and quite comfortable. but once you step outside into the patio area where the jacuzzi is, well, lets just say its best to not venture out without shoes. the wooden floor was mouldy, dried leaves were everywhere, and stray hairs covered the bottom of the jacuzzi. obviously the room hadn't been opened since the last visitor left. my partner and myself spent the better part of an hour TIDYING UP AFTER THE HOTEL. in the evening, some friends brought wine over, and we searched high and low of the corkscrew, i personally went down once to ask if there was a corkscrew in the room, the receptionist insisted that there was and i went back up, but even after tossing everything out of the minibar, it was obvious that there was not corkscrew, so my friends called room service to ask them to bring up a corkscrew, room service insisted that there was a corkscrew in the room and once again, we tried searching for it. finally, we gave up and just went down to the hotel restaurant to have it opened. im tired trying to relate everything that happened, so ill just summarize everything. the patio lights were blown, so it was nearly pitch black outside, the breakfast thats included was just some random danish pastries, hard hard hard boiled eggs, toast and some odd tasting cold cuts. for the price i paid, i could have just topped up around 400 more to get the presidential suite at the St Regis. My complaints to the management took a week to reply, and all they said was hotel policy blah blah blah. boutique hotels are a good idea, but because they have no real reputation to protect, they dont care about what u think about them. for anyone who wants to patronise klapsons, my advice is to think about some other place, where you will be treated like a real guest. this was the most unfavorable experience i have ever had at a hotel in my life.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFabulous.

So I had to go looking, and I'm very glad of that - but the Grand Hyatt has lost me for all time, I'm afraid. I've just found my favourite hotel. In the world. And I've stayed at lots. This is a delightful, funky, fun, ingenious, gorgeous hotel. The staff are gorgeous, interested, with light in their eyes and interest in everything about you. The rooms are FUNKY. But here's the key, and here's why it's not for everyone: There are only 17 rooms. Yes, a 17 room hotel in Singapore, in possibly the smallest building in the city - and it is brand new. And it is nothing like I have ever stayed in before. To the guest who gave it three stars because they served bluefin tuna: get over it, dear. To the guest who gave it one star it can only be a sick joke: \"bad service just like how big and elaborated the hotel is.\" Right. \"Big\". 17 rooms. Yeah. So dear Trip Advisor - please remove that review! The hotel doesn't deserve its name to be tarnished by larrikens. So if you can handle a wonderful, modern, incredibly functional small hotel, please don't book here.
