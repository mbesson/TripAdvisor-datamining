Being on a solo trip as a young female my biggest concern was safety. The hotel is in a great location and I had no worries about my safety at all. It is conveniently located 1/2 a block off of 5th Ave and is at the quieter end of 5th Ave so you don't have to worry about music blaring all night but you can easily get to the music if you wanted to. The hotel beside it has a bar but the live music is only twice a week and is over by 11 so it's not really a problem. Also there is a computer with free internet access at the front as well as a mini lending library. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English. It's not luxurious but for what you are paying it is an excellent value. I would definitely stay here again!

As we have gotten to know PDC, we seem to want to stay further north each year. Our budget was tighter this year, so to make our trip happen, we decided to go for a budget hotel. That is how we decided upon Hotel Coco Rio. They require you to pay cash up front for the $88 per night rate. Pay for six nights get one free. We knew it was risky should something go wrong, but we took the plunge. We stayed in a standard room, number 10. When we checked in, the desk clerk was quite ill with a fever and did her best to give us the scoop as far as safety deposit box, towels, beach, places for breakfast. It was a bit strange. I was hoping I wouldn't catch whatever it was she had! The room was very small. You could hardly sit on the toilet as there was not much aisle space in front of it. But the plumbing, A/C and cable TV worked fine. We did have to have someone come in to get the cable TV going. The safety deposit box would not accomodate a laptop if you bring one. This time we didn't and it turned out to be a good thing. We did purchase cleaning supplies to clean the white closet and bathroom doors. They were covered in black fingerprints & dirt. Once we did this, it was fine. We also purchased a light bulb for the bedside lamp. The globe around the bathroom lamp was cracked and we reported it the day before we left, but it still had not been replaced. The closet space was good. We also had a wood table with 2 chairs. Two small bedside tables each witha drawer and a lamp. There is no shelf or counterspace in the bathroom whatsoever. So we requested a little plastic table we saw on the balconies and they brought us one. There is a refridgerator that works well. Though it was kinda rusty. The space around the bed is tight. My husband & I could barely walk along the same passageway at the same time in the room. I did request the bed to be made with the blanket in between two sheets, and the maids did it this way each day for us. Someone at the desk did ask us if we would mind using our beach towels two days in a row before replacing them using a save the planet approach. But there is but one small towel rack in this room, placed quite low on the wall. You could manage a hand towel on it. No line to pull across shower to hang dry...and the beach towels were pretty sandy from all the wind at the beach. We think they wanted to save on their laundry bill.

Note that I had let them know the day before that I would be checking out early so I would need my $50 back but to no avail. The receptionist could not give me the money, he could not call the owner so he promised to send me the money... yeah right! At this point I knew I could forget about the money but decided to fill in the form anyways. For a few weeks after my return I was in contact with the hotel regarding the missing money. They told me that they had sent it but I never received anything. After a while the management told me they had fired this guy....but you know somehow I don\u00b4t believe them. The rooms had it's charm and having lived in Mexico it did bring back memories and I like my bed firm. As to my partner, he was not too thrilled...but we didn\u00b4t plan to spend anytime there anyways so we managed. Other aspects: the bathroom was tiny as well as the balcony. They did keep everything clean and indeed were able to point me to a really good taco place where I could get my fix of Tacos Al Pastor (the place is El Fog\u00f3n and I reccommend it for anyone looking for real mexican tacos). It is nice to walk through the courtyard to the rooms and the balcony, albeit small, was very nice. Since we were busy diving most of the time we only used the beach once and that was very nice...although rather crowded. I am conflicted whether to reccommend this hotel or not - it has it's upsides and downsides. But if you are looking for luxury or new furniture you should skip it - if you are looking for a good location and are fine with old furniture, hard beds, very dodgy doors and a tiny bathroom then I guess it is fine...", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cokay place\u201d", "Author": "Dasini", "ReviewID": "UR7640102", "Content": "Got a pretty negative start at this place when the receptionist wanted us to sign a blank Visa voucher. This has happened to us before in Mexico and we absolutely hate the idea of it. It would be so easy for hotelowners to fill in some random amount and withdraw it from our account - they already have our signature! But seeing as we had already payed for our stayed - we were forced to do this. Otherwise we would lose money for not cancelling our reservation in time. Anyways the hotel was okay - great location - not on the beach but very close to it and very close to shopping and dining. Also the room was clean. One other thing we didnt care for, was the fact that there was absolutely no waterpressure and when we made the staff aware of this, a guy came to the room and blew some air into the showerhead - although this was rather entertaining - it did not work.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ensenada, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "aineetiny", "ReviewID": "UR7588723", "Content": "Stayed at coco rio for 3 nights in room number 22, garden view...queen bed, fridge, a/c, hairdryer, Cable TV, large closet....Large bathroom.

This hotel is 2 blocks from the beach...60 dlls a night...they give you day passes for mamitas beach club...and they rent you beach towels at 5dlls valid for the whole stay. There are safes in the rooms...but it\u00b4s 2 dlls per day. Front desk staff is really nice, we saw the owner almost everyday, she is really friendly and helpfull.
