At the hotel, when when we first arrived, the window in our room wouldn't close. While they let us move rooms, which was great, it was surprising that they were offering that room to guests, as it was very noisy with the window open. The other slightly negative comment was to the paper cups for drinks in the rooms, which as another review said did cheapen the image of the room.

If you want rustic, and Central Paris, this would not suit. However, it is a Very Short metro ride into central Paris (and it felt really good to be able to navigate the metro so easily). The concierge is endlessly helpful. The staff, A1. On my last day I was absolutely exhausted, so ordered room service. The food and coffee were piping hot and delicious. The hotel is spotlessly clean and modern - I did like the aromotherapy scent as you come through the main revolving door. The free access to PCs was a bonus. The rooms were spotlessly clean. The beds DEVINE! I did eat out a couple of nights at the Bercy Village, which is very conveniently located 2 minutes stroll away, but found the food and service very ordinary. BUT, the cafe there was superb - the BEST coffee. Great little shops at Bercy for browsing and buying. Monoprix is there and has very well priced clothes and accessories, if you have forgotten to pack something. Sephora have the most delightful staff, and beautiful makeup and perfumes. I found the breakfast at the hotel to be more than adequate. Yes, a bit pricey, but I loved the fresh fruit. And it is very convenient. As I was with the tour group, we were in the big \"Downstairs\" breakfast room. Many people were grumbling that the escalator was out of order, and they were not happy with walking up the stairs to get back to the lobby area. It's worth noting that the escalators start up as yet step to them. They do not run all the time. :0) My one bit of advice if you are staying here with a tour group is, if you are arriving before 3pm, to book an extra night at the beginning of your trip. I always book the night before I'm due to arrive so I can check in immediately. It's not a lot of fun arriving at 10am (after 30 hours of flying) and being told you can't check into your room until 3pm. Just make your arrival time clear to the hotel, so that they won't give out your room the night before, thinking you are a No Show.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Union, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cStay no place else !!!!!\u201d", "Author": "xanthe890", "ReviewID": "UR123603271", "Content": "Stayed for 7 nights in may of 2011.

It is located on the relatively new and clean number 14 metro line (at station Cour Saint-Emilion), and is just a few metres away from 'Bercy Village', where there is a small alley of restaurants and small shops. There is also a grocery-type store (monop), and a large cinema nearby. There is a taxi station just by the side of the building. As for the rooms, the beds are clean and comfortable. The TV has a selection of foreign language channels, though as another reviewer wrote, the English ones were mainly news-type, eg BBC, CNN, CNBC. The breakfast was quite nice.

Nevertheless there are some issues that for me put it on the level of a \"Novotel plus\" rather than a truly high end remarkable hotel (these do exist in the Pullman brand and in Accor as a whole) and that is too bad since we had higher expectations after staying at the Pullman Skipper in Barcelona. The hotel is located outside the historical center of Paris, but is very accessible by Metro line 14, that relatively quickly hooks you up to major lines like no. 1 at Chatelet. The Metro station itself is within 5 minutes walk of the hotel, adjacent to the nice Bercy Village pedestrianized shopping and dining area. Automobile access is also very good from the Peripherique or the Quai road along the Seine. This of course depending on the traffic situation which was more or less jammed throughout the main arteries of the city almost all day. If you are just touring the city, avoid using a car at all costs, the Metro is your best bet. Valet parking is available in front of the hotel as well as at a 24/24 parking opposite. Prices are equally expensive (around 28 euros per 24 hour period), but this is par for the course in Paris. As at other Pullmans, the public areas, with emphasis on the lobby, is very modern and attractive. The staff overall is professional, helpful and polite, but some are more so than others. When the concierge noticed that I was having trouble using the airline on-line check-in kiosk in the lobby (a very useful and nice touch in itself), she immediately offered effective assistance and solved my problem. We arrived at the hotel after 14:00, the official check-in time, and our rooms were not yet ready, even though we had reserved long before. Just as hotels rightly insist on check-out at or before the official time so that rooms can be made ready for the next customers, so they must have the room ready when the customer arrives after the publicized check-in time. Apologies were offered and arrangements made so that after a short wait we were given rooms. This is not a tragedy, but it is nevertheless irritating to arrive from a long flight and have to wait. The rooms are relatively spacious for Paris, nicely decorated and clean. The inner door separating the entrance from the living space and isolating you from noise in the corridor or a loudly showering partner as you sleep is a very useful idea The queen size bed is as comfortable as it gets. There is sufficient closet and shelf space as well as a large in-room safe. On the other hand, our sons were in a so-called triple room - a queen sized bed and a convertible sofa bed. The sofa bed, as is usually the case, was unfortunately much less comfortable than the main bed. Apparently the hotel does not have twin bed rooms (2 equally comfortable beds) or we were not offered such a room and this diminished the sleep and overall experience (after all what do you do most of the time in a hotel room other than use the bed). The rooms are equipped with flat screen TV sets offering a wide variety of channels in myriad languages - the English language channels are all of the 24 hour news type. A great plus is the free wifi available in all the rooms The bathrooms are also quite large for Parisian hotels and supplied with a selection of Pullman's wonderful orange scented amenities. It's too bad that the sink, bath and shower facilities are closer to the Novotel standard than that which we expected of Pullman. There is only a single sink for what is billed as a triple room and a lack of shelf space for customers' toiletries. The bathing area is a very simple bath/shower combination with the simplest of shower heads. There is no hand hold available when standing under the shower. This combined with the lack of a no-slip shower mat (of which I'm no great fan), makes slipping in the tub a distinct and dangerous possibility. Hotels of similar standard usually offer separate walk-in showers with advanced \"rainfall\" shower heads. Pullman Bercy is not for aficionados of the great hotel bathroom! Housekeeping needs to run a tighter ship so that amenities are replenished in sufficient quantity for the number of guests in the room. The hotel offers a varied and adequate breakfast. The room itself is large, reflecting the size of the hotel, with a reasonable overflow area. At the same time the main table and side counters are insufficient for a \"full house\", which was (happily for the hotel) often the case during the week that we spent there. The somewhat harried staff had to work hard to keep up with demand as different food trays were emptied and had to be quickly replenished. This seems to me to be a planning failure. I would expect a Pullman brand also to offer a greater variety of cheeses (the glories of France), There were no soft cheeses (Camembert, Brie), no blue cheese, etc. The breads were good, but again, a greater selection is called for. Above all, there wasn't a single fresh vegetable to be found for a breakfast salad (the wilted tomatoes on mozarella don't count). Hasn't Pullman heard about the benefits of fresh vegetables? I could go on and on, but the point is that you get the feeling that breakfast variety and quantity was decided upon by the cost sensitive accountants rather than by the chef. This may well be true at many hotels, but it shouldn't be so obvious. None of this should prevent you from using this hotel - there are much worse out there purporting to be high end hotels. It does mean that we expected more of Pullman and I think that the management should too.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel\u201d", "Author": "vinket", "ReviewID": "UR121762639", "Content": "In line with all other europian hotels, it's basic things that you can expect and nothing more.

Upscale bathroom. Staff were very courteous. It's located about a 4 min walk to the metro (No. 14 line) and 2 min walk to the Bercy village for lots of restaurants and shops and a good supermarket. Free wifi was a great perk. Rooms also have free Evian and sparkling water daily put in your mini-fridge. Nice toiletries plus a robe and slippers. It was so convenient, yet removed from the chaotic noisy bits of central Paris. I highly recommend this property and would definitely stay there again.

The room was nice: typical business hotel fare, but with a really comfortable bed, a Nespresso machine and a big flatscreen TV. But then the annoyances started. After having been driving for a number of hours, I wanted to freshen up... and was happy to see a big rain-shower shower. But... the designers obviously don't believe that people over 180cm exist. I'm 196cm and was unable to shower comfortably - even with the shower-head tilted up as much as possible (and then it tended to poke me in the eye (yes, the head is square)). The TV had the most slow and pointless menu system for finding TV stations. Breakfast the next morning was average. Nothing remarkable about the food - except even with an hour left for breakfast service, there was no bread left. We went out for the day, and on returning, I thought I would try the fitness area and sauna. The fitness equipment was OK, but I was most looking forward to the sauna - again designed by someone who hadn't been at a sauna before I think. However, it was nice and hot (but the showers there was certainly not clean to a standard I would expect). But I had to leave after 20 minutes because of the piped music which permeates every corner of any public area in the hotel. Saunas are meant to be quiet, and if there is music, it should be soothing... not this jazzy poppy bland music being played (I wonder how the staff working in the hotel don't go crazy being forced to listen to this all the time). Breakfast the second morning was a disaster. We arrived down at about 9.40 (service ends at 10.00) to find a huge queue of people waiting to get in for breakfast. On asking to speak with the duty manager I was told that they were surprised that so many people wanted breakfast at that time, becuase normally on a Monday guests have breakfast at around 8.00. How was this a surprise I wonder? It's the Monday after Christmas when most people at the hotel were obviously on holiday and are not working. Some manager type woman tried to get people to have breakfast in the bar. When asked what this consisted of, she wasn't able to tell me. In fact it was a juice, a coffee, and 3 mini-croissants. No thanks. In the main breakfast room, there a lot of things had run out (but were slowly being replaced). Except the bread. There was no bread at all, and only when I was finished did any more appear. We spent 2 nights in the hotel. On the first night we parked the car in the public parking beside/underneath the hotel. 24 hours cost 28EUR. On the second night, I parked in the hotel parking (which is just on-street parking and NOT secure), and for an overnight fee, I was charged 25EUR. An absolute ripoff. All in all, there were too many negative things about the hotel, that I will not be back, nor will I recommend it to anyone else. - A shower designed for people under 180cm - Sauna with piped music which permeates the whole hotel. - So so breakfast with no bread - Unorganised breakfast room in a peak holiday period - Expensive parking charges costing the same as secure parking underground.

Formerly a sea of small wine warehouses (some of which have been converted into stylish restaurants, shops, and other boutiques facing a pedestrian mall), the hotel, just like the area it is in, is modern, bright, and convenient. Though somewhat of a distance from the charming center of Paris, Metro Line 14 whisks passengers there at in only minutes at high speeds in very modern cars. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend this hotel for someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first visit to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153romantic Paris, but for the business traveler or savvy repeat visitor to Paris, this is a refreshingly modern (an reasonably priced alternative) to the somewhat worn or overpriced hotels which are found closer to the city center. The lobby is spacious and colorful, the staff are exceedingly friendly and professional, and everything in the room and elsewhere in the hotel was in great working order. Though the room was equipped with large windows, the sound insulation is excellent, and it was a very restful hotel experience. The distance from town can be a bit of a nuisance, but traveling to even the farthest destinations on the Metro (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll nearly always have to change at least once) doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too long.

Before I continue writing, I must let you in on a secret... I'm an obsessive planner! I like to know all the details before I go somewhere, so I intend to list all the things I would have wanted to know here for you, so you can make an informed decision. First off, travel from airport to the hotel. We used the taxi from the airport, standard 5 seat car, and it cost 43 euro to the door. I tipped him 7 euro, but apparently this was way above the going rate. It took 30 minutes, and this was at 10pm. If I had known the city already, perhaps the Roissybus to Opera, then Metro system to the hotel would have worked just as well, and been half the price. But late at night, we just wanted to get to the hotel! On arrival, with my shaky french I was worried we'd struggle checking in. Not an issue at all. The desk staff spoke very clear, polite English, and in a matter of minutes we were in our room. Perhaps because I booked 3 months in advance, we were upgraded room type on arrival, which was a very pleasant surprise! We opted not to have breakfast in the hotel.... 27 euro each seemed ridiculous. Instead, if you cross over the road to the Bercy village, there's a Starbucks (within 200 metres of hotel door), where you can get breakfast for two for around 14 euro. Much better option in my opinion. The metro station is beside Starbucks, so you'll be heading in that direction anyway. If you've never used a metro system before, don't worry... The french metro system is incredibly efficient. As we were only there for 3 days, we each bought a \"carnet\" (a pack of 10 single tickets) for 11 euro 40 each. The ride into Madeleine station was approx 7 minutes (Line M14). So in other words, do not worry in the slightest that this hotel is slightly out of the way... it's extremily accessible due to the great metro system. There are restaurants in the Bercy village beside the hotel (Bercy village is really just a strip of shops and restaurants), but most of these were closed when we stayed. Room service in the hotel is a great option is you're feeling lazy, and the pizzas we had were both big, and very tasty. Erm... what else. The rooms are very nice, with the queen sized bed being very comfy. Our minibar was free for our upgraded room, and was re-stocked every day. Bathrobe and slippers were supplied, and used!!! The free TV channels are limited (CNN, Sky News, BBC News), so we ended up paying to watch Hancock for 12 euro one night. I would say the only thing that let me down was the TV... but then, you're in Paris! Who needs TV?!?! Oh, the TV is a 32 inch LCD, so it's enjoyable to watch. All in all, an excellent experience at this hotel, and I wouldn't think twice about staying again. Same opinion from my girlfriend! Paris is a lovely city... enjoy!!", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cModern Hotel, good location, a little expensive\u201d", "Author": "dannysherwood", "ReviewID": "UR21671843", "Content": "a really nice, modern hotel, great sized rooms and a good locatiion for transport and Bercy Village.

We were looking for somewhere comfortable just for one night before catching a train to Venice the following evening. The hotel is easy to get to from the Metro (about 5 mins walk) and being one of the newer lines were able to use escalators to get to street level rather than dragging heavy cases up steps. The hotel was conveniently situated close to the attractions of Bercy Village, a pedestrianised block or two of resturants and niche shops. We didn't try any of the local resturants but they seemed to be popular with the locals although they did look a little on the pricey side. Because we only had about 36 hours in the city we didn't spend much time in the area but headed off to the main attractions nearer the centre of the city. Some people mentioned the hotel as being a bit remote but we found that even watching the lights get switched on on the Eiffel Tower at 10 o'clock from the Trocadero we managed to be back at the hotel within 35 minutes. The hotel was very comfortable, the staff friendly and helpful and were happy for us to leave our bags for a few hours after checking out so that we didn't have to drag them round Paris before catching the train in the evening. We also didn't have breakfast. We too throught the E27 price charge was a bit steep but looking around Bercy Village a bit later most places were around the same price for breakfast. On the whole I would go back, certainly mid-week because we got a good rate, and would recommend it for a night or two.", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, Clean, and Roomy\u201d", "Author": "redtexas", "ReviewID": "UR19522384", "Content": "The Pullman Bercy (formerly Sofitel) is a spacious, clean, and modern hotel just steps away from Bercy Village.

Pros: Quiet, A/C, big king-size bed (although we were told queen), fridge, access to metro (Cour St. Emilion stop on purple 14 line - one stop away from Gare de Lyon which is a major intersection), close to restaurants and a few shops. Excellent and very affordable wine store at Nicolas in Bercy Village - also a good restaurant. Get their house brand of wine. Bottle from store is less than 3 euros. Cons: No breakfast cafes, no stand for a croissant and coffee. There is a restaurant at the bottom of the Ibis across the street with a great buffet for 9 euros, but nothing cheap, easy, and quick. Dinner restaurants in Bercy were nice, but lacked some of the charm of the Latin Quarter or Marais areas. Very popular and great people watching. Hotel is perfect for anyone who needs a nice, cool, and quiet room. For some of us insomniacs, this is critical and rare in Europe. We were not any further away from sights than anybody else in the city. Don't fear the metro as the 14 is the newest and fastest subway line in Paris. Yes, it lacks some of that \"charm\", but we wouldn't have traded our wonderful nights of sleep on our big comfy bed for anything! Booked on Priceline.
