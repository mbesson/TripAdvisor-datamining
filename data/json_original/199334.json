The hotel itself is not impressive looking from the outside and the reception is ridiculously small but that is the worst criticism that I can give it. The room itself was lovely, the staff were friendly and I have never had as good a breakfast as I did at the Hotel Miramar. There was something the cater for all tastes (which is not always the case in hotels on mainland Europe) and I have to say I was really set up for the day of sightseeing after it.

Furthermore, they had made a courtesy reservation for me and my family at a nearby hotel (near the train station). I did not want the reservation they made for me in a red light district hotel.Unfortunately, I was unable to find anything reasonable on such last minute in Frankfurt, so I ended up staying at a nearby town, instead of Frankfurt.
