{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Villa Poppy - great, but not perfect I stayed at Villa Poppy from 11 - 16 March 2007. My wife and 2 children (3 and 1), and my parents and wife's parents, were with us, so it was a three-generation family vacation.Villa Poppy has many things going for it. Here are the pluses:(1) Location, location, location. It's a three minute walk through a quiet side lane to Jalan Raya Seminyak, where there are all sorts of great shops, cafes, restaurants, and the supermarkets. It was really useful being close to Bintang Supermarket. And I liked that after dinner, we could stroll over to do shop and just look at clothes and other stuff at the great shops. And more importantly (when you have 2 small children who often want to be carried), the taxis are nearby. One of my friends stayed at another villa that played up its quiet, remote location -- but the downside was that she had to walk 20 minutes to get a cab.(2) The shops that are within a 10 - 15 minute walk of Villa Poppy are lovely - much, much nicer than those at Kuta. The quality of the clothes, the styling, the atmosphere of the shops -- these were great. Some of the shops, my wife noted, looked like they belonged to the best malls in Singapore, or in LA.(3) There are at least 3 or 4 spas within a 10 min walking distance of Villa Poppy, one of which, Espace, is really nice. (4) The staff, Ayu and Ilu, are great. They are good cooks, completely obliging, and make killer avocado milkshakes. Great mie goreng and gado gado too. They were great with our kids too. Made and Gede were friendly and obliging too.(5) The grounds are lovely -- not too big, just nice enough, and the pool, just steps from the living and dining areas, was nice for cooling off in the heat.Here are the downsides:(1) Noise at night. Villa Poppy was also just a 2 minute walk to Jalan Dyana Pura, the club street. So we could hear the throb of the clubs up till 2 or 3 at night. The first night we were there, it was a bit of a problem. But we got used to it and it didn't bother us the subsequent nights. (2) Mosquitoes. I think this is a problem faced by virtually all Bali villas, since I think nearly all Bali villas have open-concept living and dining areas. The good thing is that the staff are pretty obsessive about burning the mosquito incense. And we just had to be pretty obsessive about putting insect repellent. So after the first day, we wisened up and the mosquitoes didn't bother us quite as much. One night, while watching TV, my wife and I saw a frog hopping across the floor in front of us, taking refuge from the rain. (3) For villa newbies, don't expect five-star hotel service. This means that sheets and towels don't necessarily get changed and washed every day. And no Molton Brown toiletries in the bathrooms. And if the sun doesn't come out and if it rains, your laundy doesn't get dried. And the open concept bathrooms mean that when it rains, the bathrooms get wet too. So one shouldn't stay at a villa and expect five-star, Ritz Carlton-style service. (4) My main complaint -- again a minor and tolerable one -- was with the water pressure of the shower attached to the master bathroom. It was very weak and I had to stand right under the shower head to get wet and get washed off.(5) Those who want easy access to the beach will be disappointed. This wasn't a priority for us so it wasn't a problem. The beach was a good 10 minute walk away, not just a few minutes. It was a nice, easy stroll, but still a fair distance, and you can't take the kids and bring all the beach stuff easily.But all told, these are minor compared to the pluses of Villa Poppy. I would certainly stay there again if I were to return to Bali.", "Date": "Mar 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR746186865", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "singaporeboy"}, {"Content": "Beautiful Traditional villa in Bali OK - this place is a gem! We've been there twice now and want to tell everyone about it - despite the fact that we wanted to keep the secret location to ourselves!This gorgeous traditional private villa is located just off the main street in Seminyak, Bali, 5 min walk to the beach and 5 min walk to a supermarket. It's surrounded by some of the best shopping on the island - not to mention magnificant restaurants. All within walking distance. The villa is a traditional design opening out to the gardens, has the alang alang roof, 3 a/c bedrooms, 3 atmospheric indoor/outdoor bathrooms, fully equipped kitchen, DVD player, cable TV, and - best of all - a lounge area and hammock overlooking the beautiful lush gardens and pool. That was one of our favourite places to relax and daydream - another was the traditional 'bale' under the huge mango tree beside the sparkling pool,if we weren't actually floating IN the pool!At night, specific palms and frangipani trees are highlighted with spotlights - it's just like a fairyland believe me. So relaxing and quiet.We also love interacting with the staff, they are so friendly and can help organise virtually anything. They cooked our meals and did our laundry - better than a hotel, but much much more intimate. The Balinese are beautiful people and this is a wonderful way to experience something different and interact with the locals.Sure, there may be many villas available, but we'd highly recommend Villa Poppy to anyone mainly because of its atmosphere and its location. Both times we've stayed there, we've felt like it really was our own home and settled into the lifestyle in no time at all.We've paid US$200/night both times for a week, but I think they'll discount depending on the length of stay. It works out to be about $35 per person per night, if you have 6 people staying there which is excellent value. The villa came highly recommended to us, and we made a booking over the internet on -------. Easy. Perhaps others can enjoy this special find....", "Date": "Mar 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR756432393", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Baliphile1"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d602653-r7189672-Villa_Poppy-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "602653", "Price": "$225"}}
