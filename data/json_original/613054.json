{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Location Location Location Stayed there for two nights in august of 2007. The location is just awesome. In the middle of the West-Berlin Center. You are just in the middle of everything!! The rooms are small but just ok. It's clean and the staff is very friendly. Breakfast could have been better but the location is the best!!", "Date": "Aug 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR946300130", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "1globetrotterSweden"}, {"Content": "Remter was there in a pinch. Great location. This was my first ever trip to Europe. My friend had made all the accomodations in advance and all was going well until we reached Berlin. Our pre-booked hotel was not located where we expected. We were lost, it was raining and my friend was very frustrated. We went back to square 1 (The Zoo Banhof) and simply went to the room finding service located there. They gave us some choices and we selected the Remter due to it's location  price.The hotel is just off the K'Dam on a quiet street a short walk from the Banhof  the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church . Shopping, restaurants, transportation  nightlife are all nearby. The staff was pleasant as well as the property. There is a large communal living room near the check in desk. The place was clean  comfortable which is what I expect. They even gave me a discount for staying an extra night after my friend flew home.I miss you Berlin and hope to return soon.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR997635925", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "DDayMiami"}, {"Content": "my first trip to berlin hi, i was a guest at the hotel for 7 nights. in the first evening i had a very unpleasant experience . as the bathroom is one step higher then the rest of the room i made a step backwards and fall on the flour .it was not a laugh .the edge of the step didn't have any warning sign. or a glare strip. i want to warn other people who are visiting this hotel to pay attention.thank God i could get over it. the hotel is in a good location .the rest of my stay in Berlin was very satisfactorybye ilana", "Date": "Sep 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR314053210", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "meravi"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d613054-r18988768-Hotel_Remter-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "613054", "Price": "$128"}}
