It was his 2nd and my first trip to Sydney. Enjoyed our 2 night stay at Park Hyatt. Good: Particularly loved the brilliant views of the harbor and the Opera House. Our room was elegant and tastefully decorated. Loved the nice comfortable bed and ever fluffy towels which were changed twice a day. The hotel is located in the Rocks and many tourist attractions are in short walking distance, including the Harbor Bridge, Opera House, and the recently reopened the Museum of Contemporary Art. Bad: No free Wi-Fi. Two unpleasant incidents-- Guest staying in the room above us failed to use ashtray while smoking on the balcony. When we approached the balcony to enjoy the glorious morning sun in the balcony, we were terribly disappointed with the mess on our chairs. While this unsightly views of ashes were cleaned up later by the cleaning staff, it happened again on the 2nd day. I do acknowledge that this is not entirely the fault of the hotel, however, this should not have happened as our rooms are designed to be 'non-smoking'. Second, having walked around the town all day, we came back to the hotel in the late afternoon to rest till dinner. We were surprised to find a waste basket on top of the table and all the used teacups and glasses were still there. This was handled swiftly once we notified the reception. Have to admit that this was totally disappointing. If you are in Sydney for the first time and are looking for a hotel with dazzling views of the Opera House, I could highly recommend Park Hyatt. The view was stunning in the morning sun, at sunset, and under the moon. However, the overall experience of the hotel did not wow me except for the views -- at least not as much as I had expected from reading all the reviews. Good but not that great --It was pleasant just as much as at other five star hotels in general. If I were to go back to Sydney again for holiday, I would look for other hotels.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGood!

However I could not fault the service at check-in as the staff where impeccable at the front desk. The rooms are nice but lack that real sense of class that the hotel says and thinks it has. The furniture in the room was nice but nothing great, there's an arm chair in the room that just looked like a nicer version of an ikea arm chair. The breackfast was very good, probably the best thing about the hotel, however I ordered room service one night and they forgot a couple of things and I had to call them to bring them up. At$900 a night for your basic standard room the hotel is very very very overpriced!!! Yes the location is nice. Yes the service is good.

With respect to the property, it has an unrivaled location on the harbor with magnificent views of the Opera House, CBD skyline and cruise ships. Our room was tastefully decorated and modern. The property has undergone a complete renovation and parts of the hotel were still under construction. For example, some guest rooms were still gutted and you could hear the construction noise from our room at times and work around the gym and pool was still ongoing (the roof top spa was out of order, gym toilets wouldn't flush and construction equipment was left in the gym corridor leading to the pool). It was particularly disturbing that management failed to notify us in advance of the ongoing construction (we were really looking forward to using the rooftop spa). Additionally, in some ways it felt like some of the details were slapped together without much care. For example, the safe in our room broke and it took several people several hours to fix the problem; the emergency exit sign on our room door fell off; an emergency exit sign in the hallway fell off the wall too and wasn't replaced during our stay; part of the smoke detector fell off the ceiling in our room and wasn't fixed during our stay; and disturbingly and frighteningly, the hotel-wide emergency alarm went off early one morning. As for the service, it was mixed with some notable good and bad exceptions which for a property as nice and expensive as the Park Hyatt is overall disappointing. At check-in the staff made a fuss that the manager wanted to greet us personally, so we waited and the manager came to front desk, but never bothered to follow through and speak to us. Our room was not ready when we arrived and they told us to have a drink or go out. Instead we said we'd like to workout. They took us to the gym and told us they'd collect us when the room was ready. They never came and we had to go back and inquire about our room's status. Also, they didn't bother to show us any of the new amenities or explain our Diamond amenities. Management should train staff to ALWAYS ring the bell before entering the room. One day I hurt my ankle while out walking and returned to the room a little early. I had removed all my clothing and was walking to the shower when our butler walked in and I was completely naked. There was no bell ring or knock. I heard the key swipe and then the door opened! This was extremely embarrassing and a complete violation of privacy. Staff should always ring the bell (even with the privacy light is not on). I suspect some of the staff are new but this should be one of the first things they are taught to do. One other point worth mentioning is that the turn down and housekeeping service is really odd. The staff would tidy the room, but wouldn't clear used dishes. It seems that the butlers were responsible for clearing dishes, but we noticed that sometimes our dirty dishes and barware were moved from the table to the minibar area and then back to the table. The result being that sometimes used dishes remained in the room for up to 2 days. One suggestion would be that management instruct all staff members--butlers or housekeeping--to remove any dirty dishes whenever they see them. Otherwise, relying on the joint efforts of the butlers and housekeeping to maintain a room produces disjointed results and it's a little unpleasant to come back to a clean room with a table full of dirty dishes. Also we noticed that housekeeping doesn't use the big trolleys that you typically see in a hotel and as a result, it seems that they have no capacity for clearing dishes or restocking small items like shampoo, conditioner, note pads or bath salts. We'd often arrive back to the room after a long day and we'd have to call for shampoo/conditioner & bath salts. So perhaps management could provide housekeeping with a fully stocked trolley. Overall, we were disappointed with our stay, but believe that once they sort out their start-up issues the Park Hyatt Sydney could once again be top notch.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Patong", "Title": "\u201cPark Hyatt Delicious and Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "wendywanda", "ReviewID": "UR127457776", "Content": "For a beautiful breakfast with a view visit the Park Hyatt.

It is by far the best option for a Sydney stay in terms of location and five star experience. We had tried to book the deluxe rooms because they were bigger but they were booked out and two standard rooms at 40m2 were absolutely fine even for a family of six, newly renovated and lovely view of the city, ferries and a square rigged sailing ship recalling the Rocks' history. It is an intimate setting as opposed to looking down from a distance at the city's goings on from the Four Seasons or Shangri-la glass windows. The view was only marred by a huge cruise ship that docked on our last morning. Perhaps the Opera rooms don't have this problem. Check in was smooth and we were able to shower in the gym when we were not able to check in early. Concierge were lovely but a mixed bag in terms of experience like the rest of the staff at the hotel. We heard one of them say some odd things to tourists (we are former Sydney residents) such as telling another young family that a trip to Taronga zoo would only take 2-3 hrs (not with kids in tow!) and then they could lunch at Doyles (it is easy to spend a day at the zoo and Balmoral Bathers Pavillion which is on the same side of the harbour as the zoo would have been a more memorable option). Doyles is okay - fish and chips, a bit of a Sydney institution and needs a facelift - but there are other more up to the minute options nearby (MCA rooftop cafe, Sake). Eatability.com lists restaurants with chefs' hats which is a pretty reliable indicator of good food. The fine food company (for breakfast or coffee) is great as is Baroque for dinner - both around the corner from the hotel and recommended by a staff member. Ferry ride is a must - Darling Harbour (maritime museum, aquarium and fab playground), Luna Park (tacky amusement park), Balmain East or Mosman Bay (playground by the Harbour), Zoo etc are all a ferry ride away from the hotel. The rooftop pool was like a welcome warm bath. Breakfast was good but again, service was mixed (Antoine and Isis stood out for us as consummate professionals). For example, coffee took a long time to arrive on most mornings we were there and when we queried one morning where it was after waiting 10 minutes, we were told 'it is made from scratch' - laughable! However, there were only ever minor blips and none of the sassy attitude that you get from others in the city's service industries. Instead, there were so many small gestures from staff to make our stay a pleasure that we really felt very privileged to be there. Room Service menu was excellent. Afternoon tea scones were delicious. Most importantly for us, our children were always welcomed (thank you for the gifts and I loved the organic bath amenities- thank you!). Overall, a very intimate re-introduction to Sydney in all it's glory (Opera House, Harbour Bridge, the historical Rocks area, Ferry rides, the Botanic Gardens and city shops all on your doorstep and shiny, happy people to welcome you).", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStill one of the best\u201d", "Author": "Simon T", "ReviewID": "UR127396289", "Content": "Being a Hyatt fan, have stayed in about 30 of them mostly Park Hyatts for business and pleasure.

Guests are escorted to their rooms by hosts/front desk Ambassadors not bellman which may be more typically a front office manager. If I've observed anything about the new Park Hyatt Sydney it is an overwhelming desire/commitment to please guests like never before With one glaring exception of its past business decision of no suite upgrades for Hyatt top tier members a policy which sadly still remains firmly in place On the other hand each guest is treated with the highest regard for room upgrades and all other amenities here including the unexpected and random acts of kindness and generosity from mostly amazing professional well groomed attractive team members Moving on................ The Butler is Back!!! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just advertising it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time in 15 years I actually had one show up at the door. For those that have not had such luxuries they are truly a great asset providing you with any special services during your stay. Packing or unpacking and a wide variety of assistance are offered.Regretfully my short stay didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make use of this exceptional service. The Room Upon entry of the long and winding corridors which have some nice new touches including enhanced hallway lighting I arrived at my upgraded room 244. I am a huge fan of the simple rectangular door handles of polished chrome and the simple state of the art room key entry system. Simple, effective and effortless. Have been looking at a similar design for my new residence. The large well-appointed room two exceptional all glass balconies(no obstruction remain anymore) with good views of the Opera House It took a while to understand the rooms architectural design The rooms do not have the wow dramatic factor of say Andaz Wall Street New York City that I have come to favour. In fact in some areas it is a slightly lesser overall room product with some exceptions. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m speculating the designers wanted to achieve an understated yet tasteful contemporary design that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compete with the view which is the main event at this property clearly. In that regard I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say that the designers got it right. The rooms are certainly more functional and contemporary then in the past and as other long time guests have noted slightly fuller of furniture making rooms seem a bit smaller. Impressive are the mirrored and wood light up closets(beautifully lit with great task lighting) that open up to impeccable storage and your every whim from a glass door mini bar to all the most important amenities.Sharp television replaces the former Bang AND Olfusen television that were confusing because the B&O remotes were never meant to work with hotel systems.I am not a fan of Sharp it is a lower quality television compared to LGs,Sonys and other brands. The upside is they are on beautiful round silver bases opposite the bed and the sliding glass doors They are adequate but the picture is not as sharp and bright had they used a more appropriate higher end brand.A beautiful fruit bowl and bottled water (with my brand of choice awaited) House chocolates appeared in my room the next day as well (this may or may not be typical) THE Good & the Bad The Beds as noted previously are platform they are very firm and have no box spring.The bed has zero movement. For firm mattress lovers you will be in heaven for those accustomed to the Westin Heavenly Beds you may be in much misery. The other thing that does happen through the night is the occasional blast of cruise ship horns which I also experienced at 3 AM Light sleepers may be startled in the otherwise quiet of night. Lighting A mix of state of the art LED energy efficient lighting with on off touch controls that are difficult and confusing to control in a darkened room at night. The lighting is stunning and well thought out when fully lit. I regret they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply use dimmers for greater control of lighting and ease of function Power Converters are something the Park Hyatt Sydney truly got right located on both sides of the bed and desk/table area. Easy to access. Shades Like Andaz they use motorized shades one for black out and one for blocking some of the day time glare .They are not the high end of motorized shades and slightly noisy but highly effective,functional & attractive at doing their job. The heating and ac controls are adequate and a huge improvement over many I have observed elsewhere Bath Area The rainforest shower and second hand held is very nice with controls located on the marble at waist length that extends from the vanity into the shower area. I was slightly disappointed with the shower water pressure after coming from the Westin.The vanity area is very attractive with the toilet area located away from the bathroom in the front of the guest room in what almost seems like a second guest toilet at first glance. In the middle of the night confused how to get adequate lighting in the pitch black I ended up walking into the shower accidently seeking the toilet :) The Toto toilet is quiet elaborate one part heated seat one part bidet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fattest toilet seat I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever parked myself on. Though I assume that many find it appealing to have their rears warmed while on the throne I am not a fan. I chose to pull the plug out of the wall rather than read the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manual or call the butler to learn how to make it all work J I loved the new sleek glass minimalist European scales I will be purchasing one for myself Toiletries I am not a fan of their new shampoo amenity which is the new Bergamonte 222.Of course like beds subjective. Oddly there are tubs in the room and no Jacuzzis in the rooms and that follows the same path up to the expensive lavish suites that go for 3000 plus dollars a night. IMHO I believe that and the platform beds and the lack of Jacuzzis are the two biggest mistakes this otherwise amazing hotel flubbed. That of course will ultimately rely in the eyes of the beholder! The Dining Experience was below quality expectations though the team was welcoming and hospitable and always coming up with unexpected surprises during my stay They even know what brand beverage I prefer and had it available during my stay The Bellmen First Class & Professional The Concierge I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use but their services they never failed to smile and engage in nice conversation when accessing elevators where they are now located in the former space of the checkout desk area The Gym Has a new Techno Gym line up.I wish Hyatt had kept its recent smart partnership choice of Life Fitness.To be fair Techno Gym equip has made some improvements in recent years. However it is still not as good as Life Fitness,Nautilus and other fitness brands IMO The Spa Nicely redone with couple massage tables side by side so partners and or friends can be massaged together by two therapists at a time Final Assessment Park Hyatt Sydney after many years is well on its way to finding its ultimate promise to truly exceed most guest expectations. It was well on course even at the time of its closing last year despite its aging interior and small shortcomings. Today it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply a vastly improved and much better hotel experience physically and aesthetically. It knows who its luxury customers are overall and what it takes to satisfy their most individual personal whims and desires for those that wish to engage in such pampering In my eyes it is what the Park Hyatt brand aspired to be at inception of the original brand launching and reasonably acheived. Park Hyatt Sydney is clearly well on its way taking it to the next level if early experiences are any indicator. Is the Park Hyatt Sydney worth its starting price of 800 dollars a night and up even in an overpriced high demand market like Sydney? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of my opinion that the Park Hyatt Sydney has few peers when it comes to overall guest service for those wishing to fulfil a truly aspirational experience in Sydney Surrounded by polished seasoned Hyatt hospitality professionals with amongst some of the best moments of my thirty years on the road in any brand. One can find a far more comfortable bed in Sydney and better overall dining experiences with far better value. However nothing compares to the remarkable team that remain currently on board or the magical setting that is a must for anyone traveling to Sydney for the first or the 100th time This is a place where celebrities, VIPs and the mere frequent traveller elite or not can feel pampered and made to feel like a true visiting VIP dignitary on revenue or award. I would suggest run don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk and make a booking to get your preferred dates while availability exists Come experience one of the worlds most civilized unique aspirational experiences in hospitality surrounded by panoramic views of the Opera House In closing I wanted to award 5 stars for the team/service however I deducted one star for food quality and the platform bed.Shy of those two exceptions this remains one of my personal favorite properties in the word where one feels honored to be a guest Welcome back \"Park Hyatt Sydney\" nice to have you back!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFlat Packed Gone Posh\u201d", "Author": "HarryP72", "ReviewID": "UR126447261", "Content": "Location wise, this hotel has it all. Having just re-opened in Feb 2012, following a very expensive refit, I have to say we were sadly rather disappointed. Perhaps we expected more. After all, at a cost close to $1000 per night, one kind of expects something really good. We requested a room with an Opera House view, which we got; as long as you sat on top of the dining table and leant into the wall. It was as though the room itself wasn't actually designed with the view in mind. We asked to change room, and we were offered a similar room further around the corridor. The room had a reverse layout, so in theory we would get the 'killer view\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the bed and couch, unfortunately not. Because of the rooms position within this wonderfully curvaceous building, the view could only be enjoyed if one were to also sit on (not at) the table. Had each of the rooms been fitted out in reverse format, one would have enjoyed the view from the bed and the settee...... clearly a rather large oversight by the interior designer. This is what happens when you design on paper and don't consider the aspect. Doh! In general the interior design is very heavy. Dark wooden veneer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on every surface, slightly oppressive and not really very \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The same finish in a London hotel may work, but not in a warm climate with bright skies and killer views. A prime example of this in the public spaces is the hotel bar. Dark and dingy, with views a stone throw away, yet you are concealed into a space behind screens and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even see the harbour let alone the Opera House. The breakfast room is nice and airy I have to say; very lovely to have breakfast in. Shame breakfast isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t included in the room rate; at $1000 is it unreasonable to expect this? The roof terrace is the best bit. Nice sun loungers and a cracking view. Perhaps a tad noisy, but given its location (under the bridge) one doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visit for peace and quiet. The staff were very polite and did a good job from a service point of view, however they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that edge that you would expect from a hotel of this standard. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that feeling of sincerity, but perhaps that was also because they were new given the hotel had only been re-opened less than a month before our arrival. So, I am only giving 3 out of 5 because in my view the interior design is not great nor is it unique.

I was also supposed to stay for a Sunday, but decided to cancel my stay and to stay somewhere else in Sydney. The hotel is having the official grand reopening this Tuesday (20th of March, 2012). This hotel just feels very touristy due to its location in the rocks. It is perfect if it is your first time in Sydney and you care about the view of the Sydney Opera House. The view is not that important for me. I care more about functional hotel and the benefits they offer me as a Hyatt Gold Passport Diamond member. Per terms and conditions of the program I was eligible for the best available room. At the Park Hyatt Sydney this would have been Opera or City King Deluxe that they were selling at the time of check in. I checked this from Hyatt.com. Hotel did acknowledge that they do have at least City King Deluxe available, but would not upgrade me into it. I was too tired at this point to contact the Hyatt Consumer Affairs in the States to have them to fix the issue. This particular location has been playing this same game even before the renovations. The room that I had felt about the same as before. These are not huge by any means. I would have preferred somewhat smaller bathroom and more space in the room itself that now feels somewhat cramped. There is a large kitchen table that you should use as a work desk. If you work on the desk, it is impossible to use any of the two phones that you have in the room, however. The minibar setup is one of the best that I have seen at any hotel. The bed was very comfortable. I did, however, have a huge problem with the lights. They should have an instructional booklet by the bed how to operate the system. I couldn't figure out how to dim the room completely. I loved the Diamond amenity of a bottle of red wine and a small fruit display. The fitness center had been completely refurbished and they had a new line of LifeFitness equipment that I like. The space is rather small, but I doubt that there are going to be more than one or two exercising at any given moment due to the clientele at this hotel. The pool is on the rooftop that has zero privacy due to the bridge and the walking bridge tours. Breakfast was really good, but didn't like the restaurant area. I would have preferred to have my breakfast in a quiet setting but the room was full. I don't like hotel calling me at 11:56AM to ask if I need help with my bags. If you want to know what time I would be checking out (4PM) just ask. I also received a Thank You For Your Stay-email from the hotel before I had left. Attention to detail missing? There was already huge stains on the hallway outside of my room.

If you want the best 5 star hotel experience in Sydney bar none then this is the place for you. Prior to the recently completed renovation, the Park Hyatt Sydney already boasted the best rooms and everything else in town, so the wife and i were interested to see just how the 2011 renovations would raise the bar on an already exceptionally high benchmark. We checked in for 3 nights with a small group on March 9th 2012, just 3 weeks after the hotel was reopened on February 17th. On arrival,we were greeted by a youthful,enthusiastic, multilingual international front of house team, that could mix it with the best anywhere, anytime, anyplace in the world. - They are just \"Shiny\" ! - After 3 days we could see that they were still the highly skilled, well drilled machine that they were prior to the renovation. - Leon, the General Manager prior to the renovations, has returned with a vengance to re establish a new benchmark for Sydney 5 star properties. So, on to the rooms. - We stayed in an Opera King this time, which is smaller then the Opera Deluxe that we normally like to stay in. Japanese visitors will be delighted to know that the latest model Toto toilets have been installed in all rooms, complete with features that NASA engineers would be proud of. IT savvy android compatable devices have been added as well as a complete suite of IT outlets for all things IT. The bathroom features a nice bath and rainforest shower, which is a lovely addition. The beds are delightful and sooooooo comfy. - Better than most 5 stars we have stayed in. Our room came standard with a balcony overlooking the harbour and the Opera house and it was quite spacious with plenty of room for 2 on the comfy chairs provided. Room service was on time and most importantly hot !! Plates are pre heated and remain warm when themeals are served. Breakfast arrived complete with toaster which was set up on our table so that we could have hot toast with our meal cooked to our liking. The room decor is beige/brown predominately and the feel is very warm. - We also suggested that the 40' TV could be mounted a little higher so that it was easier to see from the bed when lying down. A completely new spa has been created replacing the old 3 room one with a new 5 room one and this time with a couples suite which we enjoyed. Treatements here are very good and if you like deep tissue massages done deep then this is one of the few hotels i have found that actually do this consistenetly. The Spa is now conveniently located next to the elevators on the second floor instead of having to access from the 4th floor down a staircase. - Much better ! The swimming pool is an outdoor facility and it is located on the 4th floor. It overlooks Sydney Harbour and the Opera house and it is a great place to soak up some rays and take in views of Sydney harbour at the same time. Service in the restaurant is schmick !! - We were served by staff from France, Norway, Germany and Italy. - a very youthful, professional team all smartly attired and groomed to the max. During the renovations last year the wife and i tried the Shangri La, The Intercontinental, The Sheraton and The four Seasons. - Whilst these are good, they are not even in the same solar system as the Park Hyatt. All now look very tired compared to the newly rolled out Park Hyatt, none can offer the on the Harbour experience and the Park Hyatt front of house team have an edge on all of them. - If you are planning a special trip to Sydney for whatever reason, don't even think about staying anywhere else. Having said that, you have to be prepared to go all the way and book a Harbour view room or a suite, as this is an important part of the wow factor of the hotel. From your balcony you are spitting distance from the Harbour in one of these and this is something you will enjoy and remember long after you leave. - Wife and i have spent many days and nights on the balcony sipping Champagne,listening to nice music and watching the world go by on the harbour. - Game over other Sydney 5 stars !! Park Hyatt Sydney, is not for those of you who prefer to do things on a budget. My view is that money is only worth the pleasure it brings you and you will get plenty of that staying here. On check out, Leon the GM met us and enquired about our stay to ensure we were happy. This was a nice touch and further demonstrated the levels of service you experience here. Left with the wifey, once again very happy that our favourite 5 star retreat in Sydney was back open for business. - Arguably the best hotel experience anywhere in Australia. - Now its back open, \"piggy banks\" all over the world will be sweating !", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hunter Valley", "Title": "\u201cSee Sydney at its best\u201d", "Author": "grussellt", "ReviewID": "UR125300311", "Content": "Our stay was in 2010 (so I'm a little late writing this review) but the hotel was superb even before the recently completed refurbishment.

The manner in which he called the reservations desk, he was able to secure a room and have everything pre-paid in advance and since he was affiliated with a loyalty programme of the Hyatt hotel chain, his details were stored in the system.

On the day of arrival, I had arrived with my partner and was expecting to have a seamless check in upon verification of my identity and that my uncle had given permission; unfortunately this was not the case.

Because two such special occasions were tied over the weekend, we decided this year to do something really special and I'm so happy we booked at the Park Hyatt, Sydney. Due to extreme excitement, the morning before we flew to Sydney (from Adelaide) I rang the hotel to enquire as to the view from our assigned room, and what room number we were. (also, a previous experience shows that late arrivals to some hotels you get \"what's left\"). This was not the case here. I spoke to Simone who was very helpful and entertained my enthusiasm and barage of questions. A good start... We arrived late, about 10pm and we had the pleasure of Ronny checking us in. Very professional and friendly and it was a really nice start to our stay. As it was a special stay Ronny arranged a bottle of wine to our room - this was a really nice thing to do for us, thank you. Next we decided to have a hot chocolate before retiring to our room. Thanks to my earlier liaison with Simone, Stuart brought out a dessert with a candle on it (me being the terrible wife, i hadn't arranged a cake:). Thank you Stuart, this was very special. Kirsten was looking after us also and she was such a delight as well. The hospitality and warmth we experience from Stuart & Kirsten made us immediately feel at home. It was the end of the night and yet they were very relaxed and had lovely smiles for us and we really enjoyed our interactions with them. Although I had an itinerary for our trip to Sydney, the next morning I rang concierge about a minor query. I was speaking to Chris who drew from me our plans for the day. By the time we went to Concierge 10 minutes later, Chris had a number of Manly breakfast dining options and ferry timetables for our day. Wow! We hadn't expected this and he had even highlighted certain details for us. During our stay calling Chris each morning became a regular for us. I feel he encapsulates the service you expect at this establishment and Chris does it with ease. I wish him all the best, he was really lovely to us. I highly recommend WOLFIES GRILL for dinner - I have dined here previously and it's still as excellent as I remember it and fyi it is on the waterfront. Best of all it is only a stones throw (literally) from the front door of the hotel - an easy stroll in heels ladies! We also dined at Aria while in town, which was a complete sham trading under a tv persons name. Hugely disappointing on so many levels (except the food which is a real shame for the chefs.) We were made to wait 60 minutes for our table which I had booked months in advance, they tried to then give us a middle of the room table when i had requested a window table in my booking, they tried to charge us $100 of the previous tables drinks, they filled still tap water into our sparkling water glass - of which we'd had half a glass each and were charged $24 for! the list goes on sadly. It was over $150pp and we were hugely dissatisfied with our experience and I feel really sorry for Matt Moran and the chefs because front of house really let them down (I have reviewed it so and wish i'd read previous reviews saying similar things *sigh*) Back to the Hyatt! (Wish we'd dined here instead of Aria). I would like to make a special mention to housekeeping. Our rooms were kept pristine clean and the turn down was lovely. I've been to hotels where you sense housekeeping do a rush job through your room but I got the feeling that housekeeping took great care and pride in their work because our rooms were always of a very high standard. We enjoyed a lovely warm spa one morning. The water level was a bit low but we still enjoyed ourselves. We noticed a very well equiped gym on site also. We ordered in room service one morning and it was delicious and i have to say, not too badly priced compared to some hotels we've been to (not that i'd want to pay anymore!) Room service was efficient and I was very impressed with this. We had room 005 which has a view to the left of the Opera House and across the water to the city. it was fabulous! thank you very much to the Hyatt for this room. Room 004 would also be ok but i think the rooms get even better up to around 009 / 010 or so with probably even more frontal views of the operal house. My sincere thank you goes out to the Hyatt and it's beautiful people. This was a very special 4 days for us in Sydney and we had been looking forward to it for quite a few months. Because it was a romantic holiday, where we stayed really mattered to us and you all did a wonderful job of helping us have a great stay.

Housekeeping was limited to making the beds and changing towels, but do not expect anything more, no tidying, removal of dirty glasses, no chocolates with turndown, nothing special. Expect to have to ask for everything in the restaurants, water etc, and your room service orders to be incorrect and the food cold.

Stay here, and you'll be looking at the Opera House from your balcony. Not only that, but you'll be steps away from great restaurants and bars, shopping, and many of the city's major attractions. You'll have a wonderfully appointed room with everything just where it should be, a well-stocked minibar, and a comfortable bed. Venture to the roof and you'll find a pool area where you can order drinks and food from room service and relax. The concierge was helpful in showing us where to go and what to do. We made reservations at Aria for our last night in Sydney. When we sat down, the waiter brought over complimentary champagne since we had booked through the Park Hyatt, which was a really nice touch. Made me wish I had made all of my reservations through the hotel! The pool area is very pleasant. Unfortunately, the hot tub wasn't very warm - but everything else was nice. We didn't eat at the hotel, but the restaurant and bar areas looked nice, too. Overall, a very nice hotel with everything you need to be comfortable. As others have mentioned, it does feel a it more businessy than leisurely. I can't really put a finger on it - everyone was very cordial and pleasant, but it just didn't have that warm feeling that other hotels of this caliber I've stayed at have. But then again, it is a city hotel. As for the city itself - definitely a nice place. Very liveable, actually. We were there in mid-Sept., so the days were mostly warm and the nights cool. We did the Bridge Climb (steps from the hotel and a fun, if time-consuming, activity), the Opera House tour, a speedboat tour on the Harbour, Sydney Tower (avoid this one - it's a huge tourist trap), Darling Harbour (good nightlife and restaurants - we had dinner at the very nice Indian restaurant Zaafran), and the Zoo (quick ferry ride away). We skipped Bondi beach since the weather was a bit cool. Also recommended - Pancakes on the Rocks - a 24-hour pancake restaurant with numerous delicious choices. But here's the bottom line. Without a doubt, the Park Hyatt is definitely nice. Best hotel in Sydney? Probably. Would I stay here again? Sure. Would I pay full price? Probably not. While I haven't stayed elsewhere in the city, there are many nice hotels in the area with far more reasonable rates. Although the hotel and staff was pleasant in every way, the very fact that it's in the city and that there are many options to chose from would probably prevent me from paying what I feel are very high rates.

We could not have been more satisfied with our stay at either location, but our Sydney stay was especially magical. I will say up front that I am a Hyatt Gold Passport Diamond member, so I received amenities that others may not (free breakfast, room upgrades, etc.) and was able to stay for free due to a Hyatt promotion. Obviously, any value oriented questions about our stay will be greatly distorted because we stayed, basically, for free, but that should not detract from the level of service and accommodation we received, nor the stunning views. We were a party of four and we had reserved two rooms, which they were able to get adjoining for us. Both modern rooms were exceptionally spacious, with huge, walk-in closets and enormous, marble bathrooms with separate tub and shower. Butler service is provided for every room and he was extremely gracious, bringing cookies, fruit and M&M's each day without our asking. The lighting was perfect and able to be dimmed throughout, and the drapes were linked to a remote control for opening and closing. Obviously, any guest staying at this hotel is going to request (insist?) on a room with an Opera House view, which cannot be accommodated in all cases. Ours were in between; they had a view of the structure from our balcony, if we stood to the right and looked out to our left. We could not see the Opera House from our beds, or anywhere inside the room, but the city views we had, in addition to the ability to see the Opera House, made it quite nice. We ate breakfast in the main restaurant every day and the food was wonderful, if expensive for paying guests. Almost all the tables look out to the Opera House and it a quite a lovely sight first thing in the morning. Ate at the Little Kitchen one evening and really enjoyed the food there, as well. Less expensive than the main restaurant and same high quality ingredients. All in all, we felt very pampered during out visit and we would not have changed a thing.

The experience was so positive that, after benefiting from countless TA reviews but always never getting around to reciprocating, I am finally doing my first review. I have coveted staying at this hotel for many years but it's not exactly within our usual price range. If I couldn't hide out in the Maldives or Morocco for a big birthday, then staying overnight somewhere special in our own home town would have to do. I really didn't expect, though, for the reality to fully live up to the \"dream\" or the hype or even the cost, but thankfully I was wrong. Maybe it helped that it was a quiet time of year, or that I wasn't jetlagged, or the complimentary bottle of sparkling wine that was delivered to our room after the concierge learned of our special occasion, or the late check out. One can also become fairly blase about an icon such as the Sydney Opera House when it's in your own backyard, so to speak. But at the opening of the remote controlled curtains of our Opera View Room, the Opera House looked sensational and new. The staff at the Park Hyatt were also among the friendliest I have experienced, impressing as quite genuine in their attentiveness and care. Alex in the Club Bar, and Ronnie, one of our concierges, were particularly helpful and friendly. The only negative to the night also ended up with a positive. We decided to dine in our room to get every cent's worth of our stay and the view. The cost of the meal was waivered, unsolicited by us, when one of the steaks was not cooked quite to our original request. Overall, the hotel is at the high end of the Sydney price range and, of course, we deserved to get what we paid for - it was just very nice indeed to actually have that outcome.

My wife and I stayed at the hotel for one night in March 2010 and the only thing which was well below expectations was the availability of our room on check-in. Normal check-in is quoted as 2pm and I requested early check-in on our reservation. Despite this (and the Hyatt claim of 'expedited check-in' for Platinum members), our room wasn't available until 4.45pm and we both felt that the receptionist had a slight tone of false sincerity when dealing with us. I felt this was pretty poor for a top-end hotel - we ended up having to rush to get ready to go out for a function (we had a taxi booked for 5.30pm), when we were expecting a relaxed afternoon in our room.

On one hand the hotel is fantastic and on the other hand I think it is really overpriced. I want to be fair to the hotel and at the same time I am thinking of the traveller coming to stay here and spending a fortune and then discovering for the price, it is not actually that great value. So if money is no object, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, spending the asking price and expecting something out of this world, then you may be a little dissapointed. Everything about this hotel was very professional. The valet parking was a breeze and the check in was as others already mentioned very, very professional and courteous. We were invited to sit down at a desk during the check in and that was a very pleasant first impression. Once check in was completed, the same receptionist who checked us in took us all the way to the room and she showed us how to operate the curtains (there is a remote control for closing and opening the curtains), and she also gave usa mini tour of the room (showed us where the aircon was located, the minibar, about the spa, etc,etc). Our only dissapointment was when she told us the outdoor pool was closing at sunset and of course we arrived after the sunset. Nevertheless we went to the pool the following morning and we were once again pleasantly impressed to see the place was clean and the pool was heated and you could just walk straight into it. There were also plenty of towels by the pool. The room was nice with a nice bath and lots of shampoos, and bath salts and bath robes and slippers. There were some minor stains on one of the leather couches and you could tell the housekeeping tried to rub them off unsuccessfully. Me mentioning this may seem a little pitiful but I am only mentioning this for those who may choose to spend the extra money expecting everything to be absolutely impecable. It's not impecable but it's probably as close to impecable as you can get. A few other nice touches were the complimentary fruit bowl, the two complimentary bottles of water on the bed side tables, and the free drinks voucher. Also the welcoming hand written note from the manager was a nice touch as well. The food in the restaurant was nice and not too over priced. Oh yeah, our room (125) did not have a full view of the Sydney Opera House. You can only see it from the balcony but not from inside the room, which leads me to believe not all rooms have a view of the Sydney Opera House but all balconies do. The staff was very polite and very accomodating and they extended our checkout time past their normal check out time without any problems at all. Checkout was also a breeze and there was another separate desk dedicated to the checkout. Arghhh...

Registration is a personalized affair similar to Park Hyatt Tokyo, completed while sitting in front of a receptionist behind a desk. Everyone I initially encountered was very obliging and friendly. Accommodations: I stayed five nights in a king \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Opera House view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. Like all Park Hyatt properties, the rooms are sparsely decorated but immaculate. The bathroom was very spacious with both a stand-up shower and separate large bath tub. A light bulb was out above the mirror (no big deal, it happens) and a simple phone call corrected this in minutes. The walk-in closet was more than adequate for the needs of a single traveler and the bed was perfect. I would have preferred some outdoor lighting on the balcony but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being picky here to be sure, overall the room was excellent. The pool and spa are a bit small, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a smaller hotel so this makes sense. Dining: I ate 3-4 times in the Harbor Kitchen and Bar/Little Kitchen. Although they are advertised separately on the website they are essentially served by the same kitchen just on different sides of the same room, one being more formal (Kitchen & Bar) and the other less so (Little Kitchen). Food was excellent and had service to match. I decided to try the afternoon tea (which usually requires 24-hour reservations), was seated the same day, and enjoyed the experience at a window seat. Room service was also five-star quality. Location: Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat, to be honest. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying under one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most iconic structures (Harbor Bridge) while overlooking another (Opera House). The ferries and tram system are a 5-10 minute walk away, as is the Rocks neighborhood with all of its shops and restaurants. Campbell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s storehouses are within sight of the harbor entrance and house a number of varying restaurants. Service: So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4:30 in the morning the day my flight leaves and I decide to check my flight time on the business center\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complimentary computers before leaving for a run around Hyde Park. My key card did not allow access in the center (one of the few missteps of my five day stay) but one of the staff noticed me struggling with this and because he recognized me from earlier in the week (itself an impressive feat) ushered me into the center and apologized for the inconvenience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is there anything else I can do for you sir?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This level of attention to detail was seen consistently through my time at the hotel. Cost: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still difficult for me to rationalize how much these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experiences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cost, but keep in mind the following: you are staying in one of the most expensive, international cities in the world that functions as a gateway to a very desirable country/continent for even casual travelers and the hotel overlooks an iconic World Heritage Site (see picture taken from my balcony). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not cheap.

The Hyatt thoughtfully installed double doors on their balconies which cancel out any outside noise. Food and room service at the hotel were stellar, but expensive.

This hotel should really be in a category by itself because of the unique location in the rocks and exceptional service. Yes it's expensive as other reviews have noted. But this hotel delivers for the money. It's worth staying a shorter time to stay at this property. We returned after an almost 8 year absence wondering if the hotel would be able to match our memories from before and it did. As other reviews have noted, it's well worth paying the extra money for an opera deluxe room open floor plan suite (750 sq ft) as the view and space are magical. The beds are ultra comfortable, the bathroom will match the best bathroom anywhere and the living and work space are well thought out. You feel like you can reach out and touch the boats on the harbor from the rooms. This is one of the few modern five star hotels left that operates in the traditional customer service of years past. We were greeted by the very capable Leigh Shepheard at check in and we found all of the departments to be excellent including the bell desk (Shawno) reception (Renato) room service (too many great people to list) etc.. When you phone for anything, housekeeping, bell desk, room service, etc the staff reacts quickly and tries to over anticipate needs. Our average wait for room service was less than 20 minutes, even on Christmas Day. It reminded my husband and me of visits to Claridges in London where they must somehow keep a list of requests from visitors. The hotel staff will even do completely unexpected touches as when my son somehow misplaced a stuffed animal given to him for Christmas - Hans arranged to surprise him with a special \"park hyatt bear\" etc.. The hotel gave us lovely home made delicious cookies for Christmas Day and boxing day etc... The Park Hyatt Sydney does not nickel and dime guests like so many hotels. Guests may use the fast four computers in the business center without a charge. They don't charge an extra service charge for room service delivery and don't force gratuity or tips ever. It's a standard two full housekeeping services a day as well as bottled water by the bedside, ice bucket filled - even champagne, water, and wine glasses changed daily. It's a very luxurious feeling to be a guest in the hotel. The hotel is small and well sound proofed. We never heard other guests or outside noise even though the hotel is located on a very busy and noisy part of the city. My family disagrees with some of the recent trip advisor reviews of the food and/or ambience in the hotel. We ate two of three meals daily using room service, the harbourkitchen and the harbourbar (serves a lighter menu) and found the food and service to be consistently superb. In fact we had friends from Sydney dine with us on several occasions and all felt that the harbourkitchen was a secret find. It's a fabulous place to be at night but still welcoming to families. They offer a discounted lunch on weekdays that includes a glass of wine and valet parking for $39. Given how expensive Sydney's main restaurants are right now for Americans we found this to be a terrific bargain and an easy way for our friends to visit us. The harbourkitchen has modern doors that lift to the ceiling so most days you are literally on the harbor. Even if you aren't staying at the hotel it's worth a visit to eat or have a drink. We also disagree with some of the comments about the health club, pool, and spa. This is a small hotel so we wouldn't expect a large gym. The gym had a variety of exercise equipment including a complete set free weights, bars, and balls with a lovely view of the harbor. It's identical to the gym at the Ritz Carlton on Central Park and appropriate for this size hotel. Very few hotels in Sydney have a pool yet alone one that is outdoors. We did try a service at the spa and found it to be lovely. Another secret of this hotel is that it houses one of the best concierge teams worldwide. We found the concierge to be very useful organizing a decorated Christmas tree in our room, water taxis, car service, appropriate restaurants to take our kindergarten age son, a pirate ship dinner on the harbor, to helping us figure out the right shows and seats at the Opera House, etc... On several occasions we phoned them last minute from a day trip for help with directions, ferry times, New Year's eve venues or reservations. One night (boxing day) they were able to help us secure a coveted reservation dining literally on the sand at Le Kiosk on Shelley Beach in Manly when we spontaneously jumped on a Ferry. Chris, who manages the concierge team, had emailed us restaurant and dining lists prior to our trip and we found all of the recommendations to be on point for our family. We loved our visit to Sydney so much that we ended up staying over New Year's Eve to watch the fireworks from the Opera House party. Because the Park Hyatt was fully booked (New Year's is booked often a year or two in advance) we had to move to another hotel. The entire time we kept wishing that we were still at the Park Hyatt. Really - nothing else in Sydney compares to this property. There are lovely business hotels that have harbor views that are less money, but they aren't the same. A stay in an Opera View Deluxe Room at this hotel should be on everyone's bucket list.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brussels", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "idlBrussels", "ReviewID": "UR52829174", "Content": "we stayed for 6 nights with the whole family (4 kids age 10,14,16,17) in 1 opera Deluxe and 2 standard rooms. it is worth going for the Opera Deluxe rooms , what a view!

We were met by the hotel's friendly driver (pick-up by luxury limo is an optional extra) and with minimal fuss were on our way to the Park Hyatt Hotel . The driver called ahead, so that when we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by name, taken through the speedy check-in process and shown to our room (where our luggage was already waiting) by a friendly receptionist. And yes, our room really was available at 8am! We booked a Opera Delux King but it was worth every cent. For AUD 1115 per night (including breakfast) you get plan studio suites with stylish uncluttered surrounding including a living room, bar and work area. Floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors open out onto two private balconies overlooking Sydney Harbour and the Opera House. There is a separate bathroom and walk-in wardrobe. The two sets of curtains (voils and blackout) at the windows are operated by remote control, so you can lie in bed and watch the sun rise. Magnificent. There are so many other restaurants around the historic Rock district where the hotel is located that we tended to eat out save for breakfast and a midnight feast in our room after the opera (the room service was great). The hotel staff were very friendly and anticipated every need. I happened to come back to the room while one of the team was refilling the mini bar. He asked me if I would like him to clear some space in the mini bar for our own bottles of champagne, and when I said yes that would be nice, we planned on having a bottle when we returned from the Bridge Climb later in the afternoon, he promptly arranged for an ice bucket and glasses to be waiting for us when we returned. Lovely. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT: The rooms would benefit from the addition of a docking station for an ipod / iphone / MP3 player. OTHER: Just one thing to be aware of. The small hotel pool is located on the roof and suffers from the noise of the long term repainting work being done of Sydney Harbour Bridge. Not a major factor, just a minor irritation.

The Opera House view was uninterrupted, it's viewing made easier by the remote controlled curtains, and the facilities were certainly of a high standard. Bed was big and comfortable, walk-in wardrobe meant it was easy to keep room tidy and the flat screen TV would be fine for anyone who should want to sit in and watch it! In the bathroom the shower pressure was good and the bath was deep yet filled quickly. I'm generally not a fan of hotel toiletries but quite liked those supplied here! We had breakfast included and certainly made the most of it: a superb spread of continental-style options, with particularly delicious fresh fruit, and a menu with the usual suspects such as eggs benedict, pancakes and smoked salmon bagel, all served to perfection. Our main disappointment was breakfast on the Saturday morning with a packed dining room, including walk-in diners. The service, having been excellent all week, was now appallingly slow and even though the staff were very apologetic we left unimpressed (still having had a good feed!) We didn't eat any other meals in the hotel due to the large selection of other restaurants in Sydney to enjoy. The location was perfect not only for the views but also accessibility to the main tourist spots. Being only a few minutes walk from Circular Quay where the ferries go to several areas of interest, and a train station, it's easy to get anywhere you might want to go! There was free internet in the 24hour business centre that was never busy but a charge for Wi-Fi. We didn't use the gym or rooftop pool (the weather being a little undesirable for outdoor swimming) but had a look. Both are quite small and would be busy with more than 3 people.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at the Four Season and Shangri La in Sydney for business on many occasions, however for a long weekend, I travelled with my wife for her birthday and wanted the best. And the best is what I got. The price tag for a weekend at Park Hyatt is expensive but the service and the view is exceptional. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff were always present. The Bellmen were friendly, welcomed us warmly and ushered us to the reception desk. I had booked a Opera room but due to arriving early, the room was not ready, but instead of being asked to come back later, we were taken to the harbour with beautiful view of the Opera house for a complimentary drink while we waited for our room. In no time at all were collected from the Harbour bar and escort to the room by the Duty Manager, Andrew, and in my opinion, is an asset to the industry. He catered for everything from restaurant advice to shopping for my wife during the walk to the room. His recommendation for dinner for my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Birthday was superb. We went with his advice and chose \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEst.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the Establishment hotel which was beautiful, and the hotel even organised a table at the cocktail bar afterwards. My wife thoroughly enjoyed herself, the food was superb and although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to the cocktail bar it was a great example of providing additional services not just a dinner reservation. Upon returning to the hotel, we had a night cap at the beautiful Club bar, which is one of the best Hotel bars I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve visited, small, personalised and very comfortable. But what made the night, when we returned to the room, there was a cake, a bottle of wine and a card wishing my wife a happy birthday. The attention to detail offered here at the Park Hyatt should be an industry standard for 5 star hotels. Just phenomenal! The rooms are aged but maintained well and the amenities supplied were plentiful. The rooms are expensive compared to another hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in, however the personalised service offered at the Park Hyatt, and that unhindered view of the Opera House is worth every dollar. Congratulations to the management at the hotel, as the staff are the hotels greatest asset.

Either the previous reviews have never been anywhere outside Australia, or it is not the customers who are providing the reviews. There is a clear lack of interest by the staff which is not unusual for Sydney hospitality generally. Also there was a touch of arrogance on top of this which was noticeable. The breakfast was fair but no wow factor at all. Our toilet seat lid kept falling off in our room. There was definately no value with this stay and will not be going back. We wrote a letter to the hotel to state our disappoint and issues with a very flat response. The room itself was reasonable and the view and location pretty good, so if this is what you want then if you pay enough, which is too much, then you get it. My suggestion is to try the fourseasons.

The soundproofing of the rooms is excellent, but one curious feature is that the bathroom extractor fans do not turn off (they are not at all loud, but you know how it is when you notice a noise that will not go away). Management confirmed that this was a design feature. My other minor gripe with the room was that the internet service had to be paid for. For a property at this price-point, I consider this to be an unnecessary irritant - and Park Hyatts are not consistent in this regard. Breakfast (included in only some room rates) features a great selection, including many cooked-to-order items. Both hotel restaurants, situated with Opera House views, offer excellent quality of food and elegant presentation. On one occasion the lunchtime service was slow but it was a minor complaint and the place was busy. The hotel also has a cosy and comfortable whisky bar with an open fireplace (or at least my wife tells me it does - I was sufficiently sloshed not to remember). The Park Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spa is a little disappointing, being both tiny and disjointed. Showers are on one floor and the sauna and steam room on another, making it a bit of an effort to cool off afterwards. Bell boys are super friendly and very quick to help with taxis, luggage etc. With the exception of a dim receptionist who allocated us a room with an inferior balcony, when the next door room with a large one was vacant, the overall quality and friendliness of staff was excellent. If you are willing to swallow the expenditure, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find a better option in Sydney than the Park Hyatt.", "Date": "October 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Sussex", "Title": "\u201cDon't bother !

On arrival at Sydney we were advised the luggage was not on board. Imagine our horror in that we were arriving the evening of the 5th July to the Sydney Park Hyatt in clothes that we had worn for 2 days already. My wife Chrissy and I have nothing but admiration for everyone at the Park Hyatt in that we were greeted warmly and the Concierge Team of Cameron, Chris, Andrew & Patrick swung into action immediately day & night seemingly chasing our baggage through Qantas Baggage Services. All the way through our stay we were addressed with our names without prompting & after 4 days in Sydney my wife Chrissy was reunited with her luggage. Needless to say that the Concierge Team never gave up chasing my luggage & despite moving on to Lilianfels in the Blue Mountains for 2 nights & The Beach Club in Hamilton Island for 5 nights. On our return to the Park Hyatt we were greeted with an immediate update on my baggage status from Cameron in Concierge. Never before in our stays in hotels of all standing has my wife or I experienced customer satisfaction & attention to detail as shown by these guys. As to the hotel itself, the bell hops are very dutiful & attentive, greeting us by name on both initial greetings & subsequent greetings during the stay. They were very prepared to organise a taxi which was a past reviewers concern. Daniel on reception initially checked us in with a relaxed but efficient style that was very much appreciated after what we had endured the previous few days. We were shown to our Opera King Deluxe Room 212 which definitely had the wow factor, Daniel showed us round the room facilities finally retracting the main curtains and sheer drapes electronically revealling the signature view of the Opera House, fantastic. The bed must have been 7 foot wide & it was extremely comfortable, supportive & good for your back, it was without doubt best bed we had in Ozzie. It was nice to wake up, turn over & take in the view from the bed viewing through both patio doors as the Opera King Deluxe Rooms have 2 patio doors & balconies. Breakfast is taken in the main restaurant with views overlooking the Circular Quay & the Opera House, on weekends a buffet is provided, on weekdays hot meals are waiter service. A good choice is also available in cereals, fresh fruits, danish pastries, croissants & toasted bread of various kind plus cheeses & hams & fruit juices. Restaurant manager Lucinda oversees the restaurant extremely well catering both business people & holidaymakers. Lunch & Dinner in the hotel provide an excellent array of choices including vegetarian options which if for some reason other choices are required Lucinda or the Concierge Team are only too happy to discuss on your behalf with the chef. The rooftop pool in spring, summer & autumn time provides a pleasant location to cool down & unwind with bridge views, although in winter the temperatures may prove too challenging, it was for us anyway? The spa provides all year round facilities & is located in the roof top area. It should be appreciated that July 2007 has provided the coldest winter month for NSW & Queensland for many years, our time at Hamilton Island was affected by colder than usual weather also. General Manager Marlene Poynder can be congratulated for running an exceptional hotel; her management style certainly seems to get the best out of her management team & staff alike. She can be found most mornings in the breakfast room talking to clients & reviewing facilities, she is a lovely lady. Our time at the Sydney Park Hyatt was above expectation & on both stays in the holiday (we returned for 1 last night immediately before returning home); without doubt we would return to this hotel again when we are next in Sydney.

The bathroom was huge and had a separate bath and there was a sizeable walk in closet where I could hang up my wedding gown.

We first arrived late and tired after 24 hours travelling from the UK and were efficiently and courteously welcomed and shown to our room. Opening the curtains after dark showed why the Hyatt charges a premium, even for Sydney. We had a Opera King and right there in front of us was the floodlit Opera House, a fantastic view. The Hotel is well situated for most things you would want in Sydney and has all the right facilities - free internet (for first 30 mins although no one seemed to be checking) business like staff, a decent restaurant with great views etc, and the rooms are good sized and pretty well equipped. We ate there one night and the meal was pretty good, although there was a bit of a wait between courses. To the staff's credit they picked this up and offered us complementary wine. The buffet breakfast is a little thin for the price - we headed for the Gum Nut Cafe on the second day - much better! We left thinking it was close to a 5. However, when we returned, things were not so great. As we were only staying one night and had an early start we only booked a City/Harbour view room, but were horrified to find ourselves in a room at the far end of the hotel with a view of a tree and a cafe kitchen. We expressed our views to the reception person who said she would look into it. We felt that for a hotel that trades on views the lack of any view from this one should have attracted some reduction. After 20 minutes of no response we headed back to reception to try and track her down - and ended up being handled by the overall Room Director as the original receptionist seemed to have disappeared. He arranged for us to move to a more central room with a view of Circular Quay and admitted that the room we had originally been allocated was often heavily discounted and complained about. However, the service did not really improve as the original girl re-appeared and asked if we would be moving our own bags along - no offer of a bell boy. With hindsight (and denied by the Room Director) we believe we got the duff room as we were checking out very early (6.30 for a flight to Uluru) after just one night and it was also the Bridge Birthday weekend, but the room we were given certainly could not really be called a room with a view. Overall, the Hyatt has got a great location, good facilities, some good staff and a high level of style. However, it was all rather impersonal and business orientated which for a hotel right on Sydney Harbour was slightly at odds with the location etc. If you want the best views in Sydney, and go for a minimum of an Opera view room - you will be fine, if poor!

My husband is a Diamond Gold Passport member, so we used his points to get 2 rooms for the week. When we arrived, we were greeted by the door man, who was very nice! The woman who checked us in was great and even came to our rooms to show us around. She also included 2 Continental Breakfasts per room at no charge (a $160.00 AUD per day value) which we greatly appreciated. The rooms we had were on the first floor. For the Hyatt points the only choice was the City/Harbour views,which are beautiful, but one of our rooms also had a great view of the Opera House as well. The rooms are good sized with a large bathroom, and nicely decorated. As I was unpacking, I noticed the glass on the table next to the bed was VERY DIRTY with glass stains as well as some kind of sticky substance. This was also the case on the table next to the chair by the mirror, although this one was much dirtier! I cleaned the night stand table, but for curiosity, decided to not clean the table next to the chair. I wanted to see if the housekeeper in the morning cleaned it.. To our surprise she did not. This went on for several days. I told my family that the first housekeeper to clean this table we would give a $20 tip as well as inform the management of what a good employee this person was. Unfortunately, after 5 nights, no one did and my daughter could not take it any longer, so she cleaned it herself because she did not want it dirty when we celebrated New Year's Eve that night. The room service was great and the continental breakfast had a decent variety. The staff in the restaurant was hit and miss, however, there was one that especially terrific! We were lucky to get him as our waiter on New Years Eve Dinner! Also, one of the managers in the morning was great! We tried twice to have dinner at the hotel (not including New Years Eve), but one night no one would even acknowlege us (even after standing there for over 10 miuntes).On the night of the first of January, a nice woman greeted us . She told us that she did not have room in the restaurant, but if we did not mind waiting, we could have dinner in the bar. She told us to talk with the gentleman with dark black glassest there (she told us his name, but I can't remember it except that it started with a F). We approached him and when I repeated what she said, he RUDELY told us he had no room for us and tried to get us away from his area. On both of those nights we went to a nearby places to eat, which were EXCELLENT! Most dinners for five ran around $200AUD, but since the food was good, we did not mind spending the money. My daughter got sick one night and we called the hotel doctor. He recommended us to take her to a hospital called St Vincent. The only problem was that the hospital he told us to take her was for adults only (my husband told him she was ten years old). The hotel staff at the front desk, the door greeters, and the concierge were GREAT! Nicole the New Years Eve planner was wonderful! If you are in Sydney for New Years Eve, this is DEFINITELY the place to stay. The location is great!! We had dinner in the restaurant, which by the way was fantastic! After dinner we wanted to watch the 9pm fireworks, but were worried about the crowds, because the Rocks where the hotel is located is one of the best areas to see the fireworks. To our great surprise, the hotel blocks off the area in front of it to only hotel guests or people having dinner there. We had a fantastic view of the fireworks. It is so hard to describe how beautiful the fireworks were, especially the ones at midnightl. From the hotel, we were able to see the fireworks over Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, as well as fireworks coming from what appeared out of the buildings in downtown Sydney. If we came back here, I would stay for New Years whether we used Hyatt points or had to pay, because the experience is well worth it.

We have stayed in many stunning hotels, but there is something so captivating about this property, that although it is expensive, it is well worth the outlay. . Some years ago we were visiting Hawaii, and met some people that did a great deal of traveling for business. I remember being told that the Park Hyatt Sydney had a remote control to open the drapes while you were still in your bed. Crazy as it seems, that always stuck in my mind, and when we were going to be spending ten days in Sydney, I knew that was the place we had to stay. The Park Hyatt is in a great location in The Rocks area of Sydney. It is located right on the water of the harbor, positioned with perfect views of the Sydney Opera House, and walking distance to Circular Quay and most all points of interest. There are many fine restaurants just out the door facing the Quay. You will find restaurants serving everything from Italian, seafood, and Chinese food. No matter what you are looking for, this hotel is so convenient, it makes it the ultimate spot. The hotel is not a large one with just 160 rooms and suites ranging up to over 1200 square feet. The design of the building is curved, located at the edge of the Harbor Bridge. There is no doubt that it was shaped to fit into the scenery without being flashy. There is nothing about this hotel that is tasteless. It is simple elegance at its best. The lobby is total class! It is basically uncomplicated, all windows, marble floors and lovely artwork. It took just a short time to get checked in, as we were already reserved for 10 days. We had a standard room and were extraordinarily delighted with our accommodations. The room was about 450 square feet with a balcony overlooking the Quay and a pleasant panorama of the Opera House. The rooms are very luxurious with a king bed complete with all white linens, goose down duvet, and silk pillows and matching dust ruffle. It almost had an Egyptian feeling. The wall looking out on the deck is all glass. These are amazing because although it is quite busy in that area, you cannot hear a thing when the doors are closed. They are all double doors with double panes. Trust me, it is as quiet as you could imagine. We had a contemporary desk, large television, overstuffed chair, and Internet service in the room. Everything was simple and perfect. The closet was not just any closet, but probably the best one I have seen in a hotel. Not only was it a walk-in, but there were drawers, multiple shelves, and all kinds of places to put your things. The bathroom was very generous in size and amenities. It was all marble, had a glass shower, and a very big separate bathtub. The vanity was designed with two marble sinks and numerous drawers to stash all your cosmetics. Of course there was a hair dryer, plush robes, and tons of fluffy white towels. The amenities were the best lotions, shampoo, soaps, and of course even an emery board was included. Nothing was missing in this bathroom. The dining room is called The Harbor Kitchen And Bar. It has won many awards and the food is excellent. Everything is a la Carte, so it can get expensive. We ate breakfast there a few times, and dinner a couple of nights, but there are so many places to eat in Sydney we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to just eat at the hotel. One very interesting thing about this dining room is it is right on the waterfront. Again, the glass theme continues, and the windows actually pull up so you have a feeling of being outdoors. There is also an intimate bar on the main floor. There is an excellent exercise facility, and the pool is on the roof. We enjoyed going to the pool, as it was usually not crowded and very cozy. You had the feeling you were in a place that few had visited. I love this hotel, and actually hated to leave. I find that this is the benchmark of all hotels we stay in. Although I have stayed in some that are fancier, this one takes the cake for class, but not snobby. The staff is friendly and we felt we were not so much in a hotel, but a home.

I would however also recommend that you have some confirmation of your reservation, room setup & view(note: rooms at the back of the hotel don't appear to have any view).", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cmemorable weekend\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5373313", "Content": "We had a delightful time being tourists in our own town with a weekend stay at this lovely, low key hotel with stunning views and charming staff.

The staff were beyond helpful without being intimidating. The only thing that didnt live up to the standard of the hotel was the day spa. They seem to have squashed it into some poky little rooms.

The Rolling Stones had checked out a day or two before we arrived. Car transfer from airport worth every penny. The exterior of the hotel is low key almost to the point of dowdy; interiors understated, classy but a little faded. This Grande Dame could probably do with a bit of a makeover but the location is unbeatable and dripping in 'wow' factor. Our room had a direct view of the Opera House. Spacious and well-appointed with plenty of room for an extra single bed. Breakfast in the waterfront restaurant simple but delicious although at times the staff seemed to struggle a bit with the guest traffic (we were there over Easter and the hotel had full occupancy). A leisurely 20 minute stroll round to the Opera House and then on to The Botanic Gardens. 5 mins from Sydney Harbour Bridge. Ferries to the Zoo, Manly Beach and others en route to Opera House. Museum of Contemporay Arts (currently showing the Sam Taylor-Wood exhibition) a short stroll away. The Rocks market on a Saturday is behind the hotel. Fantastic bars and restaurants within moments of the front door. Rooftop pool small but perfectly formed and a great place for bat-spotting at dusk. Cannot recommend highly enough. May not apeal to high-fashion style seekers as low on glam factor but unbeatable choice for seeing the sights and very child friendly. Undeniably pricey. By the way, we did notice that there is a very good-looking Holiday Inn tucked in just behind the Park Hyatt - prob won't have the views but also a fantastic location for seeing all of the above and no doubt a lot less expensive.", "Date": "April 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocean Ridge, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFive Star View\u201d", "Author": "Rocket88", "ReviewID": "UR4717800", "Content": "We stayed at the Park Hyatt for 5 nights in March 2006 and here is what we observed: -There may be a nick or two in the furniture and it could use some exterior touch-up paint but make no mistake about it-this is truly a 5 star property. -The main reason you would stay here is the excellent location and the stunning knock-your-socks-off view of the harbour and Opera House. For this they get big bucks. But if you're not going to have a room with a view you would be better off staying somewhere else. -We stayed in balcony room 334 (top floor-level #4)and had a full straight-on view of the Opera House and a slightly-angled view of the downtown area. Most of the rooms to the left of room 333 (i.e. #332 down to about #300) have great city views but only a lateral view of the Opera House (everything over the hotel lobby is in this category) so if you want to sit on the balcony and take in the Opera House and the harbour views while having cocktails or pre-dinner snacks as we did every night you would have to lean over the railing and look sideways to see the Opera House. Rooms to the right of #335 down to around #354 have full Opera House views and partial bridge views but no city views. Rooms to the right of about #354 have only partial or no Opera House view. Rooms at the other end of the S-shaped hallway toward the bridge have Opera House views as well as bridge views. Then there are some rooms with just water views but without the Opera House or bridge or city. The rooms on floors 2 and 3 presumably would have the same setup but I didn't see them. The best thing to do is call the hotel directly on one of the \"dial around\" numbers like 1010987 and you can confirm for yourself the exact view of the rooms-it only costs about $2USD to talk for about 10 minutes. Don't waste your time calling the Hyatt toll-free central reservation number--they haven't the foggiest idea of the layout of the rooms or which way they face. The hotel's direct number from the US is 011-61-2-9256-1101. -Speaking of balconies, every third room facing the water has only a small semicircular balcony with no chairs or tables so if you plan on using the balcony on a regular basis you should consider the rooms with the larger balconies with furniture. Also, the top floor (level #4)balconies have a pergola-type overhang which lets rain and other things falling from the sky onto the balcony. If it's raining you couldn't use it and if it rains at night the chair cushions will be wet the next day. However, the balconies on the first and second floors (levels 2 and 3) have a fully-covered overhang from the balcony above. -The balcony rooms also have double sliding and locking glass doors which removes 100% of the noise of the harbour. -We arrived by cruise ship which docked at the overseas passenger terminal only a 3 minute walk away. I walked over to the hotel and got the bellman to come over in the hotel car to pick up our luggage and take it back to the hotel. -The hotel has a convenient location for many Sydney sights-10 minutes to the BridgeClimb office -5 minutes to the weekend market at The Rocks -20 minutes to the Opera House -10 minutes to Circular Quay -10 minutes to the Hero of Waterloo pub The congierge staff is first class-they can arrange the BridgeClimb or set up private tours to Hunter Valley or the Blue Mountains using their recommended guides and drivers. They will also make a heavy-duty electrical converter/adapter available for your appliances. -The only negative we found was the exorbitant price of breakfast. Easily to overcome-there are several sidewalk cafes in the Rocks and along Circular Quay that are a 5-10 minute walk away. Additionally, there are several lunch and dinner restaurants right outside the harbourside hotel entrance. -When going to the airport the hotel can set you up with their limo for $90 or you can just have them get a street taxi for about $40. -When checking in I asked for and received a further 10% senior citizens discount off the room rate. At these prices that paid for our wine tour to Hunter Valley. -In summary, this is all about location and 5 star views. I thought it was worth it.

It is the best positioned hotel in Sydney on the Opera House side. A real treat, though probably a one-off for a non-business traveller due to cost. The Views - be careful what room you get! This hotel's big selling point is its location off Circular Quay and the Opera House views. This was a special occasion and we wanted to be sure of a direct opera house view, so we booked (direct with the hotel) the \"guaranteed\" direct view of an \"opera deluxe king\". Unfortunately we arrived later than most and ended up with the poorest of that grade - and discovered that there are two \"bunches\" of this room grade in the hotel. The ones at the North end are the closest to the opera house and have the best and widest views often including the Harbour Bridge (PIC 1), but there are some at the other end, further away and whose views can (as we found) be partially obscured by visting yachts etc and other bits of the hotel (PIC 2). Sounds picky, but you pay through the nose for the view at this hotel, so make sure you hassle them for one at the north end! Thankfully, we were swapped to one at the North end after the first night. The rooms The rooms are absolutely fantastic with huge marble bathrooms, (good toiletries, bath and separate shower), and great entertainment system (Widescreen TV/DVD). The deluxe rooms also have a massive king bed which is extremely comfortable. Ours had the advantage of not having to get out of bed to see the Opera House at dawn (a must-do) Meals Food is excellent. The restaurant has the same great view, and the food was very good. Breakfast is superb - everything about it is superbly done, and the service was great. If you're a light eater at breakfast, you'll feel cheated - single items (eg if you wanted a glass of juice) were expensive, but the full buffet was around AUD$45 (\u00c2\u00a320-ish) which is cheap by London hotel standards. Room service was prompt and the food very good too. Swimming Pool There is a roof top pool, but frankly its too small to swim in ! Its pretty disappointing when you get up there and the view isn't as good as you think - the draw seems to be the jacuzzi on the roof which gives some kind of view, but that wasn't our cup of tea ! Service generally - Our one gripe.... Generally service was very good indeed - easily the best we experienced on our holiday. The concierge's desk in particular was excellent, whether it was stamps for postcards, couriering documents back to the UK, or just getting directions or a taxi. However, some of the front desk staff, in our view, need an attitude adjustment. Our inital request for a room change (above) was treated dismissively and unhelpfully by one front desk member, almost as if we were lucky to be staying at the hotel, rather than paying a hell of a lot of money for it. We were told that nothing could be done - very disappointing. Thankfully, in our case, the front of house manager sorted us out quite easily, suggesting that the problem was really one of attiutude and being bothered. Had we stayed in our \"old\" room, we would have had a very different feeling about our stay. Overall though, a very nice stay. Alternatives If you're after something at better value at Circular Quay and don't want to end up in a tower block like the Shangri-La or Intercontinental, the Quay Grand Suites {---} are often good value for a one-bed harbour view suite at about \u00c2\u00a3240 per night. We stayed there on a previous trip and thoroughly enjoyed being at the heart of activity at Circular Quay. If you're not worried about being on the Opera Harbour front, there are several good hotels at Darling Harbour (not as far away as you might think) which also have good views. We stayed 3 nights at the Four Points Sheraton in a Maritime Studio room for under \u00c2\u00a3420 for the whole stay inc breakfast - I've done a separate review of that. If we go back, we're staying there again, it really is superb - as good as the Park Hyatt for everything except a direct view of the opera house.
