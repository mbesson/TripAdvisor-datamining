The window ledge was covered, and the two beds nearest to it had dead bugs all over the pillows and blankets. The bathroom walls were coated in them, and showering meant having to attempt to spray them down with a lower water pressure shower head. ( = flies start flying everywhere, while you're naked. Terrifying). Now, the beds. Our 6 person room came with two pillows, one of which was covered in flies and covered in nasty yellow stains. The bunk beds were rickety, squeaked loudly, and DENTED in the middle. The mattresses were hard, and having a sunken in middle made sleeping nearly impossible. I thought staying here would be okay, seeing as we would be out all day anyway. I was wrong. The beds made it impossible to sleep and we woke up each morning exhausted and with back pain.

Toilet was smelly. Rooms are carpeted and this gives you the usual dusty and smelly carpets, if they are not properly maintained. Breakfast: essential, not much variety if you stay more than 1-2 nights. Firstly, I would like to say that I am not a person with a delicate stomach. Unfortunately, my friend and I ended up searching for a hotel at the very last minute and this one suited our budget. I didn't know what to expect from a 1 star hotel, however, in spending 97.50euros per night I'd expect something better. It is too much for the quality you get. The cost is only justified by the location, I believe. The photos on their website could date back to when the hotel was NEW, or perhaps they took photos from another hotel??. We stayed in room 17 (twin room with shared bathroom). There was hardly any space to move between the beds and in the room in general. There were clean towels and soap (squeeze bottle, which is hygenic enough). This was the only good point about the room. The hand wash basin seemed clean, but the glass shelf attached to the mirror had not been wiped. The duvets seemed clean. We didn't feel itchy or suspected there were any bugs, as you often read in other reviews. I found a hair after I first sat on the bed, but that could have been one of mine. The cupboard was about 50cm wide and there was just one hanger. The carpet was dusty and smelly. The smell was not pleasant but after a while in the room we got used to it! There was a small brand new LCD screen that really clashed with the rest of the room. It was only possible to listen to the music played by the hotel staff (I assumed). No remote control in sight, couldn't figure out if it was meant to be a TV. The toilet was right next to us and was always smelly. They put a deodorant spray bottle, that we used all the times when going in. Initially I thought that perhaps the staff only cleaned once a day and the rest of the day the toilet could be left dirty by the customers. However, after 2-3 days, the smell was always the same, which told me there was something chronic about that toilet. I wiped an antibacterial tissue on the toilet seat every time before using it. The shower was also average. Hair left by previous users didn't make it showering in there a nice experience. The staff was always friendly. There are 3 computers that can be used for free 24 hours. That's another good point. They also have 2 types of good free city maps, and all sorts of brochures. The breakfast room is not the usual breakfast room you may expect in a hotel. It does not look like the one in the photos (I didn't see any romantic fireplace, plants, etc). It consists of a few tables (no cloth) and chairs on either side of the reception desk. They give you the usual butter, jam, bread slices, cheese slices and ham, tea and coffee, pineapple and orange juice (which tasted as if water had been added into them), serviettes. That's it. There is a toaster and a sandwich maker. If you try to take food away (as in a takeaway sandwich) there is a fine of 20euros. Initially, we looked for a place that was in between the city centre oval and the museum area, so this seemed a good area. The location is good because it is close to the Heineken Brewery, Leidseplein, Albert Cuypstraat market and a short walk to the Munttoren (Minttower, Flower Market). However, as we learned after booking, with a transport card (7.50 for 24 hours, 11.00 for 48 hours, etc) you could really book anywhere around the city, finding affordable renovated (=clean??) hotels in a nice residential area such as around Vondelpark and Museuumplein, thus avoiding both the 5% city tax that you pay if you stay within the canal circles and possibly shabby places like the Sphinx Hotel. Finally, I can confirm that NO, we did not see any mice in our room, even if I was thrilled at the idea! However, in the morning of the 3rd day, a couple of Spanish girls complained that they had found food packages chewed and they suspected there were mice. The only thing the girl at the reception commented was: YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE FOOD IN YOUR ROOMS! That's right! How about: We shall DISINFEST ASAP? I believe we did not see any mice because we were on the 4th (last) floor and they might not get that high up. On the other hand, the stairs were unbelievably steep and 4 floors were a killer to climb twice a day. However, this seems to be a common feauture of Amsterdam old buildings, so no point in complaining. But if you really wish to stay at this hotel, remember: lower floors = risk of mice; higher floors = steep climibing. We only had hand luggage, luckily. And remember to bring downstairs your own rubbish upon checking out, thanks!", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHOTEL FROM HELL-HOTEL SPHINX AMSTERDAM\u201d", "Author": "neil s", "ReviewID": "UR116665223", "Content": "I stayed there back in 1997 and it was a nice hotel, sadly my image of the hotel was from that time and I made the big mistake of not reading other peoples reviews of the hotel. the hotel should be renamed HOTEL STINX. its nothing more than a 1 star hostel and 1 star is being generous. rooms are small and shabby- shower door came off when my wife was using it, drawers broken on bedside cabinet. single wardrobe in a double room. room had not ben cleaned and we had toask for clean towels as they had not been changed, breakfast was DIY toasties, sorry looking cheese and ham in plastic boxes and tea/coffee in flasks. we were charged 500 euros for 5 nights, in hindsight we should have left and gone elsewhere but we would have lost some monies in cancellation charges, but some money would have been better than staying the full term. we also had to pay 5 euros for a pass key. safe was broken in room so we had to lock valuables in case.

The bathroom was a shared one, but was exceptionally unsanitory. Some other guests locked themselves out, so they spent the entire night ringing the buzzer to be let in. However, the receptionist had secretly snuck out for the night, so he was not there to let the guests in! In the end, I had to get up, get dressed, and let these people in myself. Yes, this is the hotel where you have to pay to do the job of the staff ! Breakfast was disgusting, and we eventually demanded our money back, and checked into another hotel on the Rembrandtplein. Please be warned, this is a terrible hotel and should not be allowed to continue running. Even years later, the experience is unfortunately still with me.

Just so it would be easy to read I summed up all the negative and positive points of this hotel. Bad - 1. Deposite of 5 euros for the room key and the reception refuses to take your key when you leave for the day. A cheap way to make money if people lose the hotel key. Highly unprofessional. 2. 5% charge if you decide to pay for your stay by a credit card. 3. Extremely narrow, and I mean narrow staircases. Usually Dutch hotels have a pully for your luggage or staff to carry them. Sphinx does not. Be careful not to break your neck. P.S. No elevator. 4. We were never imformed that not every room has a shower and a toilet. So if you don't want to pay extra, you have to share a shower and a toilet with other occupants. 5. Rude staff. Very loud and obnoxoius.Talks in the backyard into the wee hours of the night. 6. Usually hotels give you leway during what time you can check in, this one didn't. Good points 1.

When we came in our suite the room looked big, nice, clean and the smal was that typical pleasent smal of a clean space.

When my friend and I arrived we had no idea what to expect and when the man at reception checked us into room 13 I nearly lost it. We climbed the very steep staircase to the 3rd floor (4 in all) and opened our door, which took a little time becuase the magnetic strip keys are old, and to our relief the room was very clean, tiddy, and smelled great. We stayed for 5 nights and never had a problem. I'm not trying to say that this hotel is like staying at the Ritz or Hilton, but you definetly get your money's worth. A few things to take into concideration: the stairs(not a good idea for the elderly), the locks(be patient,they will work), breakfast(eat out), the shower(down the hall, bring your flip flops), the rooms(small yet a perfect base of operations for planning all of your misadventures in the greatest city in the world), the beds(clean and useful). All in all, if you want to hang out in your hotel room all day and think of stuff to complain about you shouldn't stay here(c'mon, it's a 2 star hotel).

The staff was equally as bad, often they were rude, unhelpful & at times aggressive (mainly the manager). My experience of this hotel was that the manager just wants your money no matter what, we paid on arrival for the room in cash however the manager felt it necessary to debit money from my credit card even though we had paid in full in cash!
