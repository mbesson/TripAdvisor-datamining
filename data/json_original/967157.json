Our stay was dependant upon a fragile elevator which did not go to the 4th floor, only the 3rd.

Top floor walls sloped inwards taking away from floor area and making entry into the king sized bed a bit difficult (watch you don't bump your head on the exposed beams). In the room was an oversized leather chair and ottoman which was tucked into a corner with no lights making it somewhat dark and uncomfortable for reading. On the plus side the bed was very comfortable and the window in the room opened up outwards allowing for some evening ventilation into the room. Downstairs in the lobby is a breakfast served from 730am till 1000am every day (well worth having). Also, there is included free tea and coffee from the bar (24 hrs.).

This did not look like any pictures of rooms that I saw. it also said there was a safe. We searched and never found one. For $186 a night, this was a joke. The bed was a double thank goodness. There was a rolling closet but it could not hold much. We will not even talk about how small the bathrooms are. Lets just say we were glad we stayed out really late so we could just come home and sleep. We left the next day at 5am so overall it was only a place to crash and dash.

Next time we are visiting the hotel we are going to get a bigger room only because it would be nice just get a bit of leg room and to walk about the room a lot more.

Although the hotel is not right in the centre, this is good for sleep quality, the road is very quiet in the evening which is good considering the nightlife in the City. The rooms were quite small but perfectly formed making use of all available space (wall mounted TV). We had a shower room which was lovely and very stylish. The bed was very comfortable. There is not tea or coffee facilities, but you could get these free from the bar downstairs. A little annoying if you do not want to leave the room, but the quality of the coffee is better as they have a proper machine and don't use instant.....it just depends what your preference is, convenience or quality? A continental breakfast was included and the selection was very good indeed. A brilliant way to start your days activities! The bar was quite cool although pretty quiet when we went.

I scoured reviews and web sites looking for the perfect place to stay that also fit my aesthetic tastes and price range. Hotel V was the best option based on my parameters. It has a really lovely, modern, chic vibe and look. The staff are also so warm and wonderful with their assistance from dinner remmendations to ticket reservations. The location is perfect-- accessible to everything, especially by tram, which is right in front!-- and not too close to the busy tourist center for a tourist who likes to be away from the bustle moderately so. The breakfast and service are great; and the free coffee, cappuccino, and tea throughout the day is a wonderful touch. Now, to the room... I stayed in a double on the fourth floor to which you must take the stairs after taking the small lift to the third floor. It felt like a nestled attic or loft space, tastefully designed, BUT as most reviews have said, the rooms are small. As a solo traveler, that was bearable. However, I was displeased that there is no place for suitcases, which must lie on the floor; and the low (poor) lighting, which makes it difficult to see, especially in the bathroom; and the lack of a shower enclosure to a nicely tiled rainshower that gets the floor really wet. I was mopping (with extra towels) after each shower and tracking water into the bedroom- no fun. The windows could also use screens to keep mosquitoes at bay after the near daily rain that one can experience in AMS. So these are just areas for improvement, in my opinion. I really liked the hotel, its location, and vibe; I'm less superlative about the certain (key) aspects of the room- hence my review title.

We can't wait for a future trip and future stay! Overall, it's a very hip and trendy hotel and the staff are hip and trendy as well. First of all, their staff is the best ever! They greeted us every morning before breakfast (some by name), helped us plan our daily activities, made restaurant recommendations and dinner reservations, and would chat with us over the free hot drinks (hot chocolate, tea, latte, etc.) in the lobby before the end of the day. They know the city well and are truly passionate about helping visitors enjoy Amsterdam like the locals. The breakfast spread was great - wide range of choices and very delicious. We looked forward to breakfast! Coming to Amsterdam/Europe, we expected rooms to be small, which is why we upgraded to the XL room, which offered us a balcony and street view...The XL room had a very large comfy bed and great trendy decor, though the room was still small for the highest upgrade. The bathroom space was really small too - and we thought that for the price and size, Hotel V should at least offer more room amenities to compensate for the price (they offer shampoo, soap, and body wash only)...just a little suggestion. Hotel V is right across a tram stop (which you can hear throughout the day from your room, but it's no big deal and not a bothersome) and is located near some great attractions (like the museums, great restaurants, the Heineken Experience). Amsterdam is relatively small and we didn't even use the trams...we walked all over AND conveniently rented the bikes that the hotel offered. They offer free wifi as well as have two computers in the lobby. When hotels do this for free, that's always a plus. Also, they have multiple wifi signals so you'll always have a connection. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend staying at Hotel V. It's a great experience and we would definitely go back and stay at this Hotel on future trips.

The front desk staff is well informed and courteous, and took very good care of us. The rooms are small by American standards but are clean. Make sure you book your room with one of the packages, such as the museum package like we did. You get express entrance into two of the big venues, avoiding the hour plus wait in line, and at a significantly reduced price. The beds, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough; these were the best hotel beds I have ever stayed in, EXTREMELY comfortable! One challenge we had in the room was hot water; there is plenty of pressure, but the water wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as hot as some people like it.

There was even a music event on Sunday evening during my stay, with some performers, a band, poetry reading, and a large, young and vibrant crowd. Nevertheless, the quality of the rooms and the minimal service does not justify the prices of this hotel. I would have given a much more favourable review, especially considering all the above pros, if this was a budget hotel. Unfortunately, with these prices, what you get is budget services, for the price of a 4 star hotel. The rooms are extremely small, even if a larger room is requested. The normal/smaller rooms are tiny! There is hardly room to stand, and practically no room to open your suitcases. The layout of the rooms is also extremely unorthodox making the space feel even more confined. The bathrooms are claustrophobic and impractical. I personally am not bothered by loud noises, but if you wake up easily you can forget enjoying a good nights sleep: the tram stop right in front of the hotel means that you can hear the tram bells every 5-10 minutes throughout the night. And I am probably nitpicking now, but I had to raise an eyebrow with the floorplan around the hotel, especially the lobby area where there are several different floor levels, often with hidden steps, or with uneven, varied-sized stairs. I wonder how safe this layout can be, especially for older or handicapped guests. In a nutshell, if you can get this hotel for (much) less than 100 euros, or if the most important quality in a hotel for you is style and you don't care about anything else, go for it.

We booked this hotel having done some research on the location and on other peoples reviews and we were not at all disappointed. This hotel is beautifully designed and the reception/bar area is absolutely stunning. The hotel is located right next to the tram stop at Fredericksplein so it is very easy to get to the centre, it is also only a 10-15 minute walk to Dam Square and about a 10 minute walk to Rembrantplein depending which way you walk out of the hotel. As many of the reviews have stated the room sizes are very small. We booked standard rooms as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on spending much time in the rooms, they are perfectly adequate if you have a small case or rucksack that slips under the bed, but if you have a large case you may have to sleep with it in the bed as there is very little floor space!

The bed is one of the most comfortable I have slept in, had an amazing night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep in it, comfortable pillows and lovely soft linen. The rooms do not have air-conditioning, but this was not a problem for us, despite the fine weather. The rooms have black out blinds, fans and the windows do open. As the hotel is so near to the tram stop you can hear the bells from the trams but this did not interrupt my sleep. My room was in the back building which does not have a lift and has incredibly steep stairs; the hallways are painted black and metallic silver and give a very nice effect if you like modern design. The front building does have a lift so I would recommend you request this building if you have any sort of mobility problems. The breakfast was absolutely lovely, served until 11 at the weekend and 10 during the week. It is served in the bar area where there are plenty of tables, we never had trouble finding somewhere to sit. It is a continental breakfast but a very good spread, croissants, bread, rolls, cheese, cold meat, preserves, soft cheese, peanut butter, chocolate spread, fruit, cereal, boiled eggs, juice, coffee & tea (and probably more that I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall!). We were going to breakfast at 10.30 and the spread was always extensive and fresh. A perfect breakfast to start the day, I cannot see how anyone could complain! The reception has a fantastic feel to it, just stunning design. No shortage of places to sit. You get free hot drinks from the bar during the stay which is a nice touch. There are also two Mac computers in the reception with free internet and the hotel has free WIFI which they will give you the log in at check in. You must visit the bathrooms on the ground floor under the reception, the wallpaper is amazing. The staff give you a great map at check in which is really handy for recommendations of places to go during your stay. I would recommend this hotel if you like modern design and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend on doing anything other than sleeping in your room. The style is fantastic, location perfect to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Dam, I will definitely return to the V hotel next time I am in the Dam.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBoutique hotel with bulk quality\u201d", "Author": "JMal555", "ReviewID": "UR70630184", "Content": "I was recommended this hotel by my local friend, who lived close by. The hotel looked very nice in their website and since the location was good, I booked it. Thou the lobby looks nice and designed, that's where it ends. Here's a quick rundown of the hotel: - There is no A/C in the hotel anywhere which is a problem when the temp goes above +24c (as it did during my stay). One window opened about 30cm, but there is a tram stop outside the hotel and the trams ring bells when approaching the stop, so it will wake you up. - My room (302) had a double bed, and abou 80cm space around it, nothing else. If you have 1 or 2 big suitcases, there's no other space to open them up except the bed, on which you obviously can't keep them throughout the night - The blackout blinds are positioned so, that sunlight will shine between straight to your face when you're lying on the bed. One of the blind was very difficult get all the way down, as someone talented decorator had installed a coat hanger so that it blocks partially the blind. - There is no minibar in the room, nor there is no ice maker on the hallway. You can get ice from the hotel bar, but only in a very small ashtray type of dish. Forget ice buckets. - TV has basic channels only (about 30), PayTV did not work, Info screen did not work - Hotel room door uses a traditional key, that you need to use when entering the room, inside the room if you want to lock the door (as you do) and when leaving the room. There is no autolock. - Door handle came off on my hotel room door - Bathroom is quite nice and modern, but very small, only about 80cm x 150cm and there's no space to put your toiletries besides a very narrow shelf (5cm x 20cm) - Modest continental breakfast; 2 types of rolls, 2 types of croissants, 2 types of cereal, 2 types of coldcuts, cheeses, coffee, tea, and warm orange juice and warm milk. Not worth paying for if you think about booking it separately. - Hotel is in 2 different buildings and to get to the back building you need to go outside through inner courtyard. The back building has very narrow and very steep staircase to the extend that I would not recommend this hotel to anyone with even slight mobility issues. The steps were about 15cm wide and 25cm high, so it would be dangerous with children, elderly or with even minor issues with balance, fear of heights or lifting feet.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cCan't decide if I liked my stay and if I would go back\u201d", "Author": "ColumbusCompass", "ReviewID": "UR70474609", "Content": "Stayed in Hotel V for 2 nights in July. Mix of business and pleasure. Hotel V offers itself as a bit of a funky, modern hotel, which granted it was, however, I really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make my mind up if I enjoyed my stay. One key point to make, this hotel is not for anyone wheel chair bound or has a walking disability. There are high and low steps into and out of the rooms and into the bathrooms, the stairs are steep and I ended up tripping up in my room. It is a very strange layout indeed. The positive side Off the main areas of Amsterdam, it was fairly quiet. I had a room in the basement, facing away from the road so no traffic noise for me and could not hear anyone. There is a tram stop right outside the hotel. There is free internet access with a couple of Apple Mac\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, you get free tea and coffee from the bar during your stay and there is a happy hour in the bar from 6-7pm. This is bottled beer but all half price at 3.50 Euros for a bottle of beer. Staff were friendly and could not fault them. The shower was excellent with a decent hairdryer and towels with complimentary soaps and shower gels. There was a TV in the room as well. All keys are handed into reception when you go out and collected from reception as well. The negative side No aircon in room, so room was warm. I had a basement room facing towards the back which was not too bad but my colleague had a room on the 1st floor and it was awful. The room itself was pretty small and dark, in fact, so dark, the safe that was situated on the floor in the corner was useless as I could not even see the numbers to use it, let alone, get on my hands and knees to use the thing anyway. Bed was very soft and the pillows were pretty dreadful. The high steps into and out of the room were a pain, and the steps leading down from the bar / breakfast area to your seats are not safe as yet again, after you descend, you step up and down for no apparent reason. The breakfast was average, cereals, boiled eggs, range of breads and hams. There is no real kitchen area as such so they are limited to what they can serve. The positive side is there is a good selection of teas and they can make you coffee straight from the bar using a decent machine. I really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decide if I will stay again, I am due to go back to Amsterdam with work so will need access to hotels. The biggest benefit to me on this hotel is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location away from the majority of noise. How to get there. From Schipol airport, take the train at a cost of 4.20 Euros for a single trip from either platform 1 or 2. The train takes 15-20 mins to arrive in Amsterdam Central. From there, you have three choices. Walk Will take approx 30 mins and is fairly easy to do, but, depends upon your luggage and the heat of the day etc. Tram. I took a tram from the hotel to the station at a cost of 2.60 Euros for a single trip. There are two trams, 4 or 25. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if the same tram runs from the station to the stop at the hotel. It takes about 10 mins. If you have never used the tram before, you board at the back and you pay a ticket inspector as you board. Taxi Around 20 Euros for the trip. Note minimum cab fare in Amsterdam is 7.50 Euros.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, friendly staffs, comfortable bed...\u201d", "Author": "llng555", "ReviewID": "UR69079844", "Content": "This was my first time to Amsterdam and traveling alone to a new city in a totally different language can be quite adventurous. I took the train from the airport to Centraal Station and hopped on the #25 tram which takes you directly to the front of the hotel. The hotel have rooms in different buildings and mine was in the back of the main building. I was assigned a room on the second floor and the girl told me there was no lift. My jaws dropped and she immediately asked if I would need help with the luggage. Luckily I was smart to store part of my luggage in the airport or else I would need to carry over 30kg. However, with the offer, I gladly accepted it. As I walked through the black corridor in the back building, I saw a narrow and steep staircase with a turnabout. I felt bad for the guy who was going to bring my luggage up. Opening the door to my room, I was literally 2 steps away from the wash basin and a step to the right was the bed. The room was small, but it did fit the queen size bed. I was looking for the bathroom to find a hidden door next to the wash basin. As I pull open the door, the toilet facing the wall was merely 8 inches away and the shower area was an elbow apart. If you are over 6'3, this would be a really uncomfortable toilet. If you are claustrophobic, you cannot survive the bathroom. Other than the size, it was clean. The room does not have any coffee/tea or water. The bar area in the lobby offers free coffee/tea throughout the day. The staffs there are all multi-talented. The guy who brought my luggage up was also the bartender and occasionally a receptionist. Amsterdam is definitely a city to be seen by foot. There's a supermarket 2 blocks away from the hotel. Two of the sightseeing attractions are 5 minutes away (Heineken Brewery and the Albert-cuypt Market. The reception can provide you with the map of Amsterdam with all the attractions to be seen/visited, so no need to purchase one from the tourist information counter at the airport for 4 Euros. My booking included buffet breakfast daily. The buffet offering are mainly continental breakfast with some cold-cuts and boiled egg at its max. Anything additional will be charged. However, i find their offering to be very fresh daily. So really, no need for the extras.

It is not large or spacious but what does that matter when I was out and about seeing the sites? I always had a fresh supply of towels, hot water and a good night's rest with little noise.

Breakfast was great and the lounge/dining area is very posh and inviting. Right outside the hotel entrance is a conveniently located tram stop.

But if your stay involves needing anything more than that, I would not recommend this hotel. For all the chicness and professionalism that this hotel boasts, it's nothing more than a facade. Where do I begin: when we asked for directions, the hostess marked it incorrectly on the map, which caused us to bicker with the cab driver who insisted we had to pay more for getting lost. when we made it very clear that we had to have our dresses and suit for our wedding from the dry cleaners back on the same day and they said the dry cleaning comes back same day, they didn't have it until the next morning, which caused concern since we had to leave for the ceremony at 930am. When a dress strap needed to be taken in, it came back from the dry cleaners/tailor shortened, but twisted. When they charged my credit card twice, and I called them up to clear up the mistake, they told me they didn't have any record of it. They were looking it up based on the amount and not by the name on the card. Conclusion: This hotel is not worth the money one spends on a room. If you're going to spend this amount on a room, it should come with professional service not a headache. The staff should be trained to be specific and professional, and as you can clearly see they are completely unprofessional when you need anything outside of basic. It starts with poor communication and service from the staff trickling to whoever is doing their cleaning/tailoring. Maybe this was all bad timing and luck for their staff and perhaps what we were asking is not considered basic, but then one could argue that getting your suit cleaned the same day or as promised is a basic service whether for business or a wedding.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "maryland", "Title": "\u201cloved it\u201d", "Author": "travlermd", "ReviewID": "UR48941126", "Content": "The hotel V had a wonderful and very helpful staff.

I loved the lounge area as well as the delicious breakfast and very comfy bed. Room as well as bathroom are little, but have everything you might need for comfortable stay. Our room was located to the yard so it was quiet. Most flattering is the individual and friendly approach of the hotel staff .

The small radiator struggled inefficiently to warm up the room. We enjoyed the peace and calmness of our room until a neighbour room was occupied. One night, we were bothered by the noise of the next door opening and closing. The slamming of the next door was so loud and clear that we thought that somebody was invading our room! For sure, this is also a matter of personal behaviour and respect for your neighbours, especially in early morning hours. Staff was so friendly as every Dutch people we met during our stay. It consisted of young guys and girls, trully kind, english speaking and willing to help with exploring Amsterdam. Breakfast was good, with a normal number of choices. The buffet was refreshed regularly and we never missed something. Thus, everymorning, we were filled with all the required energy to explore this fantastic city! We were very satisfied by the cleanliness in the room and the hotel. The strongest part of the hotel is the lobby area. Perfect for relaxing by the fire, having a drink and people-watching. It's worth mentioning the very good music playing through the lobby's speakers. In general, we enjoyed our visit to this modern concept hotel that had been recently renovated. We enjoyed it because we were not looking for something typical or luxury. We would be coming back if we could have a better deal than the 159 Euros we payed per night (not including 5% tax). We think a better price would be around 100-110 Euros for a standard double (including taxes).

I have stayed in Amsterdam six times before and for ease (and less expense) try to stay as near to central station as possible! The problems started when our cab drivers didnt know where they were going, however the hotel being fairly new it was prob expected! There was 10 people in the party and two cabs cost us 40Euro. Upon entering the Hotel you are blown away by the modern way the decor is and how welcoming and friendly it looked! I was more than pleased even if I didnt have a clue where we were based! We got our 5 sets of keys and just picked them from the table randomly, the guy on reception didnt advise us as to how to get to our room and we had a bit of a run around looking for it...The lift struggles to fit 2 people over size 16 in it with luggage (alot of hilarity though for us still at this point!!). I was sharing with my gay friend and requested a twin room, we asked were it was and we were shown a seperate building down a ramp at the back of the main entrance area! The Bed appeared to be a small double but we soon discovered was 2 (small) singles pushed together. To emphasize the size of the rooms all i can say is if you are built like Kylie and staying in a double on your own you will be fine!!!! Absolutely beautiful decor but nowhere to put our cases, no mirror, no dressing table or drawers, the wardrobe was a recess in the wall with no hangers or shelves in it and a white curtain! The bathroom was even worse! There was a black plastic stool with 4 (equally small) towels and a hairdryer (the only normal sized thing in the place!!)placed on it, this prevented you being able to sit on the toilet! Once we had reasssembled our room so we could actually fit in it, going to the Loo still proved a chore asyou had to slide your legs under the sink to sit on it!!the shelf over the sink (presumably for your toileteries) was about 3 inch deep by 12 inch long! Just about held our toothbrushes and toothpaste!. The shower was really funky and based on a wetroom feel, again tiny and inappropriate as no door, so the whole bathroom got soaked (and anything you took in there too, which wud have to sit on the toilet seat!Yuk!) The windows were long sash ones and had black out blinds to pull down, if you didnt totally pull these down people checking in and having breaki could see you in bed! The blinds also let bright daylight in the sides defeating the object of them! The ramp outside the room was like decking and was on two long levels, you can imagine the noise from people arriving with cases, coming home after night out and staff back and too with trolleys of rubbish and laundry! Back to first night, we asked the lovely guy at reception how far we were from red light district, he told us approx 40min walk?!?!?The trams 25 and 7 stop outside but finish at 12.30am. We wanted water for our room and with it being midnight the bar was shut, we asked were we could get some refreshments (always available in red light area and surrounding) He looked quite perplexed as he told us it was 3 tram stops away?! And then he didnt know if it would be open!!! Two of the ladies with us were the Hens mother and Auntie and their room was a single (three quarter bed!) it was in the basement with tiny box windows atthe top of the walls and was even smaller than ours!! These ladies are touching 60 and were told in no uncertain terms that their rooms could not be changed (no apology!) They ended up topping and tailing!!! (bloody good job me and Christopher didnt end up in 007!!) The stairs everywere are extremely steep and usually spiral with no handrails. Second night we got back approx 10.30 and asked about any snacks, we were offered a choice of prepacked anchovy sarni, chorizo sarni or stilton pear and veg (??!!??) sarni! No ta! Ill eat most with the best of em but made do with a mini box of pringles!. Breakfast room was in the foyer on iron chairs and you have guessed it, tiny tables! Beautiful continental though and staff so lovely. I think this hotel has early teething probs and maybe should have concentrated on space rather than cowskin hide and pebbles, its extremely overpriced for the size of it and the location ( 104 shiny pounds per night!) maybe half ofthat price would be more suitable based on other hotels. Have stayed in all sorts from hostels to 5 star in The Dam but this is the first time I have felt compelled to write in! We made the most of it and came home shuntin sideways like crabs but would reccomend you to find somewhere nearer to town and bigger (unless your a size zero!!) will maybe laugh about it in a few week!!", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cQuirky and unique hotel, had a great stay\u201d", "Author": "InkwotaBeru", "ReviewID": "UR14527646", "Content": "Just returned from a 3 night stay at the V in Frederiksplein. I agree with InspectorBaggaley's review below. The hotel is well designed and quirky, with high quality finishes and fittings. It has some idiosyncrasies, but the great atmosphere and the friendly staff make you forget them. We really felt at home there and often hung out in the lobby by the fire, watching the world go by (the hotel faces a cafe/bar, a tram stop, and an ATM so is perfect for people-watching :) or using the free Internet terminals. Check out the hotel's website for a sample of the type of music that is always playing in the lobby. The hotel is about 10 mins by tram (No. 4 or 25) from the Centraal Station and the tram stops right in front of the property. Worth noting that the rooms come in Small, Standard, Large, and X Large; we stayed in an X Large room and it was reasonably-sized, although certainly not huge. It was snowing outside but with the radiator on full it was 20-21 degrees in the room, so not too bad, although it did feel chilly sometimes. Beds were fantastic. The buffet (continental) breakfast was of a good standard but worth arriving by 9am if you want the full choice, otherwise stocks of cheese and fruit tended to be running a bit low. The bathroom was cramped and no bath but had a gorgeous rain shower. The elevator is indeed tiny and only fit one person plus suitcase or two people without, but it's cute with its hairy tiles! Also the room numbers and the elevator floor numbers don't match - you push button \"0\" for the gound floor and \"1\" for the next floor up, but confusingly all the rooms on this floor \"1\" are numbered 200-something! Half-way through our stay the light in the elevator broke so it was then pitch dark inside, which was another unique experience! However, despite these quirks/teething troubles, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return to the V. If you're looking for a taste of Dutch design away from the craziness of the red light district/centre but within easy reach of the sights, we would definitely recommend this place!", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cCramped and Cold Rooms\u201d", "Author": "NZChef", "ReviewID": "UR14485275", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel when it had just opened and advertised being a four star design hotel, so we expected a funcky design, cool new clean rooms and nice bed.

The hotel is quite a way from the city centre, it took us about 20 mins to walk to Dam Square.

The staff were relatively pleasant, however my requests for an iron went unanswered and the room was only cleaned once in our 3 night stay. The 'breakfast' consists of bread, ham, cheese, jam, cold eggs and some mini pastries.
