When i went to get the key to the room and take care of everything the woman at the desk didnt even seem friendly like no greeting to the hotel what-so-ever. and not even a smile. The first night there we got settled some of the things they mentioned on the website was not what we paid for. For as much as they charge u to stay there, they should have everything updated not just the TV. the fridge is some small old looking thing under the sink, the stove is a mess only one eye clicks on. We had to switch from one room to another because the toilet in the first room didnt work. the second room the shower was toooooo hot u couldnt even adjust it to make it at least warm, you basically either froze or burned so we had to take a bath everyday since we were there. and you had to wait til the tub filled up just enough because the water came out pretty slow. then the craziness is that the bathroom is so small they couldnt fit the bathroom sink into it so its outside the bathroom in the kitchen area thats pretty nasty if u ask me. how can someone be cooking and another person brushing their teeth in the same area just dont mix. then there were ants on the stove and counter, they came out all of the sudden and thats nasty if ur trying to cook. i mean do they get exterminators in that place?. They mention on the website wifi, there was nooooooooooo wifi so why mention it on the site? the lady at the desk told me they were working on getting it and they dont have it. thats a inconvenience to people that might have work to do or whatever. There was no pool open on the site it says swimming pool, we seen that someone was cleaning it and then when we called the desk they said that it dont open until memorial day like what kind of mess is that, when u have people that travel to that area on vacation. Then my fiance had ants in her bed luckily we had a double bed room. the only good thing is that the a.c and the television thats it! im so mad that we spent our money on a hotel that we didnt even feel welcomed too or even accomondated as what we seen online. we dont like false advertising. we spent 300 and something dollars for 3 nights. You had young kids that were next door to us basically having a party and on the site there is no tolerance for noise after a certain time, and we heard noise all night til about 3 in the morning, like who patrols or where is the security there?. Our last night i went to the office to get some tissue or ask for it and the lady at the desk act like i was bothering her! her attitude was horrible and when we called about the ants she didnt really try to fix the issue, her attitude was the worst ever , all she said was the only thing she could do was maybe change our room, or if she had some bug spray she would come and spray it , like really?! it was the worst hotel we have ever been to, and we go to hotels all the time when we go away. We wasted no time on the check out day, i was up early packing because we had the worst time. we left way before 11 a.m...I thought hotels are supposed to make ur stay a great one, not one that we just couldnt wait to leave. just bad bad bad.

The room was very small and out dated. The bed was clean comfortable. I brought along extra sheets just in case and we used them for cover since I don't use the comforter at ANY hotel/motel. The room had a slight odor that smelled like smoking was permitted at some point although it was a non-smiking room. There was a pool there but we never used it. We were told that we could use it after hours as long as we were quiet. I thought that was cool and a little mad that I didn't take advantage of it. I also took along towels and washclothes from home and I am glad that I did. The towels there are so hard and thin. We pretty much just used them to dry our hands. LOL Like I said, we didn't expect too much because the room was less than other motels in the area so we weren't disappointed. I wouldn't want to stay there any longer than two nights. We would drive out car to the park and ride and ride the bus to the boardwalk (just $1/day!!!). That was very conveineint and allowed us to only drive our car about 10 miles the time we were there. If you are looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay with no frills, this is the place for you. It's old but it serves the purpose.

Both of these families had the nasty little laundry room held hostage for our entire stay. Oh ya, the washers and dryers have a sign on them that says they are for washing beach clothes only. There is a clothes iron in the laundry room tied to the wall, none in your room. Under the stairway landing there was a big turd and toilet paper that stayed there in plain view for 5 days.

Maybe not high for Ocean City, but way more expensive than it deserved. The room smelled like something had died in it. When I opened the refrigerator (which didn't work), I found the source of the smell. Nothing was in the fridge, but something must have been at one time. The bath towels were not much larger than hand towels, and the wash cloths felt like sandpaper. So, if you are trying to exfoliate, this might be your spot. Even though it was about 96 degrees outside, the air conditioner was not turned on when we checked in.
