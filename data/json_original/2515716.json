This was an ongoing issue the entire stay. Sometimes the keys would allow us onto the property, sometimes they wouldn't but almost never did the keys allow us to enter our room. After two failed attempts on the night of our check in, the overnight handyman had to let us in and even his master key failed to open our door at first. The next day, the whole issue started over again. The rooms themselves are nice, the air conditioning works, the beds are comfortable, nice large TV's in the room with mini-fridges and such, overall pretty typical for Fairfield Inn's. I am an elite member with Marriott and have a standing request for the highest room available but that wasn't honored on this trip. I was placed on the second of three floors in the facility but the second floor is actually street level so we had people looking in at us for our stay. I hate having to keep the black out curtains closed for the entire stay but that is what we eventually had to do. The location is nice and other than the key card issue the hotel is fine. The staff was pleasant and helpful enough and the rooms were clean and comfortable but the layout of the facility is very odd and confusing. The next time I'm in San Diego I'll probably search elsewhere for a place to stay but I wouldn't offer a strong recommendation against or for this hotel.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "reno", "Title": "\u201cStaff not helpful\u201d", "Author": "pickyreno", "ReviewID": "UR128149755", "Content": "It is in old town and across the street is a nice resturant.

I checked in on a friday night and my friend and I came back around 2-3am. We approached our room and started getting ready for bed. In our room, we heard banging on our wall from another room. We looked at each other in surprise and continued to get ready for bed. About 15 minutes later, we were already in bed and get a knock on the door from the security guard. The security guard basically talked down to me as if I was some punk trying to wreak havoc at the hotel and literally tells me that I am 'talking too loud.' Really?!?!? I wanted to ask him if I was making trouble anywhere in the hotel or running around and making noise, because I don't know what I was doing wrong. The loudest thing I could think that my friend and I could have done was just talk, but we were not screaming or laughing at all. But I decided to comply with whatever 'demands' he wanted from me because I already did not want trouble or get kicked out of the hotel. He really upseted me because I do not believe I had done anything wrong and he was being a complete jerk to me.

The location is terrific, as it is right off I-5 with immediate access to/from the freeway either north/southbound. The main part of Old Town is within a short walk. The hotel offers not only free airport shuttle, but also shuttle to/from Seaworld and SD Zoo. Free shuttle to Seaworld and Zoo has to be pretty rare for any of the area hotels, and it made things real convenient although the caveat is I believe they only offer one set dropoff/pickup times per day. Our room came with a wet bar (sink) and microwave/fridge. Not sure if every room comes with a wet bar, but I think there's microwave/fridge in every room. Of course, the Internet is free. The lobby area has two computers for guest use, as well as a color printer. I will say that the lobby computers were extremely slow. The free breakfast buffet was very good. As with all Fairfield Inn's, it had Jimmy Dean microwaveable sausage muffins. Also had cereals (good selection), fruits (limited selection), muffins/bread, yogurt and packaged cups of grapefruits and pineapples. Although there was no prepared hot food items on offer, I found the breakfast buffet to be still good. Coffee was terrible, though. The dining area in the lobby is modern-looking and nicely done. Very interesting layout. This place is made up of 4 different buildings, each with rooms that are accessed via interior corridor like most highrise hotels. But the buildings are connected via outdoor corridors like at motels, and some of the rooms are actually accessed from the outdoor part of the corridor. So there are some rooms here that have motel-like exterior access setup. The four buildings form an arc that surrounds a courtyard area which has nice tables, sofas to lounge in, as well as pool/spa. Our room was a 1-king facing the courtyard, and it was spacious. Looked like fairly new carpeting. The bed was a little soft, but the bedding was very comfortable. Nice towels, too. Overall the room felt very clean, although I still don't think that the housekeeping did such a great job of cleaning because I saw dust at the edges of the carpet along the wall. When this place is no longer new, the housekeeping will need to do a better job of upkeeping this place to keep it looking clean. One thing that's not free here (although typically free at other Fairfield Inns) is parking. It's $15/night to park underground in their gated garage. There's possible street parking nearby, but street parking near the hotel was completely occupied most nights that I was there. So I suggest you just suck it up and pay in their garage. One important thing to remember, though, is that this place has a very low garage clearance (6 feet).", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston Salem, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat place!\u201d", "Author": "Brenda M", "ReviewID": "UR125252067", "Content": "Only spent one night at this hotel as I was heading on down to San Ignacio for a trip to see the gray whales; however, the hotel certainly met all my expectations.
