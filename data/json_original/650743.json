Breakfast is coffee, cereal, and disgustingly sweet croissants served from 0730 to 0800 only. There is a 0100 curfew with no exceptions made for any reason. If you are not in the hotel by 0100, you are spending the night on the street. The owner was extremely rude to our group and left a horrible taste in our mouths of Roma hospitality. Although it is physically convenient to the main terminal, I would strongly suggest walking another block to another hotel.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cJust save yourself the drama and stay elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "Wanderplus", "ReviewID": "UR107462649", "Content": "This hotel was booked through the services at the train station. What a mistake this was. From day one, we were treated like criminals and just inconvenienced in general for the duration of our stay. Unbearable and unnecessary.

The rooms are just like they look on the hotels website, which is totally acceptable. Unfortunatly, nothing in them works. The safe did not work in any of the rooms, the TV did not work in my room and most of the bathrooms had a terrible stinch. When we complained about the problems, we got no help at all. They just said \"Thats how it is in all the rooms\" - Great, thanks for nothing! Furthermore the beds very terrible and the noise from the street was excessive, so avoid this hotel if you're actually the type who sleeps. The pricing is low and the rooms had a descent size. Therefore i give it the rating \"poor\" but its close to \"terrible\".", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deventer", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but that's about it.\u201d", "Author": "W_J_V", "ReviewID": "UR54673365", "Content": "Although Hotel Marisa has a good location, being next to Termini, for most rooms, that's where it ends. Very basic indeed. Very noisy as well, even at night. The beds are comfortable though. The TV only had Italian channels which was not too exciting. The guy who gave us our keys was a bit grumpy and the breakfast is quite awful. Best go somewhere else for that. The area it is in is full of beggars and homeless people, so you've got to watch out. Although in Rome you shouldn't idle in your room, it is very nice to get back to comfortable room after a long day of walking and sightseeing. This was not it. The elevator was usually broken so had to walk up about 3-4 flights of stairs before reaching the room. We did have a balcony, which was nice. All in all, only go here if you're on a budget and don't plan on spending too much time in your room. And all the other hotels are full.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201c3 Bad nights sleep\u201d", "Author": "JColemanUK", "ReviewID": "UR16522591", "Content": "What can I say.
