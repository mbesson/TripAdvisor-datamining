The room was large and the three of us fit there very comfortably. The staff was very friendly and helped us a lot with directions, top sites to see and food options. The breakfast every morning was delicious. All home made Mexican fare as well as cereal, fruits, yogurt. The family that runs the hotel were very warm and made us feel like we had a home not just a hotel. It was just a 10 minute walk to the beach which honestly felt like nothing at all because it was a really nice walk.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staten Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cBest value you will get in this area! Clean rooms, cheap.\u201d", "Author": "PinkNeve31", "ReviewID": "UR123576579", "Content": "Here's the deal: it's no fancy, beautiful hacienda, BUT talk about affordable and convenient. I went to Playa Del Carmen Mexico for the BPM music festival, which is one of the most popular events in the area, and we had a hard time finding ANY hotel availability, never mind deals. Hotel Plaza Playa is not loaded with amenities and it is far from scenic or dreamy, but it has what you need at an amazing rate. We booked on hotels.com for about $50 a night, during the most popular nights of the festival!! PROS: clean (towels, sheets, overall room), walking distance from prime party area (approx 10 blocks or so), friendly staff (extremely helpful, and bilingual), internet (not best connection, but fairly consistent), around the block from THE BEST taco spot \"El Fagon\" (recommended by all the locals) as well as La Mega (like Wal-Mart), elevator, close to public transport, balconies in most rooms (for smokers), plenty of parking, easy going staff (not all up in your business, trying to charge you for visitors (like hotels on the strip do), and generally safe (two single girls in our party, never had any issues walking alone late night). CONS: WORST shower I have ever had in my life (requires some kind of secret code of mechanics in order to get hot water), no safe, no room phones, no pool, no amenities, and construction going on across the street (while we were there). Also lengthy walk to beach, and everything scenic. If you are looking for a place to keep your stuff safe, and only utilize the room for sleeping and preparing to party then this is your best bet. It's not far from the strip, plenty of convenient shopping and transport, and best of all the price is low as can be for an area that is starting to bang out tourists for every single convenience.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merida, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGood mid priced property\u201d", "Author": "El-Yuca-Ingles", "ReviewID": "UR123309734", "Content": "We stayed one night here on business in early January. Mid priced hotel, clean rooms, good shower, comfortable beds. Included breakfast was good, with good choice and quantity. Only annoyance was that the wireless internet signal was only available in public areas of the hotel not in the rooms, meaning that to work, I had to lurk around the area near the elevators... which had seating, presumably for that purpose. Overall a good place to stay.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cI need hot water\u201d", "Author": "Dilatorre", "ReviewID": "UR123117080", "Content": "Well, for the price it's not bad. Great breakfast even though I was not even told we get one I just found out by chance. Service sucked.well it's Mexico right. Told the girl at the front desk I had NO hot water for the shower?? Got the oh not sure why we will look into it. Well no hot water for both nights. Safe did not work. Shower head for my cold shower did not work so I removed it with my pocket night and cleaned all the crap out of the head and cleaned the holes.well the shower was fixed but still cold. Great way to wake up. My room was big enough for two beds even had two head boards but only one bed that I needed to share with my son. Not what I wanted when I made the reservation but only two nights so I just dealt with it. In the morning I had a small puddle of water under the ac and told the receptionist , it got fixed because it did not leak the next night. Good parking in safe enclosed area.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Plaza Playa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1639253-Reviews-Hotel_Plaza_Playa-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$52 - $96*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Av 20 entre 25 y 30</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col.
