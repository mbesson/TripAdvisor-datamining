The gentlemen at the front desk were super helpful, they gave us a map and we used it, often. The location of the hotel is awesome. We walked about a block and were wondering where exactly the colesseum was and we looked up from the map and could see it down the street a ways, this hotel was pretty much in the middle of everything. We walked most everywhere except for the night of the game between Roma and Genoa, we took a tram, what a wonderful public transportation system they have, no shortage of transportations. I ate paninnis and pizza till I couldn't anymore and well gelato...I never knew how much I really liked it. I tried alot of flavors. We did a walking night tour around the city that turned out to be very interesting, hit most of the must see attractions.

The room was tiny and very dark as it overlooked a central light well but it was clean and quiet. Shower was lovely. Breakfast was what you should expect from a standard city hotel - scrabbled egg, sausage, bacon, selection of cereals, yoghurt, fruit. We also tried dinner at the restaurant and the food was good. Service though was odd and at times entertaining (poor waitress got a right earful at one point). There are some small things that let this hotel down which I often wouldn't bother to point out normally but feel like that it will explain my 3 stars. The pillows were rock hard which didn't make for a comfy sleep, no tea/coffee facilities in the room, the 2 English channels (CNN and BBC World news) had really bad reception making it difficult to watch. No I definitely do not go on holiday to watch tv but we both were quite ill the first couple of nights so was stuck in the room longer than we would have liked. No wifi in the room (but was available in reception for \u20ac6 3 hours).

But the location is excellent, the staff are friendly and professional, and they all seem to speak at least a little English. Breakfast was plentiful, although you might want to steer clear of the poor scrambled eggs, the fatty bacon and what appeared to be hot dogs cut up. This is Italy, so eat like the Italians: a cornetto (croissant) with your coffee, and save your appetite for lunch. If you must, there's plenty of salami and ham, cheese, cereal, fruit, yogurt and cakes as well. I don't normally eat in hotel restaurants but one night I was sore and tired from walking and decided to try their E40 seafood prix fixe dinner. It was excellent! And the waiter, who was very nice as well as professional, kept pouring me very good wines (included in the price).

We booked a superior room to ensure we had a larger room, and indeed it was spacious. the bathroom was tiny but perfectly formed and very clean. The double bed was 2 singles locked together, and the matress and pillows were very hard, but surprisingly this lead to a very good firsts nights sleep! It was only on our second night (a friday) we noticed that it was much noisier at night time. We had requested a quiet room, and had been given a room at the end of the corridor, on the 4th floor, which was not on the road side. But until the early hours of the morning we could hear loud bangs, we assumed it was the terrace restaurant on the top floor, the furniture being moved etc, but it managed to keep us awake! Then on the Saturday evening we could hear loud music, we think it must have been a nearby dicso, as it was the bass that we could hear. Also, everytime our neighbours pulled the toilet chain it made a very loud clang! So the quiet room turned out to be not so quiet!! But, we can appreciate the hotel is very central and this comes hand in hand with noise. The breakfast was average, there was good choice, and the restaurant is clean and tidy. We had enjoyed our stay on the whole until it was time to check out. It seemed the whole hotel was trying to check out at the same time and the reception desk was chaos. There was one guy manning it, and the queue was as orderly as Italian queues get! We finally reached the front and the reception guy explained our charges, we were prepared for the city tax (3 euro per day per person) and wanted to pay in cash. This apparetly upset the man and he told us he didn't have time to sort the cash, he kept flinging his arms the the air and saying 'no'. We insisted and eventually he accepted the 18 euros!

We ended up getting the taxi service direct from the airport instead of using the train and walking, which was a bit pricey (50 Euro) BUT worth it for a vacation of no aggravation! Taxi pulls right up to the hotel, which is on a nice little off shoot of a main street. Our room was great, we had a double bed and normal bathroom for 2 people. We were on the main street side but the windows are super and we could not hear anything (except the occasional ambulance) when they were shut. The bathroom was fine- you aren't staying in the bathroom anyways! big enough for two people to brush their teeth and ours had a little shelving unit on wheels that was handy. Beds were great, not home but best version of a queen/king/two twins together we had the whole trip, which is important! Closet space was fine- plenty of hangers for clothes. I didn't like the hotel's wireless policy- go to the lobby and pay for usage- most places give it to you for free for at least 24 hours... that is the one downfall of this hotel. Breakfast was great though- buffet style to make sure you are fueled for the walking you will do! A coffee/capu/cafe machine, so no waiting for a person to get you whatever hot beverage you want. There is also a rooftop seating area that is outdoors and indoors, whatever you want, with a great view of Rome during the day and night. First come first serve on seating, and for some reason the hotel staff didn't tell us about it, but it was open and super nice! relaxing and no crazy street traffic like other outside seating. The hotel has a great map of the area for attractions, so don't waste money on a streetwise map like we did for staying in the heart of Rome. The hotel map is color and also paper, much easier to fold up and not look like such a tourist with huge map, blocking sidewalk traffic.... :) All attractions are within reasonable walking distance for a normal person. Roman Forum ruins are just down the street to see at night and during the day. Restaurant across main street was great (Caesars?) and there is a little market with wine, water and meats. If yu turn to the left out of the hotel doors and walk down the street a bit, one one short, stairs/street on your left there is a Farmacia (emergencies only! expensive!) but also a little sandwich shop that is awesome and cheap, and next to that gelato, which is also cheaper than elsewhere!

The location is fantastic. Being right in the center of Rome, all of the ancient ruins are just steps away. The hotel\u2019s rooms are very clean definitely large enough for two adults, always made up early in the day and the rooms, as well as, the hallways are quiet. Our room on the fourth floor faced the main road and I was concerned about police or ambulance sirens keeping us up at night. My husband who is a light sleeper never heard a sound and we both slept well. My only complaint was the bed and pillows were a bit hard for me. I am used to soft bedding which is not found in most European hotels. We had some difficulty with our in-room Internet but the front desk staff was extremely helpful and informative. It is not WIFI. If you are staying in Rome and plan to spend a lot of time on the Internet you may want to consider a different hotel. At 6 Euros an hour it can be quite expensive, but we were there to see Rome and only used our computer for contacting family members and watching movies on DVDs. If you enjoy some TV time in the room it is a great idea to bring a laptop to Europe with your own movies/shows downloaded. Watching CNN or British news can become boring very quickly. I must admit the breakfast served is not the best but it is adequate. Not being much of a breakfast person a pastry with English Breakfast Tea fit my needs. My husband had the scrambled eggs with some type of sliced cold cut and their coffee, which was not gourmet but eatable. It does take sometime to use the coffee machine. With only one dispenser for coffee and hot water you may have to wait awhile for your turn. Breakfast is included in the price, as in most Rome hotels. In comparison with the other hotel prices, I believe Cosmopolita is within reason for the quality and service. First - each room has a small refrigerator. Across the street is a shop that sells bottled water, sodas and pastry at a reasonable price. We would use the refrigerator to store our goodies, which saved a lot of money, since the room items were quite expensive. Second \u2013 the room is comfortably air-conditioned although being there in May it is hard to judge how it would be in summer. Third - the front staff was always helpful. There were some friendlier than others, but no one ever made us feel uncomfortable. The map they gave us came in very handy and if we weren\u2019t sure which way to go \u2013 a staff member was always there to show us the way. The staff in the breakfast room was also courteous and conveniently stayed out of the way \u2013 not hovering and making you feel rushed. Fourth - you can walk to the Coliseum, Forum, Pantheon and Trevi fountain all in less than 15 minutes. A cab to the Vatican cost 10 Euros and to the airport it was 50 Euros. You can also walk to the Vatican within a half hour, if you are not in a rush to meet a tour. There are numerous restaurants in the area, a cabstand around the corner and ruins just outside the hotel.

You can walk to most attractions in under 15 minutes. There is a busy street on one side with cabs, stores and ATM's.

The amenities are Neutrogena. Some disadvantages: The rooms had to conform to the curves, angles and uneven floors of the building. Of the 4 bathrooms we used, only one was exceptional. The showers are narrow and the shower baths tend to be a bit difficult to get into. One tub had an uneven floor with a built in seat contour that made it really tough to stand up in to use the shower. The hotel has a tiny elevator accessed by a key card sliding glass door. We do not travel light, so getting luggage up all the stairs, through the maze and into the elevator took some planning and muscle. The air conditioning was just barely acceptable.

Rooms are fine if nothing special. We enjoyed our time mainly because we could easily walk to everything and we spent most of our time doing that, returning to sleep. This trip is our honeymoon and when I left a bottle of quite good wine in the room when we left, intended to share with my wife when the occasion presents, I fully expected to get it back without demur. I realised the mistake within a couple of hours, phoned, was told the cleaning staff might have put it in lost property but would not be back till morning. Next morning I attended in person. The unhelpful men on reception dissembled, evaded, told me about a 'hotel rule' that all food and drink must be thrown out (an unopened, sealed bottle of good wine in Italy?? ie, treated me like a fool). When I said I had been told to ask about lost property on the phone, he made a farcical show of calling someone to speak on the phone in Italian. Amazingly that person apparently confirmed 'it must have been thrown out'. I bought this wine in southern France in a store where you can get very good wine indeed for 10 Euros. It paid over 35 Euros for something special to share with my wife. I am certain they drank or purloined it and lied to me immediately after we spent a little over 500 Euros in their hotel. I am instinctively sure it was NOT the cleaning staff responsible, just by the dodgy, evasive concierge behaviour. The man did not once meet my eyes throughout this farcical exchange. Totally at odds with all of our other experiences of Italy. These two 'gentlemen' do great disservice to their hotel and their country's tourism industry. Stay there if you like but, as Byron said; 'Read your bible sir, And mind your purse.' I never will again.

It's very neat & clean and the breakfasts are okay...mostly since they are included. If I'd had to pay separately, I wouldn't give them a good review either. There was only one person who worked the front desk that was civil. During our stay we interacted with four different employees and with the exception of the youngest man were all rude & surly. No matter what you asked, it was a curt answer and they were of no help. The one young man (I wish I had gotten his name) was friendly & helpful and suited for his job. The rest of the men should not be working a front desk! We expected the room to be small, and knew we were getting twin beds. I, however, didn't expect the room or the beds to be that small. Truly, the smallest twin bed I've ever slept on...hard as a rock too. Our room was too warm, we turned the heat off completely & still had to leave the window open at night. If the room was small, the bathroom was tiny. Probably 4x5 with a sink, toilet, bidet & corner shower unit in it. The shower was the low point of this bathroom. As I said, corner unit, with the door opening at the corner. The doors slid open down each side...about 10 inches! Seriously, the opening to get through the doors could not have been more than 10 inches! Plus the shower was raised about 8 inches above the regular floor. So not only did you not have any space to get in the shower, but you had to reach & grab the top rail to pull yourself up into it. My husband is 6 ft tall & weighs 225.

Allessandro, the front desk clerk recommended this restaurant and others to us. We found his advice to be right on! Allesandro was always cheerful and helpful and made our stay very enjoyable. There is a rooftop restaurant where you can enjoy the views of Rome or a cocktail. Parking is at a premium in Rome (impossible!). However, the hotel will unload your vehicle and park it off-site and return it to you on the morning of your departure.

As it was 4 star and in Rome and I paid \u00a31500 for the package for 3 I hoped for good things. I was taking my elderly parents away so wanted to really treat them to something special. Although it was a nice hotel and it was comfortable, it didn't have any wow factor and in places needed updating and bit of t.l.c. The rooms we were allocated 301 and 302 were a single and twin. Both were cramped and badly laid out. Simple things about the hotel had been done without thought. Flooring in the halls is hard so every person leaving early in the morning or coming in late at night WILL wake you up with their wheely cases and heels. There were no door hooks anywhere meaning the bathroom and bedrooms quickly became cluttered and messy once wet towels were in the equation. The shower cubicles were tiny. I'm a size 10-12 and found it cramped. My mother who is larger didn't even try to get in. So the good : Location. You are in the heart of everything - a short walk ( 5-10 minutes) to lots of sights. But this is a double edged sword. I hadn't expected October to be SO busy. It was overwhelming, so if you want something a little out of the way with a quieter feeling and gentler charm, this hotel is not for you. Road noise was not a problem, just that you stepped straight out into full- on bustle. It's like Piccadilly circus. Also good - Breakfast - which is GREAT. You couldn't get a better selection of pastries, cake, fruit, yoghurt, sausages, bacon,GOOD coffee, and the first decent scrambled eggs I have EVER had in a hotel - ie not cooked to death so they resemble polystyrene. These were creamy and great! Waiting staff were friendly and quick. The Glass bar attached to the hotel is nice and pleasant to have a drink in, before venturing out for the night and the front desk were helpful. We didn't experince the roof terrace as it was booked out for a private conference which was a shame. But they don't serve drinks up there which is missing a trick I think...Danilo on reception kindly booked us onto a Ciao Roma bus tour on day one. These were a good way of getting around with older people, but the tours were so oversubscribed we only got a seat once in 48 hours of using the tickets! One tip for eating is book ahead for any recommended in lonely planet etc. And be aware that on Mondays lots of places close. Our best meal was at a restaurant called Giggetto in the jewish qtr. Knockout meal, great price, lovely service ( v supportive of my attempts to speak in Italian ) and true Jewish Roman flavours. Great courgette flowers and oxtail with celery, deep fried artichokes etc. Avoid eating anywhere near Trevi - had appaling meal there. Roma is a great city but like any that is popular I think you need to go out of season, get away from the main sights and wander. Overall the hotel was good, but it needed some updating.

When we got in, they gave us a free upgrade to a Junior suite which was located right next to their roof garden. This was very nice of them, and we thought we had picked a great place. I'll go through our experience after: LOCATION The location is ok, though I am not sure why some folks are gushing over it. You can walk to a few places, but you are by no means living in the middle of anything resembling a shopping/restaurant/sight seeing location. Having travelled to Europe a fair number of times, the cities are old and historic enough that you will be close to something or another no matter where you live. I saw someone write below that they walked to the Trevi fountain frequently. We did this walk and it was about a 15-20 minute walk at night without having to wait for too much traffic. The Colloseum was about 10 minutes which is nice. The point is that, Yes, you can walk to a few locations, but you pretty much HAVE to. There is no restaurants/bars/shopping area right where the hotel is. ROOMS: Well, we were upgraded to the Junior Suite, but every night we came back, the bathroom smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. We told the hotel about it, and they sent someone up to spray air freshener. We left the doors and windows open, and it aired out which was fine. It might an issue with their ventilation system. Very odd. BATHROOM: The water temperature kept fluctuating, and it got worse later in the evening. You would either get blasts of very cold or very hot water. It was not a comfortable shower. SERVICE: This was perhaps the worst part of it. We signed up for their wi-fi service, at about 10 Euros for 12 hours, but it never worked on our floor. When I let the hotel staff know about it, the person and the front desk recommended using it in their lobby while they fix it by the next day. The wifi was never fixed, and when I talked to the front desk about it, they said they couldn't do anything about it, and they would NOT refund the money. I have never experienced that at any hotel. FRONT DESK RECOMMENDATIONS We asked the front desk for a restaurant recommendation, and what they described us a traditional Italian restaurant frequented by locals ended up being a modern designed, sparse restaurant, with nothing but tourists carrying other hotels' recommendation cards. Makes me wonder if there is a commision involved. They also recommended the Ciao Roma bus tour, and said, \"We have a special partnership with the best tour in Rome.\" This was by far the worst double decker tour bus we had ever been on. The busses came so infrequently, that at one of the stops, a small mob of angry clients, that had been waiting for a full hour, jumped on the bus and would not let it leave. The bus itself, was rusty, and dirty. Is the condition of the bus service the hotel's fault? NO. However, it IS their fault that they recommend it as the best service. I suppossed their \"Special Partnership\" has more to do with the commission. When we mentioned this to the front desk, they asked us to call the bus tour and take it up with them. Hoenstly, we are shocked that this hotel has received glowing reviews from others. Even before all the service issues, I would have given them 3 stars based on the smells in the bathrooms. I wonder about the validity of some of the other reviews.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cbrilliant location and great breakfast\u201d", "Author": "arpa45", "ReviewID": "UR82706888", "Content": "everything in walking distance, what a postion!!

It is a quick walk to many of the prime attractions. Unfortunately, you have to travel a little further out to get to restaurants worth eating at... But, if you don't mind an evening stroll to get to them, it is perfectly fine. The hotel itself is about 5 stories and has a roof-top lounge. 1/2 of the lounge is in the open air, 1/2 is housed by a roof and clear, heavy vinyl \"windows\". We have stayed here 2 times. On our earlier stay, we could buy drinkgs at the roof-top lounge. On this trip, the bar was shut down and the staff wasn't willing to retract the heavy vinyl clear dividers to allow the cooling breeze of Rome entirely across the roof-top lounge. The rooms are big enough, but all of the storage you will get is a armoire with limited drawers and few hangers. Each room we have had has a small fridge, but don't expect it to get very cold. The TV in the room gets about 3 English-speaking channels. The beds are hard and the linen is rough, but my wife and I didn't have an issue with that. The pillows were made of foam - again, perfectly fine. My daughter's bed was really a fold-out chair/single bed combo. Besides its location in the room, she didn't have a problem sleeping on it. The bathroom is small but the shower had good pressure. What I don't get about Italian showers is that they often consist of a tub with a moveable half-glass wall. When taking a standing shower, you can get water all over the room. The breakfasts were part of our package and they were passable: eggs, bacon/sausages, breads, salamis, cheese, fruit, preserves, yogurts, cereals, espressos... Nothing that will make you dream of an Italian breakfast when you are back home, but enough to get your day moving. Most of the staff at the front desk speak English fluently, and the others that don't are passable at it. They were helpful when in a pinch, but I often felt that they would rather be doing something else than help me.

As in other posts, I can say that this hotel is superbly located. If you don't mind short walks, up to a half hour, you can literally walk everywhere in this great city. We did buy a 48 hour hour pass on the Roma hop on/hop off bus and that was good to add to the site seeing. Really though, distances aren't great for the sites and we did way more walking than riding. The hotel is a good choice for the money with Rome being pricey. We all had small, clean and comfortable rooms. Never heard a noise at night which is always a plus when you've had bad experiences in chain hotels with party crowds. The only issue we had was with air conditioning. We hit Rome in the heat of August and it appeared the air units in the rooms couldn't keep up. They worked but could only cool the room, not get it cold enough for all of our tastes. It wasn't unbearable, only uncomfortable somewhat but not to the point where I would complain about it. I would expect that at most times it works fine when it's not +35 celcius. Front desk staff were okay, middle of the road. They are helpful, some more than others. we had no issues and service was good. They gave us a few restaurant ideas and we tried a couple. One was very good, just a block and a half away. It's called Le Lanterne.We ate there twice and were very pleased with the food quality, service and price. You can sit on the patio or inside. The pasta was very good and we would go back. Another restaurant we found on our own that was very good was just across the main street from the hotel and up a half block beside a Scottish Pub. It was called Pastarito. We ate there twice and it was excellent. The place is large, all indoor seating with great A/C. Pastas and pizzas were very good and prices were extremely reasonble for larger portions than most places we saw. The hotel never recommended it to us but we sure would recommend it as a close place to have a great dinner. Lastly, just down the street, Euphemia, only two very short blocks is a street to the left that has a large set of steps going up to the main road. On these steps are located three smaller shops/stores/pizzarias. We used them a lot for cheap beer,wine, ice cream, pizza slices,etc. Here you can get all of this for a fraction of the price you pay at the steet car vendors a block away that are in front off all attractions. You learn fast to grab a beer for 1.50 instead of 5.00.If you go, check them out day one and you'll save yourself lots of Euro.

The bed was large and comfy and we had a nice view from our room. Breakfast was good, we discovered the best idea was to have the breakfast pastries - delicious. That's what all the locals were having and after sampling the scrambled eggs (which just tased very sour and not nice) and the limp anaemic bacon - we could see why! Also the fresh bread with cheese and ham was very tasty. The staff were helpful, letting us check in 3 hours before the due time and holding our bags until we left on the day of departure and were ready to collect them in the evening. The only bad thing about our stay was the awful group of young people staying the rooms next to ours. They were shouting and yelling all evening whilst we got ready to go out for dinner (7-8pm ish) and then spent between 3am and 5am then next morning banging loudly on the doors and shouting very loudly, which kept us awake and very tired for our sight seeing the next day. We hadn't put the deadlock on our door and they were banging so hard on the door next to our that our door was jarred open at 3.30am. They were just as loud at breakfast the next day, although it has to be said looking suitable hung over and rough - not that I wished them any suffering after what'd they'd done to us!! The glass bar, which is also open to the public in the hotel is not cheap but a nice place to go for a pre-dinner drink.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cWORTH A STAY AT THIS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "117PeteAnn", "ReviewID": "UR58384986", "Content": "The hotel was ideally located for the tourist attractions eg. The Colleseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and a bus stop just outside the front which took you to the other side of Rome to the Vatican area. Bus Tickets cost one Euro and last for 75 minutes, the only downside is that you have to purchase your bus ticket from a tabacconist shop if you are not using the Roma Pass. The central location adjacent to the Via De Corsa which is the shopping area makes the hotel a perfect choice for sight seeing and shopping. We walked everywhere apart from taking the bus to the Vatican City area. We checked in without any problems and found the staff extremely helpful in advising us where the various sights we wished to visit were located and how to get there. The whole of the hotel was spotlessly clean and well maintained, Our bedroom was a double room, spacious and with a well sized bathroom. The shower pressure was excellent in comparision to many other hotels which we have stayed at. The linen and towels were changed every day during our four day. The breakfast was mainly continental but bacon, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs and sausage were also served and these were hot. The continental selection was comprehensive and plentiful and you could help your self to as much as you liked. There were no tea making facilities in the rooms but it did have a fridge/minibar. Overall an excellent hotel with good location well worth patronising. Would recommend The Scholars Arms Bar (Irish Bar),Via Del Plebiscito off the Piazza Venezia and about 5 minitues walk from the hotel. Excellent food, plentiful, varied menu, good prices.

It was probably the most expensive hotel we stayed ( other cities in this trip were venice and florence). The location is pretty decent and the entrance does give you a decent impression at first look. There is a glass bar on the left when you enter the hotel and the reception seems to have been upgraded with some contemporary furniture. Check in was OK, the staff was neither too happy or rude, but we didnt get a very warm reception from them. The entrance to the rooms are very odd. On your way to the rooms there is a tiny computer (only one) for internet use ( u have to pay for that). It is followed by a small alley with steps. The alley had the most horrible smell coming from it, seems like it is connected to the dumpster below and which was partitoned by a plastic sheet!. The elevator is small and can fit max 4-5ppl ( without luggage). Our room was on the 5th (top) and we had to take about 7 steps to reach the hallway with the rooms. There seemed to be another flight of steps for 2 more rooms on the same floor. The room was very small, barely fitting a double bed and some walking space. There was a locker in the room, which we found out later that we had to go get the key from the reception ( they made us sign for it and needless to say, the reception did not tell us about it when we were checking in, so it required another trip down the stenchy alley). The bathroom was OK, tiny though, shower was barely big for one person. No iron was provided and the manager said it was not available, so laundry service was the only option. The breakfast was decent, we did get bored of it after 3 days, still had warm food and an expresso machine. I would say that breakfast was the best part of the stay as the b'fast room was pretty nice and with new furniture. I think its a regular restaurant during the day.

LOCATION - The hotel is so close to all major sites of Rome, excluding the Vatican. We could easily walk in 10 minutes to the Colesseum, Forum, Spanish Steps, and the nicer shopping areas. The Vatican was not bad either, as the bus taking us there picked us up about 2 blocks away from the hotel entrance (same goes for the bus taking you to Termini to catch all the trains). We rented a car service (Rome Cabs) from the airport to the hotel only because we were unfamiliar with Rome -- if we did it again, public transportation is very easy. HOTEL - Rooms are small, but clean and in good shape (size is normal for Europe IMO). The previous reviewers are correct that the bathroom is small, but honestly -- how much time do you need to spend in the bathroom? I am 5'7\" and did not have any issues taking a shower or anything else. It was clean and looked like it was new or recently renovated. My wife could use the mirror outside to do anything with her hair, if she needed more space. They actually had a built in converter in the bathroom for US plugs, so you did not need a converter for your hair dryer, etc. Had your basics -- queen size bed, tv, work table, minibar, and dresser. Room overlooked the street below, but was relatively quiet. Internet was only 3 Euro for an hour or something like that. Not bad considering how much you spend in Italy! We brought our laptop to Skype and had no problems with the connection. The reaturant/bar is a bit expensive ($10-$17 for a drink), but we found that \"normal\" prices were $8-$12 anyways. Maybe that was cue to stick with house wine! The free breakfast buffet was good and had everything from cereal to breads/cheeses to hot items like bacon/potatoes/eggs/ham. Coffee and caf\u00e9s were also included. SERVICE - Generally good service for a larger hotel. They took the time to show us where to go and how to get around with public transportation. Most staff members (at least front desk) spoke English and could communicate well. Checking out was a breeze and we were never ignored and always attended to when we had questions.

That's it! We were put in the smallest room I have ever had the misfortune to stay in and our friend's room was even smaller! The rooms were so small you could not open the door fully as it hit the bed. This brings me on to the bed which was basically a large single bed for 2 people, none of our party of 4 got a good nights sleep over the 3 nights we stayed. There were no plug points in the room and the wardrobe was so slim that only 4 hangers could hang in there, the television made a loud buzzing sound whenever it was switched on which basically made it unwatchable (obviously we were not there to watch TV but when you are in a hotel room it is nice to watch tv if you choose), there was no storage space whatsoever which meant that we had to have our cases by the entrance door and then lift them on to the bed when we needed to exit the room. Perhaps the size of the room and the bed would have been bearable had the room not have been filthy as well, there were sprays of what I hope was mud up the walls and the floor was dusty. What little sleep we did have in this room was interuppted by a phantom phone that would ring once every half an hour throughout the night and at one stage when attempting an afternoon nap, despite putting a \"Do not disturb\" sign on the door we were disturbed twice by cleaners asking if we wanted our rooms made up, what is a do not disturb sign for if it does not stop people from knocking on your door??? The breakfast was of reasonable quality however once a tray of food was empty it took 2-3 requests or 10-15 mins before it was refilled which is very frustrating when you are paying EUR15 per head. As well as the other complaints the internet speed was a joke in the rooms despite being EUR9 per day and the reception desk got our bills wrong when we went to check out. This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in and was not cheap it is such a shame that such a wonderful historic and cultured city has a terrible hotel as this representing it.

Rooms are basic but clean and comfy if a little hot. We had a twin room which would be small by American standards but perectly fine for Europeans.

The hallway and the elevator had a very bad smell the whole time we were there, but otherwise the hotel was clean and nice looking - nothing especially interesting but more than adequate since we didn't want to spend much time in the hotel anyway. The rooftop bar/restaurant is really more of a patio - you cannot order anything up there, but you can bring your own drinks or food up and sit and enjoy the view.

It was only slightly bigger than a room we visited in a hotel literally around the corner, where the price was 20% less. Contrary to the misleading pictures on the hotel's website which show a room with a couch, two arm-chairs, and a view overlooking some piazza, this room had no couch and no arm-chairs. Besides the bed and one straight-backed chair, there was no place to sit. After three days of begging, we finally got a second straight-backed chair. The window did not face a piazza, but the small space between the back of the hotel and the next building. At least the wall opposite our window was mostly blank, so our privacy was not much impaired. Though this was disappointing, considering the pictures on the website, it was actually a blessing. Had the window faced the street the room would have been intolerably noisy. We had the good fortune of having a tiny balcony, useless for sitting or looking out from, but pefect for hanging laundry. (You can have your clothes laundered by room service at prices such as 6 euros for one t-shirt.) The place seems to have had a recent remodelling, so things like doors, light-switches, bathroom facilities were all in excellent shape. We did not hear our neighbors at all. The location is fine, but not as special as other reviewers have written. The cluster of hotels of which this a part is the nearest to the ancient Forum Romanum, if that is what you are looking for, but not necessarily to other sites. Rome is so packed with things to see and visit, that nearly anywhere in the large \"Historical Center\" -- such as the areas near the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Campo di Fiori, Spanish Steps, Termini, Vatican, and much more -- can be said to be ideally located. A drawback of the immediate location of this hotel is that being surrounded by business and government buildings and the vast emptiness of the ancient Forum approaches, there is no residential \"hinterland.\" The nearest place to buy so much as a cucumber or a band-aid is a ten-minute walk away . (An excellent and friendly supermarket on the Corso Vittorio Emanuelle just before the Largo Argentina.) To say that the front desk staff was unhelpful in finding this would be a great understatement. The breakfast room is quite pleasant, but not the spectacular place pictured on the website. Breakfast included a fine array of cereals, fruit, coffees, and the like. The worst part was the attitude of the front desk personnel. The front desk is understaffed, so that even if the people there were inclined to be friendly, they probably could not be. There was no evidence that they (with one exception) were inclined to be friendly. For the dati traveler: The doors operate by electronic key cards, which presents a shabbat problem. However to our pleasant surprise, the porters were quite cheerful in escorting us to our rooms, and are apprently accustomed to dealing with this matter. There was in the room one lamp which we could put on a timer we brought. The old Ghetto, with its synagogues, restaurants and superb bakery, is a seven to ten minute walk from the hotel.

Fifteen minutes' walk was really 15 minutes, and it was very hard to walk under a hot sun. We needed to ask 5 passers-by for direction, although only two of them clearly knew the direction.

We were arranged to stay in Room 446, and the room was very extremely small indeed. Well, but everything was clean and tidy. Sleep was sound. I think that the most uncomfortable thing was the cold and stern attitude of the staff. There was a gentleman who looked like a manager working at the reception desk. We tried to ask him for some information about hot water and direction to the railway station on two occasions, we were faced with blank face, blunt voice and of course lack of eye-contact. And in a morning when we went to the hotel's restaurant for buffet breakfast, we were led to a table. Then after we'd returned to the table after taking the food, the table was occupied. The staff there did not seem to know what had happened, but asked rather impolitely, \"what's the problem of you?\" Well, I explained, and he apologised, and asked us to move to another table.

But after researching hotels in Rome I found 150 Euros a night was fairly reasonable. And the location was definitely great. But you have to be so careful in Rome because it seems sometimes like everyone is trying to scam you in some way and this hotel was no exception, unfortunately. Upon arriving at the hotel we were pleased to see it was very clean, modern and upscale. But when I was checking in, the man at the desk seemed to hesitate a bit as he looked at my reservation. Then I saw him cross out the room I was originally given and change it to another room number. He then gave our room key DIRECTLY to the bellman, not even telling us the room number or giving us the option of taking the luggage ourselves, which was a bit unnerving. I was also a little unnerved that the security system not only requires a key card to get into the main part of the hotel, but also to get out, which seems scary in the event of an emergency. Anyway it was somewhat convenient to have the bellman since the hotel is somewhat oddly shaped and even when you take the lift, you usually have to take some more stairs to get to your room. When we reached our \"room,\" (#114) it was essentially a long, narrow hallway with 2 single beds lined up, one behind the other with a bedstand between them. The bathroom was tiny, the whole shape was unnerving, as it looked sort of like a dormitory hallway. Since it said very clearly on my reservation form through expedia that I had booked a room with a QUEEN BED, I called the front desk and complained. He immediately said it would be no problem to switch and that he would send the bellman up to move us (again, he didn't even give me the option of getting the new key myself, and we were forced to wait until the bellman was able to come up and move us). The upshot was the new room was lovely, with no problems. Personally I believe what happened was that the man at the desk saw that we were 2 females traveling together and thought perhaps he could get away with giving us this crappier room, saving the queen room in case a \"couple\" came in not realizing we too were a couple. BUt even if I had been with just a friend, I wouldn't have wanted this room - it was too weird and creepy. Anyway, the new room, as I said, was quite satisfactory, and we had no further problems with the hotel, but that experience definitely tainted us a bit, especially since we'd had good experiences with all our other hotels in Italy. The breakfast is good, and they had a beautiful restaurant though we didn't eat there, and apparently a rooftop balcony though it was too cold when we were there to take advantage of that. Everything was clean and it was in a great location to explore Rome. They also were able to provide a car service to take us to the airport for a flat rate of 50 Euros, about the same price as a taxi. I don't think this is a bad hotel, and probably most people wouldn't have the experience we had, but if it speaks to the way they operate, I can't wholeheartedly recommend them.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Earth", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Travel_Dog_2000", "ReviewID": "UR22809606", "Content": "Visited Rome the first week in November and had an amazing time. Rome is a very easy city to navigate and everything is within a reasonable walking distance. After all of the stories I've heard of pick-pockets and roving Gypsies I was a bit concerned. Of course like in any big city you should always be cautious of your surroundings, but I felt very safe walking around even at night. There was always alot of people out and about and so many people looking at maps that you won't feel like the \"only\" tourist trying to figure out where you're at. We stayed at Hotel Cosmopolita for 4 nights. It is located close to the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, Capitoline Museum. This was my first visit to Rome so being centrally located made it very easy for us to walk everywhere which made the experience so much richer as every square inch of Rome is a magnificent work of art not to be missed. The area around the hotel seemed very safe. From Fiumincino Airport we took an \"official\" taxi from the cue just outside the doors. We were solicited by many \"unofficial\" taxis, but ignored them. The cab cost flat rate of 40\u20ac + 2.50\u20ac for each bag + tip. Hotel Cosmopolita offered a limosine service for 50\u20ac from the airport, same as a cab ride which is a great alternative if you plan ahead. I payed $160USD per night for Hotel Cosmopolita through European Destinations, which I thought was a very reasonable price for the quality and location of the hotel. The hotel staff was courteous and very accommodating. We arrived at about 8:30 a.m. and were allowed to check in early at no extra cost which was really nice since we were fatigued after a very long flight. A very nice young man carried our luggage to our room and would not accept a tip. We had a to use a key card to get into the area where the rooms were and of course a keycard to get into the room, which made us feel very safe. The room was not very big, but met our needs...a place to sleep and take a shower. The room was kept very clean as was the entire hotel. The bed and the pillows were a bit firm for my taste, but that seems to be the norm in Italy. In the room there was an armoire that locked and a safe inside of that...very nice to store larger valuables. The hotel is located on a side street so it was very quiet in our room, which was nice because we had the windows open as it was rather warm during our stay. The bathroom was a bit of a tight squeeze, especially the shower. I am small could barely turn around. But there was always plenty of hot water and the water pressure was powerful so I certainly wouldn't base my decision to stay here on that minor inconvenience. A hairdryer was provided and nice little amenities like Q-tips, kleenex, nail file, shampoo, soap, shower cap, etc. In the evening the chambermaid left us candies and turned down our bed. A delicious buffet breakfast was included in the price of the room and served from 7:30 - 9:30 a.m. Eggs, meats, cheese, croissants, muffins, breads, spreads, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, juice, coffee. It was plenty to keep us filled for our long treks around the city. We did try hotel restaurant one evening when we were too tired to trek out for dinner. It was reasonably priced and the food was pretty good. You'd have a hard time eating a bad meal in Italy. There was an excellent restaurant just round the corner from the hotel,Trattoria Melo, a small family owned place. The grilled squid was delicious and the owner was quite charming. Would have definitely gone back if we had more time. The hotel had a really cool rooftop terrace with an awesome view of the city where you could sit and have a drink. It was closed for the season, but I'm sure it's a really cool place to hang in the summer. If you need to stay connected to the internet the lobby has wi-fi hotspot or for a few bucks you could use a computer located in the lobby. Additionally each room had internet connection via the television for $9, which came in handy when I had an emergency situation that I needed to take care of. The staff at the front desk provided us with a map of the city that included all the city streets making it really easy to find our way around. They were very helpful in providing directions or advice. When it was time for us to leave, they called us a cab and told us exactly how much it would cost to the train station. It cost 10\u20ac and was worth it as it would have been quite a trek with luggage. Overall Hotel Cosmopolita is a very nice hotel for a very reasonable price, great staff, great location, clean rooms, good breakfast. I would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach,FL", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location.\u201d", "Author": "GoLo", "ReviewID": "UR21660635", "Content": "The hotel is located in the city center (next to Piazza Venezia) Walking distance to all the attractions.

We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and booked it from their website, which was the best deal I found (included 15% off if staying > 3 nights). Location: The hotel is centrally located in the heart of Rome basically across the street from the Victor Emmanuel monument/Capitol Hill directly behind Trajan's column. It is about a 10 minute walk from the Colosseum and Metro B, one block from a major bus stop (Piazza Venezia and Corso), 15 minute walk from the Spanish Steps, 5-10 minutes from the Trevi fountain and Pantheon. Room: The room is larger than other rooms we have stayed in Europe and well decorated. The beds were firm but comfortable. There is a safe in the room (you must get a key from the front desk). The bathroom is large and included a bidet. Con: The bathtub is very high and would be difficult to get in and out for older individuals. The maid service was excellent. **Note: Although shampoo/soap was provided, there was no conditioner or lotion.... so you will have to bring your own. Services: The front desk was very helpful, especially Bruno. They sent up a bottle of Prosecco to our room with a nice note stating happy anniversary, as I had mentioned this in an e-mail to them as the reason for our visit to Rome... very nice touch! Breakfast: Very good breakfast which consisted of both hot and cold items, coffee (excellent capuccino!), and juices. Examples of offered items include scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, various pastries and breads, cereals, meats and cheeses, and fruit. Getting there: Taxi: Cabs from the airport are approximately 40 euros. We didn't take a cab because of everything I heard/read about unscrupulous cab drivers. Train: Leonardo Express from the airport to Termini (11 euros each; leaves every 30 minutes) then Metro Line B towards Laurentina and stop at Colesseo. It is about a 10 minute walk from the Colosseum. Bus: (easiest) Take Leonardo Express as above to Termini. A number of buses go to Piazza Venezia including #40 (which we took because it is an express bus), H, and 64. The hotel is a block from the bus stop on Santa Eufemia. Look for the Glass restaurant and bar (part of hotel). Hints for Rome: 1. We used Rick Steves' Rome 2009 which more than paid for itself! I highly recommend it to everyone! 2. Buy a Roma Pass from the airport (Terminal C at the Tourist Information Desk or TI) or Termini station for 20 euros. It contains a card you can use at different sites for free admission, including the Colosseum/Roman Forum/Palatine Hill and National Museum of Rome. Also included is a 3 day Metro Pass that you can use for any bus or Metro (but not Leonardo Express). The Metro pass alone is worth 11 euros. 3. Beware of pickpockets! We used a money belt (NOT fanny pack), worn under my husband's shirt... and I used a pouch worn around my neck and placed under my top. Do not put anything of value in your pockets. 4. Wear sturdy shoes as the cobblestoned streets are very rough on your feet.", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Amazing Location\u201d", "Author": "Mr0wl", "ReviewID": "UR19935417", "Content": "If you are endlessly searching for a solid hotel, you should consider Cosmopolita as a top contender. The first two nights of our trip we stayed at a hotel close to the Vatican, but switched to the Cosmopolita for the remaining five days to be in the city center. As many other reviews have noted, the location of the hotel is superb--within 10-15 minutes walking distance to Trevi Fountain, the Forum, Palatine Hill, Capitol Hill, Colloseum, and the Pantheon, and other nearby ruins. Other sights are also within walking distance, but I highlight these sights as they are among the most popular in Rome. It was wonderful to stroll nearby our hotel and see all these sites lit up at night. Conversely, if you do not want to walk, Piazza Venezia--where virtually all buses stop and taxi stands are located--is only two blocks away. During our stay, the hotel itself was solid--comfortable and exceptionally clean. The area around the hotel also felt very safe, as it is located next to a municipal building that has a constant police presence. The concierges were helpful and booked restaurant reservations for us on three occasions. We noticed throughout our stay the concierges helping guests in English, German, French and Italian. Since our flight did not leave until 2330 on our last day, the hotel accommodated our request for a late check-out (2030) so that we could shower and change after a day of sightseeing (cost 100 Euros for late check-out). Since this was just a quick get away, my boyfriend and I were looking for a good hotel (clean and comparable to a standard Hilton or Omni hotel in the US) to enjoy a leisurely paced vacation that was easily accessible to sights and/or transportation. Without saying, you will of course find a more luxurious hotel in Rome, but this is a great hotel and served all of our purposes. TIP: Arriving Hotel from Airport: Although we stayed at a different hotel upon arriving in Rome, this tip still applies. For 13 Euros, take a shuttle from the airport train station to your hotel. It's worth the money, time, and hassle since a train ticket from the airport to the Termini train station in the city costs 11 Euros and then you would have to take a cab/subway/walk to your hotel from Termini. A taxi from the airport would cost you roughly 40 Euros. Departing Hotel to Airport: Most buses located half a block from the Cosmopolita go to Termini train station (in three stops or less). The bus costs 1 Euro. From Termini, you can take the express train to the airport for 11 more Euros. We Loved: --The Scavi tour (Vatican Necroplis). Reservations required; --Riding bikes and seeing archeological sites along the Appian Way; --Our \"Through Eternity Cultural Association\" tour of the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, and the Forum (in our opinion, this was substantially better than our Vatican tour from Presto Tours); --Chianti Wine Bar and Restaurant near Trevi Fountain; and --That Prada (at the bottom of the Spanish Steps) was cheaper on the Euro than buying on the American market.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "travellerlondon10", "ReviewID": "UR19602299", "Content": "After reading the reviews on trip advisor we were happy to book at Cosmopolita Hotel and were not disappointed.

The roof top terrace is a great place to see over the roof tops of Rome, and to see where many of the tourist attractions are in relation to each other and the hotel. Be warned, the bar on the terrace does not open until May 5th (a shame as we had fantastic sunshine all the time we were there). You therefore need to either buy drinks from the hotel bar (\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3) and take them up to the roof, or buy from outside and take your own up. The bar staff are very helpful and most speak good English. The Bar itself is on the main street and is open to anybody for drinks and food/bar snacks. One thing i would mention is the hotel security. Whilst we never felt unsafe, we ropped the safety diposit box keys with the morning receptionist, and picked them back up from another person who had never seen us before - without him even asking for a name, passport or signature. Also, the security sliding door to get to the lift (your room key is meant to open it - was more often than not open and therefore accessible to anyone. As i said, we did not feel unsafe but be aware and mention it to the head receptionist if you are concerned. We also organised the mini-coach back to the airport and it arrived at the hotel in plenty of time. There is baggage storage if you have to leave later in the day. All in all a very nice little hotel and we will certainly use it again if and when we return to Rome - which is a beatiful city but you must use the open top bus tour early in your visit, to see where you want to go and plan a suitable route. Food there is quite cheap but drinks are not so be warned.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Va", "Title": "\u201cgreat location - and rooftop terrace\u201d", "Author": "JeffCarter", "ReviewID": "UR15633780", "Content": "booked through www.europeandestinations.com This hotel was very nice and the staff very friendly and cooperative. we were walking distance to the coliseum and roman forum and many just about any other place of interest.

Most reviews seemed to focus on the size of the bathroom ?? it had a shower, toilet, sink & mirror, what more do you need ??? It was spotlessly clean and in my opinion that's more important than a huge dirty bathroom !! Staff were friendly, breakfast was good. lots of choice and fab coffee! The Glass bar and restaurant which is attached to the hotel (its where you have breakfast) is really nice with good snacks and window seats for good people watching. The big parliament building around the corner from the hotel (approx 2 mins) has tour bus stops. I recommend the bright green one which runs every 15 minutes. We bought a 48 hour ticket for 23 euros, best thing we did. It gives you a chance to see where everything is so you can plan your routes, then get on and off at whichever stop you want. There's lots of walking when you get to an actual place of interest without killing yourself walking to it ! You get to see so much more on the bus and if the weather is good, so much the better. Would advise a guide at the Vatican, you whizz past the 2 hour queues and get a detailed explanation which means so much more once you see the Cistine Chapel.

The roof bar wasn't open at this time of year but we were free to take drinks from the bar up, cocktails whilst watching Rome go by in the evenings were good! We ate at the hotel restaurant on our first night and this was also very good. The restaurant has a very stylish and contemporary feel to it and the food was excellent (try the Roman style veal.)

Everything seemed just a beat off. With better management, this could be a great spot, but we won't stay there again or recommend it to friends. First, the good points: The location is superb. It is walking distance to the Forum, Collesseum, Palantine, and Pantheon, and there is a bus just across the street to the Vatican and other sights. The restaurant was also superb. We had a very good dinner there one night, and the breakfasts, while not superlative, were good. But, the rooms were uncomfortable and loud, the elevator, toilet and internet was broken, and the desk clerks were either rude, overwhelmed, or both (with one exception...I wish I could remember the name of the one desk clerk who was friendly and professional). Our first room in this hotel was tiny, which was a disappointment, in view of the other reviewers here who have had good sized rooms. My advice: Don't stay here if you book the less expensive \"standard\" room. They are small and loud and not worth the money. The first night we were in a tiny room with a tiny bath. Part of the room next door jutted into our room, which, we were to discover, contained the bathroom of the area next door. When those guests took showers, the roar in our room from the plumbing was so loud that it actually drowned out the sound from the television. It was unbelievable and unacceptable and we asked to be moved to a new room the next morning. The hotel was very accommodating and moved our things to a new room while we were out sight-seeing. Unfortunately, this room was even smaller with an even tinier bathroom. The toilet in this room did not work, but was fixed the next day. The shower was so small we had trouble getting into it, and it was hard on knees and elbows. The room was very thin-walled and we could hear every word from the people next door. (Unfortunately, they were not very interesting conversationalists.) We needed the internet to do some business and to make reservations for the next phase of our trip, but the internet in our room (and this section of the hotel, we were told) was not working. Unlike many modern hotels, this one does not have a publice internet station. We had to borrow the hotel's laptop (they waived the customary charge), but getting access to the laptop is hit and miss, because they have only one laptop and apparently only one member of the staff who knows the password! I had to sit in the lobby for an hour doing my work. Not a big deal, but it would have been more comfortable from the room. The worst aspect of our stay was when the elevator broke. It was broken for two days. We did not enjoy climbing the five flights of stairs to our room, although we did meet several friendly guests while catching our breath on the landings. The staff also was generally unfriendly and unprofessional, except for one desk clerk and the restaurant staff, which was great. The bar staff seemed to love Michael Jackson's \"Thriller,\" as they played it at very high volume several mornings at breakfast.

The location is super so if you're coming to Rome for a couple of nights it's a great location to be able to get around this city in a short period of time. The breakfasts were good except by Day 5 we were thoroughly bored of the selection. The porters were super and extremely pleasant and helpful in comparison to the reception staff who were inconsistent.

Our credit card wouldn't work. We couldn't understand this as we knew there was money in the account. What we didn't know though was that during our stay the hotel had attempted on a number of occasions to take large sums of money off our credit card without our knowledge. We only found this out on our return when our credit card company telephoned us and informed us that they had blocked our card because attempts had been made by the hotel to take large amounts of cash out of our account. Amounts, in fact, which we didn't even owe the hotel. So this is why we were put in a really compromising position whilst trying to check out. To add to this, the reception staff said they only had 7 minutes to close the transaction so they needed to be paid within that time..... no pressure then!! We had to leave our luggage, run out onto the street to find a cash machine. This whole experience left us with a bad taste in mouth.

I would suggest a taxi to Vatican which cost 7 euros and worth it in the heat as once there there is a lot of walking in the vatican museums. I would book somewhere else if I went back, maybe near the Pantheon which was a great place for a meal at night and still central and somewhere with more comfy beds as this became annoying.

We used the Christian tour (for price and route). Not the best commentary but stops at all the places.

I booked the hotel directly via their website and got a deluxe room (on a promotion) for the same price that most online people are offering for a standard. This brings me on to the only point to raise. The rooms aren't big. Even our 'deluxe' was relatively small. But the roooms and bathroom are tidy, well looked after and well stocked. The hotel is tucked in a side alley so the views are nothing and the roof top terrace it promotes is OK but nothing special. But these points are to manage your expectations. They are NO reason NOT to use the hotel. I have seen less complimentary comments from others on this site about this hotel when I was deciding which hotel to use. I can honestly say I had no problems with staff or noise which seem to hae been the main issues for others. I would definitely recommend it. Doesn't get 5 only for the size of rooms.

Our superior room was a good size for the two of us for four days and was modern, spotlessly clean and very well furnished. Yes, as others have said, the bathrooms are a bit of a challenge, especially the small shower - I just took the soap dish off in the end! The trick with the toilet is to keep pumping the button - it suddenly seems to pick up enough pressure and off it goes. I think it's actually designed that way. Oddly enough, given that I am generally a miserable old man, we found a certain charm in these things rather than being annoyed. Probably bacause the rest was so good. Reception staff were friendly and extraordinarily helpful, all speaking perfect English, but a special mention has to go to Eva who was a real pleasure and gave us some very good restaurant recommendations hidden away within a two minute walk of the hotel. The breakfast was more than adequate and included very good cooked items. Do yourself a favour and prebook the hotel's airport shuttle. It's a great price, totally reliable, will save you getting ripped off by the taxi drivers, enduring the touts and, although it looks simple and cheap, the unneccessay discomfort of humping your bags through the train stations and their long walks. By the way, when you get back to your room exhausted after a long day's sightseeing, if you hit the satellite button on the Sky handset, and work your way through the menu until you get the channel listings, you can select any of the channels with a yellow arrow for free viewing including several English language film channels. Just hit TV to get back to the preset channels. We will most certainly stay at the Cosmopolita on our next romantic trip to Rome. By the way, a small tip totally unconnected with and not near to the hotel. On the walk from the hotel to the Collosseum there is often a pregnant gypsy woman begging with a little girl. She will push a large piece of card up against you but it will be covering her other hand going through your bags/pockets underneath. If she sees you are sufficiently distracted by the scene the little girl will also circle behind your partner and be rifling any bags. She is relying on you being gentle because she is pregnant. Don't be.

The hotel is in a great location as it's only 5 mins walk from Trevi Fountain where you will find a handful of shops/restaurants/pizzeria's e.t.c.

It is south east of the bottom end of Via Corso, and five minutes walk from the Trevi Fountain. The hotel has recently been refurbished to a high standard. The theme is modern but not stark as some new hotels can be: both bedrooms and communal areas are filled with tasteful artwork and feature comfortable sofas. Our room was on the third floor overlooking a busy street. Although initially concerned that noise may be an issue we soon realised that the industrial strength glazing does a great job of ensuring peace and quiet. We had a very decent sized room (number 320) with wooden floors. Everything was exceptionally clean and fresh and remained so throughout our stay. Bed was very comfortable and enormous. Brand new well equipped bathroom with good lighting and a hairdryer (being female I appreciate these things - it's amazing how often I'm left towel drying my hair in the semi-darkness!). Only gripe was that the shower could have been a little more powerful, however I've experienced worse and it did the job. Breakfast is served in the newly refurbished restaurant (due to have its grand opening on the night we left) on a mezzanine level above reception/the cocktail bar. There was a good selection of all the usual continental fare. The cocktail bar and mezzanine level are glass fronted, meaning that the space is very light and airy. We enjoyed lengthy breakfasts sitting at our table watching the world go by. Despite being relatively new the cocktail bar had a buzzy atmosphere in the evenings. It serves snacks and tea (try the herbal selection - best mint tea I've ever had) during the day. Unfortunately I'm not drinking at the moment so wasn't able to sample the cocktails first hand. They looked good though... All staff with whom we came into contact were incredibly helpful and friendly. We had no problems with anyone understanding English, though being in Italy throwing in the occasional \u2018per favore\u2019 and \u2018grazie\u2019 is much appreciated! There is a roof garden at the hotel but we didn't venture up (it being February) so unfortunately can't comment. Restaurant wise go off the beaten track for the best value and tastiest food. We ate on Piazza Navona on our first day and didn't repeat the mistake. For a fantastic selection of delicious Italian fare we recommend Osteria del Sostengo. A stone's from the Pantheon on Via delle Colonnelle. Go to the North East top of the Pantheon piazza and take the road leading out (Via del Pantheon). First right and you will see a large green neon sign about 10 foot up saying 'Trattoria', pointing you down a little alley. My husband said he ate the best steak he'd ever had and the puddings were incredible (I\u2019m quite a connoisseur in this department). In fact everything we sampled (went back twice and had full 4 courses on both occasions) was delicious. Not many tourists eat here. For those of you wanting pizza head to La Focaccia on Via della Pace 11. Quite hard to find as there isn't a sign on the door. To identify that you've got the right place look for the large pizza oven as you go in. Pizzas were amazing, we also had a very tasty antipasti. I had a -- ice cream moment at Giolitti on Via delgi Uffici del Vicario 40. Cavernous place featuring wood panelling and frosted glass. Waiters wear uniforms with gold brocade and take their ice cream very seriously.

There's a mini bar in the room, a bit pricey (typical) but you could keep your own drinks cool.

What we already knew was the small size of the room and the small shower but this is how most hotels are in Rome and generally in Europe.

The A/C was so strong that we had to increase its temperature and even to stop it over the night (although on August the outside temparature was not higher than 28C).

Well, all I can say is that the hotel is just superb, hard to believe it is only a 2 star? I guess that is because is doesn't have a restaraunt but the breakfast dining area is large enough and the food itself was good and always plentiful. The bar on the roof is nice with great views and if you prefer smaller hotels with a bit of character rather than the big chains which are the same no matter where you are, then the Cosmopolita is for you. We were arriving extremely late (after midnight) courtesy of Ryanair, and so were slightly worried when checking in. We needn't have worried, they were expecting us and we were dealt with in a five star way, bags to the room and everything. The room was on the front of the hotel on the third floor. From the reviews I had my doubts, by the main street and too low etc. It was opposite what appeared to be a bar and the first night it was extremely busy. That said, with the double glazed windows closed, you can't hear much. It certainly wasn't as troublesome as some of the reviews would have you believe. Looking at the layout, we had one of the bigger rooms which had a two level floor, king size bed etc. The fittings were up to date and the orignal wooden floor and high ceilings with deep red walls gave it a great look and feel. The bathroom was small (particularly the shower) but it was clean and up to date as well. The bedtime chocolates were a nice touch as was the free bottle of wine for my birthday. The hotel is right near ancient Rome, you can virtually walk to all the sites with the longest walk being to the Vatican. The location is just great. Reception were extremely helpful with everything. We asked about Mario's restaraunt and they told us to say we were from the Cosmopolita. Wow did get the royal treatment, fantastic food (the halibut is amazing).

We arrived at the hotel at 1.30 am in the morning, had the usual hand-over of passports, got handed the card for our room and was pointed in the direction of the lift. The thing that did strike us after getting out of the lift was that there was no carpet on the floor, the floor is covered in some form of lino (not cheap and nasty) and this flooring continues into the bedrooms. The flooring is obviously alot easier to keep clean than carpet, but I was conscious of the noise that we must have been making trying to find our room at almost 2.00 am in the morning. Anyway, on entering the bedroom (Room 450) first impressions were quite good. The room itself was a decent size, it was clean and nicely furnished. The bathroom was again clean, the shower perhaps a tad on the small side, but was it was very powerful with plenty of hot water. The \"hand towels\" were actually napkins in disguise. They were made of thin, cotton material (and were pretty useless), but the bath towels were regular fluffy ones. The one disappointment was the safe in the room. We located it in the wardrobe, but were surprised to find that it wasn't at all secure i.e. it wasn't bolted down. You could basically pick it up and move it to another part of the room (or someone could pick it up and walk off with it when you had all your valuables in it !). It really defeats the object of having a safe if you can't use it.

The nicest aspect of this hotel was the rooftop garden (which of course was a bit too chilly to enjoy!) but they do have a portion of it enclosed and they had a wine tasting and free dinner on Friday night when we got there!

The hotel is very clean, the rooms are smaller, the bathrooms modern, the staff very good and well spoken. Area restaurants are mediocore unless u really know where you're going. I stayed at this hotel w/ my teenage son. Breakfast is very good, and plentiful. Taxis readily available (reception w/ call for free), and bus stop to Vatican on corner. We also arranged a tour to the Catacombs thru the hotel and it was good, Viaggi Carrinni Tours. Also arranged pickup from the airport, driver was late because of a flight # mixup on their end but ultimately he was terrific. Fast, and pointed out all the spot on the way to the hotel. I do think the walls are TOO thin in the hotel, you can hear the people next door and sometimes a little too close for comfort if u know what i mean... Other than that I would highly recommend the hotel for its cleanliness, location, breakfast and staff.", "Date": "December 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "mickrick7", "ReviewID": "UR4243143", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel together with a group of 26 other people and we were all heartily disappointed with it. Between us, we occupied 17 rooms. The rooms were unbelievably tiny and claustrophobic. In most of the rooms there was simply nowhere to put your case. Our room was a double but it would be best described as a corridor. There were two single beds end to end and just enough room to shuffle between them and the wall which was hardly a metre wide. Our cases had to be kept on the beds during the day and stacked on top of each other on the floor blocking the entrance to the bathroom at night! The shower was so small we had trouble getting in and out of it. It was a real squeeze. There was nowhere to sit in the rooms. As one of our group said, \"the rooms would be best suited to a young child.\" Either that or sardines! How on earth this hotel could be an accredited 4 star hotel is absolutely mystifying. It's true that \"you only sleep in the room\" but I think the room should offer at least be a modicum of comfort. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the roof top terrace bar etc was lovely and the hotel's location was excellent.

As we were flying into Ciampino the hotel did not offer a shuttle service but did offer a limo at a cost of 48EURO...this may sound a lot but it saved so much hassle and we were at the hotel within an hour of landing! (Tip for any of you travelling to Ciampino after your stay: Leave in plenty of time just in case there are any hold ups traffic wise as we unfortunately encountered on the roads. Plus Ciampino was one of the most disorganised airports we have visited so leave plenty of time for that too!) The hotel has a great friendly atmosphere...the front desk staff were really helpful, spoke good English and nothing was too much trouble. The room was well furnished, very clean with TV, mini bar and a large comfortable bed. There was a huge selection for the self service breakfast: cooked, cereals, toast, juice, fruit I could go on! The location is also first class, the hotel is a stones throw from the Fori Imperiali, 10 minutes from the Forum, Colosseum and Trevi fountain, 15 from the Spanish Steps and about 25 to the Vatican. However, nothing is perfect and there are a few minor gripes. As it is central it is noisy...if you book a room make sure you stay in a 4th or 5th floor room overlooking Via di S Eufemia and not the Quatre Novembre. Our room was in the former and there was still considerable noise at night, especially if you like to have the window open. However some good earplugs can counterbalance this and work like a treat. The TV is pay TV for non-Italian channels..the only English channel is CNN. The roof top bar is very limited for food and despite the claims is not open on Mondays but you can purchase some good Grappa there!

Two things about this hotel make it really great - the location is right, smack dab in the middle of Rome, making walking to see the city easy and taxi rides relatively inexpensive. The second is the wonderful rooftop lounge with terrific views out over the city, and the most wonderful staffer (his name is Ariel) who brings you wine, champagne, beer, etc. along with small salads, sandwiches, and crostini that were very tasty.

When I and my friend opened the door to the 2nd room, we were pretty taken aback. The room was very narrow. The 2 single beds were set head to head with a cabinet separating the two because the room was that narrow - 2 people couldn't pass each other without one person moving out of the way. The room was at one side of the building, explaining the layout and narrowness, but really, this room would have been more suited as a largish utility room. The bathroom was tiny - the shower cubicle was very small indeed. The window wouldn't open at different points, it would swing open all the way, meaning that you could be seen from the rooms opposite! The other room was quite compact with very little space to walk freely. The bathroom was bigger than ours, but again, the shower cubicle seemed quite small.

If you need ATAC (public transport) tickets, I'd advise getting them from the reception to make it easier. The hotel was very clean and smart. In summary, definitely not a 4 star hotel, especially compared to some of the hotels I've stayed at in the past. I'd rate it at 3 stars. Maybe Rome, and Italy in general, has slightly different rating standards compared to elsewhere, in which case, I'd adjust my expectations if I were you.

So, after hours and hours of searching, this one seemed to offer one of the best prices for what it was offering in terms of quality and location. As soon as I booked it, I contacted the hotel by phone and email to ask about a possible room upgrade, given the very special nature of my holiday. To my surprise the offered me the upgrade in a high floor room, in a very spacious and quality room (for Rome standards). We were blessed. The room was infact very nice, although I personally dont like the European version sleeping ie 2 single beds, rather than 1 double for a happy couple! The location for both sightseeing, ice cream shops, trevi fountain, collosseum, everyting in historic rome was there, even all the buses in the city pass just out side the hotel. my only complain about the hotel was that there was no ventilation in the room, being their winter in November/December (by London standard 20c is not winter!), hence the only air coming out of the cooling system was hot air. The evening duty staff seemed a bit unhelpful and rude ' this is our winter, we find it cold', so when we opened the window for air, it was very noisy. I would recommend a room not facing the street if you go in winter months, esp if you need cool air to sleep. Having said that, the day time hotel staff ( a blond lady) was amazingly helpful, professional and gave us best advise and poiners and maps, she always willing to help. The breakfast was also quite decent and it gave us a good start to the day. Some other city hotels had small supermarkets just outside, this one didnt, so we had to walk about 10-12 minutes to the nearest one. Mildy inconvinient but nothing to discourage anyone from visiting. Now- the only reason I call this a nightmare is because we got robbed on our way to the airport and missed our flights! we stayed in a dodgy motel near the ciampino airport and nearly missed the flight on the next day again, since Rome public transport outside the city (ie to aiports) is really terrible. Be careful with wallets, bags, camerca cos the thiefs can rob you ans you wont even notice anything. This is no reflection on the hotel, as we had already checked out of the hotel anyway- but no body gives you a warning, that there is so so much pick pocketing is Rome, so maybe the hotel should be a good starting point for such info.
