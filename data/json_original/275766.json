Walls are thin where conversations are easily heard; we had to go down to the front desk at 2 am to ask them to call our noisy neighbors to keep it quiet, they wanted us to do it! They don't put on air conditioning in March and it was very warm in the room. You can't leave the windows open because it is noisy out on the street. At times the front desk was curt, don't know if they were too busy or stressed. All in all, this was a good hotel. We will probably try another hotel next time because the lack of air conditioning, thin walls and noisy streets made it tough for us to sleep. If you are a sound sleeper then this place is for you. A native friend of ours recommended Cul de Sac restaurant with an extensive wine list and very knowledgeable waiters. We ordered pate which the French claim to do best, but it was the best we have ever tasted. Fantastic entrees, you will not be disappointed.

Breakfast was very nice. The location was perfect. The hop on/hop off bus is located around the corner. It is close to a metro station.

Wireless is free and works although slow and tedious with passwords on each log on etc. Most channels on my TV had weak or no signal, but you could watch italian news and some soaps and MTV. Two things where not ideal: the breakfast buffet is basic, OK for italian standards (not a breakfast kind of country anyway), but the table cloths where often not clean, and the room overheated (or not air conditioned). The other issue that has already been mentioned by others is the \"upgrade\" to the \"suite\". This is not a real upgrade in my view, since the overall space is the same or less than for a normal room, just that the room is divided into two levels, so you have to walk up to your bed, and down to a small area with sofa and TV, mini bar, bathroom etc. The problem here is that, when it's hot and the air conditioner is running, the warm air is in the sleeping area (up) and the cold air down (sofa, TV). After I was offered this \"upgrade\" I decided against it, and got offered a decent room with equal space, and a little terrace, same as the \"suite\".

This suite was a real problem for me (I have big problems with legs and cannot easily use steps) as there was not lift to the room and the room itself was a room on two levels connected by steps, again very uncomfortable for me. I believe that they would have thought that, BEFORE any change ,they should ask themselves if the room can be used by anyone or it is the case to ask if customer can really use a two level room. Only young couple with no mobility problem could, I am sure. We were given then a \u201cstandard\u201d or I would define better sub-standard room, again with some steps to do after the lift (fewer than for the suite) with no normal windows except a very small one on the top of a wall, which could be opened and closed with a device, while in the bathroom the small windows was not accessible at all ,nor any extractor fan was available, with all imaginable consequences. Neither in the room or in the bathroom was available a hang for clothes, only a small wardrobe in the room. The bathroom was big but with a very very small single washbasin, again with no hangs for towels. The biggest problem was that you cannot set individually the room temperature, it was extremely hot inside and the air conditioner was not working. When we claimed to have a big problem, a man came in our room, closed the heater in the bathroom and said no fresh air was available from the air conditioner and the unique way to freshen up the air was to open the small windows on top of the wall which was in face of the beds (yes also two separate beds\u2026..).Of course we did for a while, but since we could not look out of that high small windows so we feared some animal could enter ,and also because outside was very cold, we had to sleep with the windows completely closed at very hot temperature.

The only weak points of the hotel are as follows: air conditioning in rooms could be better, howver, in their defense we were there when it was 109 degrees F, so I guess that any air conditioning may have not really cooled things off adequately; Wi-Fi was only in the lobby--not in rooms, however, to their credit, the lobby was furnished with a comfortable sofa and chairs (and near a cool a/c vent) so that it wasn't much of a problem; breakfast was just so-so--we've travelled extensively through Europe and have had more varied and sumptuous food, here the pastries were just adequate, there was only stewed/canned fruit, one type of cheese, one type of coldcut (we don't eat meat so we don't know how good or bad it was) some cereal , canned juices and mineral water. I will say that the cappucino was wonderful (as were the excellent coffee candies in a bowl near the front desk), and the service was very pleasant. On the good side--the hotel is right where you want to be midway between Piazza Barberini and the Spanish Steps (at the top), a block away from the Via Veneto. The rooms were very quiet, and although small, were not the uber-small, climb over suitcase small that you sometimes find in Rome (and I've stayed in a few like that). In fact, the triple room that my teenage kids had was a very decent size. The management and employees were most helpful, gracious, efficient, charming and funny, and on balance we had a most excellent and enjoyable stay. I recommend this hotel most highly because price-wise we were able to save a lot over other comparable 4 star properties in the Spanish Steps area or other areas I looked into (Pantheon, Piazza del Popolo, near the Coso, etc.). It cost us 855 Euro for 3 nights in a double and triple room--the nearest competition was over 1,000 Euro for the same type of rooms during the same time period. It gave us some money to be able to afford San Crispino Gelato near the Trvi fountain on Via de Panneteria 42. Also, if you want a restaurant tip--try Margutta Ristorarte (no this is not a typo) at Via Margutta 118. It is a restaurant/art gallery with an haute vegetarian menu--including various tasting menus.

The room was very nice - everything was very clean (i didn't feel disgusted once!) the bathroom was beautiful, the bed was very comfortable, and it was nice to come back to an air conditioned room after being in the heat all day! we took the train and then the metro to the hotel upon arrival into rome - it worked out just fine! we didn't want to do the same when we left in case we might miss our plane, so we took an airport shuttle (not the one the hotel provides) and it worked out perfectly. the one at the hotel is i think, 50 euros, which in my opinion is a lot! plus, it would have been more for us (i think an extra 10-20 euros) because we wanted to leave before 7am. we saw signs walking around the area for airport shuttles and they are much cheaper - if i remember correctly almost half the price. favorite restaurant: fortunato right by the pantheon. absolutely delicious food!!! the best we had in all of rome! the view and atmosphere outside is great and the prices are actually fairly reasonable. we will definitely eat there again if we go back to rome. overall, we loved the ottocento (be aware that there are several albergo's in rome, but the ottocento is probably the best). we would go back for sure and we think that the location and value were perfect.", "Date": "October 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWe loved this hotel\u201d", "Author": "bredo", "ReviewID": "UR5895783", "Content": "My wife and I really enjoyed this hotel.

I'm adding my views given we visited in latter June, when it was quite warm (well into the 90's,) and this hotel was a great respite considering Rome prices. (We knew Rome is hot at this time, but we had a good opportunity to visit...) I should also mention that you are within an easy walk of the Via Veneto and its ritzy hotels, if you want an experience in that kind of cocktail lounge, etc. First, the room is not large, but as I expect for an older, renovated hotel in the central part of a European city (same as Paris, Geneva...) We had a fresh, contemporary room that overlooked the back on a high floor (4th or 5th, I forget,) and was quiet. The bathroom was pretty roomy, with good counterspace and a wonderful jacuzi. Spotless housekeeping. The air-conditioning worked nicely, and better than many places in Italy, where it is often under-power compared to American expectations. Don't expect ice-box cool, but few places in Italy have it at that level. The ground-floor restaurant has good food, good variety, and well-priced for the area. 'Very appreciated on these hot days and evenings: the air-conditioning in the dining room works well. Some neighborhood places claim to have AC, but it just brings the temperature from intolerable down to mildly uncomfortable. The dining room here is very comfortable, and we dined here a few times. (Too hot even for outdoor cafes.) The rooftop lounge and restaurant has a limited menu from the main dining room with some upcharge, and is a nice place for a drink when the weather cooperates. There is a small cocktail lounge, too. The desk staff are VERY helpful, espcially Nicholas, who seems to know everything that is happening around town. While we are great walkers, we often took the metro to avoid the heat or save our time for other things. There is a main metro stop a short walk away in the Piazza Barbarini. I have some minor complaints, but I emphasize -- minor -- for our purposes. The breakfast really could be better, based on our experience of 5 weeks in Europe this year, 2 weeks of which were in Italy. There is a very nice selection of breakfast breads and pastries; cereals; and some meats and cheeses. However, the juice and coffee were weak compared to ALL the other hotels; the fruit could be better; the milk one morning (for cereal) was almost warm; and the steam-table eggs were totally unattractive every day of our stay -- we couldn't bring ourselves to try them. They should forget the eggs and focus on the excellent breads pastries, and upgrading the rest. Also: this was one of the few hotels that did not have easy access to the internet. You COULD go around to the check-in desk, but this felt awkward and inconvenient. Even the other small hotels we visited has a computer for guest use (free or complimentary, whatever) in a more convenient location, if not hook-ups in the guest rooms and/or lounges. We don't need the internet a lot when on vacation, but my husband needed to check in to the office, and he preferred to go to a neighborhood internet cafe. This hotel has so many things right with it, it was surprising that they are not \"with\" this amenity. It would be a good addition to the cocktail lounge (quiet every time we peeked in.)", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesapeake, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!!\u201d", "Author": "Brenda46", "ReviewID": "UR5368322", "Content": "The Ottocento Hotel is a very nice hotel in the middle of Rome.

Buffet breakfast - on the ground floor was ok with plenty of choice. The bar/restaurant on the terrace was very pleasant but extortionately priced - 8 euros for a beer? We made use of the taxi transfers the hotel offered which was convenient. However the drivers in both directions drove like MANIACS.

This was a very enjoyable experience. We wanted our trip to have a good beginning and Ottocento really set the standard for us. (Hotels we stayed in in Florence and Venice didn't come close to measuring up) Although the hotel is small in size, the efforts shown by all the staff were great! The rooms are tiny compared to most American motel rooms but they are nicely furnished and spotless. Anyone who loves redecorating would have certainly appreciated the beautiful plaster walls and color selections. The queen sized bed was more comfortable than ours at home! The bathrooms were the best! Each came with a full tub, with jacuzzi jets for great relaxing after a strenuous day walking in Rome. The best part of our stay however, was the care received from the Ottocento staff. The front desk crew, Patricia, Magdalena and Nicola were outstanding in their efforts to make us feel welcome throughout our stay. They were never too busy to stop and chat, point out the best direction to a destination or in one case, point us to the nearest 24 hour \"bar\" for a needed food emergency at 1 a.m! Everyone at the front desk spoke English very well and the rest of the staff accommodated our minimal use of Italian with a smile. The Ottocento served a lovely breakfast buffet which we certainly enjoyed every morning. Overall, the Ottocento was our welcome place of respite after the hectic pace of Rome each day. It's well located and walking distance from the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain and the Borghese Gallery. Piazza Barberini with a Metro stop is only a short walk away. We would certainly return here the next time we travel to Rome and would highly recommend the hotel for other travelers.

The best thing about this hotel was the location: as close to perfect as you\u2019ll find in Rome without paying a fortune, it\u2019s between the Spanish Steps (from where you can get the metro to the Colosseum/Forum/Palatine Hill in one direction and the Vatican in the other) and Piazza Barberini, and between Via Sistina and Via Veneto, all really close to the best shops. I had a nicely decorated, really small - but for Italy quite large - single room (see photo) that was kept perfectly clean. The food at breakfast was ok, 4-star, though service was somewhat brusque as in most places in Italy, and on Sunday there was no yoghurt. The staff at reception were friendly and eager to please before and during my stay, but they could have done more than they did to make up for a mishap with the car I\u2019d ordered through them to pick me up at the airport so I wouldn\u2019t have to queue for a taxi, because the driver, who went to a different terminal than I\u2019d told them my flight would be arriving at (how hard is it to check flight arrival details on a screen?!), left me waiting a lot longer than I\u2019d have waited for a taxi, and his car was old and unclean (and that for EUR 50, which in hindsight I shouldn\u2019t have paid). A bus tour of the city that I took with a company they recommended was not at all worthwhile; the commentary was very superficial \u2013 just ask your taxi driver the names of the monuments, buildings and ruins and you pass on the way in from the airport and come across in your ambles through the nearby streets and you\u2019ll be as wise.

The hotel is in the perfect location. The rooms are small, not overly posh, but very modern and quite nice. The bathrooms are very nice, although the showers in the 3-person rooms and the 2 person deluxe rooms are quite narrow (and I'm not a large person). The staff is excellent, with the exception of the manager (whom I'm not sure I really know, I'll explain below). My one BIG complaint is that on our second stay there the weather was 35 celsius, that's 95 farenheit, with 100% humidity. Rome is disgusting in the heat. The air-conditioning in my room (305) was not nearly as strong as it should have been, and much less strong than the air conditioning in the other 2 rooms that were being stayed-in by my relatives. To make matters much worse they turn the A/C off at night in the entire hotel. The first night I awoke at 3:45am in a full sweat without any blankets or covers on me. By 4:30 I couldn't take it anymore and went down to the front desk and the gentleman there had the engineer turn on the A/C again. The next day I politely enquired about both my A/C and the hotel's policy of turning it off at night. Someone looked into my A/C and said it was working fine, which it was, but only barely. I mentioned to the day person and the evening person at the desk that I wish they wouldn't turn off the A/C at night when it was this hot. I was told that the manager asks them to do it every night, but they try not to when it's very hot out. That next night they turned it off even earlier, about 1:30 am, but I suspect that someone else complained because it was back on again by 2am, before I got aggravated enough to make the trip downstairs. My point is really that this hotel, while not as expensive as the big names, is by no means cheap. For 300-odd euros per night I would think they could leave the A/C on all night. Perhaps they could have each guest pay 5E more for the privilege of night-time A/C(maybe an electricity surcharge?). I would gladly pay it for a good night's sleep. Most of what I ask of a hotel is a good night's sleep, and unfortunately I was denied that by the Ottocento out of pure shortsightedness. Sorry for the rant.
