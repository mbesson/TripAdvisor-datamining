Without much trouble they gave her a 15% discount. So..... when we checked out and were asked how our stay was, I told them it wasn't great. They asked why -- all about the room being a dump and dirty. They did say they were due for renos in November, but that they had been promised renos for quite awhile now.

I figured we would ask for 1 free night - our last night as we had to pay ~$100 for fri-sun as was race-high weekend. that was given without any hesitation -- they may be too used to having to give this out as more than just our room may be a dump.

When talking to my brother and niece a little bit later, it seems she had told them to tell us to call before we checked in. The people at the check-in didn't tell us that message though. They just handed us the card and said to call her. So we weren't told to call before checking in as she had told them to tell us. I really feel Red Roof owes us our money back because they didn't tell us the right message. I feel it was on purpose. Because when we checked in we also asked if we could have two rooms side by side and they got mouthy and said if we'd have told them that before our arrival we could've. Well I did. In fact I called Friday afternoon, on Feb 28th and the young boy told me we had to wait until we got there. The whole experience at that Red Roof was unpleasant in the short time we were there.
