Having read about the bed bugs from numerous reviewers we were quite nervous about what we would find (almost brought our Marigolds!). The first thing we did on arrival was to check our mattresses carefully. Our fears were unfounded as we did not encounter any bed bugs in any of the five rooms we had on the 3rd floor. Two of our party were allocated a very small, dark room but the lovely receptonist Ross changed us to a more spacious room. He was also most helpful with any queries we had. (I think with this hotel it depends on the type of room you are allocated.) By the way the beds were most comfortable. Yes, the hotel is very run down but for the price and very central location it was OK. Two of our party were at the front of the hotel and were woken each morning at seven by the ongoing work in the street. The others were at the back and could only vaguely hear any noise. We spent most of our time seeing Amsterdam so really we only slept there. Breakfast was adequate. I think this hotel would be more suited to young people on a limited budget who are more prepared to put up with 'little' inconveniences.

On my last night,i was looking out my flight details and happened to look at page two of the booking.com papers and discovered that the company had booked me a twin room and the hotel had put me in the monks' cell single.I went down to the desk to quiz the man who had given me the room the previous saturday, and he gave me some story about the twin not being much bigger than the single and even showed me room pictures on the hotel web site,he did concede that i would have been more comfortable in the twin.My own fault for not looking at the booking properly,but i suspect that it was deliberate action by the hotel to extract as much as they could get for their tawdry rooms, as there was a big convention in town that weekend ,and as i was on my own ,they put me in a single to free up a twin.Shabby treatment,but no more than i would expect from this tired enterprise.It does have one redeeming feature and that is it's location.Avoid at all costs,oh yes,i forgot to mention the bedbugs ,but others before me have already pointed that out.Free wi-fi in reception only.Cost for 9 nights,on a sliding scale 499 euros on sat,139 on sunday,219 on monday,159 on tues,89 on wed,89 on thursday,149 on friday,189 on sat,and 89 on sunday,total 1621 Euros.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but noisy and bed bugs\u201d", "Author": "Artem C", "ReviewID": "UR117785214", "Content": "Keep attention with their beds - i was bitten by angry bugs.

Tiny, badly-arranged room, few lights (those that were there radiated darkness). Bed linens that did not smell clean. No soap or toiletries, two worn-out towels, no telephone (despite elaborate instructions on how to call from room to room), no remote for the small TV (stand up really tall and reach up to punch buttons on top of the set, hung high on the wall; they may or may not do what you want, because you can't see what they are). Internet didn't work and the guys at the desk didn't seem at all bothered by that. Two things really got to me: the toilet leaked all over the floor, from the bottom of the fixture, whenever I flushed it; I asked to be put into another room, but was told they had none. Lots of keys sitting idle in their boxes, but those people were all \"out of the hotel\". But they'd have it fixed by the time I came back from dinner. Did they -- of course not. The topper, and I'll admit this may be a matter of my own personal reactions: in the breakfast room, in a hotel where they serve no other meals, three or four large families were having dinner, with people from those groups moving around the lobby in clearly proprietary ways. It would be no problem (Lord knows) if the staff and owners of the joint were running a decent hotel in order to feed several families. But in fact they were ripping us off, and depriving us of hotel basics, in order to do that, and I just can't get away from the feeling of being exploited in many ways. All of those dubious pleasures cost 107 Euros -- yes, Amsterdam is expensive, but on a busy Saturday night (Ajax playing a big international match) I found a *far* better room, for a lower rate, in a hotel less than five minutes' walk away.

The location is great being just down from Dam Square so it was really easy to get around. We booked a basic double room with ensuite online and when we were checking in 2 men asked about prices for a room which was pretty much the same as ours. The manager answered them in Italian (presumably because we were speaking english and he thought we would not understand) and offered them a significantly lower price than we had paid. When we asked him about it he looked embarrased and said that it was a room in a different part of the hotel and that we probably wouldn't like it, ours was much better. hmmm. It seems that you will get a much better deal at this hotel if you walk in, or maybe call, instead of booking online. The room was ok. The bedspread was dirty, stained, and smelled bad, so i took it to the maid and she gave me a cleaner one. The sheets seemed to be clean. We stayed here for 3 nights when we left I was left with several large and painful bug bites on my neck and back which lasted about 5 days. I told the manager and he asked me what I wanted him to do about it. I asked him to point me in the direction of the nearest pharmacy please and recommended that maybe they have someone come round and fumigate the room before putting any more guests in there. He was polite enough, although he didnt seem to think that the bed bugs were to much of a big deal. Other than that the hotel was nice enough and quiet. The breakfast was pretty reasonable too.

Upon arrival I was encouraged by the friendly staff, who didn't fail to impress once, even at 3am when we arrived back at reception enquiring about how to get to the Amsterdam Arena for our following days outing, the staff were friendly and helpful even drawing us a map. The rooms were quite small and yes the decor was slightly old fashioned but I was impressed with the modern and spotlessly clean bathrooms. None of the rooms had bed bugs, we had three rooms and 10 beds, not one had bed bugs, believe me, I checked thoroughly having watched countless videos and tutorials on how to spot them. Breakfast was basic, but for the price of the hotel we hadn't exactly been expecting a sumptuous feast. The location was good, the shops on one side, ten minutes from the main clubbing and bar area and of course the infamous red light district on the other side, which is a must see for anyone. All in all, we had a great trip, with the hotel being an excellent HQ for us, I would recommend this hotel to any groups of 18-25 year olds who want a good location, comfortable beds and somewhere to wash. If you are looking for luxury then perhaps this hotel is not for you but anyone with any sense would instantly recognise that due to the price of staying here.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting\u201d", "Author": "densmck", "ReviewID": "UR10369265", "Content": "Had my stag at this hotel at the end of September, absolutely disgusting.

There were 4 of us, 3 girls who shared a room and a male friend who had a room by himself. Both rooms were small and dingy. The girls' room stank of stale smoke on arrival (and the smell never really went away as if it had permeated the curtains and the carpet) and the view was non existant since it gave onto an alleyway and all we could see was the wall opposite. My male friend's room was hardly better because, although it gave onto the Rokin, it was very noisy due to the heavy works going on at the moment. The hotel is in dire need of a facelift as the whole place has a grubby feel to it which is very unpleasant. The staff are borderline rude and could hardly be called welcoming. You got the impression that they would rather be somewhere else (and who could blame them?!). The breakfast is OK but nothing special. Amsterdam is a fantastic city and I am sure there are many cheap-ish hotels available so my advice is to look elsewhere.
