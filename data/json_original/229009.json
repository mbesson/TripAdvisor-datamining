The hotel is in a quiet residential area, a 15 minute walk from the hectic tourist areas.Transit from the airport to the hotel was simple. Just purchase the 25 Euro ticket (round trip = andata e ritorno) at the airport machine, and follow the walkway to the Alilaguna Linea Arancio vaporeto. Get off at the first stop, Madonna del' Orto. From there it is an easy 5 minute walk to the hotel. We started each day with the ample and delicious breakfast buffet, which also included a variety of hot dishes to order. The restaurant staff, Bane and Codu, were delightful. We initially stayed in a beautiful room, looking out over the lagoon. Unfortunately, the mosquitos (zanzari) were pleased to join us. The staff was very accommodating, and we moved to a gorgeous room (202) overlooking the canal, where we slept soundly with the windows open each night. The front desk staff (Martina, Philip, and Rositza) were outstanding, and so tolerant of my attempts to improve my Italian. Before we set out to explore Venice each day, the staff would make our dinner reservations. Osteria L'orto dei Mori, Algiubagio, and Ostaria da Rioba were each excellent, and after long days walking and walking, it was perfect to dine nearby the hotel. The staff kindly sent a gift of wine and antipasto to our room to celebrate our anniversary. I only wish we could hear those sweet church bells again now!

I am a platinum member with Marriott and average about 90 nights a year, so I see my share of Marriott properties. Without a doubt, we were thoroughly impressed with this resort. I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews, but in my opinion, i think thte most common complaints are not justified, and I'll explain. First, the hotel staff - we were checked in by Daniel, who was incredibly polite and informative every time we saw him at the front desk - Daniel really impressed us. He took us to our room and answered some basic questions we had, while a porter brought our luggage. We were in room 404, and our room was HUGE compared to what I was expecting! Granted, we were upgraded, but I was still expecting a closet-sized room - after all, we're in Venice! The manager, I can't recall her name, was also extremely polite and friendly, and the entire staff spoke English very fluently. Some people have complained about the hotel's location, but I just dont understand why... It's a 10-15 minute walk to the grand canal, a 7 minute walk to the shops (including a very large grocery store), and there are numerous restaurants within a 5 minute walk... And the Madonna dell'Orto Vaparetto is only a 5-7 minute walk... And the hotel provided shuttle service to St Marks and (I believe) Murano island, although we didnt use the shuttle and rarely used the Vaparetto. Breakfast was included for us at no charge, but it is rather expensive, I believe \u00e2\u201a\u00ac35 per person. We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was very good, although I probably would not have done so for ~$100 USD total. Our room did get a bit warm, and the only way we found to cool it down was to open the window, but it wasnt a big deal. We had a great time in Venice and cant wait to go back, and when we do, we will no doubt be staying here again.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cDon't Ever Stay Here - RIPOFF!!\u201d", "Author": "Adam N", "ReviewID": "UR127605234", "Content": "My wife and I went on a 19 day honeymoon through Italy and Greece and stayed at every type of hotel from 50 Euro hotels to 300 Euro hotels. And even though Boscolo Venice was 200 Euros a night, it was the worst hotel we stayed at. 1) There was no air conditioning and no screens on the windows. So even though the temperature was not too hot at night, because we had to sleep with the windows open mosquitos came in the room the entire night. My wife barely slept and hid completely under the covers the entire night. We had bites all over us for days. 2) The reception staff was not very good. When we arrived they told us that they wish they could do something for us for our honeymoon. That was a nice wish, but other hotels (some much cheaper in price) gave us bottles of sparkling wine and even cake. This hotel did nothing. When we tried to use Marriott certificates to pay for the room (thank God I didn't spend real money on this hotel) they tried to not accept the certificates. 3) The breakfast is Horrible! Do not pay for breakfast here. We got it for free because I am a Marriott Gold member. But it cost 33 Euros for others. The breakfast was barely worth eating, even for free. If for some reason you don't listen to me and still stay here, at least skip the breakfast. 4) The hotel is right next to a famous church, Madonna Dell Orto. The problem is the church rings its bells at the most random times. And they are extremely loud. I remember around 6:30am one morning, I counted the bells ringing over 100 times. There is no way to sleep through it and it happens over and over throughout the morning and evening. The location is far from St. Marks and many of the touristy spots in Venice. We actually liked that. But it is about a 30 minute walk. The boat shuttle is worthless as it only leaves around 3 times a day. There are some local spots around the hotel we liked also. But take my advice and DO NOT STAY HERE.

Due to the hotel being on the side of the airport rather than further south it is very near. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, very good, lovely cold meats, cheese, cereal selection etc - only thing which we both found annoying was on every morning the coffee was cold/luke warm at breakfast. Room facing garden was lovely and very quiet.

Remember that if you don't take a water taxi (which are expensive) you will have to drag your suitcases, over cobblestones and over bridges to get to the hotel. The hotel has its own water taxi, that takes you to St. Marks Square, which is convenient and very fun, but it does not take you back and forth from the train station or airport. It has the largest private garden in Venice, which is totally enchanting, and unexpected. Must be great for weddings. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and gave us excellent tips for dining each night, that were walking distance from the hotel.

We had great weather last week and slept with the windows open and woke up to the church bells every morning. The hotel staff was very friendly and greeted us every morning and every evening when we came in. They answered any questions and offered maps and directions. The hotel garden is beautiful, and I enjoyed taking a cup of coffee every morning to the end of the garden and standing on the pier in the back of the hotel. This hotel is away from the crowds, but there is a grocery store, restaurants, bakery, wine shop, any thing you need very close by. The hotel does not provide conditioner, so if you need hair conditioner, be sure to bring it, or there is a grocery store one block away. There is a spa onsite, and we were allowed to use the spa for one hour a day. However, we did not realize this so did not bring anything to go into the spa (swim suit, etc). From the airport, take the Alilaguna Linea Arancio (Orange line). The Madonna del'Orto (or Orto) stop was a very short (less than 5 minutes) and easy walk to the hotel (flat and no bridges).

We loved it. Its a place to be seen, the atmosphere is fantastic no cars, its so calm and just what we needed as we were so stressed we just needed a break! We stayed at the Dei Dogi Boscolo Venezia, Autograph Collection. What can I say we had a room overlooking the front over the canal it was nice well apointed and comfortable bed. The staff were excellent we got delayed on the flight there and were stuck at Munich airport on the runway for 2.5 hours! So you could imagine when we got there we just wanted to get to the hotel, they had stopped serving food as it was late. However they were really accomodating they had the chef make us some room service we just asked for 2 tomato and mozarella salad, 2 spaghetti, a bottle of water and a bottle of the house white the total was 120 something euros!!! we were shocked until we went into Venice the next day and everything is overpriced! I tell you what though that was the best meal we had whilest we were there the food was spot on even though expensive, to this day I haven't had a better spaghetti. The hotel was nicely located away from the hustle and bustle of the grand canal. It can get very noisey staying on the grand canal. Everything in Venice is in walking distance we should know as my partner dropped our map and we couldn't find our way back to the hotel and walked the entire way across venice! We used the water bus alot its really easy and a cheap way to get around we just bought a 5 day pass. If you want to take a water taxi you pay a flat 100 euro fare. We got a private boat trip to murano glass from the hotel and shown around. Was worth it although its very expensive. We bought a large brandy goblet which costs about 150 euros and is beautiful I have all my glass and tableware to match it now. We went into the Biblica San Marco, what a building it is truely amazing! As you walk around venice stop in the Churches the architecture and detail is amazing and you can go in most of them. We spent alot of time just walking around admiring the scenery so make sure you pack your walking shoes as I forgot my trainers and had to pay 130 euros for some as all I had were my UGG boots and my feet were soaked when it rained and its also very slippy! Like I said everything is expensive so you really have to watch your wallet and make sure you don't over order at dinner. Pick back street restaurants, you will be charged a fortune around the San Marco square 15 euros for a coke kind of thing. When we left Murano glass they gave us there private boat to take us where ever we wanted to go. We asked the driver to take us to a place he would go to eat and he took us to a Seafood place nearby which from outside looked nothing but was really good food and really good price! All in all a fantastic place if you just want to go away with nothing in particular in mind but to stroll around and look at the scenery and see the sights. Pack your comfortable shoes, eat in back street restaraunts to avoid paying ridiculous prices and to be frank not very good food in the main tourist spots. Ask locals if your not sure we do that anywhere we go and always works out well. Avoid later in the season when it rains alot as it floods, we were very lucky and it flooded the day after we left. Places we say to visit are Biblica San Marco and Murano Glass. This hotel is a good hotel friendly staff, well apointed rooms, clean, we got a very reasonable price with the late booking out of season, food was excellent but pricey. You would not be disappointed unless you want to be on the grand canal, its only a couple of minutes walk to the grand canal for those of you who don't care. This is not a place to take children so is the perfect adult getaway which is what we always look for when travelling.

The alleyways are not very well lit so I would not recommend this hotel for solo women travellers (unless the restaurant is open and you don't venture out too late!) Breakfast was fairly poor, maybe due to the kitchens being out of action. But they did offer to cook to order hot items such as full English, scrambled eggs etc, which were ok. Room reasonable size and decor pleasant, kept very clean and lovely toiletries and robes were provided. The staff were fine, not overly smiley and friendly, but not surly or rude either. Location is excellent for being away from the crowds of Venice, and a good choice for exploring the islands of Murano, Burano etc due to the nearby vaporetto stop. I would stay here again as I liked the location, hopefully with the shuttle boat and kitchen working it would have deserved a \"very good\" rating. One thing I did enjoy was waking to the smell of fresh bread every morning - lovely.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTreasure of Venice\u201d", "Author": "Ingham M", "ReviewID": "UR118918839", "Content": "Found this hotel so beautiful I was lost for words..

We had selected this hotel from several options available through American Airlines Vacations when we booked our holiday trip to Rome, Florence and Venice. The reviews were mixed, but since most complaints centered on insufficient air conditioning during the hot summer months, we figured this would not be a problem at New Years. Unfortunately, while the hotel was acceptable, we concluded it was overpriced and certainly our least favorite hotel of the trip. We traveled with our 3 daughters, ages 14, 12 and 9, and had two rooms on the 2nd floor. Obviously New Year's Eve is a challenging day to arrive. The hotel had a large function downstairs, and we had no reason to be upset by the noise from the band and large dinner crowd. Frankly it was fun for our children to watch the fancily-dressed guests. The major issues we had with this hotel were: - poor heating in the lobby and downstairs area. It was frankly freezing inside the reception area. - unexpected charges. About one hour after we arrived, a room service person arrived with tea and cookies at our door. We had not ordered this. We assumed it was a complimentary welcome service - a nice touch! Then 30 minutes later, after we had enjoyed it, another room service attendant showed up with the bill for me to sign. I did not feel like arguing with him about it after a long day of travelling. - expensive breakfast. The breakfast buffet was E35pp. Overpriced for a meal of lower quality than I would find at Denny's in the States. - inconvenient location. I suppose being on the lagoon side would be convenient for some (it's a straight shot on the boat to Marco Polo International Airport), and it's away from the crowds in summer. But it's a long way from the major sites. The walk to the Jewish Ghetto is only a few canal bridges away, but St. Mark's Square is a good 30 minutes' walk. We knew this going in, but in retrospect wish we had found a more convenient hotel. - expensive. This was the only 5-star property we stayed in on this trip, and it was the poorest quality experience. We felt nickle-and-dimed, and definitely did not feel like we had a 5-star experience in the least. I've stayed at many of the Leading Hotels of the World, and can appreciate real 5-star service. But I wasn't feeling it here.

Since we were traveling with a tour group, we got to see some of the other rooms in the hotel. Every room we saw was different being unique in shape, size, and decor. All the rooms we saw on the 4th floor were nice size and elegant, with our room being the largest. One of the rooms we saw on the 2nd floor was tiny! Being an old palace you may end up staying in the King's room or a servants! We didn't try the restaurant at this hotel and had limited interaction with the staff so we cannot comment on that.

The rooms are large and have comfortable beds and reasonably sized baths (especially for Italy). The onsite restaurant was very good, but almost abandoned (except breakfast) when we were there. The recommendations for dining by the front desk were excellent as well. My only real complaint was the poor airconditioning in the rooms. I understand that this is Italy and not the US and that this is a old building with limited room for ductwork and such, but it was really hot (85 d.

Ours had nice bunch of pillows on the bed but if you tossed them on the floor there was no room left to walk except over them. Also no room to leave a suitcase open.

Cheapest way (and most scenic) to get to this hotel is to buy both landbus and waterbus tickets from the kiosk at the airport, which is immediately left through arrival doors. Take the land bus to Piazzale Roma which is the main bus terminal for Venice and cost 3 Euros per person, then take the water bus which is alongside the bus depot on the canal, either No 42 or 52 to ORTO. (The stop is actually Madonna d'el Orto, but everyone calls its ORTO). Be ready at the exit of the boat on arrival, as they qiuckly let people off first, then passengers on, and then they GO! There is no hanging around and you will miss your stop if you are too slow. The water bus tickets are various prices, you can buy a one-trip ticket for 6.50 Euros, or a 12-hour, 24-hour or 36 hour pass. On arrival, to the right of the Orto stop, you will see the back of the hotel awning (no access, only for boat). Walk in a straightish direction, through the buildings facing the bus stop, until you reach a small canal, entrance to hotel is on right. Its only about 4 mins walk. You definately need a map to get around in Venice, the hotel give you one on arrival if you don't have one. You also need the water bus route map. With regards to this hotel, it is beautiful on entrance, the receptionist was very helpful, the gardens are lovely and super to sit in and sunbathe. The bathrooms are superb and the beds are large and comfortable. The bar service we had was first class. The hotel have a complimentary water taxi to St Marks Square, which is really useful, although its only about 20 mins to walk to the main sites, which is fine, as Venice is so beautiful. BUT there are a few issues we found with this hotel - firstly it is very expensive to eat or drink in the hotel (and has to be said, Venice itself). A Gin & Tonic in the bar cost 16 Euros. 4 drinks set us back 53 Euros. The breakfast service was appalling. The food is not much better. Because it is winter, they were not using their outside breakfast area and crammed tables into a small room, which meant standing for 10 mins. waiting for a table in the morning. The breakfast staff are unhelpful and stressed. Coffee was served to us at the end of our breakfast, which was annoying. The cooked breakfast quality is poor. The scrambled eggs are powdered, we think. Awful. Everyone was eating the croissants/rolls and cereal, which says it all. So major thumbs down for breakfast, def. not 4 star! The bathrooms, whilst lovely, with complimentary top-quality shampoo/bath salts/moisturiser etc. bath robes and slippers - had a really weak shower, which dribbled out at best and left you feeling rather annoyed in such a wonderful setting! We had two rooms at the garden end, one was fine, the other was really dark and gloomy. Walls are thin - beware! With regards to Venice itself - what we can we say - Magical. Amazing, Beautiful. Expensive. Bring a big wallet. Bring lots of different layers, as it was 20 degrees one minute, and chilly another, as there is so much shade from the buildings and narrow alleys. We went to the Opera (booked beforehand- Venice Opera House). Loved St Marks, Basilica (free entry) Palazzo Ducale, Bridge of Sighs, Rialto bridge, Accadamia, gondola ride - \u00c2\u00a3120 Euros for 45 mins) if you do this- pick up a gondola away from the main St Marks/Rialto area, as you can get the same ride from the Rialto from the water bus and the gondolas get buffeted around by the water traffic, so ask them to take you somewhere on the quieter, meandering back-street canals, its wonderful.

The people at the front desk also call cabs that are twice the price than if you call them yourself. It wa a huge disappointment and a rip off.

If you insist on water transport, there is public transportation (very easy!) that drops you off about 5 minutes from the hotel. Now, is this a true 5 star hotel? Not in my opinion. I would place this hotel at 4 stars, not 5. Yes, I know this is Europe, but if you are looking for a true 5 star experience, I would recommend Hotel Cipriani or one of the other grand hotels. At Boscolo Dei Dogi, you are getting exactly what you pay for. You are charged 4 star prices, not 5. One look at the rates for Cipriani and you will know exactly what I am talking about. However, I would like to note that this fact in no way detracted from my stay. I would certainly return on a future visit. The lobby is lovely, the staff is very friendly and, good heavens, incredibly good-looking. I am very happily married, but I am not blind - yes, the men were model-like. At least when I was there. Our room was spacious and done in typical ornate/overdone Venetian style. Breakfasts in the garden were lovely and walking the beautiful grounds was quite relaxing.

The architecture is interesting, with some magnificent first floor salons, in the grand Venetian style. The garden is an absolute delight, with a sizeable ancient ice-house amongst the lush foliage.

The heat in this area was unbearable and the air conditioning didnt work. There was a crack in the main floor the full width of the room with stone and dust continually coming out of it, therefore walking around barefott was not an option, this was confirmed when on leaving the shower I felt something under my foot. the chambermaid must have dropped a glass and not swept it properly, I had a large piece of glass stuck in my foot!

Our first stay was brilliant - staff were excellent and the whole experience was superb, hence returning year after year. However, nothing ever seems to stay the same nowadays and over the last 6 years the quality of the hotel and especially the service and attitude of staff has waned gradually but this year has plummeted dramatically. I booked this trip in March and as I am a Boscolo Card holder requested at the time of booking, my complimentary free upgrade to the room we stayed in the previous year. I assumed as this was requested 5 months in advance it had been actioned. Nearer the time of travel I sent an email requesting confirmation of this request - no response - then another a few days later - again no response. So, with fingers crossed we travelled. We firstly flew to Rome and stayed in the Regina Baglioni (we normally stay at the Aleph but after dreadful treatment there - is this a trait of the Boscolo group I wonder....). The experience at the Baglioni was fabulous - we have stayed at countless 5 star hotels and this rates up there with the very best. Superb, attentive staff, great room with excellent air con, great service, great location - great everything really. We then flew to Venice to stay at our 'old faithful' Grand Hotel dei Dogi - yes, it had lost it's excellent status over the years, but we were confident it wouldn't slip further - how very wrong we were... We were greeted, AFTER struggling up the step into the hotel by a doorman/porter in bright white Nike trainers! We went to the desk where we were greeted with indifference by the femail receptionist. No warm welcome at all. I asked her if my request for the upgrade had been made to the specified room and she said no, because that room was one grade above the upgrade - so why wasn't I told this 5 months ago or anytime since that booking and the two request for confirmation so I could have done something about it - payed more to secure it? She said the hotel was full anyway so that was that. I was a little annoyed to say the least but kept my composure and accepted we would have to compromise. Not the best of starts. We were shown to our room and it was awful - small, a very low ceiling, windows set at skirting board level and only half way up the wall, ie a nice view of your midriff for those below but no view for you! Obviously we went down to reception and politely requested if it was at all possible to move rooms - the receptionist was ignorant and put out! This got me seiving inside as I had paid \u00c2\u00a3750 over 5 months ago (and this was with an early booking, pay in full up front discount!) for three nights room only for this 'service' - a not inconsiderable amount. She just kept tutting and shaking her head and showing she was annoyed with us! I then had just about had enough of this attitude, this lack of respect and service and said we'd be more than happy to leave and I would like a refund. She then said we could have the room originally requested(!) BUT we would need to pay another 200 euros PER NIGHT!!!! Thanks for nothing!!!! I spoke to my wife and said spending another \u00c2\u00a3400+ with this hotel was not something I wanted to do so I said no. She then said we could look at another few rooms (I thought they were full?) so, with a heavy heart we agreed. The rooms were in a row - Room one was bad - tiny, dark - no good. Room 2 was only a tiny bit better and a third room was about the same. My wife was getting annoyed so I said room two - bit of a mistake!!! When the porter had gone I went into the bathroom - or should that be shower room!!! Oh dear - my wife likes a bath - me a shower and I assumed all the rooms had a shower over bath set-up but no. I did notice the third room had a bath as the door had been open but hadn't noticed this hadn't as the door had been closed. Yes, my mistake, innocent and understandable I am sure you'd agree. I popped to reception and said appoligetically that we had just realised that the room didn't have a bath and could we move to the third room - well, was she annoyed or what. She huffed and said 'well you didn't ask for a bath, tut,' shake of the head several times!!! There was no, 'No problem sir - certainly you can move to the next room'. A truelly dislikeable, ignorrant, inpolite and rude person as you would ever have the displeasure in meeting. We moved rooms and on closer examination it was shabby, unclean, badly leaking shower screen all over the floors (very dangerous), noisey and ineffective air con, no turndown service (had been every other year), fraying furnishings, dark, noisy - need I go on...) but we were beyond caring - we just got out at every opportunity. On the second night the room beside us was taken and it seemed like a party was going on with at least 4 very raised voices (in a double room - very cosy!) It was like the people were sitting at the foot of our bed! it started a 11.50pm with a huge bang, bang on the nexr door and after much merryment, 2 people left the room at 2am. The 2 people left in the room continued to below at each other until almost 4am! Bad luck I guess... Suffice to say, we will NEVER stay there again. I am sure some people have had reasonable stays there, but take it from me - I've stayed there many times - not like these 'one hit wonders' - 'oh we'll definitely be going back' brigade.

To get from the airport to this hotel, don't pay through the nose for a water taxi and don't spend ages taking public transport and walking. Instead take the Alilaguna Linea Arancio (orange line) boat from the airport jetty. It runs every hour, costs 12 euros and takes 35 minutes.

I have booked 2 rooms for the week-end,stating clearly that I prefer a high floor.As soon as we arrived around midday,we have been assigned one room on the ground floor and another one on the first floor. Both was in the back of the hotel, in order to get to your room you need to walk pass the breakfast room,trough the luggage deposit, then to the small courtyard where the broken furniture is stored... you get the idea.It feels like this rooms where part of storage rooms before, but has been converted to guest rooms in order to squeeze some more money from this dump.In one of the rooms the bed was not done, in another there was a large stain on the bathroom floor - disgusting.The ground floor room had no windows, the first floor one had 2 very small ones that do not allow any light in the room.When I have asked for another room the front-desk staff nearly laughed in my face ! Them said that the hotel was full ( difficult to believe at 12 AM ) and that if some of the guests would not show ( !!! ) them would give me a better room.The reason why we where treated like 3-rd order guests was not explained.Just to add more offence, my frequent flyer card witch entitles me to a free upgrade at Boscolo chain was ignored. Ok, I was trying to do not let them to ruin our week-end in Venice and have accepted what we get.We went out of this \"hotel\" for a walk in the city centre, came back around 22.30, looking for a good rest. I have asked the front deck clerk if a dental kit was available.He told that he will send us one.Nothing arrived.I went out of out room,located the maid and asked her for a dental kit.The answer that I got was : 1 - there are no dental kits available 2 - that she could provide me the toothbrush that them do use for pavement cleaning !!!! She was clearly laughing at me, I was not able to believe my ears!A maid was laughing at guest, in a 5* hotel, after a request of a dental kit !!! I have asked for her name, assuring her that I will inform the management about her attitude - what else I could do ? Went back to my room,and went to the bed strait away looking for a good rest.Has been waken up around 23.00 PM by a very loud music.Called front desk,them put the phone down for 3 times.Insisted,them picked up and told me that there is a wedding going on.I have told them that it was impossible to sleep and the clerk assured me that he would inform the management and find a solution.After an hour I got a call from my friends in the room on the ground flood, the music was getting extremely loud and their 6yo child was crying scared ! I have tried to contact the front desk again,for approx. 20 times - nobody answers.The things was getting worse in the meantime - the music got to the level that it seemed that you are sleeping in the middle of the disco, there was drunk people screaming under my windows,somebody was running in the corridors making unbelievable noise, it seemed that them was trashing the place! Some staff arrived in front of my friends room and started to disassemble some metal furniture - you can imagine how this sounded.Them get out of the room and asked the staff to stop - completely ignored ! At 01.45 I put the closes on, asked my girlfriend to lock her well and got down to the lobby.What I have seen there can not be described.There was HUGE loudspeakers installed, the colour lights and the strobes was on - basically the lobby has been transformed to the disco !!!Lots of drunk people everywhere and so on.I have located the front desk man and asked him to stop this madness.He told me that he can not - he just called the manager and he said that he can not do anything about it too !!!!!

Fresh fruits, juices, cereals, breads, pastries, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, hams, salamis, bacon,an array of cheeses and all constantly replenished by the friendly staff. Coffee is brought to your table by staff who will take your order. The best part of this hotel is actually outside. Follow through the rectangular shaped lobby to the glass french doors and you will find a large covered patio, likely used for receptions. Pass the patio area is one of the most beautifully maintained gardens we had seen, with statues, water features and paths leading to tunnels. At the far end of the graden on the left are more guest rooms which seem to be in their own small villa building. The front desk staff stated they were Deluxe rooms you must request when making the reservation, the highest category of room in the hotel.

At the far end of the garden is a set of iron doors which lead you to the back dock directly on the Venice lagoon.

The boat is beautifully appointed with a closed cabin seating area and uniformed boat captain. Although the hotel boasts a wonderful elegant dinner menu, we were in the mood for a walk and a more casual dinner. Front desk staff not only made a recommendation of a local restaurant but called ahead and gave them our name and asked them to expect us. It was an 8 minute walk from the hotel. We noticed only a few restaurants on our walk so unless you want to venture into Venice by boat for a larger selection, your options will be limited. The food was local fish and pasta dishes as well as Tirumisu and local Venetian cookies for dessert. We watched what the locals were eating and asked questions. We were not disappointed in our selections. We transferred to our next hotel by water taxi arranged by the front desk and were disappointed in having to leave.

However, the hotel did not match up to other 5 stars I've stayed in. Apparently in italy there is a higher class 5 star L, which this hotel is not. The rooms were not as clean as I would expect with crumbs on the carpet and mildew in the corners of the shower. The room service was also very expensive, with a cup of coffee about 10 E. The turn down service was not sufficient either, they only made the bed, did not straighten up the bathroom or bring fresh towels.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cNever again at the Dei Dogi in Venice\u201d", "Author": "FMolieri", "ReviewID": "UR5597901", "Content": "Last May we stayed at the Dei Dogi Hotel in Venice, Italy. We booked this hotel through Hotels.com and must say that for the great service Hotels.com provides to travelers, it is a shame that establishments such as Dei Dogi that do not meet the high standards they advertise to have make a great dis-service to this great website. Dei Dogi proved to be the complete opposite of all it offers to be in their advertisement. Our experience was terrible, almost ruined the entire visit to Venice. Accomodations were less than adequate, even after upgrading to a suite for 300.00 euros more a day. Very shop-worn and upkept, where the bathroom fixtures did not work properly and took them a day to get them repaired after repeated requests. But certainly the most unexcusable part was the behaviour and attitude of the staff towards hotel guests. They were unfriendly, full of comptempt and extremely rude. In short, we wound up leaving Venice a day earlier than planned just to get out of there and not to have to tolerate such unconsiderate treatment. The difference of being in this suppodedly 5 start hotel became even more negatively accentuated after comparing it to the hotels we stayed at in England and Germany, where it became obvious that the art of running a first-class hotel with impeccable professionalism has not been forgotten as in the case of Dei Dogi. We do not recommend to anyone to stay at this hotel, it is to high a price to pay for such a cheap experience.

The staff were polite and helpful and I would certainly stay here again. However - beware if you need to leave your bags in the hotel's safe-keeping before your flight home. Get a receipt - or something: our bags went missing. After a few anxious telephone calls the concierge located them on a water taxi heading for the airport. How they managed to walk out of the hotel and on to the taxi is a mystery. However, full marks must go to the Dei Dogi for the ingenuity of solving the problem.

The garden is amazingly beautiful. The room was sumptuous with marble floors, vaulted beam ceiling, murano glass chandeliers and rich fabrics. The hotel was very elegant. Desiring something more casual for dinner, the concierge recommended 40 Ladroni, a small local cafe on a canal which was popular with locals. The dinner was inexpensive and fantasic. We loved this restaurant so much we returned two nights later. In our thick, soft Boscolo robes, we enjoyed evening wine on the garden patio. We enjoyed our morning breakfast on the patio as well.

Arrived at the Dei Dogi expecting a 5* hotel.. The service of the receptionist certainly appeared to support this, as when they ascertained that this was our first time in Venice, there was an in depth explanation of how Venice works, and how to get about on the vaparetto service.. The lobby was also pretty impressive, with the garden restaurant visible through the lobby. However, once we were shown to our room, I was rather taken aback by the size. It did have a King size bed (two singles pushed together, but this is usual in some hotels in Europe) and a dresser and chair that was so close to the bed that if you pulled the chair out you had no further room to walk round the bed. The bathroom was a tiny shower room, all very tastefully decorated in red marble and gold fittings (well - it keeps in tune with the hotel!) but again, there was very little room to manouevre. We were given the obligatory bathrobes and slippers, but there were no doorhooks or hangers in the bathroom, so we had to keep the robes hanging over the wardrobe doors just outside the bathroom in order to dry them out. We had dinner in the restaurant on Sunday evening and the service of the Head Waiter/Sommelier was impeccable, just like the courtesy and service from the reception staff. The food was ok, trying to be innovative and modern but in some dishes, failing terribly (my starter was scallops wrapped in prosciutto - which tasted oversalted because of the ham, and just overwhelmed the taste of the scallops), and a bit overpriced (dinner for two came up to EUR240 before tips. However, the night was well rounded off by dessert which was yummy! I had the chocolate souffle which is actually a chocolate fondant cake, with a mandarin jelly and scoop of vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend had the tiramisu which was also excellent. We were then given complimentary drinks (caiparinha for my boyfriend and a delicious almond dessert wine for myself), thanks to the prolonged conversations we were having with the Head Waiter about wine and cocktails.. The good thing about this hotel was the neighbourhood of Canareggio. Far away from the madding crowd of San Marco, it took us maybe 45 mins to wander back to our hotel from the piazza.. Taking in the Rialto bridge.. wandering up and through numerous mini-piazzas and over countless bridges that makes Venice so especially romantic.. For those times that we wanted to get straight to San Marco - there is a private water taxi \"shuttle\" service from the hotel that gets you there in 20 mins or so. Very convenient and very swanky - and best of all: free! Water taxis are so expensive that we didn't actually take any that we had to pay for! There is supposed to be a return shuttle service from San Marco back to the hotel, but we couldn't find the mooring. Anyway, it was nice to wander back on foot and take in the sights of the city. All in all - the 5* touches, such as having our bed turned down in the evening, with a couple of jelly sweets left on our pillow, made it seem like a 5* - and the service was excellent all round. But the actual room size and being located on ground floor was a definite negative. We paid a special rate of just EUR215 per night, but it really felt that we were (politely) shoved in a broom cupboard that had been converted into a room for our use.. The next morning however, we saw a few rooms with their doors open, ready to be cleaned by housekeeping and they were EVEN SMALLER than ours! I'm not sure if I would stay here again, I got a taster for real luxury at the Hotel Cipriani (we went there for dinner on one evening) and this, unfortunately, is just not in the same league!", "Date": "August 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, FL", "Title": "\u201cThree star luxury at five star rates\u201d", "Author": "chasmo75", "ReviewID": "UR3704773", "Content": "During our two day stay we had the opportunity to reside in three different rooms due to air conditioning issues and cave-like atmospheres.

We were attracted by the description of the hotel - in a converted palace with period decoration. Essentially, this is true. The Dei Dogi is indeed an impressive canal-side building with relatively large public spaces. It is also very convenient when arriving by water taxi from the airport. I agree with your other reviewers, that this hotel is a little distant from the centre of Venice, but this could be seen as an attraction. In any case, the canal-side walk to San Marco is no longer than fifteen minutes. The rooms were adequate but certainly not generous for the rate charged. The view from the windows was a blank wall. Despite comments from other reviewers, the air-conditioning did work, although this was in winter. Although the food was interesting and the service attentive, the restaurant lacks atmosphere and is massively over-priced There are cheaper and better restaurants locally. A major complaint is the internet booking system, operated by the Boscolo chain, when cheaper deals can be negotiated locally. It is galling to find that you have spent considerably more than your other guests when the website asured you that this was the 'lowest rate'. Despite the local staff being excellent, you will find that courteous but enquiring letters to managers and then to directors, about misleading advertising and charging, remain unanswered. And, do not take the trip organised by the hotel to the glassworks in Murano. It is a scam of which the hotel should be ashamed.

The following morning though the hotel put breakfast in the inside dining room which was particularly nice. The hotel fronts a canal about 15 min walk from the Rialto bridge and 20 min from St Marks square. We made good use of the free water shuttle to St Marks which makes the round trip five or six times a day.
