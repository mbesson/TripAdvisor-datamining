We arrived from a very late trip last week at 2:30am. Our plan was to stay until around 10am and check out after eating a quick \"complimentary breakfast\" and showering in the morning. None of this happened, and we were treated horribly!!! The check in woman proceeded to help other gentlemen who entered the lobby while we stood there in line. Were we invisible??? The room was the size of a box, if you are claustophobic don't even think about staying here. There were two of us and we were bumping into each other to manuever the room. The bed was hard, and the pillows were terrible. Upon waking up after a very rough few hours of sleep, there was no hot water whatsoever, and when we called to compain the manager was very nonchalant in telling us there was nothing he could do and would not issue us a refund. We then proceeded to try and have the \"complimentary\" continental breakfast, but again a complete nightmare. We got to the breakfast room and it was closed. When we went back to the room and called the front desk we were told it closed at 10am. However our room clock stated it was only 9:10am. The room clock was not set to the right time and we used that thinking that of course they would have their local time correctly set up on their clock. When I asked the manager about that she said, we are only responsible for the time if you call and ask for a wake up call. I don't know about you but I'm 36 years old and have no problem waking up via alarm clock on my own. I don't require wake up calls, and the clock should have the local Puerto Rican time on it, as people are traveling from all over the world. The halls smelled dingy and everything looked weathered and dirty. The cleanest place was actually the tub that ironically we couldn't use!!! I arrived home and called the Best Western and also did an online complaint and Sharon Gomez (the manager) was most unhelpful and very unsympathetic. She seemed to want to battle me instead of do her job and please the customer. If she would have be just a bit amount of aplogetic I might have felt better, but she wasn't. About 5 minutes in, our call was disconnected. I have called her 3 times after and left messages and she has not returned one call. End of story, no refund and no satisfaction.

We booked a Queen room for a great managers special rate, which included continental breakfast, and free wi-fi. I found the hotel to be very clean. The room was small, but adequate for a one night stay, It is probably on par with a 2.5 star hotel. There is a Buffalo Wings sports bar (not Buffalo Wild Wings as has been reported) across the street from the hotel and also a Wendy's. We we had a nice dinner followed up by a frosty from Wendy's which was very convienent. Continental breakfast was basic but good, fairly standard fare with cereal, fruits, hard boiled eggs, breakfast breads, coffee and juices. Overall we had a nice stay and we would stay here again Pre-cruise, no complaints!", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmette, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWhat a drag + it's really dark!\u201d", "Author": "siouxtw", "ReviewID": "UR123998683", "Content": "My husband and I stayed there overnight between a late flight from Chicago and a very early one to the island of Vieques the next day, because there were no more flights to Vieques on that date -- which we knew ahead of time. So we had planned our trip to do it this way, since we'd spent plenty of time in the airport in San Juan (SJU) between flights to and from Vieques over the years and had enjoyed the roulette tables in the casino in the hotel. (I usually at least break even.) We figured we'd spend an hour or so in the casino, have dinner, maybe watch some TV and go to sleep. The hotel restaurant's menu -- and the restaurant itself -- looked pretty unappetizing, very dark and way over-priced, so we wound up eating junk food and food we'd brought with us for the trip. Even the junk food places close down pretty early. The room itself was remarkably uncomfortable to spend time in awake: dark walls in a teeny-tiny room. If one didn't have claustrophobia before, this would do it! It was too uncomfortably small to even try to watch the TV mounted in a weird place on the wall or to read! And it was so dark! I am not one who likes a lot of light: we keep the lighting very low at home and in \"our\" rental casa. I have no clear memory of a pool (or maybe it was across from the \"breakfast room\"?): just... nothing to do and nowhere to go. I'm unsure where other reviewers found a pool, or maybe it was just too forgettable. Perhaps the worst part was that the casino had been closed down -- not for renovations, as posted, but because people were going through TSA twice: to get to their gate and get \"settled in\", coming back out to visit the casino, and then going through TSA a second time. (I tend to ask lots of questions of strangers and get the \"real scoop.\") It was still closed on the next trip, and on our most recent trip (12/11) it was totally gone. So there was truly nothing to do -- unless we wanted to cab it to a casino, and we didn't -- especially for just an hour or so, after a long day of uncomfortable flying. Also, we were in \"island mode\": no dressy clothes, etc. Our plan had been to just stay put at SJU, go to bed early and catch our early AM flight. Never again. We would take a cab to a place we stayed on another trip to Vieques (Le Consulat) or somewhere else -- anywhere else! Oh, but it seemed clean enough -- from what we could tell in the dark.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weare, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cPrecruise hotel\u201d", "Author": "ladtvtxrider", "ReviewID": "UR123651347", "Content": "Stayed the night before our southern Carribean cruise..clean, great staff, and saves leaving airport if you already have transferrs to boat..the rooms are small and bathroom is short on counter space, but is extremely clean, free breakfast, free interenet service add a nice touch.

BIG MISTAKE! First off once at the airport you must go down a set of stairs to even get to the front desk. Granted the women working the desk were very friendly and DID speak English, but things only got worse from then on. Just trying to get to our room was difficult - the elevator is so slow you could read \"War and Peace\" completely before it arrives! We were assigned our room - they had us listed for a double, but since it was just my husband and I , I opted for a single. Big mistake! When we tried to get into our room the swipe card would not work. The maids tried with no success. they called the front desk and finally security came and tried and it wouldn't work for them either. Another call down to the desk - finally after many attemps they decided to give us the room next door. On opening the door I felt like I was in a doll house! And not a cute one. They say it had been remodled - the question is when???? We tried to hook into their computer system with no luck at all. Finally about a half hour later their IT man finally came and with a great deal of trouble he finally got our computer up and going. We were forced to eat at the bar and it did cost quite a bit and the selection wasn't all that good. They had sushi but I would not have touched it - it did not look fresh! Since we had no car we were forced to go back to our room (closet) and watch what little TV was available. Nobody told us of any other amenities available at this hotel. We did not find out until the morning when we found - by accident the breakfast room. The food was good and the local coffee great. It was the one good thing about this experience. Sleeping and being forced to stay in that room for the night was like sleeping in a casket! And the bathroom - yes it was clean - but so small it was unbeliveable! It reminded me of some heads on small sailing vessels! The worst thing was that we were stuck in the hotel. We could not go to any of the great shops or food places in the airport due to the TSA screening. Do not stay here unless you have no other choice - especially if you are clostrophobic!. It was an insult to be forced to pay $135 for a 15 hour stay. Never again.... A better option would simply be to go through the screening with the TSA's and sleep in the airport until your flight is ready to take off.

The room was ok size; not tiny but not spacious either. It was fine for two adults but four people of any size would have felt cramped. The bathroom was small but there was hot water when needed and the water pressure was excellent. We were on the 4th floor and the view from our room was of the mechanicals on the roof of the 3rd floor; not scenic at all. The room was clean and everything appeared to work, though we did not use the coffeemaker. The room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heating/cooling unit worked just fine and was very quiet. The room was also very soundproof; even being at the airport, we could not hear the planes from our room and we did not have problems with noise from the hall. The beds, pillows and linens were fine; we had no problems sleeping. The free continental breakfast was fresh fruit, canned fruit in syrup, cold cereal, pastries, juice, yogurt, milk, and coffee & hot chocolate from a machine. The hot items were oatmeal and hard boiled eggs. Everything was acceptable and edible; nothing to rave about but it will fill you up for breakfast. The place gets crowded but the staff kept items stocked. However, someone spilled something on the tile floor and my sister almost slipped and fell because of it; it took a good 10 mins before the staff cleaned it up. There is also a restaurant on site, BJ's Bistro; see it for my review. On the 4th floor there is an outdoor patio area with 2 four person tubs; one warm, one cold though neither had any jets you could turn on. The deck also had tables with chairs and deck chairs. It was a nice place to hang out and soak up the warm, sunny Puerto Rico weather while we waited for our ride. There are also wash machines & dryers to do your laundry but we did not use them so don't know how good they are. Finally check in and check out were terrible. Checking in we had to wait because someone fell on the stairs to the front desk from the airport and he was bleeding. This clearly frazzled all the staff. They told us that had never happened before. Check out was even worse. We saw no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self check out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option and with a mass of people trying to check out (50+ all at once), it took us a \u00c2\u00bd hour to get through the line.

I was expecting a sort of sketchy lace but it was clean, updated and very comfortable. There were two restaurants within walking distance. to my surprise, the hotel also had a fitness room (with newer equipment), a nice breakfast lounge for a free continental breakfast starting as early as 5:30 am, a game room--with pool table--as well as a hot tub room. I really was impressed with how nice the hotel was considering it was located in the airport as was so inexpensive. Clearly the location is great because it's easy to get on a flight, there are no scenic views or illusions of beach front but we never heard a plane and the convenience was awesome! I will most definitely stay here again the night before I fly out.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cNothing Special\u201d", "Author": "JacksonzMom", "ReviewID": "UR25150523", "Content": "The only reason anyone should book this hotel is if they need to be near the airport for an early flight. I was trying to get home a day early and had to go standby on an American Airlines flight. After I couldn't get on I ended up booking this hotel. This hotel is way overpriced but they can get away with it because of the convenience of being right in the airport. The rooms are clean but very narrow. The LCD is smaller than my computer screen which was crazy. The continental breakfast was basic danishes, bagels and hot and cold cereal. There would be no reason for me to ever pay to stay here again, so unless American has to put me up here (which they do for travelers stranded by them) then I would opt for a hotel near the beach.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN San Juan Airport Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g147320-d498911-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_San_Juan_Airport_Hotel-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$131 - $148*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "498911", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/61/4d/83/queen-deluxe-room.jpg"}}
