{"Reviews": [{"Content": "apartment from hell I booked the apartment from the internet requesting parking. When I went to check in there was no one there had to ring for service. There was no parking. I checked the room and decided not to stay as it was so shabby and not clean. We left and found somewhere else. Perhaps it has improved by now.

However after checking in we went out for the evening and returned to our room late still no problems. Iwas there for a training course and had to leave early the next morning when I went to have a shower only to find no towels had been provided or soap. With little time to spare I went to see if I could locate some only to find nobody on site to help. I used the phone system and towels were delivered to the door whils I was at the training session. Still no soap then to find an iron was impossible surely when travelling most people will need access to an iron at some time.I felt that every time I asked for what I consider to be basic neccessities of accommodation I was treated as though I was asking for something way more than expected. We travel regularly at least once a fortnight and I have never stayed in such a poorly maintained building and would not recommend anybody stay there.", "Date": "Jan 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR744198769", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "workingDubbo"}, {"Content": "convenient, but nothing special At a hundred bucks a night I guess that is the norm for the area but i am sure there are better deals out there. The building is old and run down, the room is in dire need of a renovation. The 'hotel' has about ten rooms in the 10 story apartment building. The room provides a roof over your head to be in a good area but not much more, although the beds were quite comfortable. The front desk guy was very helpful and nice. We checked in early so the desk was unmaned but he came right down and helped us with all our directions and the lay of the land. Public transport is very convenient but becareful when looking for the address when getting off the bus because opposite sides of the street don't corespond with the other and we had to walk back up the street to get to the apartment. If you are looking for something basic with a small kitchen and don't mind the bill then it is okay.", "Date": "Jan 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR164286803", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "nate&kell"}, {"Content": "Excellent Choice We stayed here for 4 nights in October. Most accommodation in Sydney is quite expensive for the budget traveller so these apartments in Bondi were a great find. We had a small kitchen, sitting area and bathroom- which were all clean and tidy.It was a 15 minute walk to Bondi beach (buses are available) and a 12 minute ride into sydney from Bondi Junction. It takes 20mins to walk to the station.The reception people were very helpful and provided us with maps and info and also booked us a shuttle to the airport.When arriving at night (like we did) the reception is closed. However there is a 24hr number to call which you do from a phone inside the foyer and they disclose the whereabouts of your key etc so you can swipe through the security doors and access your apartment.Would thoroughly recommend these apartments to stay in.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR804817705", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not Impressed! My husband and I arrived at the Waldorf Serviced Apartments on Bondi Rd, Bondi to stay 2 nights. The first thing was, the building - It was so old and horrible looking right on the main road (which we later discovered was a good thing). There was noone at reception desk and we had to use a phone to access the 'caretaker' of the building. The caretaker who greeted us was the best thing about the place. He was warm and welcoming and had a smile on his face. His name is 'Dusty' if you ever go there say hi from Minnie and Al. When we checked into our room, we discovered how spartan and unclean it was. The floors were dusty and appeared unmopped and the dresser drawers were dirty and had a few dead insects in them. The ONLY redeeming part of this whole experience was the public transport system and restaurants close to the apartments. The buses were very convenient and arrive every 3 minutes. We took bus regularly to Bondi Beach and Bondi Junction which was enjoyable. The restaurants around Bondi are fantastic and quite reasonable. These apartments are good if you're a young person or backpacker. Don't go for a 'romantic' getaway or definitely NOT for a family. If you're into 'budget' accommodation without the frills, then go and stay here. It would be great for young single people looking for cheap accommodation.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR612588765", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Ozlem"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d594948-r19037448-Waldorf_Serviced_Apartments_Bondi-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "594948", "Price": "$72"}}
