Situated in an dark and backstreet alley with no shops or activity around, the hotel entrance looks more like the entrance to a housing estate. I have a room on the first floor and the corridor is lit by red lights shining on the room numbers. I feel like I'm renting by the hour! The room smell of disinfectant, the type used in hospitals and to compliment that feeling the floor is plastic white, a curtain separates the bathroom from the sleeping area and the massive window in the bathroom looks out onto the back of very shabby housing. Although you can cover most of the Window with a curtain there is a circular cut out in the shaded glass right in the shower area. I'm sure as a woman you'd be very happy taking a shower knowing shanty town is looking right at you! There is no desk or Internet so business travelers stay well away.

Its down a dodgy street so dont stay here if you are looking for a \"view\" from your window. It is by no means dirty or anything - actually spotless clean at all times. We found it quite modern which we loved as we are into that type of thing but could be a little \"cold\" if you dont like all that stuff. Be careful if you are not fond of stairs or are not very mobile as our room (Room 8) was a studio which had a VERY steep spiral staircase to get to the bedroom upstairs. On entering the room, you are straight into the bathroom area where there is a seperate glass door into the toilet and a glass panel (which is not frosted) into the wet room / shower which is not very private at all. The bedroom which was quite small was upstairs. We found it ok in size. We stayed for 3 nights, it may have felt a little clostraphobic if we had to stay much longer. I wouldnt recommend this hotel for families. It had a small dining area which was casual - ie.. not to use to sit down for a formal evening meal, but great for breakfast or luch or a snack during the day. We found this hotel quite charming - even though we stayed here in winter, so I can imagine it being twice as nice during summer as it has many areas within the bar/lounge which can be open air during those months. It also has a roof top terrace which opens in summer also which looked quite cool. We didnt have breakfast there so cant comment on food. It is in a good location - bout 5-10 mins walk to centre of Las Ramblas. A taxi from El Prat airport to the hotel cost us \u20ac35 euro so maybe using local transport may suit better if you want to save on that. If you are staying here in January / Feb 2012, please make sure you contact the hotel and ask if the \"construction\" is still in operating right outside - if so, make sure your room is not directly on this street as the noise of Kango's started daily at 9am. Its only work on the street outside so maybe only short term but we found it a pain in the butt. Also, no Wi-Fi for the entire time we were there - even though it was advertised everywhere.

We didn\u2019t find the part of the street the hotel is on is particularly seedy. However we go to Barcelona often and are very used to the Raval area. Our first impressions of the hotel were not very good. We found that the room, on the fourth floor, was on the small side with barely enough room to walk around the bed and a badly designed wardrobe. Also, although the hotel is new the room doesn\u2019t look very new anymore, with white marks on the toilet\u2019s black walls, stains on the bathroom floor and rust at the base of the sink. However, the room was very clean and the bed comfortable. When we entered the room it was extremely hot and stuffy. The window does not open so I tried to switch on the air conditioning unit but it was blowing hot air instead of cold air even though it was on the cooling setting. Also the room safe didn\u2019t work. The person at reception told me the air conditioning was turned off in winter because \u201cat the moment it is 6c outside\u201d. That day it was 17c ... He said he could change us room but that would probably make no difference because all the rooms were the same. I insisted we needed a functioning safe so he called the technician who came to our room right away to check it out and said he could fix it or replace it in the afternoon. When we got back to the room later that evening the safe was indeed fixed and the room felt much cooler and we had a good night sleep. The next morning we slept quite late and just after 12 received a phone call from reception to tell us we were supposed to leave the room by 12. I had to explain that I made a reservation for 4 nights so we were not leaving that day. 5 minutes later a lady knocked at our door to ask us again when we were leaving... we were not very impressed.... However, I have to say that despite a bad start we quickly warmed up to the hotel. We got used to the design of the room and absolutely loved the rain shower. The hotel has a nice solarium on the roof and a very nice breakfast/meeting room/ bar area. We did not have breakfast at the hotel but went to the bar one evening and really enjoyed it. Also, the hotel location was perfect for us.

Despite this, we found the location very convenient, within easy walking distance to the old port, Montjuic, metro stations and most of the attraction of Old Barcelona. Service at reception was pleasant and helpful, if understaffed (one receptionist only between 11am and 2pm which surely must be one of the busiest times in terms of arrivals and departures), resulting in quite long waits. The staff in the restaurant/bar/breakfast area were particularly pleasant and helpful. The hotel has clearly been built and furnished to a budget, with some unexpected finishes in places (concrete paving slabs in the lobby; IKEA furnishings in the restaurant and lounges) although the overall design is interesting and playful and hangs together quite well. Some customers might dislike the bathing arrangements, the shower being situated immediately against the external (floor to ceiling) window, which, despite partial frosting, did not provide privacy. The first major problems emerged in the bedroom (we were initially given keys to Room 119 on the first floor). Despite fresh bedding, the condition of the room was totally disgusting: fresh dirt on the floors; unclean toilet; scuffed and dirty walls; and an external window so filthy that you could barely see through it. This was not a room that one would feel at all comfortable walking barefoot in, and we rejected it straight away. We were (relatively quickly) provided with keys to another room on the 5th floor (507). This was much better and brighter, and appeared at least to have been cleaned at some point within recent weeks. The bed itself was very comfortable, and the room quiet and reasonably well ventilated. Breakfast was excellent. Good coffee, a wide array of cheeses and cold meats, and great hot selection. Looking back at the hygiene issue, part of the problem with the rooms in general was the floor finish: a white, marbled linoleum which scuffs and stains easily and which, without regular cleaning with bleach, can quickly look unpleasant. Unless management has understood this and commits to maintaining it properly, together with raising standards of cleanliness generally, this hotel, despite having much to recommend it in terms of location and convenience, is not up to European standards and should be avoided.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochdale, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel and nice staff\u201d", "Author": "Alex F", "ReviewID": "UR119498917", "Content": "I took my girlfriend away for a surprise weekend break in March 2011 and we stayed at Acta Mimic.

The hotel is very modern, with a minimalistic look. The breakfast was very good, almost excellent, and the staff very helpful and polite. One of the main problems with our stay were the lifts. During our 5-day stay, the main lift was broken. So we had to make do with the small one, that carries up to 4 persons. This, combined with the fact that the lift was kind of slow, resulted in us waiting for quite a few minutes to catch a lift. Probably, when the main lift is fixed, things will be much better, although there will still be a problem, since the lifts work completely independently, with different call buttons for each one, instead of being synchronized, to allow the empty one to come first. The other little problems with this hotel are in the room. First of all, the toilet is situated in a dedicated little space by the room door, while the sink is situated across the room, in the shower area. This might be a problem for some people. Another thing is that the external wall of the room is all-glass, with a part of it (the part near the shower) made of frozen glass. This allows light to fill the room very nicely, during the day; during the night however, with the lights on, someone from the outside (as we find out ourselves as we approached the hotel on the way back from a night-out), can see the figure of the (nude) person taking a bath, or drying his/her hair (since the glass wall near the hair dryer is normal, not frozen, glass. But the biggest problem of the room (and this happened every day to both us and to a friendly couple living in another room), is that there is not a window you can open to let the air circulate. Therefore, after having a hot bath, the room is filled with moisture. The room has ventilation; however, this did not prove to be adequate. After returning to the room, after several hours out, when we opened the door, we immediately felt the moisty and dense atmosphere in the room. Unfortunately, I would probably NOT recommend this hotel to someone, because of the problem with the air circulation in the room (since I think all the other problems are minor, and overturned by the good aspects of this hotel, like its polite staff, its nice design and its excellent breakfast).", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gibraltar", "Title": "\u201cCannot really expect much more from a 3 star\u201d", "Author": "GibonFire", "ReviewID": "UR109497614", "Content": "Does what it says on the tin...Its a 3 star and you get everything you expect from a 3 star really...

I stayed at this hotel from the 23rd April 2010 until the 27th April 2010 4 nights in total. As an overall general experience the hotel itself is fine and offers as it says a very minimalistic experience. The hotel location is good although our taxi driver did not know it and I had to direct him from the airport, but it is a reasonably new hotel and does not sit on one of the main boulevards. The location between La Rambla and Av Del Paralelo is very convenient with easy access to the Metro network via the L3 at the Drassanes station. Most touristic attractions are within walking distance. The reception area is small but continuously manned 24/7 and leads to two very small lifts that then take you to the accommodation floors and the bar lounge area located below the reception at -1 level. The front entrance is controlled by the reception staff through electronic door management allowing for a level of security to the building. The hotel security is however let down by access to the lounge and bar area being gained through a spiral staircase situated outside of the hotel that has no form of access control during normal bar hrs. This entrance is visible from the reception desk but the reception can be busy and access to the hotel could be gained easily. This coupled with the lifts not being room card operated means that potential intruders could access the accommodation levels within the hotel via accessing the lifts from the bar lounge level. The hotel itself could represent a high risk of rooms being broken into (Although I am not sure/unaware if this has happened). The rooms do however have a reasonably large electronic safe that will hold a 15.6\u201d size laptop. The 2 lifts are very small and as previously mentioned and are not operated through key card control. The lifts although side by side in the reception area are not synchronised in any way and are operated separately through utilising separate calling buttons. This is not such an issue on the reception floors but does become and inconvenience on the accommodation floors where the same lifts open back to back. This results in in some lift chaos. The rooms at the hotel were clean and tidy and did receive a reasonable level of housekeeping service each day with a daily towel and bedding exchange. Due to the minimalistic design there is very limited storage in the rooms with a small railing being available with 6 hangers for clothes and a small shelve above it (This is the storage in total). There are no drawers in the Rooms with bedside tables literally being plastic tables with open legs. The toilet facility is separate the shower and washing area and is situated either side of the main accommodation area. The toilet room lacks a sink for washing hands and results in that you have to then open the door from the toilet facility room to then access the washing sink at the other side of the room. This is inconvenient and not a particularly a hygienic approach to hand washing. The shower area is separated from the sleeping area by a glass partition but does have a curtain to ensure a level of privacy if required. The shower itself is very good although it does flood into the wash-room area adjacent to it. There is good use of mirrors within the design of the shower room area. The shower room does sit next to the outside window which is full length glass which is frosted in areas to help maintain dignity where necessary. It does however allow you to see outside whilst showering and for a good level of light to enter the room. This may not be to everyone\u2019s taste but I am convinced that it is not possible to see in from the outside even with internal lighting on. The only disappointment about this is that the hotel has no views to mention from the rooms. The Room I was based in was starting to look a little shabby in general and for a hotel that was only 10 months old was a disappointment. This is mainly the walls and flooring of the room which is generally associated with the a cheap internal fit out. It does not help that the walls are all white and easily retain and show marks etc. I have stayed in numerous minimalistic hotels which have been great but the rooms in this one did have a very, very cheap design feel to them. The walls are very thin and you can hear you neighbours showering and using the toilet facilities which is not good. The main disappointment however about the room was that there were no windows to open allowing for some quick fresh air circulation (Although I am sure the air change in the rooms are very well mechanically controlled). The hotel offers a laundry service which I must say was disappointing as it took three days for it to be picked up and laundered as the laundry is collected and managed off-site. The quality of the laundry when completed was good but was very frustrating due to it being some three days later than when required. The hotel lacks any atmosphere and although has a very chic and vibrant designed lounge and bar area if feels almost lethargic in its ambiance. The staff at the hotel were good and responsive and could not be faulted in anyway and went out there way to help where needed. I think the hotel would be better for a 1 or 2 night stop as it is which I must say is my own perspective as not comfortable enough for a longer stay. The Hotel lacks some usability thought and a higher level investment in the internal design process.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malmo, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "SophieAr", "ReviewID": "UR104252505", "Content": "Good location, cool rooms (quite small), very clean, comfortable beds, nice staff, great breakfast.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, quirky, modern, comfortable and perfect location\u201d", "Author": "Patsydoody", "ReviewID": "UR102860414", "Content": "I liked how it's not like your typical hotel with a generic feel and generic rooms, it's quirky and modern and that bit different.
