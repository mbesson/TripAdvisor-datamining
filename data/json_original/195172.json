I used to live in London for several years - I know there's a limit on space, but when you advertise a triple room in a space of just over 20m sq, you know you're not delivering a decent product. For the price that they're asking - look elsewhere. Just down the road is a fantastic NH hotel which we changed to after the second night (we asked to be uprgaded for the second night we stayed as it was impossible for us to be comfortable when there are 3 adults with the beds butted up against each other and a single 80cm wide corridor to store our luggage) which will offer you so much more for less money! The hotel is operated (and presumably owned) by an Indian gentleman who seems to only employ Indian people who find it completely normal to have avid conversations in Hindu right in front of you as you stand there for 2 minutes before being greeted. They told me I had to pay in advance, had already charged my card while I was back in Australia without my authorisation and told me what I could and couldn't do. I work in a 5 star property and have been in the luxury hotel industry for 9 years now. Funnily enough, the rubbish he was telling me about how he couldn't refund me because of the computer system he uses was in fact the very same system I have used in each property I work at so this hotel was deemed remarkably unprofessional in my eyes when I had to tell the man behind the counter how to do his job properly and advise him that I didn't appreciate the lies he was telling me and that I know for a fact how to rectify the error and continued to then explain to him where to go on the system to do this. In summary - you do not get what you pay for - this hotel is ridiculously marked up just for the location which is nice, but not essential. Everything in South Ken is so close I highly recommend you stay elsewhere and the lovely streets past cafes and pubs. To be paying as much as we did for a tiny and cramped room with incredible mould growth throughout the bathroom was an error of our judgement.

When we arrived, it couldnt have been close enough, it was across the road, you couldnt get any better than that. On walking in was lovely, they smiled, and asked how we were. We had cards to get into the room, they explained how the cards worked for the lift, told us that there was breakfast, i think breakfast was extra, so ask, and make sure. it was lovely clean inside the lobby. we paid \u00a3124.00 for 1 night. I would expected the breakfast to be thrown in for that, what they did give me was there card, so if i booked again, i would put this number in, and get a discount, by booking direct with them. I booked through booking.com so it was there prices, i wont do that again, saying that london hotels are not cheap, so make sure you look around. We was given 4 single beds, which was great for us,,There was 2 adults and 1 child. it was very clean, no dust, we all slept very nicely. couldnt really open the window, i left it open, and when we came back, it was cool, so it did its job. We was 5 minutes away from the station, also Boots was there, incase you needed anything, Also resturants too. There was a safe in the bedroom, which was a added touch. the bathroom was lovely, with the added bonus of little bottles of shampoo/body. it might be small for eveyone else, not for me, we had a loo, lovely large sink, with mirrors all around, and a large shower, and beautiful hot water all the time, i was the last one to get in there, and it was still running hot, now thats a bonus, usually hotels run out of hot water, and then you dont want to get in because it too cold. we had 301 room, it was longways how it was set out, 2 flat tv's, a desk, with a hairdryer in the draw, so u dont have to carry one in your bag. A kettle with all the cups/suguar/milk, which is good especially for london, as they would want to charge you if you wanted a cup of tea. There was a bar also behind the desk, so if you wanted a drink which was nice. a computer also with wi-fi. We didnt hear any noise at all. We all loved it, and will be coming back soon. we didnt use the resturant, so i cant mark on that, so i wont run it down because its not fair, they made our day/night very special, thanks. also they had fish nemo was in there too", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cEden Plaza half term London Museums trip\u201d", "Author": "TalkCheshire", "ReviewID": "UR124703504", "Content": "Old Building with fully modernised interior, our room 2+1 was small but very clean and functional - ideal for short stay and staff were welcoming.

I booked my room a month before my stay and got an email confirmation of the booking. When I arrived, they told me they had tried to process my credit card and the payment hadn't gone through, and when I didn't arrive before 6pm they had to cancel the booking to ensure they would fill the room (6pm was an arbitrary deadline: they hadn't asked for an expected arrival time, and I arrived at 7pm as planned). It seems highly unlikely that they had actually tried to process my card, as I used it successfully in other places on the same day, both before and after they claim to have tried to process it, and there was more than enough credit available for their booking. When I asked why they hadn't tried to contact me about the failed payment, they said that they did not have my email address because I'd booked through a travel agent. This was untrue: I had booked directly through the hotel's own website, and received confirmation from the hotel's email address. I had the printout of the confirmation with me, and although the hotel manager kept talking over me to try to avoid answering my questions, he eventually admitted that the confirmation email had come directly from them and that therefore they did have my email address. He then changed his story and claimed that there are simply too many failed payments each day for the hotel to email every guest to investigate. Again, this seems highly unlikely; even if it were true it would suggest that the hotel staff are simply incompetent and/or the hotel is inadequately staffed. Regardless, I asked why they hadn't tried to call me instead, and the manager said that they didn't have my phone number. This was easily exposed as another lie, as my phone number was there on the printed email confirmation! By this point, I was very angry and demanded they give me a room, and the manager laughed as he told me the hotel was full. Eventually he booked me a room at another hotel, and told me to run for the bus which was just going past outside so I could reach it. At no point did they offer an apology or try to make amends: the least they could have done would have been to give me a taxi ride to the new hotel, but instead I was being told to run through the rain to the bus! The manager even told me that I was lucky to have gotten a good rate with them by booking in advance, but there is nothing particularly \"lucky\" about getting a standard advance rate (of the sort offered by very many hotels), even less so if the room is cancelled without my knowledge! I suspect the hotel had deliberately overbooked, cancelling guests who were paying a lower rate if they didn't arrive by a certain time. My colleague, who is paying a higher rate for the same room, did not have his booking cancelled, although he arrived later than I did. In summary, they cancelled my booking for no good reason, lied to me about it, and were unapologetic and rude afterwards. I experienced no good service of any kind in my short encounter with Eden Plaza, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There was a happy ending to the story: in the end I did get a taxi to go to my new hotel, and the driver very kindly gave me a free ride after hearing what had just happened. I only mention this to give credit where it's due, and to show that this obnoxious hotel manager's behaviour is by no means typical in London.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Izmir", "Title": "\u201cSmall Rooms, Convinient Place\u201d", "Author": "karsiyakali_eatl", "ReviewID": "UR115881131", "Content": "We pick this hotel for our London visit because we want to be close to most popular places (at least walking distance to major underground station) and we'd like to stay in a safe district.

We would rate this hotel as value for money in a brilliant location for sight seeing.

The Power shower was WONDERFUL with plenty of hot water! The beds were nice and firm. However, the rooms were quite small and noisy. I don't know if it's because we got 'bargain rooms' or not, but our Double room was between floors in the stairwell, and the double bed was shoved against the wall, with little floor space. The Twin room for the teenagers had the beds end to end on one wall. The hotel is situated on the corner of Queen's Gate and Cromwell, and the traffic seemed non-stop, even on a snowy weekend. (Having our iPod with speakers and playing a white noise (ocean waves) helped us to go to sleep with the traffic noise. For our teens whose room did not face the street, they had problems ALL night with very loud and noisy neighbors. (They now know to call the front desk in this case, for future reference.) The location was across the street from the wonderful Natural History Museum, and in between two Tube (Metro) stations. I think the Gloucester Road station is closer, with great places to eat and quick shopping for necessities. We ate at Paul's Patissierie, the great little restaurant two doors down from Paul's for breakfast (went there twice but cannot remember the name) which had fresh squeezed OJ. The Stanhope Arms pub was wonderful as well, for atmosphere, food and drinks (we found out later that they had cheaper breakfast)! We had a delightful trip in London during the snow storm, but would have also liked a restful, QUIET night's sleep. If noise doesn't bother you, this is a great place to stay as the beds are not worn down and the shower is wonderful. It's in a beautiful neighborhood of Kensington in London and convenient, and the staff was friendly. I hesitate to recommend due to noise, but it was a decent price and nice and clean.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Townsville, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Affordable, Clean and Newly Refurbished\u201d", "Author": "HappyAussieCamper", "ReviewID": "UR88657770", "Content": "I didn't know what to expect when I booked this hotel.

As you walk down the road it is last corner on the left before the start of the history museem on your right. Its the ideal place to stay as there are restaurants near by and things to do. Hotel- I think it has probably been done up quite recently, everything is new and stylish. The lobby is Clean, tidy with a smiling face ready to help and welcome you. The room was a little small, long and thin. It was fine for my mother and I just for a weekend but if your staying longer its not ideal. The room was clean and tidy and kept that way. Our beds were comfortable, had a lovely en-suite. Again it was small but enough- Shower was amazing! Staff- They can't do enough for you.
