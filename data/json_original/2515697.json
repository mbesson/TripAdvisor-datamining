Our second week we spent at the Monte Carlo in Las Vegas which was a 4 star hotel and though the Holiday Inn's room may not be quite as big or \"pretty\" we felt the Holiday Inn's value outshone Monte Carlo. We had Wi-Fi in the room - which is helpful when you are not travelling with laptops but only smart phones (Monte Carlo offered high speed internet by way of plugging in a cord - not helpful when you have a phone and not a laptop with you). We always had replenished toiletries and more than enough fresh towels. Room and bathroom was very clean and beds comfortable. Holiday Inn offered coffee facilities in rooms and had good TV channels. Holiday Inn offered a laundry room where guests could do their own laundry at no major cost - a few quarters and it was all done. Furthermore, they have an in-house restaurant and shuttle bus which took guests to \"hot spots\" (Seaworld, etc) within 3 miles from hotel free of charge. Two computers with internet access were stationed in their waiting area near check-in and was free of charge. My husband needed emergency dentist services and upon request the hotel staff assisted in finding a local dentist and made the necessary telephone calls on his behalf. The only tiny negative experience we had was when we checked in: the person on duty could not find our our booking but we showed our voucher, she made a telephone call and then found us a room. As for location. This hotel is not close to the harbour area but well situated for getting to the Gaslamp Quarter and less than 10mins walk to the local shopping mall, Horton Plaza. We managed to walk from San Diego Zoo back to the hotel via Balboa Park. It was a beautiful day and we enjoyed the sightseeing on our way back to the hotel. It took about 15-20min walk from the hotel to the harbour area but that was probably because we were sightseeing on our way and therefore in no rush.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommend\u201d", "Author": "Hinky12", "ReviewID": "UR126302698", "Content": "If I return to San Diego, I would definitely stay in the Holiday Inn Express Downtown again. The employees go the extra 10 miles to make your stay in San Diego pleasurable. Midge is the very visible customer relations agent who not only welcomes you at breakfast and in the lobby, but gets to know the guests and does what she can to ensure the comfort of all the guests. We heard another guest say that Midge brought a cupcake with a birthday candle to their room when she heard there was a birthday to be celebrated there. The front desk receptionists always, (and I really do mean always) had a smile on their faces. They all serve as concierge as well front desk receptionists. No one that I talked to ever had to wait, and the receptionists called cabs, the zoo, restaurants, the bus and trolley line, and museums to help with travel arrangements for us. (Special thanks to Zulya and Martha.) There is a free shuttle (actually the hotel has two) and these will take you to the airport, cruise port, the Amtrak station, the zoo, or Balboa Park anytime you schedule them ahead, and on the spur of the moment if they are free. There are warm, freshly baked cookies in the lobby to welcome guests every evening. There is free wine and beer for two happy hours every afternoon. Every morning they provide a free hot breakfast with pancakes, biscuits and gravy, bananas, cereal, warm cinnamon rolls, pastries, coffee, all kinds of juices, eggs, and bacon or sausage. If you can't take time for breakfast, they give you a \"to-go\" bag with water, fruit, cookie, and granola bar. The hotel is three blocks away from a San Diego trolley stop. The hotel is an older building, but it is very clean, and the rooms are large. It looked to me like the carpet in the halls was new. I am sure the carpet in our room was new. Most rooms have a private balcony. Our room had a refrigerator, and we didn't even ask, so I assume they are standard. Wi-Fi was free, and worked great! We walked outside late at night (between 11 PM and midnight), and were not afraid in the least (we being two single women). The reasons I didn't give this hotel 5 stars is because it is an older hotel, the bathroom was small, the only sink was in the bathroom, and there is no room service or restaurant in the hotel.

The hotel manager made several appearances as well, inquiring about her guests stay and making sure everything was to their liking.

There are plenty of restaurants and grocery stores located in close walking distance from the hotel. We had a mini-refrigerator in our room so we could by some beer and wine locally. The only negative issue we had was with the free internet. I had a good 4 bar signal but the service was very difficult to log onto requiring multiple attempts and once connected it was so slow it was really unusable. I fortunately had my aircard along so we just used that instead. The manager did ask us if we had any problems with our stay during one of the happy hour receptions. We mentioned the slow internet service. She asked if we were on the third floor, which we were, and she said they were aware of the problem and were working on a solution.

I found an online rate through AAA for about $99 and then called the front desk to see if they'd match it; they looked it up and did so. The walk-in rate was much higher. I was very happy with the cleanliness and the staff of the hotel. Our main activities for the week were in Balboa park so the location was a big plus. I especially liked the free internet-use computers, internet access in my room, and the breakfast. The breakfast included things like cereal, muffins, microwaved scrambled eggs and something I'd never seen before, an automatic pancake-making machine. The breakfast room, however, was a bit smallish - less than 50 - compared to the number of guests. In general, I've rarely encountered a hotel situation where I just HAD to spend over $100 on a hotel to be happy. If I pay over $100, it's because I think I'm going to get something extraordinary. I don't see any evidence that downtown San Diego is any exception. If I go back to downtown SD and can't get Holiday Inn Express for under $100, I'll probably pick someplace cheaper; there are just so many hotels. So I'm glad I had a discount and was happy for the price. That being said, I was irked (although not surprised) to pay $18 to park in their underground parking garage. It irks me because I don't believe they incur anything like $18 in cost for me to park there overnight - maybe $1.80. In my view they are taking advantage of people who wouldn't know where else to park and they amp-this-up by giving you a somber warning at checkout that it's risky to park overnight in downtown open lots, which might be somewhat true. The only reason I tolerated it at all was because it didn't look like the parking garage could hold enough cars for every guest to park there - if parking had been free, I probably wouldn't have gotten a space. I don't mind paying for scarce resources; it's simple supply and demand. But the parking was 50% vacant, which tells me the management team needs to lower the parking price. $9 parking would have made this place \"Excellent\" for a $99/night price.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cThank You!

Also, the breakfast is below average. Other reviewers have mentioned the good location - this is true. It's 10 mins. to everything.

It sits atop a hill which affords great views, even though the building is only three stories high. It is between the Gaslamp District and Balboa Park. TIP: If you have any trouble negotiating the very steep sidewalk up to the main entrance, just enter the parking garage on Sixth Ave., and take the the elevator up. The free shuttle service is a tremendous amenity and will take you most anywhere downtown, as well as to the airport. Saves a bundle in cab fees. The hotel is older and the room is a bit dated and small. Not to worry, though. All the modern amenities are there. Free wi-fi, refrigerator, in-room safe. Very clean and comfortable. Bed was just the right firmness for me. You also have both soft and firm pillows. TV not flat-panel, but in San Diego who watches TV with such beautiful weather? You want to be outdoors all the time. ODDITIES: The bar is open only on Mondays and Thursdays. Also, when you call the hotel you have to leave a message, then they return your call. Quite odd, but just not enough of an inconvenience to dwell on. One elevator is out of service, leaving a bit of a wait for the one that is working.

Gaslamp District is a short walk from the hotel, and the hotel is located in a generally safe location. If you are looking for a cab at night, you may want to walk down to 5th street as it's a busier street and more cabs, or of course call one to the hotel.

This was a lot cheaper and a lot more room than we could have afforded at any other hotel around San Diego. The cons -The hotel and its rooms are old. They need new carpet desperately. -The hotel is close to everything but is in more of a residential location, so you have to walk to get to restaurants or shopping. -As others have noted, the parking garage is incredibly tight unless you drive a mini or smart car.

The building is clearly old, but the lobby is bright and modern, and more importantly, the rooms are also bright and spotlessly clean. Staff/service excellent so far. Parking garage is around the corner but the elevators go directly to the lobby, so that's fine. Parking fee is annoying but typical of any city so expected (for those who complain about $16 per day, in Chicago the daily rates are $35 and up, and in San Fran even worse -- not that it makes it less annoying, but ALL cities have parking fees, so to ding this hotel for this isn't quite fair). All in all, it has been a typical HI Express experience to this point. Now for the one huge negative: the windows in my room might as well not exist. The walls don't seem that bad, but in a room on a lower floor fronting 7th Street, the street noise through the windows is unbelievable. Regular traffic is not a problem and not terribly audible, but trucks, buses, etc. are beyond loud. In fact, conversation on the street below is clearly audible in the room. At first I kept checking to see if the windows were closed, then I opened them myself to confirm that it actually it just as loud whether they are closed or open. There have been several busloads of teenagers loading into school buses during the early evening hours, and the buses idling outside pre-loading and then the noise of the loading has sent me running for headache medicine. Even though the hotel itself is fine, location is good/convenient for the purpose of my trip to SD, price is in line with other hotels of this class, etc. the street noise would be a deal breaker for me for future stays, as I'm hypersensitive to that sort of thing.

They had used the same hotel before due to its proximity to our intended location. They told me in advance that it was nothing to write the parents about, but perfectly adequate for a few days' stay. We are both members of IHC's loyalty program and thus have seen a number of Holiday Inn properties and knew what to expect. I arrived on their complimentary shuttle from the airport and was given access to my room despite it being a few hours prior to the normal 3pm check-in. LAYOUT Doing some homework I discovered this property has a storied past. It was built as an annex to the historic 1920s El Cortez Hotel, and at one time the world's first moving sidewalk connected the two properties on a span over 7th Avenue. This hotel is perched on the side of a steep hill, so that the entrance on one side is about five stories higher than on the other. A parking deck, two restaurants, conference rooms, offices, stores and a church fill the space under the hotel. Parking is included for guests, but drive carefully in the garage because the columns are very close together and battle-scarred from people scraping them. A glass elevator on the low side connects the lobby level to the street. The lobby faces San Diego Bay although the view is punctuated by tall buildings closer to the water. This can be enjoyed both from the lobby lounge where IHC members are treated to happy hour during the week, and an adjacent terrace, partially covered, with tables for guests to relax, eat or smoke. Across the driveway is an outdoor pool and terrace with chairs and tables (but alas no umbrellas) all of which were kept scrupulously clean. The lobby floor and two levels above it contain the guest rooms. There are two elevators which are used not only for the hotel but the parking deck below it, and they are painfully slow so we mostly walked. ROOMS My room was a king ordinary facing the street. The furniture was all in good repair and a laptop-capable safe and empty fridge (vs. a minibar) were welcome discoveries. Wireless Internet is available and included. The bathrooms are very small (there's a bumper on the door to keep it from smacking the toilet) but nicely renovated and everything was spotlessly clean and in working order. Beds are comfortable with a variety of pillows (labeled for your firmness preference). My friends' room was a two-queen with a large terrace facing the pool and driveway area. Otherwise very similar in amenities. We both noticed that the air conditioners, while new-looking, struggled to keep the rooms cool. If having a view or a lot of daylight is important to you, make sure you mention this when you arrive. On either end of the hotel there are a handful of rooms whose windows face a wall only about 3-5 feet away... not for the claustrophobic! FOOD There is no full service restaurant owned by the hotel. However, in the building (accessible by the outdoor elevator mentioned above) on the 6th Ave side is a little place called the Indigo Cafe which serves a variety of food (including breakfast at any time), has a liquor license, and is open until 9pm most days. Free breakfast was available in the conference area below the lobby, and was well-stocked and fresh if not overwhelming in variety. Hot and cold cereals, scrambled eggs, cold hard-cooked eggs, bread, muffins, pastries, bananas, oranges, apples, etc. were daily staples. Most days we were there they also had biscuits and sausage gravy, and on the last day this was replaced by bacon. The hot cinnamon rolls were a big hit with someone in our party. Given the chaos we encountered at the last Holiday Inn breakfast (Eatontown, NJ http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46868-d98139-r70561651-Holiday_Inn_Tinton_Falls_Eatontown-Tinton_Falls_New_Jersey.html) it was well-run and we were very satisfied. None of us could stomach the coffee but others seemed to be enjoying it so maybe we're just java snobs. We found good stuff at the Cortez across 7th Ave. DRINK IHC loyalty club members are invited to a happy hour in the lobby on weekday afternoons. Otherwise there is no bar owned by hotel. The aforementioned Indigo Cafe has a liquor license, however, as does the Cortez cafe across the street. SERVICE Everyone there was very friendly and helpful. The entire property is kept very clean and the staff were quick to help with any need.

The general manager Jason Tharp was also excellent and dealt very efficiently and fairly with the small problem we had re. his bus driver wasn't available to pick up a few of the people who had flight problems and arrived late. Colin knew in advance what time and how many were coming in on each flight and they hired extra buses to meet us at the airport; even the general manger was there for much of the day to meet and direct us and to make sure everything went smoothly. The day we were checking out which went extremely well ; like check in did also , considering we were a large group; Colin and Jason were working their butts off to make sure everything went smooth which it did. This is not the ritz but people; be serious! Consider what you pay. I was shocked to read some of the reviews as all my group found their rooms clean; beds comfortable, fluffy thick towels ; bathrooms small but excellent working shower heads and water pressure and this hotel went out of their way to provide a large room to accommodate us all at their free, way above average breakfast as we were all eating and checking out at same time to go to port; They had also hired staff to keep the breakfast area immaculate; no dirty plates and keep their breakfast items refilled continuously. Of course, the pick up at airport and the shuttle to port were all complimentary and extra buses were hired due to the size of the group. A few of my people who arrived early in the day or the day before had nothing but positives to say about how they transported them to zoo, etc. all free . The computers worked great in the lobby and were free as well. The front staff were exceptional and very helpful as well to give direction and information on what to do around town to the guests.

If I was bringing another group or even staying myself in San Diego again, there's no doubt I would choose this place.

Of course, the shuttle was available to transport you if you choose to be in by 11:00 p.m. The Sales Manager is also really helpful.

They were cheerful and funny and equipped us with almost everything - toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, deodorant, bath gel, shower cap, makeup cleaning cloth - we needed to get through the night without any of our personal items. The only thing missing was clean underwear, socks and PJs! We stayed twice at the Holiday Inn. The first time was 5 nights before our cruise. The second time two night after the cruise. These are the positives and negatives of the hotel: POSITIVES: 1. Great front desk staff 2. Good size rooms and bathrooms 3. Good hot breakfast 4. Shuttle is quite good with friendly drivers but will only take you a radius of one mile from the hotel. You also have to make an appointment the day before you need to use it but once they take you to a place, you can call them for pickup same day. 5. Nice pool 6. Walking distance to shops and close to pier 7. When we returned to the hotel after our cruise, it was 10:30 AM. They got us a room right away without waiting at all and that was terrific. NEGATIVES: 1. There were problems with both rooms that we stayed in. The first room was a handicapped accessible room (we didn't ask for one) and the shower head kept rolling down the rail. The maintenance guy could not fix it. He said they didn't have the parts for it. On our second stay, the faucet was leaking really badly and the mirrored door of the closet fell off the hinges as soon as I pushed it! So the repairman came up and we waited for him to fix them. We think the hotel should have checked those things before guests moved in. 2. The beds were uncomfortable and we suffered painful backs after sleeping in them for a few nights. 3. The hotel looks old and rather rundown. 4. The maids were very unreliable. We'd put our sign to make the room hanging on the doorknob all day and come back at 4 PM to find the room unmade. We would then call the front desk and the maid would knock on the door at 4:30 PM when we wanted to have a nap and she had ALL DAY to clean our room. After that experience, we called down to the front desk every time we were about to leave the hotel to tell them to have our rooms made up and we'd return to find the rooms unmade and we'd have to call again and again.

The garage is an architectual wonder--four stories of parking *under* the hotel. But turns are tight--verified by car-paint marks on the wall near turning points.

We were informed that the charge for parking would be $14 per day (and I knew that ahead of time anyway), but in the end we were only charged for one day. I wondered if this was because we arrived on a holiday and perhaps they don't charge on holidays & weekends?

I thought it was very good value, but it was also quite busy so I would suggest getting down there earlier rather than later. We were able to walk to the Gaslamp Qtr., Petco Park, and the waterfront. San Diego is hilly, so be prepared for that. We took advantage of the Domino's Pizza across the way, ordering their 'Carry-Out Special' one evening. We also ate a a restaurant across the street called Sole Luna Cafe which was fantastic. We had a lot of variety near us, so that was great. The last review mentioned that the pool was empty, which was the case when we were there too. I did not inquire about this however. Also, I know that the front desk offers some discount tickets to area attractions. I did not use them as we had purchased the 3-1 ticket, but I did hear another gentleman get the voucher for the zoo and that was a savings of $8/per person. The hotel also has a little patio which is nice and I saw many patrons taking advantage of that and relaxing outside.

The hotel has free wireless internet! Guess what else? Not all rooms can pick up the wireless signal! I was in Room 334 and could not connect at all. When I called the front desk, the gal there just recommended I call the Tech Support line and hung up on me. She also did this several times over the week, so obviously she is in need of some customer service training. It wasn't until the next morning when a different group of staff admitted that not all the rooms can get the wireless signal. That is when they told me that for a security deposit of $200 I could rent a bridge. It would have been splendid if the gal the first night had even mentioned it! When I came back from the first day of the conference, the maid had thrown away the bar of soap I had opened the night before - and failed to replace it with a new bar! It's one thing to throw it away (which is already pretty wasteful), but then not to replace it? Thankfully, I never had that happen again during my stay. The buffet was okay. Hot cinnamon rolls, bagels, danishes, and cereal are available. There is also juice, coffee, and 2% and Skim milk. If you want whole milk or fat free milk, forget it!

We have stayed in the Gaslamp and knew budget friendly hotels are hard to come by. We opted for the HI Express because of the location and the reasonable parking fee of $12 per day. The staff was super friendly and very helpful. The breakfast is nothing special, but has your basics and it's convenient and included with your stay. Housekeeping came a bit too late for my taste. We would return to our room around 3:30 pm and it still wasn't cleaned. But, when they did clean, the room looked great. The bathroom in our room (King room) was VERY small and only one person could fit in there at a time. I wish I would have brought my own hair dryer to allow me to clear the bathroom sooner. This would have allowed my husband to get in there in a more timely fashion. The elevators are frustratingly slow, but we learned our way around using the stairs. We didn't use the pool, but it looked clean and well kept. It was quite small however. The parking garage is super tight. It brought back fond memories of Europe and having to maneuver your way around safely. Go slow and be careful. If you plan on walking to the Gaslamp Quarter, I would HIGHLY recommend that you exit the hotel down the 6th Ave. elevator and go down 6th Ave. to get down there and return. The first night we made the mistake of using 7th Ave. Quite a scary bunch on this street! We felt much safer utilizing 6th Ave. All in all, a decent place to stay for the price.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornelius, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to see San Diego again!\u201d", "Author": "rtw00", "ReviewID": "UR8102682", "Content": "My wife and I were out to visit family members in Los Angeles and decided to include a trip to San Diego while we were there. Boy are we glad we did. We chose the Holiday Inn Express in San Diego because of it's proximity to the entertainment and it's relatively low cost. Let me address the pros and the cons of our stay. Pros: -The hotel offered a complimentary continental breakfast each day which gave a fair selection and really saves at least $15-$20 per day in your spending. -Each night during our stay there was a manager's appreciation happy hour around 5:00 and lasted about an hour. During this time there was complimentary beer and wine. What a nice touch! -The staff always went out of there way to help guests out. First, they are great for recommendations for places to eat and things to see. Second, they have a shuttle van that they will do their best to allow you to use and save on the cab fare. Finally, we decided to add on a day to our stay and they actually reduced our daily rate for all days that we stayed. -Walking distance to everything as long as a couple mile walk isn't too bad for you. Cons: -The parking is slim and you have to pay either $15 or $20. -There aren't any restaurants extremely close. -Noise from the street and airplanes can get loud. I am a heavy sleeper and it didn't bother me at all. My wife is a lighter sleeper and she said at times it was bothersome, but not terrible. -Overall the cost per night seemed pricy for the quality, but relative to all costs in the area, it's not terrible. As a note about the city, we visited a baseball game at Petco Park and walked there. It was a great park and a nice experience. The San Diego zoo is absolutely amazing. The shopping and nightlife in Gaslamp is a great time. Visit Moose McGillycuddy's on Wednesday night I believe for $1 drink specials. As long as you don't mind a mainly college age crowd, the drinks are cheap, the crowd is upbeat and Jamie the bartender is one of the best bartenders I've ever been served by. Also, fit in Coronado if you get time, but plan to be underwhelmed by the Hotel Del unless if you are a true lover of history. Enjoy San Diego for all it has to offer. Truly one of if not the best city in America!", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "galpalmzmd", "ReviewID": "UR8040297", "Content": "This hotel is within walking distance of everything . . . we walked to the piers, Balboa Park, the Fish Market, Convention Center, Little Italy, Gaslamp Quarter, etc. The in-hotel bistro serves good food at reasonable prices.
