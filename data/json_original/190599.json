The room was nice and clean. The first day the receptionist was extremely unhelpful (asked for the nearest ATM, she pointed to a closed bank that didn't have an ATM. We asked for restaurant recs, got a shrug back, with an \"oh, they are all good,\" kind of unhelpful answer), but the receptionists to follow were all quite nice and helpful. The location was decent, right near the metro, but it was a long walk to get anywhere (Berlin is so spread out, with lots of empty space to get through). My biggest complaint was the lack of electric kettle, so I couldn't make myself a cup of tea in the morning. Luckily there is a little store almost across the street where I could find a 1 Euro cup of tea or coffee and some decent yogurt, rolls, or sandwiches for breakfast. It's a perfectly nice hotel to stay in.

Even though the room had a big window, the view was... a wall! Of course I wasn't to stay at my room all day but it was deceiving to face a wall first thing in the morning. Details were really what most bothered me: shutters had little holes, the shower had a broken tile and curtains looked a bit tired. Again, nothing really important except that I had supposedly paid for a 'design' hotel. HOTEL/STAFF: The architecture of building is quite nice. The breakfast room is beautiful, with lots of light and a nice decoration (the breakfast itself is once again just ok - even a bit overpriced if not for the great service). The staff was very attentive, they all spoke very good english and were very efficient.

There is a corner shop 50m away for drinks etc at a fraction of the minibar rates.

The hotel itself was of a good standard without being too over the top. One very useful feature we dont get in the UK much at this budget was aircon which was vital bearing in mind the windows could not be opened due to mosquitos from the nearby river. The only negative point was the bathroom which did not have enough ventilation leading to an equatorial feel for an hour after someone had showered. The shower was also badly designed so that it flooded the bathroom floor no matter how the curtain was positioned. The overall standard was very similar to a uk Travelinn. We got a deal and paid around \u00a360 per night which was good value. We didnt eat at the hotel as the menus looked very expensive and we preferred to eat on the go whilst sightseeing. We found it is best to shop around as there is widely varying value for food in Berlin. The best way to travel around the city is to get the 3 day welcome card. Our advice is to get the ticket from a machine which speaks english as there are a number of similar but different tickets and it is easy to get the wrong one from a non-english speaking advisor in a station info centre. You can then pick up the voucher book from a station info centre when passing. Make sure you get the right type of info centre though as we queued at several (There seems to be seperate ones for the UBahn SBahn and normal trains) getting blank looks before finding the right one (the SBahn).

The difference was stark. This hotel is located in a very quiet district - barely a passing car on a weekday, completely dead at the weekendand with no local facilities. The one bar round the corner had one old pensioner propping the bar up on a Friday evening. The hotel itself is already showing signs of age. The fixtures and fittings in the room were tired and worn; edges of shelves worn away, carpets badly stained, window blinds torn and damaged. The room was very much smaller than in the sister hotel, though the bed was amply sized as in all German hotels. Only one almost useless pillow per person though (think no thicker than a cracker) and no availability of additional bed linen as most other hotels would normally provide. The room was effectively air conditioned (i.e. you could control temperature and speed yourself) and this is essential as the hotel's proximity to a very still tributary to the Spree means that the area is plagued by large, voracious mosquitoes. Leaving your bedroom window open is not an option as my heavily bitten body will testify! During my stay I needed to use the internet in order to check-in for our return flight. The cost of using the solitary PC in the lobby was extortionate. Given the low cost of internet access and PC hardware, all decent hotels now offer such 'business centre' services for free - here, it was a credit card driven system charging 1Euro for 3 minutes online time and extra for every printed page. As a general tip, if you need to use the internet whilst in Berlin, look up the Easy Internet cafes before you go, there's a huge one in Kurfurstendam and at least one more I saw elsewhere - there access costs 1 Euro for an hour! Overall, the stay at Berlin Mitte was not what I expected from a hotel chain which calls its most basic room 'Superior'. It needs to decide whether it wants to be 'designer' or just a smart hostel. For UK travellers, the room was the same size and in the same condition as you'd find in a Travelodge. If you expect no more than that, you won't be disappointed.

We arrived at the hotel in the evening & were checked in without any hassles. We thought it was in a bit of a commercial-type area, without any local shops as such, but it was within seconds of the metro, & within easy distance of many attractions around Berlin. Our room was fairly large with huge double-glazed windows looking out onto the street. The air conditioning was provided at no extra change, & the beds (two singles pushed together to make a king) were very comfortable. There was a mini-bar, TV two desks, a wardrobe & a counter for your baggage. The bathroom was large-ish, with a wheelchair friendly shower. It was all quite nice, if a little anaemic. It seemed more like a business-orientated hotel, although the staff did their best to help us with directions & the like. The restaurant & bar were a bit pricey, but there was a cool 'outdoor bar' - an indoor area without a roof, so you could actually sit in the sun - see it to believe it. There was also an internet computer in the lobby but you can only access it by using your credit card details. We scored this room through a website that was offering cheap rooms at the time (I guess empty rooms don't make money) - while I thought we received exceptional value for money (we had a superior room too & it was still ridiculously cheap), when we saw the price that the room usually was, we just about died of shock - I cannot imagine paying that much for what it was, although I am sure that we would have stuck to budget rather than location if that had been the case. We enjoyed our stay there a lot, but it would have been nice if breakfast was included (you could buy it separately but it was also pricey).

As others have mentioned, there isn't much happening around this hotel day or night, but everything in Berlin is easily reachable using public transportation. The U-bahn stop M\u00e4rkisches Museum on the U2 line is literally right under the street (Wallstrasse) outside the hotel with easy connections a couple stops away at Alexander Platz to other U and S-bahn lines you can use to explore the city. Traveling the other direction (toward Ruhleben) will allow you to visit Checkpoint Charlie (Stadmitte station) and Potzdamer Platz where you can also connect to the S-bahn and further on is the Olympic Stadium. Our room was spacious (for Europe) and the bathroom was very nice. Two twin beds could be combined to make a king bed and the window opened for some fresh air. Everything looked rather new. The hallway lights are operated by motion, which was a bit startling when we left early in the morning to catch our flight. We had to wave our arms out the door to get the lights to come on. We flew into Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld and purchased a 2 day pass for all trains for around 15 Euro. We took the S-bahn to Alexanderplatz and transferred to the U-bahn to reach the hotel. We definitely got our money's worth using the 2 day pass as we explored Berlin extensively taking in Checkpoint Charlie, the Olympic Stadium, the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, the East Side Gallery, the Ku'damm, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged\u00e4chtnis-Kirche, Berliner Dom, the Fernsehturm, and Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Oranienburg (reachable via the S1) among others. All of the sites we saw with the exception of Sachsenhausen are in the A or B zone, but if you want to visit further out make sure you get an ABC ticket. It is only a Euro or two more to do this if you do it up front. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night when we were just too tired to find anything else. It was a pleasant experience and the food was excellent. English language menus were available and the atmosphere is quite nice. For other meals we ate near Alexander Platz at a Brewpub and also several times at Hackescher Markt (Hackescher Hof has great breakfasts and there is an \"American\" type restaurant that even sold nachos connected to the S-bahn station), reachable by several S-bahn lines from Alexander Platz. You can even find the biggest Starbucks I've ever seen there if you can't go without your daily dose. About the only problem we experienced at the Art'Otel was that the internet wi-fi was down as was the internet from the computer in the lobby (both are pay services). Since we had planned to \"phone home\" using Skype, this threw a wrench in our plans but I understood it to be more of an issue of the internet provider than of the hotel itself. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it if you don't want to spend the big bucks for something near the more popular parts of the city. Since you can get there easily using public transport, save your money for some beer!!", "Date": "May 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but...\u201d", "Author": "txsunshine06", "ReviewID": "UR4619620", "Content": "We spent two nights at the Art 'otel in Berlin Mitte last weekend.

On the minus side, the rooms are quite small and basic and beginning to fade a little too quickly for a relatively new hotel. I stayed in a junior suite, which was just about the size of an average hotel room for a four star, and was perfectly adequate, but nothing special.
