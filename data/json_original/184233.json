All of this makes the Marriott Pinnacle attractive to groups of convention goers - so calm is not one of the hotel's strong points Room Mine was comfortable and efficient, but surprisingly unfashionable for the price. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom is standard for a chain hotel. Service is spotty: housekeeping varied - on one day there were crumbs left on the desk, on another laundry bags were not replenished automatically. Reception/concierge service was generally less forthcoming with assistance that it ought to have been, and the tone of some of the interactions witnessed between the Front Desk and guests whose first language was not English made me cringe. (To be fair, this phenomenon may not be unique to the Marriott. Despite the multicultural, plurilingual reality, Vancouver's hospitality staffers' impatience with speakers of other languages may be more widespread than the city boosters like to admit. I heard it expressed sharply at the airport arrivals area and at the front desk in one other hotel.)

I was not happy with this experience. I was supposedly upgraded to a one bedroom suite and was assigned to the 5th floor. There was no view, there was no light given it's low placement, surrounding buildings, and of course, Vancouver cloudiness-it was a depressing room. The room itself was tired looking in great need of updating. The room on close inspection was also not clean--there was toothpaste \"foam\" on the faucet from a previous occupant, visible dirt on the carpet which had been missed by the vacuum cleaner. When inspecting the mattress, I noticed that it was well past it's expiry date and well worn. Also, the 1 bedroom suite is supposed to have 2 TVs. There was a TV in the sitting area, but the TV in the bedroom had obviously been removed. The remote was there, and the table to hold the TV was there, but there was no TV! Internet service which was part of the conference package was very slow. The shower took about 10 minutes to warm up to a reasonable temperature. I should mention that as I was leaving, there was work being done on the 5th floor, it appears that I was the only guest on the floor. I saw that they were changing all the mattressess in all the rooms on my wing. I was surprised to see a piece of paper on my door that said: \"This Room Is Occupied. Do not change mattress. Quiet please.\".I assume it was put there by the maintenance worker who walked into the room the previous evening without knocking. The pictures of the other rooms look nice.

You can read other peoples posts about that though. It was amazing. We drove from Bremerton, WA.

The one part of this hotel that was very disappointing was the lobby and restaurant/bar. The combined space is cavernous, terribly drafty and downright frigid on a cold evening. For dinner you might want to consider using room service if you desire a peaceful and more comfortable environment. When there is a function taking place on the third level, the small open balcony allows a great deal of noise into the lobby which then echoes like you were in the Grand Canyon. If this was my hotel, I would install a glass wall to keep function noises from reverberating yet still offering a view of the lobby. You cannot help but feel sorry to the guest service agents in having to work in that bone-chilling and drafty lobby, especially when the double wide doors open on a chilly day or night.

I arrived at the hotel via taxi at around 10:30 PM on Friday and check-in was smooth and painless. I requested a king bed on a high floor and was given a king bed on the 21st floor facing away from the harbor. The room was in excellent shape but was a bit small. It had a great setup with corner windows, even though it wasn\u2019t really on a corner, a sitting area and a huge bathroom. The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub, which was a nice feature but kind of a waste as the tub wasn\u2019t that deep or long so I couldn\u2019t imagine using it for a bath. The stand-alone shower was a little snug and I managed to bump the faucet a couple of times, resulting in a sudden change in temperature of the water. If I was going to redesign this hotel, I\u2019d make the bathroom a little smaller, have a traditional bathtub/shower combo and take the extra space and make the bedroom bigger. The location is excellent, less than a block from the Olympic cauldron, the convention center and BC place. This was my first trip to Vancouver so I didn\u2019t know what to expect and since my room was facing away from the harbor, I didn\u2019t notice any of the above places until I went exploring the first morning. Gastown is a ten minute walk and so is Waterfront Station. FYI - A taxi is about $40 (including tip \u2013 yes, you should tip a cab driver) from YVR to the hotel while the Canada Line subway is $2.50/person. If you don\u2019t have much luggage, take the subway and then it\u2019s a 10 minute walk from the station to the hotel. Both a taxi and the subway take about 25 minutes, with a taxi taking longer if there is traffic. Also, I had full cell reception on the subway ride to the airport which was great! I ordered room service for breakfast the first day and was pleasantly surprised by two things: 1) The substituted OJ instead of coffee/tea and didn\u2019t charge me for it. Not sure if that was a mistake or not as I fully expected to pay for it, but it was very nice if it was intentional and 2) they don\u2019t charge any service charges for room service \u2013 the price on the menu is the price you pay! That alone enticed me to order room service again the next morning as well. My one complaint about room service is that their \u201cOvernight Menu\u201d is pretty basic and when I wanted to order something at 3:30 AM after a night out on the town the one hot item on it (lasagna) wasn\u2019t available. However, the room service lady was very apologetic and connected me to the local pizza place. They offer both wired and wireless Internet in the rooms (for a charge) but I couldn\u2019t get either to work. However, the lobby has free WiFi so if you don\u2019t have a ton of work to do, just camp out there for a few minutes with your laptop. Every single staff member was extremely helpful and pleasant whether it was giving directions or just saying \u201cGood Morning\u201d or \u201cWelcome back\u201d. Their customer service is A+++.

The lobby lounge, in front of the reception area, was very small (a totally of 15 - 20 persons seating capacity).

I suggest you take a zodiac tour while there with the \"Prince of Whales\" tour company. They offer a 3 hour whale and wildlife tour which was great. Even though we didn't see a whale, it was great zipping across the water at high speeds. They do provide you with survival suits and goggles which came in handy with the rain.

Our three person team elected the property based on the recommendation of our travel agent and what we read on TripAdvisor. Each of the three of us is a highly experienced business traveler. None of us found our experience at the Marriott Pinnacle (Vancouver) to be positive. The main reasons for our disappointment included: \u2022 Issues checking in. Took over 20 minutes from the time we arrived (3:30PM) because all of the available counter personal were busy checking out the British Airways crew (it seems this is a common complaint/problem); \u2022 While the room was adequate it was small and cramped for the price we paid and certainly not the standard we had expected for the price or what is available at establishments like Hotel Le Soleil, Sutton Place or the Four Season for less; \u2022 The bathroom details and the amenities were of a standard one would expect to find at a hotel half the price; \u2022 We had drinks at the bar and found the service to be good but have to say the surroundings do not compare with many other nearby hotels; \u2022 Each of us felt breakfast service was good but the pricing expensive and poor value for money, (tax + tip cost was over C$30 per person) for something that the word \"mediocre at best\" describes well. The coffee may be from Starbucks but is was not very good and the espresso very bitter such that it was undrinkable; \u2022 One of our party, who normally stays at Four Seasons properties, ate dinner the night before in the hotel restaurant and found it to be average and costly. He described it as \u201ca big mistake\u201d; \u2022 Issues checking out: took too long (about 20 minutes); and \u2022 We felt we had been \u201cgrossly overcharged\u201d. Cost for each of the rooms, including taxes but none of the food or drinks, was C$313.39, far too much for the quality of the product and a real disappointment.

The room is very odd in shape, the door leads to a short hall (with bathroom to the right) then a curved right hand turn into the room propper. The rounded shape of the building is very obvious when in the room, the shape feeling somewhat like an oddly cut wedge of pie. The upside of this however is that one entire wall (the rounded edge of the pie) is floor to celing windows overlooking Vancouver.

The Pinnacle is located a short stroll from the waterfront and Stanley Park is within walking distance. The main business district is 3 or 4 blocks away. Upon our arrival the front desk receptionist, \u201cKat\u201d, tried to get us to \u201cupgrade\" into a $50/night more expensive \"room with a better view\", but did not initially say that it would be at our expense. When we found out that we would be paying for it, we declined. \u201cKat\u201d, at the front desk was aware, from our Marriott Rewards member profile that we wanted a quiet room away from ice machines and elevators. \u201cKat\u201d confirmed this with us at the reception desk. Nonetheless we were taken to a room on the 8th floor directly opposite the ice machine. The bellman who accompanied us, Taylor, phoned \u201cCurtis\u201d to get our room changed. \"Curtis\" also hit Taylor with the $50 upgrade suggestion which once again we declined. Curtis then \"found\" Room 1515, a double-double that had \"just become available\". While waiting for an appropriate room at our reservation price of $239/night before taxes, we had time to read the fine print on the keycard envelope saying that it was the responsiblity of the guest to decline delivery of USA Today or the Wall St. Journal or else Marriott automatically charges $0.75/day for it. We called to decline as soon as we were settled. The Pinnacle charges $15.95/day for wired internet \u2013 highest rate on this trip to date \u2013 but it does include local and long-distance phone. The internet works fine, as it should at these prices. The bathroom was the best of trip with a huge countertop and a separate stall shower. The air conditioning works well and the bedroom is nicely furnished with comfortable beds and a corner window -- mostly overlooking other nearby buildings. Upon our arrival we found a partially used $4.50 bottle of water in the bathroom and it took 2 calls to the \u201cAt-Your-Service\u201d line to get it removed from the room and off the bill. We also had to call \u201cAt-Your-Service\u201d once, and got quick response, to get a water glass for the bathroom after housekeeping removed the one we'd been using. Apparently at Marriott hotels there is some sort of contest between housekeeping and room service regarding which is responsible for providing clean glasses for guests. We're not sure if it's housekeeping taketh away and room service returneth, but Marriott management sure needs to figure it out. Except for outrageous laundry prices, we enjoyed the rest of our stay at the Pinnacle. The doormen, bellmen and valet parking staff are great. Whenever we returned with our car they would welcome us \"home\" and ask when we would next be needing the car. Whenever we called \"At-Your-Service\" to ask for the car it was there when we got to the lobby. The bottom line is that The Pinnacle is a very good hotel.

I had 2 queen beds and the room was not overly crowded as it was only my daughter and I staying together. The bathroom has a separate shower and tub which was nice. The gym facilities and indoor pool were great. I used the workout room each morning and pool each evening. Although the hotel was very busy during my stay neither were overly crowded. There is also a jacuzzi spa, dry sauna, and steam room. The mattresses are firmer than what I am used to but comfortable and the linens are luxurious with lots of pillows on the bed. The TV broke down on our second day but a repair engineer was sent up right away and it was fixed within 20 minutes. Likewise a request for toothpaste received prompt attention.

Open reception and good staff. You can only go to your room with using your roomcard in the elevator. Oterwise you won't get up. The rooms are spacious. The windos are all glass, so when you are situated at the highest level, you have marvellous views. There is a high speed internet connection for a daily rate around CA$16. The bathroom is spacious with a bath and a seperate shower. There is enough space for your clothes etc. I went one morning to the swimming pool. Well maintained, good facilities, nice spa and open 24 hours. I had breakfast there every morning and you can choose between buffet or a a la carte. Perfect!

I chose this hotel because of the reviews and the great package offered via the Marriott website.

The hotel was exceptionally clean, the staff was very courteous and helpful and the location is excellent. I booked the package for \"Cars eat free\" for $179, which included a $25 gas card for each night of stay, and complimentary parking (self or valet). Like most large cities, downtown hotel parking is not free, and the price at the Pinnacles is on par with other hotels. Based on the recommendation of a previous reviewer, I chose valet parking so I didn't have to hike to and from the garage. The valet service was quick. The two times I called for the car, it was at the front door waiting for me after I came down from my room. This is not a luxurious hotel and the price reflects that, so people should not have the same expectations as if staying at the Fairmont or Pan Pacific and paying twice the rate. The location of the hotel is most convenient. The waterfront and Canada Place is two blocks north. Pacific Center shopping mall is three blocks to the east. If you are looking for stores and restaurants just walk two blocks south to West Georgia Street. Their refrigerator did not have any mini bar items, but they did provide us with two bottles of water. Considering the price that hotels charge for the convenience of mini bar snacks and drinks, I'm thankful they provided a refrigerator for me to store my own drinks.

Hotel is in a great location, not far from Canada Place and walking distance to many shopping and eating areas. About 3 or 4 blocks to Burrard SkyTrain station.

Soggy tempuras, greasy spring rolls, overcooked vegetables and too-small portions disappointed. My only real issue with staying at this hotel again would be the noise problem, mentioned by previous posters. Some rooms are in a cul-de-sac configuration at the end of the halls, and this creates a distinct disturbance as your neighbors come and go: their voices sound as if they are right in your room, and the slamming of doors as people come and go actually interrupted conversation in our room. This is a design flaw; not sure what the hotel could do to improve upon it. That being said, these sounds generally die down once everyone retires for the evening, so our sleep was not interrupted.

The front desk told us to wait five minutes, then they would send someone every 10 minutes to tell us it would be ready shortly. It took us about 45 minutes to finally get our room. It would have been better to have just told us to come back in one hour instead of teasing us and making us wait in the lobby.

However, to be fair to the front desk - when we complained about it, they asked us to wait at the bar and provided a free round of drinks while we were waiting for our rooms to get cleaned. Also, the supervisor personally came and told us our rooms were done and left water/chocolates for us. So - definitely made up for the delay. Overall - great place but pricey (upwards of $265 before tax and parking of $25). But worth it.

My husband and I were going on a cruise so we spent the day before and after our cruise in Vancouver. I had requested a high room when I booked the hotel through American express, plus it is in my Marriott Rewards member profile that I prefer a high room. I arrived at the hotel around 2 pm in the afternoon and the receptionist said that my room was not ready but she would hold my bags for me. She could not tell me when the room would be ready, but she said that check in time was 4. She recommended a place to eat within walking distance (The Mill, which I do not recommend). We returned to the hotel around 4 and our room was not ready. She put us in another room, a corner room ending in the # 19. I was so excited since I had read reviews which instructed to get the room ending in the # 19. The room had a gorgeous view, but was a bit on the small side. Also the bed in this room was a bit uncomfortable and firm which is unusual for Marriott. I had two problems during my first stay. 1: the shower head & pipes in the wall started shaking violently when I took a shower. The only way for it to stop was to bleed off the pressure in the bathtub. So I had the bathwater running the whole time I was taking a shower to prevent this. 2: The other problem that I had on this first night was that the bellman put my bags under the aircon vent, which was leaking. I did not realize this until I went to leave and my 40 lbs suitcase was soaked through the top, through all my belongings to the bottom of the suitcase. I notified the receptionist when I left, that I was leaving for a cruise, and did not have time to check the contents, but it was wet soaked through. He told me to let them know upon my return if anything was damaged. The second stay proves Marriott\u2019s exceptional customer service. I contacted the same receptionist about my soaked suitcase and gave them the laundry bill for some of the clothes that got wet. The happily deducted the amount from my room cost. This time we got another corner room ending in the # \u201c11\u201d. It was even better than the room ending in \u201c19\u201d because it was bigger and better proportioned. The view was of the city, but we loved it. We had the same problem with the violently shaking shower in this room. The service in the dining room was disappointing for breakfast, they were very busy and we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. When we got a table, we never saw our waiter. It was buffet, so we helped ourselves and I even went and got our own beverages and poured my drinks from the waiters drink stations. The waiter eventually stopped by when we were finished and apologized and asked us if we needed anything\u2026 I said \u201cYes, check please\u201d. Overall this is a beautiful hotel. I would have given it 4 stars in a heartbeat but we just had too many problems to say it was above average. However, they were quick to remedy our issues and have great customer service.

We booked through Priceline and paid about $150 total per night, which was excellent for that level of hotel in the downtown area, during Canada Day weekend. I travel quite a bit and usually do extensive shopping-around on the Internet, so I did my research before choosing this place, and Priceline seemed the most cost effective way. Our room on the 16th floor had a decent view, but the office building across the street blocked a clear view of the harbour - which really didn't matter a whole lot since we spent very little time in the room. If you're going to downtown Vancouver to sit in your room and enjoy the view, you are going to the wrong place for the wrong reason. Vancouver and the surrounding area is a great place to explore. Housekeeping did a good job every day of cleaning the room, and overall it was a very modern and nice room. The bed was comfortable and better than at most hotels. The fitness center had several treadmills/cardio machines as well as some free weights and a universal machine, so not bad if you want a quick workout before starting your day. The pool area was average, with a whirlpool and sauna. There is an outdoor patio area on the floor above the pool (5th floor), which may be a nice place to unwind depending upon the time of day and the weather. We never used it but walked up there one morning after a bit in the sauna. We spent a day in Whistler hiking and mountain biking, another day strolling around Granville Island and biking in Stanley Park; also went whale watching out of Victoria. All in all, Vancouver is a really good place to visit in the summer with a variety of activities for everyone, and the Marriott Pinnacle is a great place to base your vacation from. It's close to the bus, sky train and sea bus terminal, so use them as much as you can. One word of caution - don't go to Chinatown at night, unless you are heavily armed or looking for trouble :) We made the mistake of taking the Sky Train there around 6pm and it was like a ghost town. The only normal people in sight were a few tourists. There are countless shady-looking people in the area. East Hasting street is as bad as the travel guides tell you, avoid it at all costs.

It was broken. We called for service but the guy thought he was supposed to fix our phone. He left, never to return. The hotel's solution was to use the safe downstairs...for which we'd have to wait in the always present line at the check in counter. Overall, the experience was OK.

In fact, on my way to Cafe Artigiano's around the corner, I felt like a participant. It's been almost two weeks since we stayed at the Marriott, and I deferred writing this until after I could achieve some sort of objectivity. You see, we were given the best room on floor 31, the one that everyone says to snag, the one ending in --19. Not being a member of the hotel's loyalty program, I'm still wondering how this was done. Perhaps it had something to do with contacting the hotel itself three times before check-in. Our friends traveling with us were given a room on the 23rd floor with a nice but not as sweeping a view. All floors in many Canadian hotels seem to be accessed by cards that must be inserted in the elevator and will service that floor only. An excellent security measure. The front desk and Concierge desk couldn't have been more helpful. They dispensed information from what bus to catch (and where to catch it) to how to find the nearest store that sells tonic water. No request too small. Our room itself, with its magnificent views of Stanley Park, Canada Place with its terminal, and sea planes, is an anomaly. A third of the room is given to a long hallway that curves around to reveal the bedroom. Yes, the bed is very comfortable and you have 7 pillows to play with and adjust accordingly. One guidebook criticized the hotel for its lack of imaginative room furnishings, and I suppose this could be a problem for someone who wants dramatic color contrasts. But it's very much like the plain pine furnishings found in many Swiss hotels. Our bathroom contained both bath and separate shower. During our stay, we were issued four different notices, placed on our desk: window washers, road closures due to Marathon, water treatments during the night (!), and fire alarm inspections. Quite a list for the first weekend in May! But being prepared meant there would be no rude surprises during the day or night. Because we are seniors, we paid $191 CA each night for the first three nights and $221 for the final night, probably to announce the beginning of the high season May 7. What is unusual is that as of April 1, the GST will no longer be refunded to visitors, and with the US dollar eroding even further, dollar parity will soon be achieved. Much praise has already been given to Cafe Artigiano, which is now opened Sunday's. A superb Chinese restaurant two blocks near Canada Place is Imperial Chinese Seafood Restaurant, with very fresh fish specialties. (You must peruse the menu and look that the prices for Shark Fin soup without wincing.) CinCin is OK but prix fixe is definitely overpriced and the Tiramis\u00f9 should be banned. Stick to the \u00e0 la carte items. Canadians love Sunday brunch and one of the most popular places is Shaughnessy Restaurant at the Van Dusen Botannical Garden, easily reached by bus #17 four blocks away. Everyone seems to make it to Vij's, the #1 venue for Indian cuisine. And yes, the rumors are founded. Even on Monday, you will wait an hour for a table if you arrive at six or later. Get there early! These recommendations were given to us by the concierge and also the result of asking around. The hotel itself is quite nice and very well located. If you don't demand perfection, you will be satisfied with the decent rates and you will be won over by the desk personnel and concierge staff.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cGood choice, but there are better options in this class\u201d", "Author": "cruzship", "ReviewID": "UR7625892", "Content": "Recently stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in Vancouver and was somewhat disappointed by the hotel because I was expecting more given some of the reviews.

It was very tight, especially with the baby crib in the room -They have an odd parking system, in which you park your car, receive a ticket for your dashboard, and you go back down to the garage to place it on your car.

On our last day, the Vancouver Marathon ran right in front of the hotel, and the staff prepared the guests so that no one would be inconvenienced. The doorman even was able to drive cars along a small section of sidewalk so people could get out. The only mild complaints would be that the Internet access rate ($16/day) was quite steep. The lobby was very small and sterile- looking, but who stays in the lobby? Also, there is huge construction in the area preparing for the Olympics, so traffic can be bad, with occasional noise. Try the blueberry oatmeal and lemon ricotta muffins from the Cafe Artigiano coffee shop on the corner behind the hotel - YUM! Great coffee, too, puts Starbucks to shame. Also, the Victoria Chinese Restaurant in the Hyatt complex nearby had delicious food, a touch pricy, but huge servings. Authenic Chinese, not Americanized.

Great room at a great price with a panoramic view of downtown, the harbor, sea planes landing and taking off, the mountains, and a part of Stanley Park.

I tried both breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurant and found it typical of most good hotels - good food at inflated prices. Their breakfast was especially good, but expensive. Great location - easy to walk to any downtown location. I walked back and forth on two different nights tor hockey games at the GM Place from the Marriott in about 20 minutes each way. Five minute walk to the Convention Center / Imax / SeaBus. Great location also if you're a runner. Catch a really nice running path along the waterfront basically right across the street. Across the street the other way is a Starbuck's. Only complaint but not the Marriott's fault is lack of restaurants real close to the hotel that are open after 6:00pm, other than the Marriott's.

The desk clerk looked something up on the computer and told me he could offer me something for an extra $40 charge. I politely declined. Now the standard room rate there is I guess around $220+ so I know I guess we got a better deal than a lot of people, but $135 isn't exactly free. We got one of the smallest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in, with essentially no view. I'm not sure I get it. I guess Vancouver is just an expensive place to get a hotel. My wife and I got a better deal in mid-town Manhattan, in terms of size of room and decor. In addition, the Marriott Pinnacle charges about 15 bucks to use their wireless service in the room. They also charge for the business center, and they charge about $22 per night to park at the hotel I will say though that the bed was very comfortable and the staff were friendly. Also - If you want to use the gym, the fitness center isn't bad - nice pool, nice jacuzzi, steam room and sauna open 24 hours, and decent cardio equipment. so-so weights in the weightroom. One more thing about the hotel. The hotel restaurant is ok, but somehow between a few drinks, a little tiny salad, a side of mussels and one order of lamb the bill hit almost $100.

We returned to our room the first night to find 2 bottles of Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries and truffles set up by the window - a lovely gesture orchestrated by the front desk staff. The concierge crew and the doormen were extremely helpful. There is currently construction all over the city but we did not hear any noises from our room. The hotel enjoys an excellent location in the city - near the harbor and away from the traffic of Robson St. The health club complex with it's lap pool, whirlpool, steam rooms and workout room was complimentary to hotel guests. We prepurchased tickets to Storyeum in Gastown at the Canadian border tourist booth ~ it's a presentation with separate vignettes about the history of Vancouver - featuring actors and some singing and interesting stage settings. Families with older children may want to check it out - in the same complex is a production about Dinosaurs. Gastown has typical tourist shops that are not unique. We preferred exploring the end of Robson Street - nearer to the hotel - with it's authentic ethnic restaurants and shops - that's where all the action is. We had dinner at an all you can eat for $10 Mongolian Hot Pot restaurant that was excellent. We drove north to Whistler on the Sea to Sky Highway - there are lovely views but also alot of serious construction on the road. We stopped off enroute to see the famous waterfall - if you go that way keep your eyes open for the very small road sign. If you are taking a ferry to Victoria make sure to reserve a space for your car well in advance using the BC Ferry website - and allow enough time to get to the ferry which is a 60 minute drive - or more from Vancouver to Twaussen. The Dr. Sun Yat Sen Gardens in Chinatown was worth exploring - we skipped exploring Chinatown as advised by the police - due to the masses of homeless and frequent car break ins.

You can also easily walk to Robson Street, which is about a 10 minute or so walk. I personally would have skipped Robson Street as it seemed just like any upscale shopping area in the US, nothing special. We walked to Yaletown on Saturday night and found some cool bars with live jazz music and cocktails at a restaurant called Capone's.

You could pay $30 (CAD) a nite for an upper floor no concierge lounge, or for $60 (CAD) a nite you got a room on the 24th floor or higher and the lounge. I thought with the concierge lounge you got free wine and beer but found out you have to pay for liquor. Only freebie is coffee and soft drinks. The evening hors'deurves were okay. There was fried shrimp, cheese, crackers, bread, cookies, etc. nothing too extravagant. Breakfast was a continental breakfast. Cereal, yogurt, toast, fruit, oatmeal, juice, coffee. The lounge is not very big and finding a table is difficult sometimes. There were chairs and a sofa you could sit on but had to do a balancing act with your plate. We had breakfast every morning but only went our first evening for hors'deurves. I read here, on trip advisor to ask for a room with XX19, that all the 19 rooms were better. We asked but were told there was none available but that the XX20 were just as good if not better. We had room 2420 and the view was spectacular.
