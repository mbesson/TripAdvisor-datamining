They are absolutely correct. The Oriental Express Hotel has an excellent, friendly, and attentive staff that treats you like old friends of the family. We stayed for 4 nights with our 6yr old (rather rambunctious) boy and could not have asked for a more pleasant stay. The room was surprisingly large for an Old Town Istanbul hotel and we very clean. The daily cleaning staff surprised us every day with some nice personal touch in the room (even a bottle of wine with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Happy Easter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd note!!). The staff were always available to assist and answer my never-ending questions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even when I had to make a last minute change to my room reservations. In fact they were much more attentive than another \u00e2\u20ac\u01535-star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel we considered, and the (to me) was the difference. Service - friendly and helpful service. The manager had even left a welcome note with his mobile number (which we did not need). Perfect size (heated!) pool that my son could not get enough of; a nice respite from the busy streets of Istanbul. The breakfast was very nice yogurt, small baked goods, and the honeycomb was a nice touch. The breakfast staff was very professional and clearly loved children (always a giant plus for me when traveling with my family). Finally, the location of the Oriental Star is ideal. Easy walk to all the Old Town sites (Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia, Sultanamhet, etc.) as well as the ferries to the Asian side, the Galata Bridge, and the New Town. Our last day in town turned out to be rainy and cold so we stayed close and shopped the local merchants.

I enjoyed both of these hotels and wouldn't hesitate to recommend either of them. To me, their prices seemed very fair for a large urban city. I had reserved a couple of nights at the Erboy just to start our journey, and then when I went back to add more nights, the Erboy was booked so I added some nights at the Orient Express. First, the desk staff has had excellent training and is just terrific. Upon arrival at both hotels, the front desk staff provides you with a map and helps you determine where to go if you are sightseeing. The desk staff is consistently friendly and helpful at both hotels and willingly answers questions. Second, at the Erboy, you are given apple tea upon arrival--it's great. At the Orient, there was Turkish Delight left in the room. Third, the rooms at both hotels were sufficiently clean and nice. I reserved a triple (3 twins) for two people online at Expedia at the Erboy just to have extra space, and when we first arrived, we were upgraded to a quad (one double, two twins). The room had no real view but was very quiet and comfortable with a flat screen TV with remote. I had reserved a twin at the Orient Express and it was a smaller room which I expected. The beds were pushed together but there was room to move around, and I hadn't asked for a larger room. The TV was older but still had a remote. I preferred the larger bathroom at the Erboy but I suspect the Orient Express has rooms with larger bathrooms as well so I am comparing apples to oranges here. We had hot water at both hotels. Fourth, the location of both hotels is terrific. The Erboy is up a hill about 2 blocks from the Orient Express. You walk down a manageable incline street (with restaurants and shops along the side) to reach the Orient Express which is on the tram line with the access to the tram a short distance away. The Orient Express was on a busier street but I had requested a quiet room and got one. Both hotels are within easy walking distance of the Topkapi Palace, the Haigia Sophia, and the Blue Mosque. There is also shopping within walking distance. The tram line only costs 2 TL and is very easy to use. (Get some 1 TL pieces and put them in the automated machine for a token at the access point.) Both hotels are also within easy walking distance of the Sirkeci train station. We caught a suburban train which also cost only 2 TL one way (uses a different token but uses same method to get a token). There was a convenience mart across the street from the Orient Express to buy a soda or bottled water. There was probably one nearby the Erboy as well. One night I couldn't find a small bill to pay for the water and the propietor of the shop across from the Orient Express was going to let me take it on credt--wow! I did finally find a small bill to pay. Fifth, both hotels had wireless which worked and had two computers for guests to use near the lobby with internet access and a printer. Sixth, the breakfast at both hotels was very similar--lots of fine bread, cheeses, cucumbers, olives, at least a couple of hotter items, tea, etc. I have no complaints about the breakfasts and enjoyed them. Seventh, the Orient Express had a nice looking pool that we didn't use. I would recommend either hotel wholeheartedly. They are at least as good as any Holiday Inn Express I have stayed in and actually have better breakfasts, more services, and more outstanding staff than I usually encounter at hotels. Each hotel also had a restaurant although we didn't have time to use them.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.

Thinking that it is a lot of hype I was not ready for such first class service and attention to detail in a hotel that was in my price range. From first entering the hotel everything was 5 star. The front desk clerk was ready to explain the city and when I informed him I had been traveling for over 24 hours, offered me a beverage and told me to relax, see my room and come down when I was ready and he would give me all the details of the hotel, area and sites. I have stayed at hotels worldwide and had what I would call artificial care and concern, the Orient Express staff were an exception with every need anticipated, an honest smile and greeting from everyone in the hotel and willingness to help with anything from dining choices and daily activities. One thing I will never forget, and have already e mailed friends about was an incident where I had commented about the juice at the morning buffet in a casual conversation with the front desk staff, the following morning a tall cold fresh squeezed oj was at my table, when I asked how they knew, they told me they had my picture and preference noted. They had my picture from when they took a copy of my passport, and were there to make my stay memorable.......it sure was. The buffet has enough selections to make anyone more than happy, from a rack with a fresh honeycomb to cut a piece from, to the flaky breakfast pastries. The morning newsletter with breakfast was a nice touch with weather, suggestions on activities and Turkish facts. The breakfast staff is also excellent and there to get you whatever you may want. The bartender in the lobby bar could keep you in there all night with his smile and personality. Fresh flowers on the towels laid on the bed each day, cleaner than my own home, I would like to get that housekeeper to take care of my place at home. Turkish delights in the room daily, slippers, coffee and water in the room, more than I expected. I will be staying here when I return to Istanbul, and this hotel has made it a place I want to come back to. My only complaint is that this hotel group does not have hotels in other cities because I would use them exclusively. Make sure to visit the Red River Saloon, also owned by the same group for comfortable dining, and drinks in an atmosphere more like your local pub at home than miles away. The staff in the saloon is also great and will keep you stoping by more than once if even for an afternoon cappachino or a few beers.

It has convenient walking access to most notable places in old sector of Istanbul, as well as Sirkeci station, the corner stone of nostalgic Orient Express. It is also close to Eminonu ferry harbor, where you can get easy & nice access by ferry boats, letting you enjoy nice sea breeze, to places around \"Golden Horn\" and towns on the Asian side. Another great benefit we found from the hotel's proximity to Eminonu harbor was it enabled us very easily to purchase & re-charge \"Istanbul Card\", which gave us pass to every public transportation in Istanbul.

Serving original and very tasty Turkish dishes, with superb Turkish wines from all over the country, many of them using authentic Turkish grapes like the emir, sultanye, bogaskere etc grapes - a most surprising treat to any connaisseur. And at very affordable price. We found the restaurant so good that we took dinner 5 out of 7 days stay, it became a real wine tasting experience as we never had it. The staff became warm friends who never imposed themselves but were always available. Meanwhile enjoying the beautiful views of Topkapi, the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn. Eventually, there was now and then a little present around, a glass of sparkling, a plate of fruits, turkish delight... No matter the little attentions.

We had a short walk to the Orient Express hotel which, at first, was unassuming in revealing it's whereabouts but, once found, not forgotten. It was delightful to enter into the small but peaceful ( at the time anyway ) lobby and be warmly greated by the staff and immediately attended to. Our bags were organised to go up to our room and Meric welcomed and seated us and, with the first of our Turkish apple teas in tow, provided information on the local places to visit, how to get there etc and happily answered our immediate questions. For the duartion of our 3 day stay we were impressed and appreciative of the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff and the general atmosphere and decor of this older but charming place. Our room, though not large, was adequate in size, clean and comfortable. Loved the welcoming covered dish, resting on one of the beds, that contained a selection of Turkish Delight! We appreciated the well stocked bar fridge even though I think it was only the water we used. Also the in room tea and coffee making facility. (Throughout our subsequent travel, we found that this is not always available.) Given that our room overlooked the street we accepted that there was going to be some noise until the trams stopped running at around midnight so if you are desperate for sleep you might want to try and get a quieter room. My sister found her mattress a bit too firm but subsequently encountered that elsewhere too. The rooftop restaurant had a great view over the harbour and city and the food was well prepared and presented.The chef and manager even invited constructive critique to improve the dining experience. I did find a couple of the dishes a little too salty but enjoyed everything apart from that. Breakfast, downstairs, was plentiful and a good start to the day. The hotel is a central location with easy walk or transport to places of interest. Was good to have internet that worked. This hotel seemed very popular with returning guests.We enjoyed our stay, very much and would also return again. Highly recommended.

Taksim has all the cafe's and shops, but when we went there at night all the shops closed around 9pm, unlike Sultanahmet which was awake and lively until midnight when we slept. There's a supermarket right outside the hotel, which was very important to us (with a one year old daughter), there were exchange offices, restaurants, and just about anything you needed right outside the hotel. The hotel itself was very clean, the staff incredibley friendly and helpful, and very hospitable.

There's free wi-fi as well, you just need to ask the reception for the password. The one thing I didn't like, which didn't really have much to do with the hotel, are the tourist agency they deal with. We booked a few tours through the hotel and although they were punctual, I didn't feel they gave interesting information about the places we were visiting, and would usually ask us to find our way back to the hotel since it was close to the touristic sites and we usually booked a half day tour (couldn't stay out for too long with our daughter).

Either hotel is a fabulous choice!! We were so thrilled with our experience at the Orient Express/ Sirkeci Konak Group. It exceeded our expectations. I was torn because I had read such great reviews about the Sirkeci Konak and it had so many ammentaties that I wanted to take advantage of. My husband was more concerned with price and he looks at a hotel as a place to rest your head at night. So we made the reservation to stay at the Orient. We called directly and the customer service on the phone was great...she even offered a cash discount and even upgraded us to a suite because of our family size at no additional charge. They also arranged for a transfer from the airport which was a load off our minds. When we arrived at 2:00 in the morning they helped with our bags and sent us right up to our room and allowed us to do paperwork in the morning. They were so helpful and hospitable right from the start. Now, the rooms are not large; however, you need to realize that these hotels in the old town are renovated old homes and old original buildings...so, realize this is what these hotels have to work with. However, the suite was perfect for our family with 2 adults/2 kids with a closing door b/w rooms. The customer service was impecible!!! There was not one person we came in contact with that wasn't happy and pleasant and accomodating. And Maric', the concierge was so sweet and helpful! When you arrive, there is even a letter written from the owner of the hotel chain with his personal phone number if you have any problems or concerns...\"Guest Means Everything\" in his eyes. And the coolest thing for me was the fact that we stayed in the less expensive, yet very comfortable hotel, but we were still able to use the ammenaties of the 5 star sister hotel around the corner... Sirkeci Konak. At that hotel they offer different activities each day that you can take advantage of free of charge. Even though we didn't stay there, we were welcomed to participate in any activity or use of the facilities. One day we went on a tour to a local bizarre with a guide and one other person. It was personal and informative and at the end we felt we had made a friend. The next night we took the Turkish cooking lesson and cooked in the kitchen with their chef and then got to enjoy the meal in the beautiful restaurant upstairs. And the next night we enjoyed the Turkish Hammam (bath) along with the foam massage, while our kids enjoyed the pool and sauna as well. The cooking was a small fee and of course the massage, which you would pay for no matter what. The breakfast was large selection and good. Service there great as well. And every day the hotel even has a happy hours with free tea and sandwiches if you happen to be there or in the area. It was also a super location right in the old town in the middle of it all and right by the tram station. I just can't speak highly enough of this hotel group. If you want elegance, great service, great location but on a better budget I recommend the Orient Express, but take advantage of all the great stuff the other has to offer. This was by far one of the best hotel we've stayed at in Europe and that's saying a lot as we have traveled for over four years living overseas to more than 22 countries!!

Being named the Orient Express, it's themed around rail travel, which we found appropriate as we'd got there by train from the UK. There are various bits of rail memorabilia around. Although it's on a busy street with a tram going by, we didn't find it noisy. When we arrived, we were greeted very warmly and politely, and given coffee and a personal introduction to Istanbul. We learned that there are free (Turkish) tea and sandwiches in the hotel every afternoon! Our room was smaller than expected for a hotel of this calibre; this was a bit disappointing, but it was manageable. Strangely, only one side of the double bed was furnished with a bedside table and lamp. We asked housekeeping for another bedside table, and, after quite a while, they appeared with another of those large, heavy objects used to place your suitcase on. Apparently they had no spare bedside tables! The stand they gave us was far too big for the room, and the position they left it in meant that we couldn't open the wardrobe door! (However, by manouevering it sideways on to the bed, we could then get access to the wardrobe, and getting in/out of bed was only a little tricky.) Filtered water (only one bottle between us, however) was supplied in the room, as was tea/coffee-making equipment. Breakfast was good (nice yoghourt) but would have been better served in the rooftop restaurant. It would also have been better if they hadn't penny-pinched on the \"juice\" - which wasn't juice, but some horrid, oversweetened, undrinkable liquid. (But there's a supermarket ,which sells nice juice, just over the street.) We tried the restaurant one night. We're vegetarian, and, as most mezzes are vegetarian to a large extent, we asked if we could have a vegetarian version of the mezze platter, with any meat items replaced with extra veggie items. \"Not possible\", we were told. The food we did get was OK. There's a nice sitting area downstairs, and the free wifi was available in our room as well as in public areas, which pleased us a lot. There's a computer tucked in a tiny room downstairs for those who haven't brought their own. The swimming pool shocked us at first by being so much smaller than it appeared in the photos, but we enjoyed it very much none the less. It's a nice design, and we were alone when we used it. My main quibble, I would think, was the rude sign on the inside of our bedroom door. I can't remember the exact wording, but very brusquely it said something like \"It is totally unacceptable to bring food or drink bought outside into the hotel\". Who do they think they are?! However, whenever we asked for help we got it with a smile (including the massive non-bedside table!) so I would rate the service highly.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "schilde", "Title": "\u201cnice, comfortable and well situated hotel\u201d", "Author": "walterSchilde", "ReviewID": "UR87376554", "Content": "I'd recommand this hotel to everybody visiting Istanbul.

Our stay at the Orient Express was one of the highlights of the trip. As stated by others, we were greeted on arrival by a warm welcome and a cup of apple tea. We were shown a book that contained a number of tours that we might be interested in looking over later. They were not pushy in trying to sell us any tours. It seemed to be more of \"we can help you with these if you like\". I appreciated the soft sell. The room, though small, was very clean and well attended to each day. I had requested a quiet room and thus we were on the \"backside\" of the hotel away from the front street. The view was lacking (a brick wall), but it was exactly what I wanted, quiet and peaceful. The bathroom was average is size and all in tile. The shower cabinet was smallish but OK. The one problem I had was that you stepped up into the shower stall to an elevated part of the shower. This was fine, but when I was stepping out, the drop made it rather difficult. I'm a big man (6'3\", 290) so rather than risk falling, I showered downstairs in the pool change area. the shower there was an easy walk-in type. Not a problem and I was usually the only person down there. My roomie, a normal size human being, had no problems. The breakfasts that were laid out were great. Some comments have said they were slow in putting everything out. This is true, but I think it is because very few people are there early. the breakfast opens at 7:00 AM. Every day I was there by 7:02. I was the first person there each day and frequently the only one until 7:30. Why put all the food out when few people show up until 8 - 8:30? In any case, what they put out was delicious. Lots of cereal, breads, yogurt, eggs, sausage, cold meats, cheeses, etc. Since we were there largely on business we were gone pretty early and returned usually around 5:00. I very much appreciated the happy hour the bar had with 2 for 1 drinks from 3-6 each day. We were able to sit a spell, enjoy a drink and review the days work with each other. The atmosphere was very nice and the service excellent. They also served free finger cheese sandwich in the bar during happy hour. Last but certainly not least i want to mention that every single member of the staff was outstanding. Everyone of them greeted you warmly and always seemed very eager to help you in any way.

Service - the staff were genuinely friendly without exception. Free afternoon tea and sandwiches. Breakfast - was self service - and there was something for everyone - set us up nicely for the day. Dinner - the hotel has it's own restaurant (The \"Imbat\") on the top floor of the hotel. Food was really good, as was the service and a view over the Bosphorus to boot. 3 courses, a bottle of wine, water, a beer for circa 45gbp. 10% discount if you are a guest. Free Wifi. Value - it was great value for money. The neutrals: Room - small but a view over the Bosphorus (in the distance!) - on 7th floor - facing the back. Some noise from the Imbat directly above and some on the Saturday night (music). We were not paying for luxury and we never got it - so we cannot moan.

The rooms were small, but cozy and nicely appointed. The rooms on the front all have french doors opening onto juliet balconies. There is even a \"cave pool\" in the basement which the kids used extensively after our days of touring Istanbul. The hotel is located in the heart of the Sultanhamet, conveniently only a five minute walk from Topkapi Palace which, in turn, is right next to the Hagia Sophya and it is just a short walk through the Hippodrome from there to the Blue Mosque. It is also only about 4 blocks from Galata Bridge on the Golden Horn, and the spice bazaar. Immediately across the street from the hotel, you find yourself in a maze of small cobblestone streets with lots of restaurants and shops. It is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel to the Grand Bazaar. There is a complementary tea (with sandwiches) every afternoon from 3-4 and a \"happy hour\" in the railway car bar in the lobby every day from 4-6. The hotel has a rooftop restaurant and bar, with great views of the Bosphorus--a lovely spot for an after dinner drink. We had a fabulous dinner at the restaurant on our last night and met the head of food and beverage for the Sirkeki Group, Levent Yigit , who was charming, helpful and friendly with all of the guests. The only negative thing to report about the hotel relates to a rather expensive tour we booked through one of their tour providers, Senkron Travel. According to the tour information the tour was supposed to start with a boat cruise of some sights on the Golden Horn, plus the Bosphorus. However, after waiting an hour for the people to show up, then being driven around the city for another half hour, we ended up being transferred to another bus, which then took us back to Ataturk Bridge where the boat tour began (we could have walked to Ataturk Bridge from our hotel in 10 minutes as it is right beside the Galata bridge). Then it turned out the the Golden Horn portion of the tour was nothing more than motoring under the Ataturk and Galata bridges. So, we left the tour at that point (having seen nothing but, fortunately, before we had paid) and went on one of our own, instead. We would highly recommend the Orient Express Hotel as a great location for anyone who is touring the Sultanhamet area of Istanbul.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, excellent service, good value\u201d", "Author": "ClaireinBrussels", "ReviewID": "UR79756984", "Content": "A friend recommended the Orient Express and he was right.

After reading many reviews on TripAdvisor, we decided on the Orient Express. We booked directly through their website. Since we booked for 3 nights, the airport transfer upon arrival was free which was great and we also took advantage of the cash discount. In the special notes section of their reservation form, we also mentioned our wedding anniversary . . . . What a WONDERFUL surprise it was to check into our hotel room to find a bottle of Turkish red wine and a BIG fruit basket filled with fresh fruit all wrapped up in festive wrap! Along with a card from the hotel management congratulating us on our wedding anniversary! Finding a bowl of delicious Turkish Delights in the silver bowl on the bed was a treat itself but the complimentary anniversary touches was such a thoughtful wedding anniversary wine and fruit basket was absolutely AWESOME! COMMENTS: - Airport Transfer : free and included if you stay 3 nights or more. Unfortunately, our Turkish Air flight arrived 1 hour late on a very busy Friday afternoon and we feared that our free airport transfer had left without us but lo and behold, he was there waiting for us! We were very happy that we were not left stranded at the airport! If you have an airport transfer with the hotel, remember to have a few liras, dollars or euros for the driver ;) - Front Desk : very helpful and always friendly. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a warm welcome and genuine hospitality at the front desk with an offer of hot apple tea. We were also given a short and very helpful introduction to Istanbul. We received a map of Old City Istanbul, brochures of suggested activities as well as a 10% discount Family Card valid at restaurants owned by the Sirkeci Group (of which the Orient Express is part of). Since it was our first visit to Istanbul, we had lots of questions and the staff was always very friendly and helpful! - Cash Discount - payment was easy and we received a receipt for our payment no problem whatsoever. - Hotel Restaurants : We took advantage of the Family Discount card and ate at both the Imbat Terrace Restaurant (roof of Orient Express) and the Pasazade Restaurant (roof of Erboy Hotel around the corner). Both were great, service was excellent as was the food and views. Recommend you make reservations if you want to secure a table at sunset as the restaurants fill up - reception will be happy to make the reservation for you. - Breakfast : delicious! Excellent buffet breakfast was included in our booking and we took advantage of it every day. Large selection of both hot and cold entrees, fruit juices, coffees, teas, pastries and fresh fruit. Service was friendly and good. No complaints! - Location : PERFECT! The tram runs directly in front of the hotel and the walk to the nearest station is 5 minutes away. Most major Istanbul monuments and sights are within walking distance as well. Tram is easy to use and navigate and extremely affordable - no need to bother with taxis. Lots of banks, ATMs, restaurants, cafes, bakeries, convenience stores (where you can buy bottled water, snacks), souvenirs shops all located up and down the street within easy leisurely stroll of the hotel. This is most probably the BEST location in Istanbul to stay for just about e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g! - Suggested Activities : as mentioned, we received a couple of brochures from the front desk upon check-in and we opted for the Orient House Dinner & Orient Show one night and the Turkish Dance Night at the Hodjapasha Culture Center. Both were worthwhile bookings and highly recommended for first time visitors to Istanbul. - Hotel Room and Amenities : our room was nice, clean and tidy. A little on the smallish side but that's to be expected at most hotels in general in Turkey. The air con worked very well, almost too well as we were quite cold after a while! - Swimming pool : located in the basement and suitable for refreshing dip after a long day sightseeing all around town! Very clean and almost never any hotel guests. There is a changing room with lockers, shower and big clean towels provided for free. (Thus, if you are looking to lounge under the blazing sun by the pool all day long, this pool is not the place for you but if you don't mind otherwise, it's perfectly fine ;) - Hotel bar / lounge area : in the ground floor of the lobby and there is a \"Happy Hour\" at the bar every day. Very popular! - Free Wi-Fi : fast, stable and reliable free wi-fi in our room, all throughout the hotel and also a couple of computers in the lobby where guests can use the internet. In Istanbul (and most of Turkey as we later discovered), you're never far from a free wi-fi spot or Internet cafe! In summary, we wish we could have extended our stay in Istanbul even longer as we loved it very much. When --- not if --- we return to Istanbul, we will definitely stay at the Orient Express Hotel.

The hotel has a great roof top restaurant and we ate here on one evening and again it was excellent, the hotel had even organised a birthday cake.It was a real shame that the hotel did not make more use of this area, breakfast is served in the basement area and although the food was very good it was a little claustrophobic. To sum up this is not a 5 star establishment and has nothing to do with the Orient Express train, however it is a fantastic small friendly hotel offering real genuine hospitality in the heart of old Istanbul minutes walk from all the major sites and is tremendous value for money.

The beds are separate and the rooms are cosy, not extremely huge but really big enough, it has a bit of the orient express atmosphere in the bedroom as well. The bathroom is spacious and clean + has a nice tub. The swimmingpool downstairs is very relaxing and there are also extra nextdoor changing rooms with lockers and a good shower and toilet. You can use the internet in a separate room. The luggage has a separate small depot so after checking out you do not have to take your luggage with you right away. The bar and lobby are cosy as well and the breakfast has really enough to choose from. It can be reached by tram, it is in a street with a lot of shops and restaurants. If you need a good and not too expensive way to travel to the airport Sabiha Gokcen then go to the stand of Yume at the entrance of Hagya Sophya and buy a ticket for 20TL per person. Normally, the drive is about 50 EURO by taxi (excluding toll fee) and takes about 1,5hrs. The Yume service will pick you up at the hotel and get you at the airport much cheaper. Hardly any taxi driver speaks english and some of them cannot read the maps. This info is not meant to be insulting but only to share, they really are very friendly and try to help but it is difficult if you cannot communicate even by map.

We knew that when booking (with my business colleague)- it is owned by the Sirkeci Group. Apparently this group got into lots of financial problems but has over the last four years been given capital to renovate their properties with the Orient Express Hotel being the linch pin in this effort. The Hotel is named after the famous Oriental Express since it is right up from the old and shabby train station (with a moden edition attached). One other note on what is is NOT before I move on to WHAT IT IS (this is written to my fellow Americans). It is NOT the Marriott Asia, nor is it the Ritz Carlton (situated in New Town with incredible views and sky high prices). So what is it? It is a really classy little European style small hotel (and I mean small or quaint in every way. cozy lobby, cozy lounge, small European Style rooms- nice, well almost, but not reaching elegance in their decor and furnishings). The service is incredible, and fantastic in that \"almost servile\" Turkish manner which, if I can speak as an American, is sometimes close to be unnerving (close but not over the line). Whatever you want- \"we can get it for you, not to worry\". Lounge is really great. With rooms you have a choice...if you are on a budget then purchase ear plugs and stay in the front rooms. The Tram noise and street noise is no stop. If you can afford it get a back room for the views and peace. The place is right in the center of the tourist areas- new Mosque, Blue Mosque, Sophia Hagia, not far from the Bazaars and a 15 minute walk to new town, two minutes from the train stations and water ferries to Asia. The roof top restaurant is enough to make one want to eat every meal there- with views of Asia and the Bosphorus.

The hotel is on a bustling street lined with fast food outlets, cafes, restaurants and tourist shops, but there is a feeling of tranquility as you enter the reception area. Next to reception is a lounge area with sofas, and a bar. All the staff I met, without exception, were genuinely warm and friendly, and were only too happy to help with any requests or problems. The rooms are well-furnished, comfortable and clean. The hotel had put a bowl of Turkish Delight in my room as a welcome. They also provided a tea/coffee tray, with a jug of filtered water for the kettle (replenished every day), which was a nice touch. My room was quite small and didn't have a lot of storage space - but in a fascinating city like Istanbul you don't spend much time inside. Breakfast is excellent, with a wide choice including cereal, pastries, fruit and fresh tea/coffee.

We chose it primarily for it's location, the roof terrace and swimming pool. I had discovered on a hotel booking site that they also had 2 suites as well as the standard rooms, so as we were 3 sisters travelling together we requested one of these. We were on the 7th floor but sadly the room did not benefit from a view as it was at the front of the hotel, the advantage of being on this floor was that we were completely unaware of the traffic below. As we were staying for 3 nights the hotel offered a free airport transfer, and we were met on our arrival at Aturturk by the hotel's driver, and taken to the hotel. Here we were met by Meric (customer relations) and offered apple tea and turkisk delight whilst she showed us on a map where all the major sites were, and the best ways to get about. The reception staff were friendly and courteous and we never had to remind them of our room number when we returned to the hotel. My only criticism of the room would be lat there was minimal storage space for our clothes. The breakfast was plentiful, and there was a good choice available. It was also served over a longer period of time than I have previously experienced. The swimming pool, whilst small, was adequate with good changing facilities and shower, free towels were offered from the lockers. We used the pool most days and generally had it to ourselves. We chose not to eat in the rooftop restaurant, but the menu looked good and the views from the terrace towards the Bospherous Bridge were superb. One evening when we were enjoying a drink up there the waiter kindly brought us pashminas to use as the evening air was cool! The hotel met all our expectations for it's location, we were glad that we had opted for a small hotel as the service we received was extremely personal. I would not hesitate to recommend it to friends wishing to stay in an excellent location at a very reasonable price. All the major sites were easily walked to and we did not need to use the taxis or trams at all.

[Cost L10 ] The trip lasted about 2 hours and went as far as the second bridge. The costs in Istanbul were generally reasonable. The Topkapi was the most expensive, L20 plus an extra L15 to enter the Harem Buildings. The crowds were horrendous and it was very difficult to see the various exhibits. We used a Shuttle Bus Service from the airport on the Asian side [ Sabiha Gokcen]. This was pre-booked and we were met at the airport by a rep. Cost was E10 for each person, each way. It was quite efficient but the return journey was marred as the driver arrived to pick us up from the hotel over 1 hour early. Luckily we were just checking out so were able to leave straight away. not sure what would have happened if we had not been in the hotel. Our stay was short so we did not venture far afield. However we did enjoy a visit to the Spice market and close to the Spice Market was a wonderful Mosque called the 'Rustem Pasha Mosque' decorated with the most beautiful tiles. Well worth a visit .

Visits to the Grand Bazaar (many,many small shops) and the Spice market are not to be missed.

It is safe to say that we were not dissapointed in the least, and in fact, it was the greatest vacation experience I ever had in my life. When we arrived as soon as we entered the door we were asked to sit down so that we could be given apple tea and an introduction to the city from the guest relations manager. Taken aback at the hospitality, which we never experienced because we are full time grad and undergraduate students and don't have much money, we asked to smoke a cigarette after our long flight from New York and and ride to the hotel. The staff wholeheartedly understood and as soon as we were finished we sat on the hotel lobby sofa and experienced our first taste of the Orient Express hospitality. Being that I was in the city before and knew where the monuments were located, the guest service manager directed her introduction to my wife and even took the time to save us money by making it a point to tell her that she had to bargain in the Grand Bazaar in order to not be taken by the shop keepers, as well as giving us a card that saved us 10% at all of the Sirkeci Group restaurants in the area, including the famous Imbat Terrace on the roof. After that we spent seven days at the hotel, drank complimentary tea every afternoon in the lobby, swam in the swimming pool, ate at the superb Imbat restuarant on the hotel's roof, and enjoyed ourselves in the beautifal city of Istanbul. The staff of the hotel was more friendly and helpful than we could ever have imagined and when the shuttle driver we paid to pick us up on our last day failed to show on time the hotel staff called us a cab to get us to the airport on time. When we arrived at the airport and found our flight was cancelled due to high winds in New York the hotel gave us our room back and even set up a private car to take us to the airport the next morning.

Choice of hot, (warm), food; egg, frankfurters (bit red for my liking) and cheese pastry. Changed slightly each day but still samey. The cold selection was good on the first day but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change. Plenty of choice for cereals, dried fruit but nothing to excite. The room we had was on the 7th floor, overlooked buildings at the back, bit small but adequate. Warm room and the bed was comfortable. Water and Turkish delight in room, nice touch. Very noisy at night with doors from other rooms banging loudly and other guests conversations clear when they were in their room and on the corridor. The TV was a bog standard 14\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with only one English Channel. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go on holiday to watch the TV but occasionally you like to have a diversion other than the news. Picture wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much good either. If you are spending a week here it is ideal. Plenty of restaurants and bars only 5-10 minutes away. The North Shield pub showed all of the premier, La liga, Dutch matches and if you want beer from home they sold it. Food was okay if more continental than Turkish. All in all Istanbul was different but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer much more than other cities. The hotel offers a shuttle service from the airport at 25euros for 2 each way. You can get it cheaper, we got it for 12 euros each way on the internet.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location & wonderful service!\u201d", "Author": "Kikujiro", "ReviewID": "UR55153748", "Content": "We stayed at the Orient Express Hotel from 20-26 November to our fullest satisfaction. One of the main reasons we chose this hotel is its excellent location close to many of the major historic sights in Istanbul. The Topkapi Palace, the Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, the Basilica Cistern, the Archaeology Museum, the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum, The Egyptian Bazaar and the Galata Bridge are all within walking distance from the hotel. Furthermore the hotel is close to a tram stop and about 10-15 minutes from a large bus station. Service at the hotel is great. Before arrival the (beautiful!) Guest Relations Manager Ceren \u00c3\u2021ipa was already of great help to us when we were planning our trips out of town. After arrival in Istanbul, we were picked up at the airport by a taxi the hotel had arranged for us. We did not have to wait for other guests sharing our minivan and the ride to the hotel was quick and smooth. At the hotel we were welcomed with some hot apple tea in the nicely furnished lobby. If you like, the hotel can arrange trips for you. As we had already made our own travel plan in advance, we did not make use of this service. Rooms are small, but not smaller than the rooms in other European hotels of the same class in for example Amsterdam, London or Paris. I thought the free Turkish Delight on the bed was a nice touch (and could not stop eating once I had started). Our room had a shower and a bath tub and the usual anemities like soap, shampoo and a hairdryer. Also there are an airconditioner, coffee and tea making facilities and a safe in the room. Walls are a bit thin, so you can hear muffled sounds of the people sleeping in the next room(s). The breakfast buffet is excellent and offers a wide variety of (local) products. We even skipped lunch a couple of times as we ate too much in the morning! The service of the employees in the breakfast room, under supervision of the wonderful Mehmet G\u00c3\u00bcven, was great.

The top quality service stated when we were unable to obtain a cab because the Turkey Cab drivers were all after the higher fairs for customers disembarking the cruise headed to the airport. So we contacted the hotel and they arrange for a cab to pick us up and provided the number. Well a cab with a very similar number stopped by and confirmed he was sent by Orient Express. Turns out he wasn't and request $58 US in lieu of the $10-$15 for the little over a mile trip. We call Orient Express and they ask us to get the Bellboy when we arrived. The cab driver must have learned what was up and proceeded to drop us off at the corner. I went to get the bellboy as the wife guarded the bags and held off payment. The bell boy argued and took the cabs number. We still ended up paying 30 Lira. But this was much better than $58 US. They were going to file a complaint but since we were only going to be in town one night it would do no good since we would not be available once the police contacted them for our statement. None the less this service was greatly appreciated. We had booked a single room for 3 people and they offered us two rooms because of all of our luggage and I believe to compensate us for our unpleasant start in their country. It turns out the majority of the people we met during our visit were very friendly, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let a crooked cab driver give you a bad impression of Turkey. The rooms were small but by European standard above average and the room and entire facility were very clean and well maintained.

This is an ideal hotel for exploring the historic peninsular & pretty much all the sites on the peninsular are within walking distance. The rooms are on the small side but are clean & reasonably equipped - TV, room safe, minibar, shower (no bath) & much needed aircon (temp was mostly 30C + during our stay). Ours also had a tiny balcony. The room also seemed fairly quiet - we didn't hear the early morning call to prayer once & judging by the calls later in the day they're pretty loud when you're outside. The hotel has a bar on the ground floor, a roof restaurant, a separate breakfast room & a small indoor pool. The staff are very friendly & helpful and the very reasonable price we paid included transport to & from Attaturk airport. All in all this hotel was an excellent choice & I can thoroughly recommend it. I can also recommend Istanbul which is very impressive. The mosques and palaces are beautiful & in some cases very ancient. Transport is cheap with a mixture of trams, buses, metro & ferries, all seemingly at one set price (1.6 TRY). Yellow cabs are literally everywhere so never a problem if you want one - quite likely they will hail you. The ferries are an easy 15 minutes walk from the hotel & open up possibilites for exploring along the Golden Horn & Bospheros. We did a 2 hour boat trip one day & tried hopping on a ferry up the Bospheros on another occasion - would have liked to have done more but we ran out of time. We really enjoyed the food in Istanbul and found it reasonably priced & very often in interesting locations - we ate on pavements, rooftops, quay sides, under the Galata Bridge (much nicer than it sounds), beside mosques and one night in an ancient Roman Cistern. A few tips: If your finances will run to it stay longer than we did - the area has a lot to offer and 6 days wasn't really enough. Do have a fish roll at Eminonu where the ferries are - they're cheap & delicious (think of a burger stall but with fresh fish rolls served up by a man in traditional uniform and you'll get the idea). Do bring sensible shoes as quite a lot of the streets are cobbled.

We made the choice because of the price, and because I have always enjoyed Agatha Christie stories, and I have worked for a railway company. We wondered what we had let ourselves in for when we arrived. The road outside the hotel is also a tramline, and at certain times of the day, the Police block off the hotel to road traffic. The taxi driver, however, carried our very heavy bag from the adjacent road, and we arrived at the hotel. It doesn't look much from the outside, but once in, the hotel has a charm and a grace that is particularly charismatic. From the first arrival to the day of the departure three days later, the Customer Service was excellent. We had to wait for a taxi one day, and whilst this happened, the hotel staff made us a cup of Apple Tea. There is 2for1 in the Hotel Bar in the late afternoon, with complimentary sandwiches and free orange juice. On the Saturday, one chap was celebrating his birthday, and the hotel staff dimmed the lights and suprised the family with a birthday cake with candles. We all got a slice, even though we didn't know the gentleman! The hotel is 100 metres away from the tram stop. Just 1.5 Turkish Lira takes you on one journey to the end of the line, and most tourist places can be reached from the tramline within walking distance (even in the heat). The hotel is also about 500 metres from the numerous ferry crossings to the other side (ie; Asia), and the ferry crossing is only 1 Turkish Lira, and well worth the experience. I wouldn't try and organise my sightseeing tours in advance in the future, because all of the locals are friendly in all parts of the city. We felt completely safe whilst we were there, and do it yourself travel is so cheap. Took me by surprise when taxi drivers refused tips, and even more by suprise when shop proprieters refused to haggle because they have to charge the same price for Turkish citizens as they do for tourists. A refreshing change. The restaurant view on the top of the hotel is superb, although the food wasn't as good as the description, but still quite palatable. The breakfast service was truly excellent. Although we were on time on all three days, some people on each day who arrived just before or even a few minutes after 10am still had a full choice of the breakfast offer. That's a first in all my time stopping at hotels all over the World! The swimming pool in the basement is small, but quaint, and the arrangements for the changing rooms are quite easy to follow. A yellow towel is provided in the locker, and you leave your key in the locker after you've put your towel in the wash basket and finished. The rooms are small, and designed to emulate a sleeping car compartment on a train. The \"big bed\" only just fitted in the room, and was a conventional double bed (certainly not a Queen size). Don't forget to take drinking water with you, and brush your teeth with drinking water. Tap water is definitely a no no. Oh, and if you are a train spotter, the railway station is just round the corner. Not much traffic, and more like Wigan Wallgate than the \"International Station\", but it has historical flavour, and is very busy when the odd train does run. Highlights of the weekend were the Grand Bazaar, the ferry trip across the Bosphorous, eating great food at various street vendours, and the Saturday night in the Muslim quarter watching the locals viewing Wimbledon and puffing away at their lemon flavoured \"waterpipes\".

We had a front room on to the street - not a problem as traffic (apart from trams and deliveries) is banned from the street. Only odd noise came from one very late night guest and a muezzin who seemed to think that prayer at 3.47am was essential........ The beds were a little firm - no very hard actually - in contrast to the pillows which were very good. Bathroom fine and shower worked well. Aircon controllable (remote) and effective as well as relatively quiet. Rooftop restaurant was very good and well worth eating there to take in the view and sup a beer or two as well. Reasonably priced and good quality. Not as enthused as some about breakfast - perfectly reasonable but would prefer some more fresh fruit at the expense of three choices of olives. Bread nice. Choice can be a bit limited later on. Orient Express location is excellent - walk essentially to everywhere a tourist would need to go and the tram/metro combination to Ataturk airport is very easy if you are travelling reasonably light - saves quite a bit on taxis and at busy times can be quicker.

Over a welcome drink, and while the receptionist sorted out our room and paperwork, Ceren gave us a very helpful introduction to the hotel and the surrounding attractions. We then went to our room (703 on the top bedrooms floor) to unpack and found it to be very clean, nicely furnished with a nice bathroom. It was not particularly big and the view (at the back of the hotel) could have been better. On having a look around the hotel, we discovered our room was immediately below the restaurant. This was to have a bad impact on our first night! After a walk round, and being impressed by, the immediate area and having had a meal, we went back to the hotel for an early night (we'd been up since 5 o'clock). This is where our problems started. We were continually disturbed by chairs and/or tables being scraped across the floor of the restaurant (which can be open until 2am) as well as the noise of thehotel's air conditioning unit which appeared to be somewher adjacent to our room. Eventually, at 12.30, I went to reception to ask to be moved but they were unable to do it for that night, the hotel being full. However, he said we would be moved the next day. Don't hold your breath, I thought. Next morning, after we had a really nice breakfast, we went to reception and a different receptionist knew of our complaint and immediately offered us the choice of 2 rooms on the front of the hotel. We took 502, which was very nice, light and airy. The breakfast room was nicely set out & furnished and the available choices were substantial. There was always a choice of hot food as well as a good selection of fruit, meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, jams, honey, tea, coffee, etc. You certainly could start your day well fed! Each afternoon at 4 pm, the hotel provided very welcome complimentary tea and sandwiches in the Wagon Bar. The bar also had a happy hour between 4 and 6 when local drinks were 2 for 1. Apart from the very minor hiccup on the first night, I can honestly say we found this a great hotel to stay at. We couldn't fault it. The service from ALL the staff was excellent: they were extremely helpful,courteous and very, very pleasant. Nothing was too much bother for them. Our room, although not huge, was very comfortable and kept really clean by the pleasant Bulgarian chambermaids. The sparkingly clean bathroom was adequate with an over the bath shower (screen was the full length of the bath). The hotel location could not have been better: all the major sites were within walking distance or a short tram ride away. The tram system was excellent; a flat cost of TL1.5 (60 pence) for any journey. The same cost for a ferry journey so you could go from Europe to Asia for 60 pence: cheapest inter-continental travel anywhere! We found the tram especially useful as my wife fractured her foot 3 weeks before we travelled. She gamely hobbled around using a walking stick but was very wary of the somewhat uneven pavements. She always was given a seat on a tram! I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and, if we ever go back to Istanbul, (we would both like to do so) we'll definitely stay at the Orient Express. Finally, on my actual birthday, we were having afternoon tea when in walked Ceren and other staff with a birthday cake for me, singing \"Happy Birthday\"!

Very simple breakfast but has enough to fill you up. The room walls are paper thin. We were facing the main road (ask for a room at the back).

She even placed a birthday cake and a gift in our room for my wife, both un-asked for but most welcome. On arrival at the hotel from the airport, via a taxi that Ceren had arranged, we were greeted by smiling faces and very curtious attention by the lobby staff who asked us to rest in the front lounge and take some rolls and apple tea, all complimentary. It all added to a very civilised start to our break. That attention to service was present thoughout our break, nothing being too much trouble for them to assist us. Their suggestions for the trips we took around Istanbul were spot on, with their booking for a private guide was the best idea, and one I would reccomend doing.

I would highly recommend this hotel for everything and if your staying a while it might be worth booking the 7th floor suite, which has a seperate sitting/ lounge area so you can spread out more as the rooms aren't huge (but thats Istanbul in general). 5/10 mins from the hotel is the old Orient Express Train station where you can watch the Prayer ritual of the Whirling Dirvishes and 5 mins up the street is the Underground cistern, Blue mosque, St Sophia the list goes on!

I have to start off by saying that all of the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. The location is great. It's right next to the #38 tram which goes to Sta. Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, and the Cisterns. If you want to walk, it's about ten minutes from all of these. The street where the hotel is located is lined with shops and reasonably-priced restaurants. There are two supermarkets nearby. The hotel has a very good, reasonably-priced rooftop restaurant. All very positive....Now, the negative points. The rooms, though very clean, are the smallest I've ever seen in a hotel, even by European standards. There is very little closet space and the only drawers are in the night-table (one night-table with one drawer for two people) and in the desk. (Two small drawers for papers.) The closet was not big enough for two. We had to leave clothes in our suitcases. (That's OK for a couple of nights, but I wouldn't want to do it for a week.) The bed was as hard as a rock, and we have a hard bed at home. It was impossible to get comfortable after a long day of touring. The heat was unbearable. We had to turn on the A.C. to be able to even be in the room. I had been told that the breakfast was wonderful, but I found it adequate, at best. The scrambled eggs (when there were eggs) had no taste. There were boiled eggs, but it would've been nice to have had a more tasty alternative. The yoghurt was excellent, and the assorted pastries were good as well. For those who like fruit, the selection was limited. My husband likes cheese and cold cuts for breakfast. The selection was poor. We didn't use the pool, but we did look at it. It did not appear to have been cleaned for quite some time. In short, this is not a bad hotel if you're prepared for a very normal three-star establishment. I would probably look for something else in the neighborhood of Sultanamet if I were to return to Istanbul.

The restaurant provided magnificent views over both city and the city water ways. We never had difficulties in getting the best seat in the restaurant, as long as you booked early enough. The Hotel location is perfect for walking just about to everywhere in the old city, no mean feat when you are 65. The tram to the other side of the Golden Horn is right at the front door and easy to use. The harbour, with its ferries to all parts of the Bosporus, is also within walking distance from the hotel (and again accessible by tram if you feel a little slack) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and so is the railway station. On departure the front desk arranged for a cab to our next destination As already said, all staff were fantastic, but Ms Zerrin Kanat needs to be singled out for a special mention. Ms Kanat not only assisted us with making several changes to our original, self-made, on-line booking, but also provided us with copious information which enabled us to navigate around the all too mysterious Turkish Railways on-line booking system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she was fantastic.

We ate there twice{ the steak was excellent}. The Wagon room {bar and lobby}, was very relaxing, especially during happy hour {4-6}, when a free selection of rolls and half price drinks were on offer. Just one tip, go to the bar yourself or you will pay an extra service charge for your drinks. Istanbul was a delight, massive amounts of history and all served in a friendly way, try the Dolmabache palace, catch the tram from near the train station to the end of the line, just a 5 minute walk from here.The topkapi palace and blue mosque are spectacular also. If you like shopping, go to the grand bazaar and get very lost amongst the 1450 shops covering 63 streets, mostly selling the same things, but great fun haggling, or the many shops that offer fixed prices if you don't feel confident.

In a walking distance from Sultanahmet Mosque, Agia-Sophia, Topkapi Palace etc, right in the heart of the Old Istanbul. The street itself is a bit noisy due to the railways, with restaurants, hotels and shops on both sides. No great views, but very convenient for city walkers. 2/ Rooms Very small in size, with french balcony (that means no balcony at all :)), aircon and bathroom (with bath, not shower cabin). The beds are a bit small for anyone taller than 185 cm, so keep it in mind. The other thing is if you've got a room which faces the street - you'll hardly sleep at night, so beware of rooms 601-602, 501-502 and so on. Everything else is good. 3/ Breakfast Sorry, we missed it :). But they say it's quite good and tasty, although you've got lots of places around to have your morning coffee (try John's Cafe&Restaurant near Kabatas train station - you can get there by tram which stops near the hotel and goes to Kabatas, get off on the stop just before the Kabatas itself - they have the best Kenyan coffee in town! Sadly, noone there speaks English, but the food and drinks are delicious!) 4/ Price $280 for 2 nights.

The style of the lobby, restaurants etc. is inspired by the legendary Orient Express train, which is a nice touch (the old Istanbul station where the Orient Express used to stop is a two-minute walk away). It is very conveniently located, at walking distance from virtually every major touristic sight (beware of the tramway thouogh, which runs right in front of the entrance! I have noticed that some travelers have complained of street noise in the rooms, I had no such trouble but then my room (4th floor) was not located at the streetside. On arrival we were received in a very friendly manner with a complementary tea and a snack, and were given some information on Istanbul and its attractions by the hotel's guest relations manager (who spoke excellent English BTW), while the front desk personnel took care of the adminstrative details. The room was not very large, but very clean and nicely furnished, with good beds. The airconditioner wasn't working very well, but this was promply taken care of as soon as we mentioned it. The TV featured programmes in English and French as well as in Turkish. The free safebox was also very convenient. (Minor) weaknesses: relatively small (but adequate) room size; and limited wardrobe space. Small detail: only one drinking glass was provided in the bathroom (for a double room). The indoor swimming pool is rather small but clean. Towels are provided. Breakfast was good, not the largest selection I've come across in a four-star hotel but certainly sufficient, and of good quality. The rooftop restaurant is a big plus, it has a great view, a good selection of Turkish and international cuisine. Room service is available and the personnel was also very friendly. The bar on the ground floor, directly behind the lobby, is nice but it was very quiet at all times we visited. There is a 'happy hour' in the afternoon, but in my opinion it might be a good idea to do this in the rooftop restaurant instead. as I suspect a considerable proportion of the guests don't realize how nice the roof terrace is. Finally let me reiterate that the service is superb. You can really tell that the hotel staff enjoy their work and take pride in making the guests feel at home. Every request was promptly taken care of, and with a smile! Overall, an excellent experience with the great service easily outbalancing a few minor shortcomings.

Because we booked online and stayed for a week, we were also given free transport to and from the airport-- when we booked, we were only told about the free transfer *from* the airport, so this was a handy bonus. On check-in I was originally shown to a room on the second floor, but the guy on the desk explained he didn't really work on reception and I should come back down in five minutes when his colleague returned. When I did so, I was offered a welcome drink, and as well as pointing out all the local attractions, his colleague offered me the option of a slightly better room, which I took. Although it was right on the main street above the main entrance, the only real noise was from the trams, and they certainly didn't disturb our sleep. Otherwise it was big enough, clean and well-maintained, and had a bath as well as a shower, which is always nice. Free wireless internet is available (as well as a PC in the lobby if you don't have your laptop), and proved to be pretty reliable by hotel standards, although it did go down for a few hours one day. The access points aren't secured, though (i.e. no WPA or WEP password required to connect), if that sort of thing bothers you. All the staff were friendly and very helpful, and the ones on the desk all spoke good English.

Whilst there the Orient Express Hotel is a clean, well-priced hotel in which to stay and it's in an excellent location for all the historic sites. The welcome, and the attitude of the staff in general, was exemplary. The rooms are good although a little short on storage space and the bathroom was not big enough to accommodate a full bath. In its place was one of those showers with a step in it that means you can sit down but not stretch out your legs. Our room looked out over the backyard of the hotel which, whilst not terribly glamourous, meant that we weren't bothered by the noise of the street early in the morning. Breakfast is buffet-style and was very good with a huge variety of things to try. The Wagon Bar next to reception was pleasant enough but, in the period we were there, never had many people in it. If you choose to stay here, try to eat at the rooftop restaurant on at least one occasion. The food is pretty good (if a bit on the expensive side for Istanbul) but the view over the Bosphorus is worth the money alone. Location-wise, you can't get better. Turn left out of the hotel and within 400m you are at the Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque and the Aya Sofia; turn right and it's 400m to the Bosphorus. Being British I did wonder whether the fall-out from Iraq might cause us some trouble but, other than the occasional \"Oh\", the Istanbulis were all tremendously friendly and always eager to try to sell you something that you know you'll never use. You get used to smiling and saying \"No\", or just ignoring people - no-one takes offence! Note that you can eat very cheaply in Istanbul but, because booze isn't as freely available as it is in other European cities, the price of drinks varies tremendously. Best place we found was the Nezih Bar (turn right out of hotel and after about 100m it's on a small street on the right) where Efez beer (the local 5% lager) was 3 Lira a pint. We were charged 9 Lira a pint in another local bar for the same stuff so take care. Before we went to Istanbul whenever I mentioned it at work I got asked: \"why there?\". It really is a fantastic place to visit and, whilst busy, it isn't yet as packed with tourists as many other cities. Go there... and stay at the Orient Express!

In my opinion the hotel appears to be over-staffed, although friendly and helpful as they were, each time we came in for the evening, the lobby seemed crowded with bar staff, reception staff and porters - all mingling around the front door and desk area. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is in a great location for sights and transport. The hotel is clean and attractive. The beds were surprisingly comfortable which are not something Turkish hotels are known for. The rooms badly lacked storage space - (wardrobe was miniscule - i suppose it could be described as a \"capsule wardrobe\" ) :) Breakfast (07.00 to 10.30),was excellent - lots of choice of freshly prepared fare. Unless you are a very heavy sleeper, ask for a back room, as even though the trams seem to cease around 01.00, the tram lines are repaired after that time and the line workers hammer away at the lines until the trams start again around 06.00. Disregard the website's photo of the swimming pool - it's actually a whole lot smaller than the photo would have you believe - it's basically a \"splash\" pool.

They are about 10 Euros difference in price and both offer cash discounts: LOCATION: ORIENT EXPRESS (because I personally don't like the touristy aspect of Sultanahmet) Sultanahmet is where all the main attractions are, Aya Sofya, Sultanahmet Camii, Kapal\u00c4\u00b1 \u00c3\u00a7ar\u00c5\u0178\u00c4\u00b1 (Grand Bazaar), etc. so it's great for all that. The thing I don't like is that Sultanahmet is incredibly touristy, so someone will try to sell you something every 2 minutes walking in that area. There's a bunch of restaurants by the metro station. Within a few short blocks of the hotel there are some decent restaurants too, so you don't have to always walk over to the main drag. Orient Express is one metro stop away from Sultanahmet. It's literally right on the metro path (you walk out of the hotel a few steps and you could get hit by the metro). That street has restaurants and usual shops, but they don't grab you as much as they do in Sultanahmet. In fact, rarely. Being on the metro path and a busy street, you will hear some street noise but it wasn't too bad at all. ROOM / HOTEL: ORIENT EXPRESS (edged out slightly due to room size) Dersaadet is an independent, small hotel. The rooms are smaller and older, but very clean and absolutely adequate. Bed is comfortable and bathroom is very clean. There is free internet at the lobby, and there is a laundry shop a few doors down. There's a restaurant at the rooftop but we only had breakfast there. Orient Express is part of a hotel group, so it has more of a standard hotel feel. The room is more standard Hilton'ish, decent size and there's more room for luggage and stuff. Bed is also comfortable and bathroom is also very clean. There is also free internet and printer by the lobby, but the printer was broken at the time. There's a rooftop restaurant and a cafe/bar downstairs. They have laundry service but I imagine it'd be on par with the price at a regular hotel, which is expensive. They serve welcome Elma \u00c3\u2021ay (fake apple tea) and zimit when we checked in. Both hotels offer free airport pickup if you stay a certain number of nights. To go to istanbul airport, you actually could take the metro if you don't have too much luggage and it'll save you money (about 2.6 YTL vs. 25 Euros). Just remember that during busy hours the metro cars get crowded and it may not be comfortable for a few stops, but it was fine for us. STAFF: DERSAADET All the front desk staff at Dersaadet is awesome - incredibly polite, friendly, and helpful, and I'd say more personable than OE. We mostly talked to Umit and he's just great. Really friendly and try to help with everything. More people work at OE, and the staff we met were also very polite and helpful, but just slightly more \"standard\" overall. When they were recommending things to do, it was more to the tune of generic packaged tours. If you ask about other specific things, they may not know. There's really nothing I can fault the staff at OE, but Dersaadet's smaller, more close-knit staff gives a more personal feeling to our stay. BREAKFAST: Sort of tied. Both have good selection of cereal, cold cuts, breads, dried fruits, etc. OE has a larger selection that includes sausages and scrambled eggs, different cheeses, etc. But really, how much can you eat at breakfast?

Nearly new boxsping, and the nice cleaning lady looks after it, every day! Very, very clean. The bathrooms are small but clean. Some have a douche, some of them have a small bath. The swimmingpool is smaller then it looks like on the photo's at their site and I missed the sauna... STAFF The staff is really great, always helpful and interested. They are also great with kids and spend some time with our daughter (3) running and playing hide and seek in the large Lobby and bar. She loved it!
