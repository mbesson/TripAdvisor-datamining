The reception staff are friendly and happy to help or to give advice. I stayed with my mum in a family room - we chose it because it had a double and a single bed. It wasn't huge, but a good size for the price, included a nice tv, desk, wardrobe, drawers - everything you'd need basically! There was also a fridge, bottled water and a kettle with tea and coffee. Everything looked clean, well maintained and new. The bathroom was very well fitted out with a lovely shower and very clean. But a bit strange thing is that it's partioned off from the rest of the room with a large, frosted glass barrier - practically see-through and very difficult to get any privacy! The hotel was well located and very easy to get around - a perfect base for exploring Singapore! Being a smaller hotel, many of the taxi drivers did not know where it was, but usefully it was opposite the Sim Lim Tower, so this is a good landmark to ask for! We had a good stay here - it's not luxury but it is a well appointed, very clean and friendly hotel. However there was one drawback we found - the noise! It's on a busy main road - our room overlooked this and the traffic was busy and non-stop. There is currently also a building site nearby and we could hear construction noise throughout the working day. The constant drone was very irritating (especially when suffering from jetlag!) but with a good pair of earplugs I didn't find that it interrupted my sleep any. One other minor gripe - although the wifi is free, it is very poor and unreliable. I was not able to connect in my room and judging by the number of other laptop/ tablet users who were hovering in reception, I was not the only one. Even when I was connected the service was very poor and keep dropping out - not so bad for very casual use, but really not workable if internet access is essential. So, in summary, I would definitely stay here again - the cost vs location vs comfort is great - but I will be packing my earplugs!", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta", "Title": "\u201cClean, good location, but no window - ok for short stay\u201d", "Author": "Olie92", "ReviewID": "UR127107426", "Content": "Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in Feb-12.

I wanted to do my shopping at Mustafa Centre in Little India. Althought the Fortuna Hotel was located just opposite to Mustafa, this is a worst hotel. After intensive research to find a hotel accomodation near Little India, I read the guest reviews about Mayo Inn (located opposite Sim Lim Tower) , and booked a family room for two days. The staff named Ana was very helpful and contacted her my email prior to leaving Sydney. There is no need to pay advance payment for booking as they accept only cash payment. An email confirmation of booking is sufficient. I reached Singapore at 7 am but the check in was at 2pm. I explained to the staff on duty that we travelled for 8hours by plane and we need a room if it is vacant. At 7:30am on same day the room was given to us. All basic required facilities was available at this hotel but the drawbacks I could see in this hotel was there were plenty of ants on the bed and everywhere. The hotel is located on the main road and close to basic amenities. Although I earlier requested for a quiet room, which the hotel staff confirmed with me by email that it would be given to me, but I got a noisy room(room no. 305) located at the roadside. In the toilet there is no sliding door to seperate the shower screen and the toilet and the whole area gets wet. There is no bathroom mat at the door entry of the toilet. There is no mini micorwave to re-heat food where such facility is provided in all other hotels and also in motels. There is no phone inside the room or intercom to contact the reception for any needs. There is a mini fridge in the family room. Overall it was a good stay if you wish to stay for two days. But the price for family room per night is SGD $150 which is bit expensive for those facilities provided by the hotel and not worth for the price we pay. I rate as average for the value for money. If you are not concerned about the price, I would recommend this hotel to any travellers especially if you want to go to Mustafa Centre located at Syed Alwi Road. If you love Indian food, you can go to Anjappar restaurant(both veg and non veg) located just opposite to .Mustafa centre or visit Saravanna bhavan or Anand bhavan. I went with my family and amongst these restuarant we liked the food from Anjappar hotel and the food is very cheap that they give us too much food which we cannot eat. So order for few dishes first to save money. The travelling distance by walk from Mayo Inn to Mustafa is 10 to 15 minutes but we took a taxi and cost SGD $4 to $5 depending on the time of travel. But all these shops would be open only from 11am onwards. Only Anandbhavan hotel is open by 9am and Mustafa open 24 hours. This is a genuine feedback from me and am not writing for any promotional offer. This would assist any travellers going to Singapore.

Thankfully, we had our free map from the airport so we walked in the right direction and found the place about 5 minutes later. It was a pleasant feeling walking into the air-conditioned lobby. I handed over our reservation details as e-mailed by the staff earlier and was told that our reservation was not until the following day. I could not be wrong so I pointed out to her the dates as indicated on the printed receipt they had e-mailed. Fortunately, she saw that I was right. Unfortunately, at 3:30pm, our room was not ready yet. We just headed out for lunch at a nearby hawker center and when we returned around 4:00pm, our room was ready. We booked a family room with an extra bed because there were 4 of us. Our room was clean and spacious enough for all of us. It was also well-lighted. It had windows that were bolted shut so we couldn't open them. We were not too concerned with that. Besides, we imagined it would be noisy outside so that might have helped mute out the noise, which we didn't hear while we were there. The ventilation was good despite that because my personal quick-drying towel dried up overnight. It doesn't do that in rooms that have poor ventilation. The air-conditioner worked well too. The beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean. We only had a pillow each. Said pillows were kinda weird. They looked fluffy but were not really fluffy as my head would sink into them when I lay down. Complimentary coffee, tea and bottled water were replenished daily when the room was cleaned. The small refrigerator worked properly. The LCD TV only had a few channels but it was tolerable because it had CNN and Discovery channel. The bathroom was also clean and spacious. Fresh towels were provided daily. Some basic toiletries were also on hand. The bathroom door was an opaque kind of glass but we weren\u2019t bothered with it because it was really opaque i.e., you could only see that there's a person inside but could not even make out it if was male or female. Besides, it did not face the room and we just agreed among ourselves that should one be in the bathroom, the others just don't linger in the area. The water pressure was ok and the hot water worked perfectly. Everyday one had to have the keycard updated with the front desk. Otherwise, the door to the room cannot be opened with it. We found it scary at first to use the lift but after a few hits and fewer misses, we got the hang of it. As for the staff, they were prompt in answering e-mail inquiries. In person, with a little bit of effort, we could understand each other's English well. They were friendly and helpful. Mayo Inn is in a good location. Right across its front door is a 24-hour convenience store that has friendly staff. We could also choose between either Bugis or the Little India stations of the MRT whenever we had to take the train. They were about a 10-minute moderate-paced walk away. Getting taxis was also not a problem in the area. Lastly, hawker stalls and fast-food chains were near. Because of Sim Lim Square's reputation, although it was near Mayo inn, we did not go there anymore. P.S.

The interesting part thou would be the room set up, you William be greeted with short flight of stairs, wooden shades hiding the bed on the left and the tv facing you directly. Toilet was great, interesting layout. We love the toilet. Toiletries are provided Inc towels. Downside would be their tv channels are limited, abt 8 channels in total. Their pillow case are the same ones in our local hospital, its rough and disposable type. Otherwise the rest is fine.

The area is so handy to just about everything you would need. With an amazing amount of eating places and shopping to be had in a very sort walk from the motel. It is right on the edge of Little India and a sort walk to Bugis village and the MRT. Which made it so easy to get to any other part of Singapore we wanted to visit. It is a little noisy around that area but that is to be expected when you are staying in the middle of a big city.

However, there were too many downsides with this hotel which would make me choose elsewhere next time. Initially when I tried to book the hotel (calling from overseas), I received the following blunt response on the phone \"Too busy - call back\" - so it was hardly a good start. When we arrived, it looked clean but basic in the foyer. We were in a standard room (SGD 110 per night) and we had booked 2 rooms. Both were on Level 2 and on the Jalan Besar side (the main road it's situated on) - and this was very very noisy! The rooms were tiny - too tiny. There rooms only had the basics - 2 towels and 1 bathmat - all threadbare - in fact the bath mat had 2 big holes in it - and there were no facewashers and no handtowels. The bathroom tried to be groovy as it was a green glass room within the bedroom- but functionally it didn't work - it certainly provided no privacy if you were using the loo, and if in the shower, water went everywhere as it was just too small. There was barely enough room to open 1 suitcase, let alone both of our suitcases. The room is just physically too small to hold 2 people - and barely big enough for 1 person. The wireless didn't work whilst we were there but there was a cable to connect to the internet which did work, thank goodness. The hotel is quite new but I'd hate to go there in a few months time as one can see that the maintenance is very bad - our toilet roll holder was falling off the wall, there were cigarette burns in the carpet and obviously something had been changed in the bathroom area as there was a big unpainted section and remnants of a fixture that had been removed. There was no hairdryer (lucky I had brought one with me). So all in all - I would not stay here again.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSmall upgraded hotel with lift\u201d", "Author": "Vegetarian4ever", "ReviewID": "UR116148050", "Content": "UP TO 20 MINUTES WALKING WITH LUGGAGE TO NEAREST METRO STATION (BUGIS) depending on your walking speed.

The MRT stations Bugis and Little India can easily be reachend within a few minutes, though if you don't mind walking you can also reach orachard road, the Naional Museum and the waterfront within a fair distance... As the hotel is near a mosque you might wake up at 5AM, when the muezzin calls. We didn't mind this, though... Hotel itself: Cleanliness is very good, the rooms are cleaned and the bedlinen and towels changed every day, same applieas to the complimentary tea, (instant) coffee and water within the rooms. In the bathrooms you'll find shampoo and shower gel as well. Though european we decided to go for a japanese style room - these are really nice! There's alo a fridge and a TV on the room, though we didn't need them. WiFi is available but sometimes a bit slow... The staff is professionally friendly - when we checked in the secondtime we were in Singapore, we arrived at 6.00 AM in the morning, and although check-in time is only at 12.00PM, the let us check into our room without any extra charge. A large thumbs-up for that and many thanks again! Rates are 110S$, but if you pay by paypal, you'll receive a discount of 10S$ per night.

We arrived after an 11 hours flight and we weren't able to get any sleep in the first night. We asked to change the room but the hotel was full so we had to endure honking and shouting and steel being dragged around each night and we bought ear plugs which allowed us to have a bit of sleep.
