All the room doors on the hall side have an enlarged scene from a classic movie or a classic actor. The rooms are really spacious with tile flooring, making the place really look and feel clean. The bedding was a nice and comfortable queen bed. Although i did book a twin room for my sister and i, but we didn't bother changing rooms after we informed reception. Don't except any views or anything but this is to be expected for the affordable pricing of the hotel and the location of the hotel. The buffet breakfast was very nice with a wide selection of food including hot and cold food. The hotel is located in the Anagnina region which is about a 20 minute metro ride from Termini station. The downside is though that the metro is only running until 9pm and the public buses that go to the hotel (2min bus ride) don't run after 9pm or there abouts. The hotel does have it's own shuttle bus service, however the times are quite limited. I mention that the bus ride is a short 2 minutes from Anagnina metro station, sad thing is that you cannot walk from the metro as there is a highway in between and there is absolutely no way to get to the other side (i tried a couple of times). So if you arrive to Rome late at night there is a bus service from Termini that will take you to Anagnina and then you will need to take a taxi from there which will put you out of pocket by about 10euros. Hotel is also in close proximity to Ciampino airport and has a shuttle service there too. Staff at the hotel were nice and more often than not had a smile on their face.

They never bothered to reply. On the day we were due to check in I rang them to tell them what time we would arrive in Rome. Then I am told that there is a problem and they don\u2019t have rooms for us! It was very obvious they had over-booked and decided to book us out to another hotel in the same chain. This was located much further from the airport and I had chosen this hotel as it would be close to the airport and cheap to take a taxi as we arrived in the middle of the night. Now we ended up paying 3 times more for the taxi! Arriving at the other hotel no-one at reception even seemed to take notice. When we finally get to check-in we have to wait for about 20 minutes and when I ask them what the problem is they tell us they are fully booked! All this time they were very arrogant towards us, never apologized for the inconvenience they caused, nothing! For the following to nights we had to go back to the hotel we booked originally, and first they wanted us to go there by the metro. I said we won\u2019t accept that as we have luggage and this wasn\u2019t our fault but theirs, so they arranged a shuttle for us. I was very upset as we only had 2 days to spend in Rome and now ended up wasting half a day to move hotels! We never received any sort of compensation or any apologies from anyone. I also had problems with the room as there was something wrong with the AC that made an awful lot of noise (even when turned off) so it was impossible to sleep in the room. When I complained about this I wasn\u2019t taken seriously and the receptionist suggested I open the window a bit (!) like that would solve the problem. Eventually maintenance came and sorted it for me. The hotel looks nice on the photos as they have refurbished the reception and public areas but the rooms are a bit old and especially the bathrooms. Not 4 star standards. Breakfast was also very poor if you are used to continental or hot. I am in the hotel business myself and if this hotel is nothing close to a 4 star.

We were so impressed that I have reviewed it separately. Walking back to the hotel, very well-fed and watered and looking forward to a good night's sleep, imagine our horror when we found some kind of boy racer rally in the car park. They were literally racing around the hotel and we had to run across the \"track\" to get to the lobby. There were hotdog stalls etc so it's clearly a regular, organised event.

We took a taxi from Ciampino airport which is only 10 mins away, the driver said it would be 30 euros but we haggled him down to 20 euros before getting in! The hotel is spotless, large rooms, nice bathrooms, fridge and free safe in the rooms. The buffet breakfast was great, an extensive choice of hot and cold food. The shopping mall adjacent is ok. Make sure you eat in Rome before returning to the hotel as there is no restaurant at the hotel and only a small cafe bar in the mall. Ikea has a good cafe and is open until 10pm. We found Anagnina metro station very run down and not the type of place to be after dark. We always made sure we were back at the hotel by around 9pm. The metro into the centre of Rome only costs 1 Euro. There are frequent buses from the metro to the hotel, which is only 1 stop away but not very accessible by foot. Ask at reception to book the courtesy bus back to Ciampino airport (they do not advertise this). If you are looking for a comfortable and clean hotel at a good price and do not mind being in a commercial area and travelling 30 mins by metro into Rome then I can highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "June 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucestershire", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "slinkygoers", "ReviewID": "UR4895497", "Content": "We stayed in the Anagnina hotel for 3 nights.

The hotel is OK. Very clean rooms of larger than average size. Rate was OK as well. Easily reachable from Ciampino Airport by bus for 1 Euro. There is a supermarket in the mall right behind the hotel and an IKEA right behind that (if you fancy hot dogs). Breakfast was much more choice than most Rome hotels. Full buffet breakfast that enables you to skip lunch :-). The hotel is rather far away from the city center on the ring road, however the center is easily - and cheaply - reached on Metro A. Be aware that the metro stops to run early currently (Around 9 o'clock) until January 10 2006. On the downside, the beds had a tendency to slide across the laminate floor, which could get on your nerves and since it is near to major roads it is not particularly quiet. But if you can live with that it is not a bad choice.", "Date": "December 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cBooked by a free web Hotel Reservation system\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4243319", "Content": "We also booked Hotel Anagnina by an Hotel Reservation system RoomsAccomodation , we found there better rate than other web site as venere or nycerome.
