We stayed at 3 different hotels and I was most interested in this one, after reading this wonderful reviews. After our 2nd hotel on first st. in Azusa (Rodeway Inn) where I felt scared for our lives (somehow the handful of reviews were positive) it was SUCH A RELIEF to come to Dolphin Inn for 2 nights and have that \"peace of mind for my soul\" in feeling safe, taken care of, and the layout is like a little community. The rooms were cute and clean and quiet. Breakfast was just right for us and appreciated. We arrived from the UCSD tour in pouring down rain and one of the Housekeepers who was outside at that moment offered us HER umbrella. We didn't need it, but that gesture warmed my heart. Of course we appreciated the affordable price too, fit just right into our budget.

You are around 5-10 minutes from downtown San Diego and all the attractions. The breakfast was okay- we had some muffins,coffee,yogurt, and orange juice but it was okay. Most importantly, the price was great and it is very clean. The bad: The rooms are not very soundproof. I stayed on the 1st floor and was able to hear a lot of the footsteps from the room above me so that was a bit annoying. Also, if someone was outside your room talking you could hear them without much of a problem.

At first, my husband, of course, had had some doubts about how a motel could be good with this kind of price in an expensive city. In the end of the trip, he said we should come back here again. And the experience also motivates me to search for similar motels in cities we would like to visit in the future. Yes, the room is very small, but we visit SD not to stay in a room nor to watch TV. We went out to have fun and came back to the place to shower, to prepare for the next day and to sleep. The breakfast was good. My son (and my husband) loved the chocolate muffins. The microwave was kinda slow, but it probably only bothered those, i.e., me, who wanted a 'quick' cup of 'really hot' tea. Then another tea drinker showed me the trick to use it, so the microwave did not bother me again. The outdoor atmosphere really brings travelers together. We saw many foreign travelers there and learned about their experiences in the fresh air of a sea port. For us, that's what a nice travel is all about. The motel provides everything one could possibly need in a trip, and more. You just need to ask. If you are used to everything ready in the room for you and cannot change, then this is not for you. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The owners were on site every morning, including the senior owner. Our room in the back building was very quiet. We did not have any troubles on anything in the room. The location is super. 4 years ago when we visited SD the first time, we stayed in a boutique hotel downtown. Most of our activities were centered in downtown, old town, little Italy and Balboa where could be reached via buses and trolleys. We loved it. This time, we visited places both outside and inside of the beltway so we rent a car the whole time. We noticed that a fellow resident couple actually biked. (borrowed from the motel?)

Yes, the rooms are small, with a main room about 12 feet by 12 feet, a small bathroom with shower and a smaller closet. The property is a wood (rather than tip-up concrete) frame builiding, built in 1957. Over the years there have been minor changes to various walls (new a/c, moved towel racks, et al) so the walls are not perfectly smooth. A power cable to the a/c and the cable to the 32 inch flat screen t.v. were both surface mounted on the walls. The windows are double pane but you can hear a loud motorcycle on occasion. And because the walls are wood/drywall you might hear the next door heat pump a/c turn on. What you WILL get is a comfortable quality mattress, fluffy white towels, all white bedding--the owner was justly proud of using a white bedspread to show how clean it was instead of the typical mottled dark colors in use elsewhere. The owners, who were there every day, and all the office staff were unfailingly polite, helpful, and full of suggestions for places to go and things to see. As a lark I walked over to the Vagabond motel which is a block away and also well reviewed. The price I was quoted was $26 dollars per day more than The Dolphin. For the $26 we would have had a little plastic bottle of shampoo every day, a slightly larger selection of breakfast rolls and 100 more square feet of space. You'll have to decide if that is important to you. At the time we were there most of the other guests were a mix of ages, but all uniformly quiet and pleasant.

The property consists of two buildings, a main building containing the small check-in office, with rooms whose doors face the harbor, next to the pool and outdoor area, and a second building, which I was shuttled off to.

My tiny room, with its windows facing the stairs and directly over the cars, felt like one of those art projects where a performer lives inside a glass cage on a street. I'm not sure I believe in \"feng shui\" but I felt a sick anxiety the entire time I was in the room. The door seemed like it was made of cardboard and blocked sound about as well as a sheet, adding to the sense of exposure. And the bed was as hard as a rock.

They don\u2019t have a lobby nor an official bellman or concierge. But we were warmly welcomed by Jeb who checked us in for our four night stay. We received the keys to the room. I had requested a quiet room which, even though they were completely booked, they saved for me. We opened up the door and wasn\u2019t sure what to think. The room is small and as advertised, completely white except for the carpet. It felt sterile and unwelcoming. We moved in and started to check things out. The TV was great and had a wide range of channel selections. The chair was a simple fold up card table type chair. There was a luggage rack and white end tables on each side of the bed and a closet that had no door. There was also a larger than dorm size refrigerator. The bathroom was just as simple \u2026 sink, toilet and a stand up shower, no tub. The amenities were limited to soap and toilet paper. The room has a wall unit for heating or cooling that was very efficient. There were windows that you could open to let fresh air in or check out the weather. So, luxury it is not. But, we didn\u2019t need luxury. The room was clean and we had only planned to spend time there to sleep. What you don\u2019t always get in a luxury hotel that we definitely had at the Dolphin was sincerity and service that you can\u2019t really put a price on. I need extra pillows to sleep and Jeb went hunting for just the right pillows for me. And unfortunately for us, it rained during our stay in San Diego. The owner went to his car to offer my husband his umbrella to use while we were there. Jeb gave us great dinner recommendations. The continental breakfast they offer was good and just what we needed to start our day. And the location of the hotel couldn\u2019t be better. We found easy access to everything we wanted to see. So, did we get what we paid for? Probably, in terms of the room itself. Although in the room\u2019s defense, it was home for us and very comfortable even without the frills.

I discovered it, back whenever, because I was staying at a chain motel next door. In walking around Point Loma, I noticed the Dolphin's marquee with its beckoning to \"see a room\" and \"why pay more\". So, I did. And thank God I did. I've been a regular ever since that day. With the Dolphin Motel you get a nice, little family-owned motel with really comfortable and clean rooms, breakfast served every morning, a welcoming and cordial staff, and all of this is at a price, which the surrounding motels can't touch. On my latest visit, I was warmly greeted by Tom, as I exited my Taxi from the airport, and he quickly checked me in. Steve has been at the reception desk for years and he greets guests as they pass the office on their way to whereever. And, of course, there is Alan and his father, who are around the premises all day long looking after the property and guests' needs. Another interesting thing about the Dolphin Motel, is that many guests come from all parts of the world, and most of them learned about the Dolphin from www.tripadvisor.com . This gives the atmosphere at breakfast, especially, a true international feeling with different accents and languages being spoken. As I said in the title to this posting, if you stay at the Dolphin Motel while in San Diego, you will have two reasons to return to S.D. First, you will want to again experience the hospitality of the Dolphin Motel, and second, well, they don't call San Diego \"America's Finest City\" for nothing!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cIt was great to be back!\u201d", "Author": "audreymahoney", "ReviewID": "UR120303472", "Content": "I couldn't find where to write the new review so I ended up reading all the previous ones to get here!

Personal business took me from Texas to San Diego and before I knew it I was booking a flight out to CA with a one-day notice. A friend suggested I stay at the Dolphin Motel since I would only be in town for one night and most of that time I would be out taking care of business. I called up the motel less than 24 hours before arrival and Thomas was very helpful with my booking. My flight arrived at 7am into LAX and after getting a rental and driving down I anticipated arriving to SD around 11. I has asked Thomas if I could check in two hours early and we compromised and I checked in at 12pm. The motel itself is very clean and efficient. Although an older building, the management obviously works hard to maintain the building. There is plenty of parking and lots of shops and restaurants around. I was given a room in the building attached to the front desk; it contained a couple of dressers, a good sized fridge, comfy queen-sized bed and a pretty nice tv (it's much nicer than the one I have at home). The bathroom is in step with the age of the building but clean and with plenty of towels. Frankly the walls were a little thin and I felt at times that I might have been making too much noise, but I never got a complaint from the management. The following day I had a very important appointment downtown and it started running long. I rang up the front desk and explained my situation. The motel was very gracious and allowed me a late check out without any fuss. This may well be an exception and not the rule but I was so grateful when they said I had more time. I agree with others that say this is not a luxury hotel, but they don't bill themselves as such. It is a good, honest, clean, serviceable motel and I highly recommend it because service of this caliber is becoming very hard to find.

Budgets were not my main motivator when booking this motel, despite its very very reasonable rates, it was the trip advisor ratings that clinched the deal. My criteria for a hotel/motel is clean safe and friendly, im there to see the city NOT to sit in a room or by a pool (I can do that at my local leisure centre). The Dolphin had reviews by the page full stating my criteria would be hit, they utterly smashed it! From our first steps into the reception both my wife and myself knew this was going to be a great stay. To my discredit I forget the staff members names but suffice to say they will be the same ones that get talked about so positively in all the other reviews. These unsung staff members were fantastic, without being over the top, what I\u2019d call fake US hospitality. Nothing was a problem, not that we had any issues for them to solve. Vouchers for local attractions, deals at the local Mexican (DO NOT MISS IT) and all the maps you\u2019ll ever need were supplied without hesitation. The rooms, well\u2026.they are exactly as the web site says. Click on their home page, go to room pictures and only book if they meet your requirements. Anyone on here moaning about \u201csmall\u201d rooms in my opinion didn\u2019t do their homework and therefore their comments are null and void. They are spotlessly clean, comfortable and perfect for our needs, the needs being to SLEEP. Concerns about TV volume controls from other reviews seem odd to say the least, quite why people need to set up a home cinema experience while on holiday baffles me. We went to bed, watched the news at normal volumes, woke up and watched the news before breakfast what else could you need?? Perfect. The breakfast was as you would expect, please do EXPECT basic. Basic does not mean bad, it doesn\u2019t mean you start the day hungry but it does mean you\u2019re not getting the Vegas buffet style \u201cno need to eat for 3 days\u201d event. A muffin, a banana and an amazing cup of coffee (use the vanilla cream! \u2013 it always seemed to be hidden in the fridge) was the order of each day. If you need more there are options just over the road \u2013 just remember the price you paid for your room! My only comment that could be construed as slightly negative is the motels location from what us Brits would call the city centre. We didn\u2019t book a car and potentially that\u2019s our fault but we did assume that being the United States of America your public transport would \u201ckick our [--]\u201d it did not. The bus stop is a 20 second walk \u2013 perfect! The wait for a bus, hmmm not so great. In retro spec I would 100% recommend a car hire OR a fat wallet for a taxi, as the wait was just unbearable on occasions. The issue is exaggerated 100 fold come the evening. We liked to go out on the evenings to the Gaslamp area (check it out!!) but getting back was a nightmare whilst trying to use public transport. The trolly system is ok (ish) but come the end of the line your dumped in what seems like the middle of nowhere. All of this is NOTHING to do with the Motel, but I wouldn\u2019t want people to go to this great establishment and get disillusioned by the transport woes.

The room was very bright at night, I could have probably read with the lights off. I had to prop stuff up against the window to help shut out the light. he bottom floor room also had a lot of noise form the room above and the office next door. Breakfast is a tray of costco muffins, some bananas, coffee and OJ. The staff was very nice.

Needless to stay we were not going to any of these places and were grateful for his 'mud map'. They offer you a gps, mobile phone, suitcase scales and will even print out your boarding passes if you need.

Yes the room was small and we did have to stack our suitcases, but it is more the experience than the luxurious motel that you get here. You cannot help but find yourself being caught up by the dedication of these guys.

However, after you to look around, you will realize that you wont find any that are cleaner and more hospitable, and yet also cheaper than this place. We are from the midwest and are used to Indiana's cheap motel prices (39.99-49.99). While visiting San Diego, we stayed in a couple hotels/motels before coming to the Dolphin. The first night we stayed at a Ramada ($150 per night), and while on a day trip to San Clemente we first checked out a local mom and pop inn and inquired about the rate. They wanted $80 per night but did not include cable or internet, so we had to stay at a Holiday Inn for ($170 per night). Our 3rd night back in San Diego, we agreed we couldn't afford to keep shelling out the high prices for these Southern California hotels. I happened to run across the Dolphin's website while doing a search for cheap San Diego motels. The website had us a little cautious and apprehensive but agreed we would give it a try. MY DOLPHIN REVIEW To secure the room, they do require you to use your credit card over the phone and pay for the first evening, but allow you to make a decision after the first night if you want to continue staying each additional night. We were given a second floor room in the main building, in the corner of the balcony. (Side Note: If you have disabilities like the second member of our party, this motel does not have elevators, so you will have to request downstairs room if available.). I asked how to access the pool from the pictures, and was disappointed to find out that the pool actually belongs to the neighboring hotel and therefore the Dolphin does not have a pool. WIth the negatives out of the way now, I am free to tell you about all the positives about the Dolphin that have left us with certainty of coming back. Upon check in, the staff asks if you brought a laptop with you. If you have, they will supply you with a wi-fi code to access their internet. If you have left your laptop at home, they have complimentary laptop for you to use at no additional charge. There is a privacy fence that blocks the downstairs rooms' views, but having the room we did on the second floor, we couldn't have asked for a better room with a view. From our balcony, we had a perfect view of the harbor and and yachts at Sport Fishing Landing across the street. As for the service you get at the Dolphin, you cannot ask for anything better. The staff here really care about their guests. From the night clerk we checked in with, to the actual owners that work the desk and take care of continental breakfast duties, service is top priority here. One owner asked if he could carry our bags to our room for us. This kind of service is something you don't get at other chains. The rooms are a bit small. We had one queen bed and one twin bed in the room, which only left a walk way around each bed. While the rooms may be small, you wont find a cleaner room elsewhere. Everything in these rooms is white, and the staff ensure that it stays that way. The showers at the Dolphin had great water pressure and never ran out of hot water, which was a plus compared to the other hotels we stayed at. Each morning there are large sized muffins and juice available downstairs near the lobby, free of charge. All in all, the Dolphin is a great value with great service and clean rooms. If you are like us, we don't spend much time in the rooms while on vacation, so how clean it is and how we are treated is what means more than anything, and this place delivers on that. AREA ATTRACTIONS/RESTAURANTS The Dolphin is in a great location. With everything nearby, we returned our rental car after the first night here. Within walking distance (2 blocks) there is a great restaurant (Miguel's) which the staff can give you coupon for free appetizer, a great white cheese sauce that is superb. If you prefer a hot breakfast over the free continental served, just around the corner is a donut shop that also serves plate size croissants for same price you would pay at Burger King. There are plenty of dining options in the area. Although we did not go to any of the bars/clubs, there are a few within a couple blocks if that is your scene. GETTING AROUND Just behind the motel, you can hop on the MTS bus line that will take you all the way to Old Town (Main transport area), which you can then access the different trolleys or other bus lines to take you to other areas of San Diego. Before you get to Old Town though, there are many stops at area shopping centers along Rosecrans Street. You will come to find, just as we did, that a car was not needed after you get to the Dolphin, as its location is near everything you need. Concluding..The Dolphin actually made our stay in San Diego the best part of our trip. We were able to save money on the room to use for other activities in SD, but not sacrifice room quality. You won't find a more caring staff anywhere else. What you really need in a room is someplace quiet that you can get a good night sleep, with great service and clean rooms. The Dolphin more than delivers on that!

I was all set to only stay at the Dolphin one night with my brother and jump to the Half Moon or Holiday Inn. I was nervous because the reviews seemed too good to be true and the last thing I wanted was a creepy motel. But based on my fellow TripAdvisor reviewers I made a reservation for five nights at the Dolphin. We arrived late and our room was ready for us. Yes it was small but VERY clean. The bedding was all white, the AC worked well (take off the energy conserved button and the AC won't turn on and off all night) bathroom was small, clean and great water pressure and shower heads!! We were pretty impressed that this only costed us 70.00 a night. In the morning we walked out to the charming patio area where my brother poured a big cup of coffee, grabbed a banana and a yogurt and starting working from his computer using the free WiFi. I grabbed one of the two papers supplied in the breakfast area, took a big sigh of relief that the Dolphin was both relaxing, quiet and cheap. Steve from the front office came out every morning and poured me a cup of iced tea ....yes, he walked out and served me.....we met Holly, the owner, who greeted us by name every morning and asked if we needed directions or suggestions for where to eat or where to visit. We started in room 25 (main level)which had a twin for me and a full for my brother and Holly moved us after a few days to room 28 (second level) which has it's own patio and a full and a queen bed and a large window, (which 25 did not have) plus it's a corner room so I assume less noise though we really never heard any noise as we ran the AC all night. The bathrooms had soap in them but no shampoo though there are many places, including the front office, where shampoo can be bought. We asked Lin, who has cleaned rooms here at the Dolphin for over 30 years if she could give us a few towels to take to the beach. Lin delivered them ASAP and then asked everyday if we needed more. Rooms had refrigerators and a flat screen TV. The management here at the Dolphin is around 24 hours a day, parking is free and a quiet atphosphere is stressed. In the five night we were there we were NEVER bothered by noise. We slept great every night. My brother and I hated to leave as we did feel like family at the end.

There were many people to assist us when we arrived, and they were all very friendly and made sure to take steps to make us happy; however, I honestly feel that the room itself could be improved a bit. Probably one reason that they can charge so little is that they have not made as many efforts as they could to renovate the rooms. The shower was pretty nice, but the bathroom was very small- I guess I don't see how they could do much to change that. I was able to sleep pretty well on the bed, but the mattress pad or something made it feel kind of \"papery,\" if that is a word. The room was not impeccably clean as some of the reviews have said- I found random hairs scattered around the room in the corners, on the ledges, etc. I have been to similarly priced motels where the room was cleaner upon arrival. I feel that this is something that can be controlled while still charging a nice affordable price, and I would also recommend some renovations in the near future- especially the carpeting. The carpeting was very worn, & didn't quite go all the way to the wall (kind of curled up on the edges). It is kind of a pleasant little hotel/nice location, but I have to agree with the review that someone previously wrote- \"You get what you pay for.\" \"Average\" is not \"bad\"- it is \"average,\" and that is how I am rating this hotel.

They provide a nice little breakfast for free in the morning which include muffins, yoghurt, orange juice and a few other things. The rooms are very clean, have a good sized LCD TV, free wireless internet and the showers are hot and have great pressure. The motel is in quite a convenient location as it is a short bus or taxi ride from the city centre or other San Diego attractions and it is also within walking distance of smaller shops and food (including Pizza Nova which is amazing). Only a couple of negatives which should not play much in the decision to stay here: the rooms are quite small and at times can seem a little cramped if you have a lot of luggage. Beds are double beds, which is a little too small if you are tall (such as myself) and are sharing the bed with someone else.

If you are looking for a family run, friendly staff, great location, and GREAT owners, this place is for you. Where can you stay and actually get to talk to the owners on a daily basis? We stayed here for 6 nights to visit the San Diego Zoo, Legoland, Disneyland, local beaches, and local attractions. We actually didn't know who ran the chain until the 2nd morning of our stay because all the staff members are so helpful and friendly. They are always asking if everything was ok and if we needed to find somewhere to go for shopping, dining, or attractions to visit. Summary of how friendly the staff and owners were: 1) We left our shampoo at home and they allowed us to have some for free without charging us. 2) We also left our hair dryer at home and they supplied one for us. 3) No matter where we wanted to go, the staff and owners were always able to answer our questions or take the time to show us on a map or draw on a map. 4) The father and son (owners) always made us feel at home like it was a bed and breakfast at the beach!!! They were particular in entertaining our 4 year old son. 5) Breakfast is FREE - Daily bananas, muffins, and yogurt with coffee or orange juice. 6) Last and best, our flight back to North Carolina was not scheduled to depart until 10:50 PST, which is 1:50 AM EST. So we asked the owner (father) if we could check out later than 12 pm since our son naps still. They allowed us to check out at 3 pm vs. 12 pm so our son could get a nap FREE OF CHARGE!!!!!!. The only reason why I gave 1 less than the 5 stars for service was the house cleaning does just a little later than normal. And the only reason for the 1 less than the full 5 stars for sleep quality, was due to the one of the beds being harder than our home bed. But again, this is personal preference. We were not surprised by the room size as the pictures clearly show the size but it was just enough for the three of us. The rooms are always clean and kept up very well.

After staying in San Diego multiple times, I finally stumbled upon the Dolphin while planning a semi-romantic extended weekend to the city, with the main purpose of spending time at Point Loma for the gray whale migration. That was my first stay, and I've just returned from my second, and will certainly be back. Budget motels are often far from \"romantic,\" but the Dolphin sure comes close. The motel is on the small side with two buildings. On both occasions, I've been given a room in the main building, and this is definitely the more desirable of the two. This building faces the bay, where there is a marina and several restaurants. There are chairs on the second floor in front of the rooms so you can sit and look out at the bay. It's quite relaxing. The rooms are excessively clean. I don't know that I've seen whiter sheets at a hotel under $100 before. The towels, which are typically scratchy and thin at budget motels, are soft and absorbent. The rooms feature one bed and are relatively small. There is a small closet area, a refrigerator (a microwave is available in the patio area), full cable TV and a stand-up shower. There is also an ethernet port for DSL access, which I found to be very reliable. There is wifi available (per a code on the back of your keys) as well. The motel is relatively quiet. There is a strict no-noise policy posted (in addition to a \"no fish in rooms\" policy, which I think is funny) so, if you're looking for a party motel, this is definitely not it. There is a four-lane street outside, but the traffic dies down quite a bit at night, and the only noise comes from a bar inside the Ramada across the street, although that hotel's guests are likely much more affected than at the Dolphin. If you're a light sleeper like I am, you can turn on the a/c unit to low fan and be absolutely fine. The management are some of the nicest I've encountered at a hotel anywhere in the country. At breakfast, which consists of coffee, orange juice and muffins, all of which is of fairly good quality, they're always out saying hello to the guests on the patio. They're always polite and accommodating during check-in and check-out, and are very willing to help with directions and restaurant recommendations. As for the neighborhood, there are several restaurants within walking distance in the Point Loma neighborhood. It's a pretty safe area. There recently opened a shopping center further down Harbor Blvd, toward the airport, that features an Oggi's location (local pizza/brewpub) and a sushi place, as well as other dining options. Downtown San Diego is a ten minute drive down Harbor Blvd, and traffic along it is rarely bad. Ocean Beach (the closest beach) is about ten minutes away, as is Cabrillo National Monument (although check the opening times before you head over there). There are also a couple of bus stops close to the motel. The marina across the street makes for a nice place to walk at night. There is free parking available in the lot and, if that fills up, on the small street in front of the hotel. My partner and I found the place very suitable for our needs on our first visit, so we returned recently and found the same great place, with the same great rate.

This time we wanted to try a location in Point Loma for a number of good reasons. After considering several options (most of the Pt. Loma properties are clustered close together) we opted to try the Dolphin based mainly on price and TripAdvisor reviews. We drove in after dark on I-8 and turned onto Nimitz Ave. at the end of the freeway which brought us right to the Dolphin. Our reservation was accepted and we checked in without problem. Our room was on the second floor which was fine. On first impression we were a bit surprised at the compactness of the room which reminded me of some I had stayed in throughout the UK. Apart from that the room was clean to an acceptable standard and everything that was in it worked accordingly. The place has a kind of '70's feel to it which we have experienced at other SoCal accomodations! We found that the Dolphin was a combination of several pluses and a couple of minuses. The pluses included being situated in Pt. Loma which is a self contained community with most amenities within easy walking distance of the Dolphin. There is a great selection of restaurants, C stores, laundromat, gas stations etc. nearby and the streets are safe to walk after dark. In many ways it resembles most large towns that you would find on the Great Plains with that same \"Howdy neighbour\" friendliness. Pt. Loma is also strategically located in SD to provide quick access to all of the local attractions. We found that having wi-fi was a great convenience as we packed the laptop along. Morning coffee,OJ, and muffins are served in the outdoor courtyard which is very nice on warm sunny mornings. As many other commenters have mentioned the staff and management are very nice folks. The minuses were few and rather petty. The hotel doesn't have a pool (one is located beside the office but belongs to the neighbouring Comfort Inn.) The hotel advertises itself as being on a quiet street (Garrison) which is technically correct, however it is sandwiched between two very busy streets (Rosecrans and Scott). My wife likes to sleep with the windows open and the early morning traffic was very noticeable. The street traffic can be overcome by closing the windows and turning on the circulating fan. Another irritant was the vibrating roar of fighter jets taking off from North Island late in the evening. The snug rooms are fine for sleeping but don't expect to entertain guests.

This attracted me to it instantly - it was a no BS approach, and they didn't let themselves down. Having never been to San Diego before, I was unsure of the location, but once we were settled, we found it very easy to get anywhere we needed to go; and the added assistance of the front desk staff and particularly the owner who provided basic but effective hand drawn maps and easy to follow directions. However, I would suggest that if you wish to explore wider San Diego, then a car is a necessity. The rooms are quite small, but well appointed for the price, and the beds are extremely comfortable with crisp white linen. The bathrooms are tight, but the shower has the best water pressure of any hotel I have ever stayed at. The clientele of the hotel appear to be mainly people using the harbour for fishing or diving trips, and given they are up quite early in the morning, do not expect a sleep in, as the central courtyard area can get quite noisy. The complimentary continental breakfast provided consists of muffins & coffee, and is a welcome start to the day, however, those after a substantial breakfast will need to jump in the car and find a cafe or diner. Car parking is free as well, and there are plenty of spaces available. They are very clear about no-smoking in the rooms ($100 fine), yet they are happy for guests to smoke in the courtyard area, except for cigars, which we were told off for smoking. Go figure. Overall, this small but well maintained motel is a great place to stay if you are not too fussed about not having the little luxuries - ie, they only provide soap and no shampoo or conditioner, although they do offer these items for a nominal fee at the front desk.

The best local seafood restaurant \u201cPoint Loma Seafood\u201d was just across the street. It was hard to find a free parking near the restaurant during weekend so it\u2019s better to just walk there from the motel. Restaurant opens till 6-30 pm and food there is very good (and cheap).

They are in a relatively good location, so maybe that is why the prices are a little higher. I paid $95 for a tiny room with no windows the first night and $75 in a room with a window the next night. Somewhat inconvenient and odd is that you have to mail them a cheque for the first nights stay. All the rooms are very small but very clean. The beds are comfortable. The bathrooms have showers but no bath tub. The walls are thin, so if you're a light sleeper you might want to wear ear plugs. Good sized parking lot.

First of all, it is definitely not the best motel in San Diego. I have no idea how it got such a high rating here on trip advisor...price I suppose. Oh well - with that said, on to the review: Firstly, the positive. It *is* cheap, and it is very close to the airport (about 5 minutes away) and most of the interesting downtown attractions. The rooms are pretty clean. The management is very friendly and accomodating. I had a couple problems with noise and they were very accomodating in switching me rooms and also telling some noisy people to quiet down after hours - and since there's 24 hour desk service, there's always someone to complain to about noise issues. Which brings us to the negative: the noise. If you're a noise sensitive person, you may have some problems. The walls are paper thin, as are the ceilings. During the week, things were not so bad, but not so much on the weekends or when the place is full. If you *are* noise-sensitive and you insist on staying here, I would at the very least recommend that you request a 2nd floor room, preferably at one of the ends of the motel. The other negative is that the rooms are indeed very small as some people have already mentioned. This may not be a big deal if you're not going to be in your room much anyway, but it really is probably the smallest motel/hotel room I've ever been in. In conclusion, a decent motel if you are not sensitive to noises.
