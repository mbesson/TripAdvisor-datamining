Yes the tv cabinet and the coffee table were a little 'dated' but that sort of thing doesn't bother us at all. The breakfast was delicious and abundant.

There is computers with free internet for people to use.. Did i mention the view in the club lounge??? Its AMAZING!!! you get a beautiful view over darling harbour.

The rooms aren't massive but we really didn't stay in our hotel much... Club rooms are on the higher floors so there are no noise from the streets..

Breakfast - with club access you can either eat in the club lounge or you can go downstairs and enjoy a buffet breakfast - we did this one morning and it was amazing.. wide selection of foods... egg station which i love! heaps of juices... pastries and fruits...

Initially we couldn't find it - hence my title, even the Navman couldn't find it, I almost parked in town and got a taxi. However, the search was worth it. I had booked one night as a \"secret hotel\" so wasn't expecting much, but we were very pleasantly surprised. Our room was on the 10th floor with a lovely view of Darling Harbour. The room was very pleasant and a reasonable size. Room and bathroom were very clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Even though a major flyover runs next to the hotel, we could not hear any traffic, all in all it was a very quiet hotel. We didn't use the restaurant as we were meeting family in town for dinner, we did, however, have a drink in the bar before we left. Service in the bar was outstanding. Normally it would be a walk down to Circular Quay and the Opera House, on this night the rain was heavy so we got a taxi - $17 but it was Friday peak hour. Check-in and check out were very easy and the staff were extremely friendly and polite. If you want to park onsite it is by valet parking only at a cost of $40 per night but having taken so long to find it we did not want to venture back out into the public carpark - we would have had to get back out into major traffic in the one way system. Although we thought $40 was expensive, it was worth it for convenience. Concierge again couldn't have been more helpful. I go to Sydney regularly and usually stay at more expensive hotels - we paid $140 for the Parkroyal, however, I would not hesitate to stay there again or to recommend it to family and friends.

The only gripe i have is they charge 1.5 percent card processing fee if your paying your bill by credit card which is NOT the standard procedures used by other hotels or shops for that matter when your using your credit card to make payment. Over all a good hotel, just a shame they feel the need to pass on the card processing fees to their clients.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tauranga, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "bigGNewZealand", "ReviewID": "UR121833547", "Content": "Stayed in a lower level twin room.

First the good points. Very close to Darling Harbour, where I needed to be, just a short walk from the exhibitions centre. The booking was made direct with the hotel, through a live reservation person, not through the web site as this was playing up. I was asked for my credit card details and this was given and accepted without question or comment. Prompt check in and convinced by the receptionist to join the Parkroyal frequent user programme. For this I would get a room upgrade this visit, plus 2 free bottles of water, normal value $5.00 each. Not a bad deal so I joined. I was asked for my credit card as room guarantee and this was accepted also without question or comment. Nice high room, overlook Darling Harbour, with great views, little or no road noise, clean and comfortable bed. Prompt check out, but on tendering my credit card again for final payment was blythly informed a surcharge would be added. The insidious surcharging of credit cards is just wrong. Having been in the card and hospitailty industry for many years I know hotels have always included card costs in their overheads and this surchraging is just a quick way to make more money. This hotel had two chances to inform me of their card surcharging policy, on reservation and on check in, they chose not to do so, I guess so as not to lose a booking. (they would have lost me) I have now come acrooss this card surcharging twice in recent months in Australia, and no where else in my frequent travlels. The cost is small, for now, but like all surcharges, they grow, (Think flight fuel surcharges) The hotel was fine for the stay and if you don't mind being ripped off by extra charges for using a credit card, this hotel will serve your purposes well, if you object to a card surcharge look elswhere.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cNew favourite at Darling Harbour\u201d", "Author": "EJHSydney", "ReviewID": "UR116286206", "Content": "From the elegant and comfortable foyer, with comfy chairs, newspapers and magazines and friendly, efficient staff, to the upgraded room (with a Darling Harbour view - otherwise no different from my colleagues' rooms), this hotel delighted.

If anything it has gone downhill since then. The first annoyance was the impenetrable pricing system. I was travelling to a conference with several colleagues. Despite everybody asking for the 'corporate rate' and all booking at around the same time, we were each paying vastly different amounts. As many of us were paying our own way, the people who paid the most felt very ripped off. As we checked in at the same time, the differential was very obvious and the receptionist was quite rude when the issue was raised: \"this is why we don't like guests to check in at the same time\". The room was fine, and very clean, but all the pillows provided were like cement. The business centre, for what is clearly a business hotel is a joke. Not enough computers, and no working printer! How hard it is to get a printer fixed? On check out I had an extra $45 on my bill for valet parking. When I disputed this it was quickly removed,but with a surly glance from the clerk. These spurious charges on hotel bills indicate to me either a slap dash approach to allocating costs to guests (was this someone else's charge?), or an attempt to pad a bill hoping corporate clients dont notice. The location is very drab. On a map it looks like it is on the charming Darling Harbour but it is actually in the middle of a spaghetti junction of depressing freeways and busy roads.

The Parkroyal is in such a great location with everything in walking distance and if your legs get tired the monorail is at the wharf which takes you to the museums, paddys market, the mall and a short walk to the opera house.

When we booked the hotel we specifically requested a honeymoon suite. This request was ignored and we were sandwiched in between 2 family rooms. Cue crying babies keeping us awake for the next 14 days. The room itself was a city view, which personally I think is an ambitious name for a room that looks out onto an apartment block but never mind. The bathroom was clean and modern with a sort of half bath thing and a walk in shower. It was nice. The main room let the place down a bit though with mismatched furniture and large chips taken out of the bedside tables. This had been 'repaired' with what looked like nail varnish, although maybe it was what passed for wood stain. It certainly didn't match the original colour though. The first day we were there we stayed out of the hotel to about 4 in the afternoon. We returned to the hotel to find our room still hadn't been made up. We were then interrupted by no less than 3 (!!) different members of staff. 1 to make the room up, 1 to check the mini bar and 1 to empty the bins. Forgive me if I'm wrong but couldn't 1 member of staff manage that? The next day we had a knock on the door at 0800 by the maid. This pattern continued for our entire stay. What ever time we went out our room was not made up when we returned apart from one day when we didn't get back til gone 8 in the evening. Some days they didn't even change the sheets. I know this as one day my foot bled (burst blister) and the mark was still there 2 days later. The lack of balcony was also disappointing, it would have been nice to be able to step outside on the days we didn't really want to go anywhere but this wasn't really a problem. The concierge was about as much use as a chocolate teapot. We had tickets to see the test match and when we asked him the best way to get to the SCG he told us to take a taxi for about $20. A further conversation with the South African doorman revealed that there was a bus up the street we could catch for $2. The only other time we needed the concierge was when the group in the family room next door to us decided to have a party at 0300. They promised to do something about it however it was left to another guest to complain to the people making the noise that they had a baby. They turned the music down eventually but continued to make a racket until gone 0500. The hotel did nothing but provide us with earplugs. They didn't even pass the message on to the day staff, we had to tell them. When we told the manager her exact words were 'what do you expect us to do about it?' Seriously. Then there was the wonderful time the bell-boy decided to deliver someone else's bags to our room. On discovery that there was someone there she looked confused then told us we were in the wrong room! Interesting. On the positive side the TV offered a wide range of channels, although it was a good thing we like sport as this was on just about all of them! If you wanted to stay in your room and watch sport all day you could, although you would have to put up with phone calls from the main desk asking you when you want the room made up (it's telling that the signs for your door don't say Do Not Disturb. They say Privacy Please which the staff seem to take as a sign to disturb as much as possible). You could start the day watching english football, carry on to the NHL then go into the test match and finish the evening with the Big Bash! Also the situation of the hotel is brilliant. Darling harbour is by far the best of the 2 and is within easy access to just about everywhere. The hotel bar is also great. The food is lovely and the staff are friendly even when you ask them to put the cricket on when they're losing. But you don't have to stay at the hotel to use the bar.
