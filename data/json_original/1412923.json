The rooms are on the small side but reasonably equipped. There is a breakfast room but no restaurant, meals can be ordered at reception and delivered to your room. There are several restaurants within five minutes walk from the hotel that cater for most tastes. The nearest underground station is Zinnowitzer Str. In the end a good place to stay when in Berlin.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cWalked up and got room- lucky\u201d", "Author": "shortysboyKansas", "ReviewID": "UR24435415", "Content": "I needed a room on the last night of an 8 day European blitz- no hotels booked along the way. I walked from the train station and came across this hotel. It's a bit more than 8 minutes from the station but not a bad walk. It was a walking distance to the \"Mit\" a trendy area with great outdoor dining and drinking. Plentiful cabs in the area, which I took to the airport in the AM. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. I had an early flight and they set up a table about 15 minutes prior to normal breakfast start to accommodate my schedule. I was a bit bedraggled compared to most of their clientele; which seemed more business oriented; they didn't seem to hold that against me. Across the street was a museum of some sort that looked straight out of old WWII footage. I didn't have time to visit but it made for a interesting juxtaposition from the hotel's upscale, modern polish. It's not a cheap hotel but the appointments and service were in line with the cost.", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hannover, Germany", "Title": "\u201cWhen a double room is not a double room\u201d", "Author": "Gernereiserin", "ReviewID": "UR7481907", "Content": "Just spent one night there. The location is fine, although a bit loud - you can walk from the new central station, although it is a bit more than the 8-minute walk they advertise. A tram and subway-stop are very near, and there are bars and restaurants in walking distance. The service people were exceptionally friendly, especially for Germany/Berlin standards. It was no surprise our room wasn't ready at 10.30 am when we arrived. By the time we returned they had taken our suitcases to the room, which was a nice touch. The bathroom was new and clean, the room was clean too and the furniture ok. But ... it was clearly not a double room, but a single room with a roll-in second bed. Proof: various light switches and a power outlet over the head of the second bed, only one nightstand and one bed was up to the wall, accessible only from the foot end. We felt a bit cheated by this, and with EUR 110 it was not so exceptionally cheap. Breakfast was good.", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "angelina_alix", "ReviewID": "UR6001442", "Content": "Stayed her for 3 nights in Oct 2006. Modern hotel. Very helpful receptionists. We paid 95 euros a night including breakfast. Breakfast was continental and cooked, very good selection. I think it's probably used more as a business hotel. Very clean, good sized hotel room, shower /bathroom good size. Can't fault it. 5 mins walk away are bars/restaurants. We walked everywhere from here and didn't think that it was too far out, obviously you could use tram/metro but we chose to walk.
