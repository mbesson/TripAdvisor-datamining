{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Mixed This hotel was well located by Adenauerplatz on the Ku'damm, reasonably priced with a good sized room. But walking into the lobby, the hotel looked worn and weary. The rug between the lobby and elevator was stained and frayed. The rug in my room was also stained. The desk personnel had limited English, with the exception of a very helpful woman on the night shift one night. The photographs on their website had no relationship to reality.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR292607238", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Armathwaite"}, {"Content": "Unbearable I never thought of joining trip advisor until I stayed at the Quentinhotel, but I think it is important to let others know how bad this place really is. I don't doubt the positive reviews here are genuine,but they are not the whole story. I arrived at the hotel late on a cool night in April, but amazingly my room was 86 degrees Fahrenheit. I opened the skylight, which opened about an inch, and went for a walk. By the way, there are NO WINDOWS WHATSOEVER in any of the rooms on the fifth floor - i.e. no windows in 20% of the rooms in the hotel. You roll the dice with respect to this when you book, and believe me, the hotel\u9225\u6a9a guarantees with respect to this or anything else are not something they are likely to hold themselves to. When I returned from my walk the room was 83. The front desk said they couldn't turn on the AC until the manager arrived in the morning, and promised they would do it then. It was 90 in the morning. They didn't turn on the AC. In fact they kept promising to turn on the AC for four days. They never turned on the AC. Well, I shouldn't say never, because they did turn it on the fourth day. I blasted it for hours, and it did not cool the room, in fact it couldn't keep up with the rising sun. The room coolest the room ever got was 81. I asked the maid about the heat, and she said the rooms on the fifth floor were always very hot, and the hotel knew this perfectly well. (I hope this doesn't get anyone fired.) So I asked to switch to another floor. They wouldn't switch me. So the next day I decided to switch hotels. But no. This particular Quentin insists on full payment when you arrive, and will not refund money under any circumstances. I can't tell you how dishonest I think these people are. At least 20%of the product they are selling is sub-standard, they know it, and they don't care. And without something like TripAdvisor they haveno incentive to change. Just look at my example, I paid full price for an uninhabitably hot room (and God knows what it must be like in the summer), complained for four days, they did nothing, I moved on, and they had their money.", "Date": "May 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR432974467", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "JonathanSanFrancisco"}, {"Content": "Great Location and good value Hotel Itself.Three of us stayed in three rooms march 2006. We got a great deal of 45 euro a night excl breakfast. Breakfast is available at 7.50 . B'fast was a choice of cereal/yogurt/meat/cheese/egg and orange/tea/coffee. The rooms themselves are very large and en suite. They come with a minibar and TV. There was 2 english TV stations available (CNN and BBC world). Coffee / coctails were available at reception. There was no AC but had a ceiling fan. There appeared to be parking at the back of the hotel. Better to check with the hotel.Only slight quibble the curtains are a liitle on the light permitting side so one might need to bring eye shades.LocationsThis hotel is situated on a quite enough atreet off the Ku'dam. The nearest u bhan stop is adenaur platz. (About a 200m walk). As far as I could make out any bus leaving the zoo gatern going up the Ku'dam would get you to Adenaur Platz.

We found the hotel to be fairly good value for money. The location is alright. Its in the Charlottenbeg/ wilmersdorf region and about 1min walk to the bottom of the Ku'dDamm which is excellent for shopping. The hotel rooms are of good size and are well kept and clean, however they are a little dated and old. It is very close to all public transport including the underground, bus and taxi rank. Also a short trip away from the main tourist attractions like the Branderburg Gate, the parliament and the tiergarten. Many of the museums/nightclubs however, are in the east of the city which is about 15mins away on the bus/train. Id recommend this hotel for budget holidaymakers and those who dont mind walking or using public transport.", "Date": "Feb 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR918759009", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Paul_A1980"}, {"Content": "Good value for money To be honest we booked this hotel because it was one of the cheapest available but we were very happy with the result. The big plus is its position, just off the Ku Damm and 5 minutes walk from the underground station and the bus stop for the airport. It's not exactly the centre of the social universe but there's a couple of decent pubs nearby (we liked the quiet traditional one on the corner, turn left out of the hotel) and a useful supermarket a few minutes down the road. Using public transport it's quick and easy to get to most places, at least in the old West Berlin.Staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were quiet, clean and big enough. The only real negative was the breakfast which was awful - mainly (very) processed meat, also they kept running out of everything, including bread and coffee and it was virtually impossible to find a seat. I'd suggest skipping it and going elsewhere.Despite this I'd still give the Quentin an above-average rating, purely because it offers excellent value for money if you're on a tight budget.", "Date": "Jan 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR676729532", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Jdian"}, {"Content": "Good location The hotel is situated in a good location, only one minute walk away from the Kuerfuerstendamm - the best and only place to shop in Berlin ( so I was told by the locals ).
