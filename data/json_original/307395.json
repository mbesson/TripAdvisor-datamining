Due to the close promiximity to my company, we stayed at the Tokyo Dome Hotel. It is a very clean hotel with friendly staff.It does get very crowded on the main floor lobby, but you don't notice that when on the floor of your hotel. Furthermore, the noise that emanates from the actual Tokyo Dome (concerts) is quite prevalent if you're staying on that side of the hotel.My room was adequately sized, and so was the bathroom. I was on the 26th floor and had a great view from my room. The restaurant also has very nice restaurants in the hotel. I highly recommend the Korean BBQ restaurant.Close to train station. I would stay there again despite the crowdedness.", "Date": "Aug 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR870661437", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "normaltravlr"}, {"Content": "A true Japanese hotel The entrance to the Tokyo dome hotel was a little hard to find, coming from the subway station. But that's hardly a surprise, as it's a huge building, so it takes 10 minutes to even walk around it.The hotel has a staggering 48 floors, and an enormous reception desk. The staff is friendly and all spoke english. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. My room was on the 24th floor and had an amazing view of the amusement park next to the hotel. The hotel has an english speaking tourist office and a shuttle to the airport, both of which were very useful in my case.", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR280625535", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pek1977"}, {"Content": "Exceptional Service at Tokyo Dome This hotel was beautiful - the service exceptional - the cleanliness unsurpassed - and the artist's cafe at the top of the hotel offered beautiful views of the city at night. It was close to public transit and next door to the oldest park in the city. We even were able to witness a wedding taking place at our hotel in an open-air meeting room during our stay.For years, I have been traveling with a poster of Jack and Robert Kennedy - a family tradition where the Kennedys appear in the background unobtrusively in holiday photos. During my stay in Tokyo, I lost one earring from a favorite pair. I wrote to the hotel staff from home (Madison WI) and asked if they had by chance found the earring. I promptly received a package with a very polite note saying they had not found the earring but they had found the enclosed poster - my Kennedys had been left behind in a drawer!! I was very impressed with the thoroughness of the staff and their kindness in returning my (priceless) poster.Susan", "Date": "Dec 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR490650166", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JadeGirl3"}, {"Content": "Great hotel, reasonably priced, good location       Tokyo Dome Hotel", "Date": "Nov 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR115342328", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "huw2006"}, {"Content": "Very good service and comfortable rooms I stay at the Tokyo Dome when I travel to Japan on business and it is a really comfortable and pleasant place.

Ever felt like staying in a Tokyo Hotel like the one in Sophia Coppola's movie Lost in Translation? This is it. At night, you'll get great views of the immense city from pretty much every room in the building, except for the lower ones. During the day, the views are not so great because Tokyo is more beautiful at night. There are plenty of convenient shopping options in the complex nearby, including many restaurants (also within the hotel). Service, as everywhere in Japan, is impeccable. Hotel staff are corteous, polite, willing to help at all times. Parisians and New Yorkers could learn a lesson or two or a hundred from the japanese.Rooms are very, very clean and even spacious, in case you think every hotel room in Japan has tiny rooms. Bathrooms in Japan are something else, and you'd have to visit to learn details. On top of it all, this hotel is very affordable, much more so than any hotel of this category in any major city, be it New York, London or Rome. In fact, it is half the price of a hotel of the same quality in either one of the cities mentioned. Mine was a business trip, but I'd recommend this for a vacation as well. But do learn some japanese, because english is almost useless in Japan.", "Date": "Apr 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR170894994", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "brazilianwanderlust"}, {"Content": "Worth the money Tokyo Dome is situated at the center of Tokyo's metropolitan area, next to the Giants' baseball stadium and 5min walk to JR Suidobashi station.I have been in Japan many times for many years and this hotel is one of the bests for the money.It has a good restaurant for breakfast, a little pricy though, but all is pricy in Japan anyway.
