The room was comfortable, a little shabby but well serviced. The hotel had left a small bottle of champagne and a fruit basket in the room as it was a special occasion and this was a lovely touch. The weather was beautiful so we drank our champagne on the little balcony overlooking the gardens, the Louve and landmarks across Paris - couldn't have been better! The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet, no noise from the road below. The bathroom was adequate, a disappointing shower curtain arrangement and a poor hairdryer but the lighting was good and there was a shaving/ make up mirror. There was a mini bar and high quality coffee and tea available. The ground floor was being renovated so we couldn't sample the bar and we had breakfast in one of the local cafes - so many to try! The hotel is so well placed to explore by foot - the metro is on the doorstep if you are off to monmatre or further afield. Theres designer shopping nearby if your wallet can stand it.

The prices were reasonable (for Paris) and the views could not be beat! Check in was fine but we did have to wait a little for our room to be ready. It was before 3:00 so to be fair that was expected. The front desk staff was very friendly and spoke excellent English. While waiting I was offered something to drink and they updated me every few minutes. I wasn't just stuck in the back and ignored. The room itself (on the top floor) was very large by Paris standards and as I mentioned had views that you only see in movies. Go out onto the balcony and look left... the Louvre... look to your right... the Eiffel Tower. Across the street is the Tuileries Garden so you have an unobstructed view of the city. The room itself was a little dated, but not shabby. I personally prefer more modern furnishings. It was clean and had everything you need. The rooms on the top floor have access to a small balcony that you can walk out on. Bathroom was also large by Paris standards and was very clean. When we checked in we were taken to our room by a porter in the elevator which was big enough for the three of us and several large suitcases. When going out we took the elevator down but apparently it was a different one. The doors opened and it was about 18 inches deep and wide enough for 3 or 4 people. If you are claustrophobic I would advise using the stairs :) The location is fantastic. You are right at a Metro station (Tuileries) and there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. The hotel does not have parking so if you are planning on driving it will be expensive. There are several parking garages in the area but they are all going to cost you more than 25 Euro per day.

Since I lived most of my life in S. Africa and like USA, Australia we are used to big luxury spaces I can understand all those travelers that are disappointed after coming to a historic cultured place such as Paris and they also expect to find the same high luxury standards as well. Well this is Europe, everything is smaller due to space limitations. So if you want to visit classic and historic Paris then you have a choice of staying in central Paris in close proximity to the main touristic places such a s the Louvre etc. ,but then be prepared to compromise luxury ,space and services, otherwise you can stay in the business district of Paris central. I stayed in Brighton hotel and for a 250 euros a night room a 4 star hotel (in effect a 3 star) I paid for location, view and this was the hotel with the biggest rooms and bathrooms in my opinion and this category. So let\u2019s start with the positives: Location, to me best position in Central Paris with great views and walking distance from the gardens, main attractions since I was traveling with a 9 month old baby. View was unbelievable both from 314 and even better from the smaller deluxe room at 413 with two windows and better room to my opinion since 314 had ventilation problems in the bathroom. Rooms ,typical over 200 year old hotel ,I was happy with the deco ,space and bathrooms had all facilities ,plenty hot water ,shower and bath . I was impressed with the large space. The heated system was ok , but if you like more ,then make sure that the cleaning ladies don\u2019t turn down the heat in your room while you are out. Regarding the old furniture well this is Paris and you are surrounded by 100 year old furniture and it is a pleasant addition to the atmosphere, so I was happy with it. People and services : A lot has been said about the French people and their ruddiness ,well I will disagree ,it is all about their culture and once you are traveling to their country you are guess in to their culture and way of life so once you have establish this it will make your holiday happier. Had said this, be advised that you will always find both professionals and nonprofessionals every were you go. General I was happy with the positive attitude of the Limited staff in the hotel, not all were up to a 4 star services but this was due to \u201ccut costs\u201d policy and to my surprise they did everything possible to accommodate my demands or requests. Just don\u2019t be rude, don\u2019t belittle them they are very proud nation\uf04a. I was extremely pleased with Frederique, that went out of the way to accommodate me and my family on a short notice even if I stayed for 6 nights on Christmas and the hotel was fully booked.(she spoke French ,English and Greek \uf04a). She even booked transportation for me (all though more expensive than a taxi) as well as managed to book table at the Le joule Vern on the day before Christmas (now that was a bad choice of a restaurant but this is another story\uf04a ).Her emails to my inquiries were prompted and in to the point. The reception was warm ,the luggage\u2019s were sent to my room fast as well as collected on departure and stored safely until we were picked up to the airport. In fact a pair of earrings of my wife\u2019s that were left in the room was given to us as well \uf04a The linen was new, clean and towels were plenty, clean, and to my surprise no dust in the room. I cannot comment on breakfast since I general prefer to eat out at my time convenience. There are two lifts a small and a bigger one that was good enough for a small hotel. There was coffee, tea, sugar, milk every day in my room all though sometimes they will forget to refill and I had to ask for it. The negative: Cleaning and hygiene is an issue in Paris hotels and I will have to say that the cleaning services need more training in order to clean better the bathrooms .I had to request three times a better cleaning service in the bathrooms and I was a bit disappointed as they sprayed aromatic spray in the bathrooms to get rid the drain odder in room 314 , that caused me allergies the last day of my stay. 314 room has a problem with drain odder and poor ventilation in the toilet that is separate from the bathroom and faces the main bedroom. 413 has a passage that has the toilet and bathroom and then the bedroom. Better choice if you ask me. No drain odder there as well and better view. This is a 3 star hotel service to my opinion but all small Paris hotel in this area are within the same categories .It has to do with location, view and exposure to central touristic position. I cannot find anything else negative to say except that in the evening there is only one person in the hotel (frond desk ) and when I had a problem with some of the plugs and lights not working I was asked to go downstairs to the reception in order to pick up globs \uf04a We all know that most problems occur when the guests are return from their daily trips and need to rest, sleep so in the course of the night there should be more capable staff. For 250 euros a night I would like complimentary water in my room, and I found prizes in the mini bar a bit expensive.(a juice 6 euros ,water 5 euros) Also I found that communication and coordination can be a problem between staff I had requested over my emails a baby cot and a baby milk warmer ,they forgotten to had them placed in my room when I arrived , however this was rectified immediately so no fuzz, and since I had arrange for 1300 check out but the front desk at the day of departure was not informed for the late chkout he was a bit \u201c persistent \u201dand I had to speak to him a bit \u201cstraight\u201d \uf04a I didn\u2019t find any overprizing with my bill and everything regarding prizes was according to my knowledge and expectations. Tips to save you money \u201c : One of the ways they make money In Paris is to sell water very expensive. A small bottle of water (250ml) is charged 5 euros so remember Paris tap water is excellent quality for European standards and buying mineral water in supermarkets will also save you some bucks!!We were surprised in local restaurant to see only tourists drinking bottled water while most France people were drinking tap water on large glass containers. I cannot understand in this financial crisis why they do not sell the water at a reasonable prize and forcing most tourists to purchase water outside of the hotels\u2026 Also stop a taxi at the road and it will be cheaper than have transportation arranged from the hotel. I believe that whatever the hotel books for you takes a cut that makes your bill more expensive. I paid 65 euros for one way transportation from the airport that was arranged from the hotel .however you can book yourself over the internet for 35 euros. Overall I will take my family there again I was happy with my stay and will recommend the Hotel to others as well.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C.", "Title": "\u201cA Little Underwhelmed\u201d", "Author": "Chipmunk24", "ReviewID": "UR122494272", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Brighton last fall, with my husband and teenaged daughter.

The bathroom looked very recently and beautifully renovated. The only minor flaws with the room were that the carpeting and an old sofa probably should have been replaced when they updated the bathroom, but they were not in terrible shape. The staff at the hotel were all very professional, courteous, pleasant and helpful. All the staff that we interacted with spoke English very well or at least enough that it was never a problem communicating with them. They were very helpful in recommending and making reservations for us at restaurants within a short walk from the hotel. We had 3 very good meals at 3 different restaurants that the hotel staff had recommended. The breakfast at the hotel in the morning was very nice and was covenient before starting our day touring Paris. They had juices, fruits, pastries, croissants, cereal, yogurt, scrambled eggs, sausage, coffee and tea. The cost of breakfast was a bit expensive (although ours was included in the room price), but so is just about everything else in Paris. The best thing about Hotel Brighton is its location. The view is incredible. Many things you would want to visit are within a short (10-20 minute or so) walk - - Jardin de Tuileries, Notre Dame, Sainte Chapelle, Ile Saint-Louis, the Louvre, Place de Vendome, Place de la Concorde, the Latin Quarter, Musee d'Orsay. The Tuileries Metro station (on Metro line #1) is just across the street from the hotel and the Metro is very easy to use (it's very similar to the New York subway system). We took the Metro to get to the Eiffel Tower, Montmartre, Sacre Coeur, and Versailles (for Versailles, you need to switch from the Metro to the RER C line that takes you out to Versailles - about a 45 minute train ride).

From the moment we arived the reception staff were the most welcoming I have met. They spoke perfect english and could not do enough for us. I had read that the hotel rooms in the city could be on the small side but our room (501) was a good size with a desk and chair etc. The hotel also organised airport transfers for us which were first class. Five minutes from the Louve and oposite Jardin desTuileries it is perfect. It is an easy walk to Notre Dame along the river bank with many restaurants, for those who feel the need Carrs Irish pub is also two minutes walk away. The river taxi is superb and gives a hop on hop off service so I recommend it. A word of caution regarding pick pockets they operate openly along the arched shopping areas and main attractions.

The gentleman at the reception desk immediately gave me the room across the floor which had a much better layout. While the carpet was still stained in this new room the light and layout were a big improvement. 2) However, during my first night the air conditioning in this second room did not work well. I turned the fan on high and within 30 minutes it automatically turned off. I know this because the heat and stuffiness woke me a few times during the night. The next day (Friday) I notified the hotel of the issue. I stayed another three nights and brought up this issue each morning and evening because the problem was not addressed. 3) Toward the end of my stay I asked the receptionist whether I needed to order a taxi to take me to the train station at 6am for a day trip I was taking. He said there was no need to do this since at that time there are plenty of taxis. Well, this want the case. The morning receptionist had to order me a cab. 4) The overall attitude of the hotel employees stinks. They are not helpful and in one case quite rude and condescending. 5) The hotel has no restaurant and only serves breakfast. It's a buffet that is not great.

You could barely hear the traffic outside with both sets of windows shut. So the street noise wasn't that much of a bother. I just couldn't believe that there were utility workers at 5 AM banging away on God knows what of 2 of the mornings. But that's not the hotel's fault. If you looked out of the windows to the left, you had a great view of the Louvre. If you looked out the windows to the right, you had a phenomenal view of the Eiffel Tower. And straight ahead was the Tuilleries Garden with lots of greenery. The WiFi in the room was free and was consistent and reliable. However, the buffet breakfast was not free; it was 19Euro a person, which was really high for the small selection of food available. So we opted instead to walk (left out of the hotel) down the street 100 yards to the Welcome Cafe. We recommend you get out and about to see what cafes are in the area; you\u2019ll find breakfast is really inexpensive. Hotel Brighton had room service available until 11:30 PM, and we ordered some salads one night. We ordered the Arugula Salad and the Buffalo Salad. Each was around 12Euro and I highly recommend them both; they were great. There was a mini bar fridge available in the room as well with a selection of wine, liquors, water and sodas. The wine was 10Euro, and the water was about 8Euro. There was also a bottle of champagne. However, if you want to save money and shop at a local store for wines and water instead (and other snacks) we recommend walking out the hotel to the left 1 block, then turn left and go up to the next street. You'll see a plethora of cafes and a small grocery store. But I must say that the fridge in the room had some space to put small items if you had leftovers from dinner, or wanted to store snacks in it. The cab ride to the hotel from the airport was 60Euro, but on the way back to the airport it was only 45Euro. The Arc de Triumph was a 15 minute walk out the hotel to the right, and Louvre was a 5 minute walk out of the hotel to the left. Notre Dame was a brisk 20 minute walk to the left, but the Eiffel Tower was easily a 1 hour walk (though we weren't necessarily hurrying either). I highly recommend the Welcome Cafe one block east of Hotel Brighton. FANTASTIC food at very reasonable prices. We had the chef's special; one was a beef stew dish in pepper sauce which my husband had, and a chicken dish in a creamy mushroom sauce that I had. Each were outstanding; the waiter did not lie. :) The Welcome Cafe had a pleasant atmosphere and a large interior in which to while away some time and people watch. The waiter was attentive and very personable as well. We felt we chose a great spot to call home-away-from-home and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone with a modest budget. The staff were all very nice and friendly as well as helpful. The entire staff spoke English but humored me when I wanted to try my French.

We also easily strolled from the Hotel Brighton to Napoleon's Tomb, Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame and Saint Chapelle. All on our top 10 list of places to visit in Paris. The room itself was probably on par with a newer Holiday Inn---which meant everything was clean and spacious with lots of storage, an in room safe, desk, large bathroom with separate shower and tub and free wifi. The bed was comfortable, the room was cleaned and toiletries and towels refreshed daily, and we found it very quiet with both sets of French doors closed to the Rue de Rivoli. But while other hotels can offer all this, it was the tiny \"balcony\" which allowed you to sit admiring one of the most spectacular views (glass in hand) that was unforgettable. It was something we never tired of any time of the day when we happened to stop in to the room, but the view was especially wonderful in the evening. We found the all the staff most helpful with luggage, directions and dinner reservations, and after accidentally locking the safe with the wrong code on a Friday, even the manager came in on the weekend to assist us since our flight was leaving Sunday at 7am.

Location - Ideal for walking to many prominent sights, from Notre Dame to Champs Elysees. We paid 10 Euros max for taxis to other locations we visited, or when going out for dinner (Eiffel Tower, Isle de la Cite, Latin Quarter, etc). Tons of cafes nearby, of course the Louvre and Tuileries Garden, ATMs within a block, and multiple markets within 2 blocks (on Rue St. Honore) including bakery, convenience store, and wine shops. We shopped at these markets to get snacks/water for our daily outings and to get picnic dinner items for an evening trip to the Eiffel Tower (only concern was having to be conscious of the hours they were open). Hotel \u2013 Room was 4 nights for price of 3 (Fri-Tues), third floor Tuileries Garden view with king size bed.

View and location were well worth the price (avg $324 US per night). Did not bring laptop so we used free computer/internet in lobby without problems.

That wasn't a problem - but it was different than I had expected. The Staff was very professional and courteous across the board. All spoke english very well (which was great, because my french was terrible) and they were all very responsive and helpful. Our room was large with a beautiful view that you can see all over the reviews on this site - so I won't post more pictures. It was hot during our stay and the air conditioner did not work as well as they have to in Texas. The room decor overall was three stars except the carpet was a one star and the bathroom(s) (separate toilet room) was four stars. The sleeper sofa - which our two teens slept on - was the most comfortable pull out couch I have ever laid on. I thought the location of the hotel was perfect for touring sights throughout the city. The one big fault during our trip was listening to a recommendation by the front desk to eat down the street on Rue de Rivoli at L'Imperial. It seemed like a decent place when we were eating there - except I ordered a couple of \"specials\" recommended by the server which turned out to be OUTRAGEOUSLY priced - which was a shock when we got our bill - because most items on the menu seemed to be priced within the stratosphere. The off-menu \"specials\" were the perfect trap for stupid tourists. Our bill ended up costing me $240 US for nothing more than simple sandwich/soup fare. I don't like \"getting taken for a ride\", so I would never, ever go back to L'Imperial. If you do, stick to the menu and make sure you have verified ALL prices (including drink (even water)). Angelinas was terrific. The front desk also recommended restaurants at the Place du March\u00e9 Saint-Honor\u00e9. It is a short stroll away from the hotel and there are many, many great eating options there. We ate at several places there and enjoyed all of them - very reasonably priced also.

I found this hotel with a wonderful location, almost too good to be true, and the reviews about it seemed especially encouraging. When we arrived the hotel lobby was a bit small, but coming from London I wasn't too hung up on cramped spaces, but the room had a nice view of the Jardin des Tuileries, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Musee d'Orsay (pics attached). The room was spacious and felt a bit empty, the television was small and awkwardly positioned given the size of the room, the little fridge was a funny imitation of a mini bar, but the bathroom was nice and spacious with a shower and bathtub, and the bathroom was in a seperate room with it's own sink. We were content as the room and bathroom seemed clean. However during our 3 night stay the room was not vaccumed, the sheets were not changed and one night after taking a shower I found that they had not left us any big towels with only hand and floor towels on the rack. After we left I found that I had forgotten my house keys in the room, I called them and they confirmed that they had found them and I asked them to send them to me, which they said they would. I do not know if they would have contacted me to tell me I had forgotten them, but from their tone of voice I don't think they would have. I received my keys a ridiculous 10 days later, which is pathetic considering that I'm just across the channel. Again the staff didn't get back to me to update me, I had to call and kept hanging on the line for about 10 minutes until they remembered I was there, then the emails I received from there directed me to a French website, the link they sent me was mis-spelt, that I couldn't make tails or heads of, and a series of emails ensued between us until I had to ask them to look at the site and tell me what it said. They seemed very unwilling to take an extra step. The service from the hotel staff was civil enough, although I have seen much friendlier. And in all, given the money that I was spending there, I was disappointed in the quality of the room. Some of the staff were very friendly and chatty, but I found the majority a bit sullen and surly, however I found that most French service providers are that way. I enjoyed my stay in Paris very much, but I've stayed in 5 star hotels that didn't charge as much as this hotel and where every conceivable comfort was available. Furthermore, no room service to speak of, the restaurant was only open for breakfast, again if I compare to other hotels, given what I was paying, I should have been getting a whole lot more.

The view was spectacular and the room was very spacious and clean. The location was great for getting to all the main tourist sights and close to several metro stations. The staff that cleaned the rooms and the door staff were very polite, helpful and efficient at their jobs. However, both my husband and I found the front desk staff very stand offish from the word go.

We then asked to use the internet for a short while to check the status of our tours for the next few days. It was the bell boy/doorman that helped us with that and gave us a code to use the internet free. Unfortunately the internet took about 10 minutes to come up and we could not get on to anything but local tourist sights so could not check our email for our tour updates. I advised the lady at the front desk that the internet was not working properly and she just shrugged. I asked her to look into it and went to another hotel to use their internet. We tried the internet to complete online checkin for our flights upon checkout and it was still exactly the same and we could not check in online. The morning we checked out I called the front office and asked if we could possibly leave a bit later than middat as our flight was not til late that night. He replied very abruptly \"No!\". At about 11.45am we had a knock on the door asking us to check out as they had to clean the room. We did not expect late checkout, but did not expect the attitude we got from the front desk staff. Upon checking out at midday the man at the front desk did not smile and had a very rude tone to his voice and then made comments about not using the hotels shuttle service.

The location, rate and ambience made up for those minor negatives. I would rate our experience here as excellent as we were able to walk to all the major sights and there are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants near by.

We booked an \"apartment\" that had a modest-size bedroom, full bath, and separate small living room with a pullout couch. There was plenty of room for all of us throughout our entire stay. This room configuration and size were perfect as we were traveling with our college-age daughter. The room had been recently updated; was clean; and quiet (we had an inside courtyard apt). Our room included two flat-screen TVs, a refrigerator, safe, full bath (with two sinks), tub, shower, separate toilet area, hair dryer, and plenty of closet space. WiFi Internet was available in the room using a prepaid internet card purchased at the front desk. Only nits: Shower was weak and took 10 minutes to get any hot water and cable television went down. The staff was wonderfully helpful and welcoming. Anytime we needed anything, they provided it to us in a friendly, expedient manner: restaurant recommendations, taxi, directions, etc. The hotel is located near EVERYTHING: across the street from the Metro, Tuileries Garden, the Louvre, L'orangerie, and Jeu de Paume museums. Walking distance to great restaurants, bateau mouche, and amazing shopping. Tips: Rue Ste. Honore, one street away, has all the couture shopping anyone would ever need. We enjoyed dining casually at the Imperial Cafe one block away. We also loved Le Souffle (fabulous to have appetizers, entrees and desserts prepared as souffles) and Il Cortile (a fine Italian restaurant located in the Hotel Castille). One last tip: Be sure to purchase a museum card, which is a prepaid advance ticket that gets you into almost all Parisian museums. The card can be purchased for a variety of days and is activated (by writing the date on the back) as soon as you use it the first time. We purchased ours on the afternoon we arrived at the Notre Dame Cathedral, because there is barely a line at the ND ticket booth. If you purchase the card at any of the museums, you'll have to wait on a long, serpentine line. The museum card can be also purchased online (takes 10 days to mail), or at the Paris airports. Once you get the card, you enter all museums via a separate entrance on a short line. Be sure to check your coats--you'll roast in the museums. Be sure to have hot chocolate and a pastry at Angelina's Salon du The, which is located four doors down from the Hotel Brighton on Rue Rivoli--It is unbelievably scrumptious! Be sure to go before 3PM, because the place is a zoo afterwards. Last word of advice: I purchased lovely cookies at Angelina's while in Paris; and, like a good citizen, checked YES \"are you bringing any food item into the US?\" Well, had I known I would have to stand on an additional customs' line because I had food (cookies). I would have left the yummy treats with the hotel staff. Goodness, Uncle Sam, was that necessary?

On this trip, we thought about staying at the Regina again, but opted for the Brighton because it was less expensive, had a better location, and was also a 4-star hotel. We're very glad we made that choice. The Brighton has much better views than the Regina, larger rooms, larger bathrooms, and for a fraction of the cost. My only issue was that the linens were not changed daily and were only changed when I specifically asked. The staff were all friendly and the location is perfect. A concern is that the AC isn't as strong as it could be. It was 40 degrees outside at night and very chilly, but the room was steaming hot (we turned off all the radiators, etc). With the windows open we were able to sleep fine, but I imagine if it were any warmer outside it would've been miserable. Maybe it is fine when it's hot out, but I don't know. Also, when we checked in we stayed in a smaller room the first night on the 5th floor before changing rooms into a De Luxe room on the 2nd floor for the rest of our week. The tiny room at the top had a double bed (like a double size in the USA), but was nice and had a great shower. The larger room had a king-sized bed (two large twins pushed together). Both had stunning views. The hotel breakfast is a little weird and the service is spotty. My advice is to do what we did - skip the hotel breakfast and walk two doors down to Angelina -- the best place for breakfast in town. They also have the most outstanding hot chocolate you'll ever have in your life. Although the service at Angelina is not so hot either, you'll enjoy the atmosphere. (Tip: go early, the Rue de Rivoli is basically empty in the morning and late at night, but crowded with tourists during the day). There are dozens of great places to eat all within walking distance.

Unfortunately, I found the male member of staff on the front desk to be both abrupt and rather dismissive upon check-in. (When I checked out the following day he also seemed unable/unwilling to tell me where a particular street was located, and it turned out the street was next to the hotel!). I do have only a rudimentary knowledge of french, but use it to the best of my ability, and he was able to speak english so it didn't seem to be a language barrier, only a service one! I was very happy with the size of the room. I was given room 401, which was a large room on the 4th floor with a huge (comparable to other hotels in Paris) bathroom. My room did not have a view but I did pay a discounted rate so I wasn't expecting one! The room and bathroom (on first inspection) also appeared quite clean. The hotel is located literally across the street from Tuilieries metro stop and the gardens, and is surrounded by many lovely shops and cafes, so the location is great and very central. After returning rather late to the hotel after a day of sightseeing, I was about to go to bed and unfortunately noticed the state of the sheets. There were some small bloodstains on the edges of the sheets and several large holes (possibly cigarette burns) in both the upper and lower sheets. When I inspected them more closely the sheets did not look like they had been changed since the last occupant. As by this time I was too tired to deal with the problem, I slept on top of the blankets! This greatly impacted on my enjoyment of the hotel (and obviously my night's sleep). The only other point I would note is that, as a solo female traveller, it would have made the room feel more secure if there was a chain or similar on the door. The lock itself felt quite flimsy.

It was cool enough to be comfortable without much heat or air while I was there. The location couldn't have been better. The Tuileries metro stop was across the street, one block down. This is the yellow \"liine 1\" which gave easy access to all of Paris. The Tuileries garden entrance was just across the Rue de Rivoli. Walk to the left and you could visit the Louvre. Walk straight ahead and head towards the river and the Musee d\"Orsay across the river. You could walk to the right to the Place de la Concorde and the Champs Elysees and Arc de Triomphe in the distance. I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. I'm not a big breakfast eater and had read that it was too expensive (from other Trip Advisor travelers) so I didn't add their breakfast to my package. There were plenty of places nearby to get a croissant or pan au chocoalte. There was even a McDonald's a few blocks down towards the Louvre. (their idea of Pancakes and mine are not the same! lol) I loved the location, the room, the amenities, the view! The people at the front desk weren't rude, but they weren't overly friendly. They spoke English and were always helpful when I needed something, so that was good enough for me. It's amazing to see the Eiffel Tower lit up at night from your room. Every hour, on the hour, for 10 minutes it sparkles all over...very cool! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

A man named Elio was similarly hostile to us and to other guests. We could barely get anyone at the hotel to make a restaurant reservation. We had no hot water at sporadic points throughout our 4-day stay; although the hotel sent an apology bottle of champagne, they never fixed the problem. Most 4-star hotels in Paris have a concierge, or at least top-notch front-desk staff. This one was a service disaster.

We asked for more sheets to make up the bed for her which were brought up quickly and she slept there happily for the duration of our stay. The main problem was the traffic noise. It seems that either there's an awful lot of crime in Paris or the local police just like to use their sirens when they get bored. There were sirens sounding much of the night which were intermingled with the screams coming from one of the rides on the Jardin De Tuileries' Fair which just happened to be located across the road directly in front of the hotel for the months of July and August.

We had the continental breakfast in the hotel a couple of mornings for 10 euros each which is similar to most of the prices in the cafes very close by (between 10 and 15 euros) but if you go back a few streets, you can get the same breakfast for 7 euros each. The location is excellent, we walked to the Louvre (very close by and part of the wonderful view if you're overlooking the Jardin De Tuileries), the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame - in fact, we went everywhere on foot. The only time we used transport was to go on the Paris Vision tour bus to Disneyland Park - personally I wouldn't bother with Disneyland simply because of the horrendous queues. We had to queue for 40 minutes just to buy some sun screen when we first got in (only place selling it was the same place that hires out wheel chairs and push chairs - hence the long waiting line). Average waiting queues at the rides were at least half an hour for each short ride and on a hot day with little to no shade, the novelty wears off pretty quickly. My 10 year old daughter actually said she preferred the noisy fair across the road from our hotel to Disneyland!!! - It was a lot cheaper too. If you're looking for souvenirs, you won't be dissapointed -there are a huge number of souvenir shops very close by. There is also one of the new bike hire stations just down the road (the sort where you pick up a bike in one station and can drop it off at another station if desired) so if you feel like cycling around Paris, the bikes are virtually on your doorstep.

If you want an above-average hotel in a super convenient spot in Paris, you should definately consider staying here. I booked this hotel in Jan 06 for a trip to take place that July. I based my decision on the reviews, and mostly the location. I thought it would be great to be able to walk to the Louvre, and to all the best shopping, as well as the river- and it was! I booked a triple room for our 3 kids, and a double room for my husband and I. I had requested a balcony in my booking, but was given a nice, but interior room. Our kids' room was very spacious with a huge marble bathroom, and they loved it. When I went to the desk to ask about the balcony, they said it wasn't in their booking, but they would do their best to get us a balcony room- which they did. They were very friendly and eager to please or help us in any way. Since we had found out that the Tour de France was that weekend, we asked them where we could see it. They told us very matter-of-factly that the Tour would pass directly in front of the hotel-- 7 times!!! We couldn't believe our incredible luck!!! My husband and kids were jumping for joy. Then we realized we could have a perfect overhead view from our 4th floor balcony of the whole street, then go down in front of the lobby and see the riders up close. It was a day none of will ever forget. The other people on the street watched us very jealously as we went up- then down for every oother lap. SOmeone said, \"You must have paid a fortune for that room\" I told him I actually paid the normal rate, and found the hotel on the \"Budget Europe\" website! He said, \"Do you know who is in the balcony next-door to you?.....The royal family of Luxenburg!\" Wow, we did feel like royalty at that point. Aside from the tour mania, and the cool parade which preceeded it, we had the carnival going on across the street in the beautiful park- a stone's throw from the balcony. The huge lit-up ferris wheel was magical at night, and we strolled over and had a few rides from which we could see all of Paris. OH! I can't leave out the wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower from our room also!!

It was her first time to Paris and the only requirement she gave me when arranging the trip was that she wanted to stay in a hotel with a view of the eiffel tower from her window for at least one night. I searched trip advisor and came across Hotel Brighton and made contact with the hotel via their own website (Espirit or something similar). I ended up booking all five nights with Hotel Brighton because there was a discount if you booked online mon-wed. I was very specific in my communications, making sure to get the discounted rate, a twin room with a view on a higher floor. Booking with Hotel Brighton was one of the smartest travel decisions I have ever made (and I travel a lot). Here are the specifics: - The room was wonderful. Everything was clearly new and there was more than enough space for my mother and I. Three closets. W/C separate from bathroom (although the shower was hand held and very annoying). There was a lounge/couch in the entry room (salarium?). Flat screen tv (although there was a scratch across the entire screen, only a few channels worked, and there were no english channels, so we just watched music videos in the morning). The bedroom had a desk and two twin beds that were just pushed together, i think they use the room either as a king (make it as one bed) or twin (make it as two) depending what you request. I thought it was room 504, but looking through the other reviews again, it may have been 514. Noise wasn't really a problem. Our room was so high up, you only heard things when the windows were open. We received exactly what we booked/requested. The final bill charged the full rate for one night. and they gladly fixed that at check out. - The view had everything. There was a small balcony for room for two of us to stand, though you feel like you are standing on a window sill. It is quite safe. To the left is the Louvre and its pyramid and you can just make out the top of Notre Dame over it. Beneath you are the Louvre gardens and Tuillerie gardens. Across the gardens is the Musee d'Orsay and some more key landmarks. To your right is the Eiffel Tower. It feels a bit far and small, but it i would rather the view that had everything in a great location than a hotel far out of the way. The view at twilight during the first eiffel tower light shows were unbeleivable. - The staff. I had read pleasant reviews about Bernard on here, but really, he knows his stuff. He was amazing. When we walked in, he greeted us by name and in english. He always kept on top of everything. We booked a tour online before we left, however when we got to Paris and Bernard checked on it, they had no record of us. Bernard sorted the whole thing out! When we were getting picked up early in the morning, Bernard arranged a special breakfast for us. He made recommendations and was always very nice to us. He even offered us an umbrella as it started to rain. The only thing he asks of you, if you enjoy your stay, pass the word on. The rest of the staff is a little hit or miss, but it feels like Bernard is always there (and he leaves notes for the rest of them reminding them to do things). All of the front desk staff speak english and will take care of your needs, albeit occasionally reluctantly. They will book tours, sell you tickets, and make most reservations for you, but don't expect a discount. They will book whatever you want, but will push the companies they have deals with first. This can have pluses and minuses. We let them book the shuttle back to the airport with the company they have a deal with instead of the one we originally picked because they offered a better price, but the shuttle was nothing but a problem. They wanted to arrange it for 2 and a half hours before her flight, but my mother was a little nervous and instead requested pick up almost four hours before her flight. The shuttle was over a half hour late picking her up, and then made another hour's worth of stops picking up travelers before heading towards the airport. The driver dropped her off last at the airport and no where near where she had to check in and did not help her at all with her two large suitcases and two carry-ons. By the time my mother got to the huge check-in line, it was less than an hour till her flight time. In the end she was rushed through check-in and security and had to run through the airport to her gate. This was a lot of unnecessary stress. - The cost. The rate I got 155 euros I think, which went down to 138 with discount, which was more than competitive. I compared it against all of the other hotels in the area and with a view. It definitely beat them. Sure, you could get a room cheaper in another part of town, but I felt like this was a bit of luxury and i was paying for the view. I didn't expect to get a great room too! Beware of all the add-ons though. Breakfast is very pricey, get it at a cafe down the street instead. The internet is available on a computer in the lounge, but it is pricey. four or five euros for 45 minutes I think. As the hotel is finishing up renovations (we saw no sign of any) and getting quite popular, I have a feeling the price may start to rise. They have another hotel a few blocks away that already costs more, and the clientel at this hotel seemed very upscale. I occasionally felt a little out of place as my mother and I would walk through the lobby in our jeans, sneaker and windbreakers going out for a day of sightseeing. Business men and women were checking in as were very posh and sophisticated guests. But I must say that we were never treated any differently. We were always treated as if we were important guests. - The Location can't be beat.

Part of the reason for choosing the hotel was our research on TripAdvisor with the many positive reviews. I can report the that the reviews were accurate, and we were glad we chose this hotel for our time in Paris. We made the reservation online directly with the hotel, which provides a discount for booking three or more nights. The hotel also does not charge your credit card until after your stay. We booked a junior suite with a Tuilleries view, which we thought was extremely reasonably priced. We received an email confirmation, and then we called two weeks prior to arrival to confirm our room requests, including an early check-in. When we arrived directly from CDG airport around noon (after traveling overnight from Toronto), we were prepared to wait until the room was available; but we were delighted to learn that the reservaton was in order and that our room was ready. My wife and I are often picky with hotel rooms, asking to see a number of them before settling on one. In this case, we accepted the first room we were shown: the room was enormous by Parisian standards with two step-out balconies facing the garden. And yes, the view is what makes the room. There was also ample closet space, an in-room safe, and a huge bathroom with a separate soaking tub and a glass-doored shower. My wife especially enjoyed soaking in the deep tub at the end of a day after long walks throughout the city. The room was clean and tasteful, with two twin beds joined together as a double, a writing desk, a lighted vanity, and a sofa. The noise from the street is, as other guests have mentioned, noticeable. But my wife, who is a light sleeper, brought along earplugs; and she did not have trouble with the street noise. The heavy curtains also helped to keep the noise out. We thought the view was worth the street noise--and it is all that the others have said: you can step out on your balcony and take in the entire city, from the Eiffel Tower to Notre Dame. The greenery from the garden across the street is especially appealing. As far as the service of the hotel is concerned, we have only good things to report: the desk staff was helpful, especially Bernhard, and the breakfast was fine (we ate the breakfast at the hotel only on the last day, because we found it convenient before heading to the train station). Notably, the staff provided excellent advise on traveling to the train station, collected our bags, hailed a cab in the rain, and loaded our luggage. We have nothing but pleasant memories of our stay at the Hotel Brighton. The Tuilleries metro stop is nearby (featured in the recent movie, Paris, Je T'aime), and we enjoyed going to two nearby restaurants: Angelina Salon de The and Cafe Marly. Angelina's is just a few doors down, which is famous for its dark hot chocolate. It is worth the experience, even if the chocolate is over the top. We found other items on the menu were great for lunch, such as the salads and quiche. If you plan to visit the Louvre, we recommend having breakfast at Cafe Marly, an elegant cafe in easy walking distance, right under the arches of the Louvre.

Speaking of the front desk, we were treated with nothing but kindness and helpfullness there. The hotel really projects a small hotel feeling, and after a short while, it felt like they knew us. Two things to be aware of: 1) You trade an incredible location and view for a non-neighborhoody venue; i.e. you will not find a corner store on the corner. and 2) The cafes on the Rue de Rivoli mostly cater to tourists and are outrageously overpriced. My husband ordered a beer, albeit a large one, without looking at the price on the menu. Turned out to cost $27, more than my $20 chicken dinner!!!

If it is your first time in Paris I would really recommend the hop on/off bus; gives you a great overview of where everything is and how close things are. The hotel is positioned in a very posh area and it is fun to walk around the shops. We discovered a great wee restaurant a few streets away - Le Souffle at 36 rue du Mont - Thabor.

My husband and I stayed at Hotel Brighton in April 06. After reading a number of reviews prior to our visit I specifically requested room 511 (I have attached photos). Upon arrival we found a beautiful room, adequately sized (very French), and two small balconies that overlooked the Tuileries Garden and the Louvre to the left, and the Eiffel Tower to the right. We were very happy with the room, especially the view (despite the scaffolding which obstructed our view of the Eiffel Tower), and all aspects of the hotel. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Prior to arriving, I emailed the hotel to request they organise all our dinner and lunch reservations (i.e. Moulin Rouge, Jules Verne Restaurant, Bateaux Parisiens - the dinner cruise on the River Seine in a glass top boat; all the touristy things for first time visitors.). The staff were very helpful and easy to communicate with (considering I speak no French). They had no problems carrying out my requests and our reservations were perfect. My only complaint would be that the breakfast wasn't so great, however there are plenty of alternatives close by, and why wouldn't you want to try them all! Best points: 1. Great location - so central, we walked everywhere. 2. Fantastic views - I cannot believe how great the views were.

We especially enjoyed the French onion soup--though while I would strongly recommend this place for a long leisurely lunch, I wouldn't recommend for breakfast (omlets weren't great and the entire breakfast was quite pricey at about 50 euro). We found the location of the hotel to be perfect for shopping in the area (many wonderful boutinques) and for walking to the Champs, Eiffel Tower, and Arc. We found a restaurant just past the Arc called La Grand Armee (on Ave De La Grand Armee) that we really enjoyed--a very large terrace that attracted Parisians rather than the tourist crowd.

We just think that although the Hotel Brighton was nice it just wasn't worth the price.", "Date": "September 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay at the Brighton!!!\u201d", "Author": "Manda B", "ReviewID": "UR3655466", "Content": "My husband and I, and my family, stayed in the Brighton Hotel after reading all the fantastic reviews on tripadvisor.com. I can honestly say I am baffled by this hotels high scores and glowing reviews. We stayed there for 5 nights and were extremely upset arriving at this dump of a hotel. Lift was tiny and totally out of the way. We walked down three long corridors to get to our room (on the other side of the hotel), all of which had the carpet literally peeling away with boards exposed, which felt like walking through an old haunted mansion the boards wobbled so much. We thought we were going to fall through to the level below! The staff, apart from one man (I assume was the boss) were pathetic. Especially at night. One red headed man was so rude and useless we were furious with him the entire time we were there. I've never come across a less helpful and totally rude receptionist. He was useless. The location was handy, but not good. VERY noisy. Don't stay here if you have a car. We were told by the useless receptionist there was parking just around the corner - we ended up parking about 4 blocks away. I could go on with the examples. The whole stay was just awful. Over all I would most definitely NOT recommend this hotel. It was the worst one I have stayed in in all of Europe. Unless they have gutted it it should have been pulled down long ago (and my families room was just as bad, so it wasn't only our floor or our room). If you're happy to use the public transport in Paris (which is easy) then I would stay at Les J'ardins D'Eiffel (unsure of spelling). I stayed there a few years ago. It's a lovely hotel, lovely staff (who also speak English and are handy with directions and suggestions), view of Eiffel Tower from the breakfast room and some bedrooms and delicious breakfasts, great splendid location down a little Parisian alley way a short walk from the Seine and Eiffel Tower.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "WA, USA", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back!\u201d", "Author": "DesAlpes", "ReviewID": "UR3646351", "Content": "We had a great stay at the Hotel Brighton for four nights in June and we'll definitely be back. We had a renovated room, but a friend of ours was there at the same time and had an older room but was perfectly happy with it, too. Although breakfast is available in the hotel I can't imagine why one would have that instead of getting out into the streets of Paris. There is a cafe next door on the corner where we had coffee and croissants every morning and watched Paris go by on the street and sidewalks. The staff were very helpful and friendly. I can't remember any names but every single member bent over backwards to help us and they were very patient with my broken French. My companions spoke no French, but that wasn't a problem. Regarding the small elevator. We used the tiny one quite a bit and found it quite cute. But don't think that's all there is. There's a bigger one that will hold several people and their luggage just a few feet away. While the neighborhood isn't the most charming in Paris (nothing wrong with it, just no much charm) it IS very conveniently located. We were within walking distance of so many places, but with the Tuileries Metro station, on the #1 line, just across the street, we could quickly and easily get to anyplace we wanted to go. And Paris Vision is only about four doors down so if you are inclined to do anything with them it is quite convenient. We'll be stopping in Paris for a few days next year at the beginning of a month-long stay in France and I'm pretty sure we'll be staying at the Brighton.", "Date": "July 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLiked it a lot, once we got a good room!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3548530", "Content": "Our first room was on the mezzanine level (level E), just above the reception. When we entered the room stank of air freshener. It looked out onto the very busy street UNDER the arches outside , so it was very dark and had NO view. And it needed double windows to keep out the traffic noise - we like to sleep with a window open, but this would have been impossible. Having established we were not having a \"moment\" we went down to reception armed with our email requesting a quiet room. Within 5 minutes, we had been reallocated to a renovated room overlooking the courtyard - the room was large, well lit and well ventilated - in fact it seemed like a room of a higher standard. We were very pleased but wondered why we had been assigned to the noisy and dark room initially - maybe because we were two men travelling together. I suggest you confirm that you are getting a quiet room at the back OR a noisy room at the front of the hotel with a view and avoid the mezzanine level.

The room was huge, made by combining two original rooms. The bath was bigger than our home's, with both a tub and a walk-in shower. It appeared to be recently remodelled.
