The hotel seems to have recently been refurbished and the rooms were generally pretty nice and very clean. We had a nice balcony overlooking the sea which was a real treat. Although the town was quiet this time of year since it is basically a beach resort area, the hotel was pretty full with tour groups. The groups ranged in age and the hotel didnt seem overly loud or chaotic with the groups. There is a small bar, a nice restaurant, and nice areas on the beach. There's really very little within walking distance but since we were with a group that was no problem. It's about a 45 minute drive into central Rome which may be somewhat of a hassle although there are trains that go into town that stop nearby.", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Pino Al Mare", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d654425-Reviews-Hotel_Pino_Al_Mare-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Lungomare Pirgy, 32</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">S.
