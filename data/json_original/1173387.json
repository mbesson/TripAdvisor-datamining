This hotel is shocking to say the least. We went for Christmas and were appalled. DON'T GO!We booked a superior room with garden view - didn't get either - the Manager told us he doesn't have any garden so can't offer a garden view. The hotel is NOT on the beach - you have to walk down a road, across a garden full of chickens and up a slope to get to the seaweed strewn beach. The catamaran and pedallos offered in the package are ALL broken. The catamaran (only 1!) has no sails and has a hole in the front. The pedaloes have no seats but the metal bars which held the back rests in dig in your skin if you try to brave it. People (including my husband) are offered prostuition and drugs regularly here.The food is inedible, cold and covered with flies. As the food area is outside, cats have been seen licking the plates put out the previous night for breakfast the following morning. My mother was taken into hospital with an intestine infection - whilst we were there, another guest of the same hotel was in for the same thing!The children's play area doesn't exist. In any shape or form. Nightly entertainment was kareoke or bingo. That's it! The alcohol is served in miniscule plastic cups and is watered down. As a rule, I don't drink at all but even there, after 4 spirit drinks, i couldn't get even half drunk. The bar even ran out of vodka amongst others or more than 5 days!The restaurant (if you can call it that) had no tea bags for over 5 days - we had to go to the local shop to buy some. This is NOT all inclusive. Not by any stretch of the imagination. Finally, the raw sewage which ran across the pathway by the exclusive restuarant and reception and outside the pool area was offensive to say the least.Don't do it! We had 3 different rooms - all as bad as each other and none of them the one I had booked (superior and garden view). In the last, my mum had no bedding for 3 days, and we had water run from the ceiling for 4 days despite complaints every day to the rep, to the hotel and to the Manager himself. All to no avail.We also had cochroaches on the balcony and outside our door. There was NOTHING good about this hotel. EVERYONE complained - German, French, Chinese, American's, English, Canadian's, Polish. Everyone. All to no avail unless you wanted to pay \u62e2900 to move hotels. The Director of the hotel came in the last 2 days and admitted to another guest that the photos and the details on the internet were mistakenly of the hotel next door!I have video and photographic proof of all of these claims.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR672257679", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "ArnieDevon"}, {"Content": "boot camp!!!! we have just returned from all inclusive stay at tropical clubs bavaro. well what can i say even the taxi driver on the way from the airport didnt know where it was!! As we arrived a man was singing about leaving!!!Our room for 2 adults 2 children aged 10 and 5 consisted of 2 double beds in same tiny room with 2 bath towels between us.The shower was always cold after a few days i had to really psych my self up 4 yet another cold shower. Towels were changed if you put them outside your door or caught the maid gave her a gift then she would give you some. Our bedding was changed twice in whole week.The bathroom wasnt cleaned during our stay. The fridge had 2 small bottles of water between 4.You are given your tags as you arrive RED or BLUE which permitt you to eat and swim in various areas. if you have children you are not allowed to upgrade to red altho different rules for different people apply. we were blue bands.The tv was a god send it had a load of channels on which was good because there was limited entertainment at night trip to casino children wernt allowed and the all inclusive hotel bar closed so we retired to bed most nights at 8.30 ( we are on holiday) beach party started at 9.30 again hotel bar was closed so had to treck just a few mins down the road 4 a drink or go to bed as usual.Carlos and his gang tryed his best to engage people at various points during the day in pool aerobics!! bar staff were very pleasent and friendly. nothing for children 2 do except play in pool but we kept them away from the baby shallow pool as there was a little tykes slide which was cracked if a child went down that they would cut them selves badly hence kids played in deep water all week hence i was on pins.The food granted we were on holiday in a foriegn country but...pig in sauce, rice and kidney beans any meat eg pork was pink chicken pink beef burgers pink. we lived on eggs for breakfast as there was a really nice chef cooking omlettes fresh and bread and butter all week. The rest of it was not edible when reported to the rep he just shrugged his shoulders and said the kitchen had been told. oh yeah all food is cold.Choice of resturants lol you have to book the mickey mouse mexican!! there are enough tables for 20 people the food is just as bad as the main resturant and once its gone its gone.Drinks my partner drank rum and coke all day one day sober the kids were high on sugary slushes and the water came from a big bottle to which u had to refill your fridge bottles. you couldnt use the water to drink so hence by end of the week filling the same 2 bottles everyone was drinking from it all became minging.over all i am am very disapointed with this holiday i expected 3* plus i know its a poor country but i dread to think what the lower grades of hotel are in this country.I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone unless you are prepared to rough it all week its certainly not child friendly. i was pleased to get out of the place due to restricted hygiene we all came back with water infections.The mosquitos: sprays,bands and lemon shower gel and still got bitten.", "Date": "Jan 1, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR472520628", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "staffordshiredot"}, {"Content": "Had a great time....shame about the people!       2nd pool", "Date": "Dec 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR260067409", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Well_travelled015"}, {"Content": "could be better just got back from this hotel and this is ny account of the hotel and area the rooms were quite big with two double beds, shower, fridge, aircon and a saftey deposit box wich was $15 a week the towells were changed daily if you wanted and the beds every three days.FOOD. for the first ten days i thought the food was ok but no better and the last four days poor, it was usually chicken pork and salads with a little bit of fish one night the bread is left on the shelf all day and eaten by the birds please take care if you eat it,there was another restraunt for the people who upgraded but they nealy all ate in the same restraunt as us saying there was cats all over in theres.DRINKS. the drinks were large measures but were wated down every barman barwoman told us this and showed us how every new botle had been opened before they got itPOOLS.

The hotel rooms were clean but basic, the food basic but edible and the entertainment ok but not outstanding. What made the whole holiday were the people. Both the people we met at the hotel and the hotel staff. Francisco the bar man was a particular favourit of us all! The Dominican people love the English even though the men are a bit full on! We almost wet our pants when we walked past someone carrying a submachine gun on the way to the shops, but apparently it was a security gaurd and perfectly ok. I would suggest not roaming down to the supermarket in the evening but to go in the morning instead. At first glance me and my sister were a bit nervous about the area but i think you are ok as long as you stay in groups, stick with the hotel staff if you go out to the Mangoo club in the evening and just generaly use your nouce. You wouldnt wander the streets of London on your own late at night, so don't do it here either. We were upgraded from the basic rooms due to the hotel being so quiet, and in doing so became really friendly with the other guests. This is what made our holiday. I would say the hotels best point are the staff, and the worste is the food.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR179652374", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Katie_TBuryStEdmunds"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147293-d1173387-r23389916-Tropical_Clubs_Bavaro-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html", "HotelID": "1173387", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
