I have to say what tipped the balance was that I had to read 4 pages of reviews before reading any criticisms and even then I found them constructive and I have to say we were very happy with the choice. Generally speaking if there is any criticism its about actually getting to the hotel. If you are going by car, as we did, you really need GPS. The last 2 kilometres from the B-10/Rondo literal bypass exit was very hectic. The traffic is one-way so if you miss the turning to loop back round to approach the hotel you will find yourself heading along the Ave Diagonal into the city centre if you are not careful. Anyway we got there in the end. Now onto the hotel itself. The hotel is 4* and merits them 1- The reception staff were professional AND friendly, plus they even asked us our choice of bed (Big or Twins?) so 01st Brownie point 2- The rooms were big, with A/C, stylish - we liked the design - complete with courtesy products and literature and were clean...plus the mini-bar was full and not with the usual courtesy bottle of water, so 02nd brownie point 3- The beds were nice and big, a bit hard after a days driving but thats no big deal 4- The bathroom was spacious and well equipped (the only minus point was the glass partition between the shower and the wash basin was a bit too small, plus the bottom of the bath tub was slippery) 5- Breakfast was nice , complete with Spanish /regional specialties, but at 18euros if booking with special rates don't forget to include breakfast, its worth it. 6- Other restaurant. Had evening drinks and Tapas, which the wife and daughter loved. = Conclusion. Overall evaluation is very good and would definitely go there again. Next time if we go by car we know how to get there, and once there we will definitely use the Public transport system to get around the city, there's a Metro and Tram stop not far away at \"Selva de Mar\" and we do advise visitors to use it, its easy, clean and safe, as safe as any Metro system in the world can be, but be street wise. Final word. Even if you don't speak Spanish the Hotel staff speak English but at least learn how to say \"Please\" & \"thank you\" in Spanish and SMILE you'll appreciate it in return!", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ka T", "ReviewID": "UR124744995", "Content": "This hotel is not too close to the center, but metro is not far from hotel.

I'm always nervous when hotels get some terrible ratings, but I'm glad we booked here anyway. As others have said, it is not central, but it is 2 mins from the metro which is cheap and quick.

I'm not sure we would have seen these areas had we been in a more central hotel so I felt being further out was a bonus (and cheaper). If you walk towards the Hilton hotel there is a huge shopping centre with lots of (chain) eateries and a supermarket.

There is also a supermarket a couple of blocks in this direction from the hotel. The room was great. We were pleased to have a fridge in the room. When we arrived they offered us breakfast for the week at a rate of 6 Euros a day if we paid for the whole week. Can't comment on breakfast, we took advantage of the fridge and just stocked up on crossaints, yoghurt & fruit. The bed was lovely, a queen size and comfortable. The bathroom was gorgeous, modern frosted glass, great shower, bidot and bath. The rooms were kept really clean. We ate in the restaurant once and had their set evening menu. It was good value, but some courses were better than others. The pork and cheese starter were good. The veal burger and mushroom pasta less so. The waitress was fantastic though, she appeared to speak at least 4 languages and she made us feel really welcome. I understand why some people have commented on the reception staff, they weren't the warmest I'd met, but I didn't find them rude at all. We had some problems with our key cards, but it only takes a minute to reactivate them. My only criticism was that there wasn't a pool.

THAT'S how strongly I feel about warning you about this hotel. We got a great package deal through one of the major booking websites - there were many hotel choices and since we are not picky travelers AT ALL...we went for one of the less expensive options. Doing it again I would have GLADLY spent more for a different hotel. I'll cover for what us, are the most important factors in deciding where to stay. Again, please realize, we are NOT \"snooty\" travelers. We often backpack, stay in hostels, on couches etc... You will never hear me complain about smudges on mirrors, towels that aren't soft enough etc. Even room size - I don't care about that because we are never there except to sleep. Which brings me to why I feel so strongly about this place. THE BED. We didn't sleep. We stayed six nights and never got more than 3 hours of sleep at a time. The bed was SO HARD. Even more terrible than a hard bed - you can feel each and every giant metal spring in the mattress and when you or your partner move around THE SPRINGS MAKE NOISE. Like, noises similar to the beating of a little drum. I'm not exaggerating. At one point I went to sleep in the bathtub but had to get out because the shower leaked. We are young, in shape and ALWAYS sleep SOUNDLY on vacation. We woke up aching, in pain and exhausted. The bed and quality of sleep single-handedly just about ruined our vacation. IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THIS - PICK A DIFFERENT PLACE TO STAY. YOU WILL NOT SLEEP, I PROMISE PROMISE PROMISE YOU! Other than that... this place had other negative things going for it. The desk staff was pretty rude. Whatever, not a big deal - we never talk to them. There are no late night (or any other time of day for that matter) eateries in the area. There isn't much at all in the area - it's pretty empty, the economy has hit this area pretty hard - most things are closed down and covered in graffiti. The food at the hotel is so expensive, there is no way we would even consider eating it. It's on the outskirts of the city center - there is nothing fun/exciting/\"Barcelona\" in the area. The only positives; Close to the subway - about a five minute walk. A mall down the street which contains a giant grocery store Mini fridge in the room in which to store our grocery store food. The beach is only about 3 blocks away which made for a nice walk along the water into the city center. When we checked in I saw the \"normal\" rates they charge to stay there. You have got to be out of your freakin mind to pay full price at this place. I couldn't believe my eyes. If we hadn't received a great package deal I would have never booked this place. Even still - I would have GLADLY paid more for a better place to stay. Considering the only positive things this place has going for it - you will see right away that those things can be found AT A PLETHORA OF OTHER HOTELS.

Although the location is definitely not city centre, there is a metro station and a tram stop less than 200 metres away. Travelling time to the city centre is about 10-15 minutes and so this is not a problem. The beach is about 500 metres away which is also a big plus. The rooms are clean, the fit out is modern and the receptionists are quite friendly and so first impressions were quite good on the whole. The Rest But the little things matter and this is where the hotel falls down. Arriving for a conference the following morning, the hotel does not provide an iron. There is a laundry service apparently but only at certain times of the day and the receptionist was not clear at all on the details and was very sceptical that anything could be laundered within 24 hours if at all. Everything shuts after 11pm, including room service. Even the front door is locked around midnight and you might have to knock to gain entry if the receptionist isn't paying attention. There was no kettle in the room, so even a simple cup of tea is impossible after 11pm and given that this is primarily a residential area there are no real options available in the vicinity either. There is no gym or pool and the terrace is definitely a pleasure reserved solely for the underprivileged. Conclusion I have an impression that this is primarily a tourist hotel aimed at the low to mid-budget market - long weekending accountants from the UK and that sort of thing and the attire and palour of the guests reflected it. In fact, in some ways the hotel is like a Premier Inn or Travelodge which isn't a bad thing at all but it is hardly worthy of 4 stars.

First impressions were excellent. I arrived late (~10:00pm) on a Sunday evening and immediately thought that the hotel looked good. Room was very modern, superbly clean, etc. The problem came when I looked for an iron. There was none - no coffee making facilities either but there was a well stocked mini-bar. So I went down to reception and asked for an iron. They didn\u2019t have one. Get this - the only way to iron a shirt in this 4* hotel is to put it in the laundry \u2013 for this they charge you 5 euro (or 7.50 euro for the express service if you need it turned around quickly). The receptionist couldn\u2019t understand why I thought that not being able to iron a shirt in a 4* hotel was \u2018poor\u2019 when our conversation was cut short because a lady in her 50s ran in having just had her handbag snatched outside! I ran out with her (the concierge wandered out as well) only to see a guy getting into a car about 100 yds down the road. So she lost her passport, money, mobile phone, etc. Not a great introduction to the hotel. So, onto the facts. I\u2019d happily recommend the hotel to those needing somewhere close to the convention center. It\u2019s a modern hotel and everything works. My room was a good size and comfortable. The bath is full size which is a real luxury in hotels these days. The area is not \u2018bad\u2019. I guess bag snatching happens in all cities everywhere \u2013 especially late on Sunday evenings in deserted streets. I guess they target the tourist/conference areas. One person I was discussing the incident with last had her bag snatched in London. That said, the hotel is not as noise free as I\u2019d like. I could hear the wake-up call next door every morning (about an hour before I wanted to wake up) and a baby screaming at 5:00am seemed like it was in the same room. The internet works (7 euro for 1 hr and 17 euro for 24 hrs) but seems slooow \u2013 I suppose it is broadband, Jim \u2013 but not as we know it. The hotel does not appear to have a gym or other such facilities. The hotel is convenient for the conference center (10 mins) walk and is a couple of minutes from a large shopping center (Diagonal Mar \u2013 which you can walk through to get to the conference center as it\u2019s across the road) which has countless bars/food outlets, etc. I didn\u2019t use any of the hotel\u2019s facilities. Breakfast was listed at 15 euros in the hotel and there was a Starbucks 2 mins down the road in the shopping center! I put my shirts for ironing in at 9:00am the next day and did get the express service one back within the hour. So I suppose I have to conclude that the service was good! Luckily I didn\u2019t need it until midday. But, be warned, if you have a 9:00am meeting its crinkly shirt time.

Like a recent review, I found the location of the hotel really surprising. It literally is like being in the ghetto. If you want the closest beach (which was closed due to construction work - well it was November!!!) that was a good 20 minute walk away. When it comes to the area late at night it was pretty seedy however didn't encounter any problems myself. Rooms: I was on the first floor and from seeing the pictures on this site was expecting to see a swish and cool decor. To be honest it was tired and unkept. I booked my hotel via the conference travel service and was sure it said free wifi however they where charging 9 euros an hour and the reception was poor. I ended up walking down to the local shopping centre and getting a network cable and using that instead as wired internet was free. The safe wasn't big enough for my laptop which I thought was odd for a business hotel as other ones I've stayed at like one recently in Brussels had safes designed for them. I ended up having to do something with a kensington lock, a suitcase and a wardrobe:) On arrival I thought I would get room service and ordered a ham and cheese baguette. The baguette was so tough it felt like it was going to cut my gums!!! Apart from that there was barely any filling so was not impressed.... I gave room service a miss after that. The hotel: I'm sure the owners of the hotel thought they had something really cool with their \"starck like\" style however its done to such a poor quality it just looks more naff than starck. The japanese garden was literally some grass, tables and chairs, some rasied planting areas that contained just bark??? Oh and some wooden posts.... The bar was big but empty. It looks like it should be a swanky cocktail bar but it didnt quite carry it off. I've been to better empty cocktail bars that have more character than this one. Breakfast was the usual European affair of something from everyone. Hopeing to get a nice English breakfast unfortunately the bacon was like chewing on slithers of leather, the eggs where soggy and well everything else was just poor. In my stay I unfortunately joined the enormous number of visitors to Barcelona who was pick pocketed (as did two other conference delegates I was out with that night). This was despite the fact my wallet was in the front pocket of my jeans.... As frustrating as it was for me those Catalans seem to have thieving down to an art!!!! When I got back to the hotel, the reception staff gave me a new key and opened my safe for me (the safe is controlled using your own credit/debit card) I couldn't get through to one of the numbers to cancel one of my cards due to a block on that number prefix not being allowed so they had to patch my call through. Not so much of a problem apart from the fact it took me a good five minutes to explain this to the staff as their English is about as good as my Catalan. Next day I spoke to the hotel about what do do about paying for my bill since the card I'd used to pay the deposit had now been blocked. For some reason they thought this would still be okay however looking back something was lost in translation there. Come check out day, you've guessed it \"Can I have your card please?\", \"Sorry its been stolen. I spoke to your colleague?\" , \"You must have a card here to check out\", \"But I don't have one\".... This went round and round for a few minutes and ended up waking my partner at five in the morning to ask her to give them their card details. For some reason thats no good though as they needed confirmation the card details could be used in writing by the card holder???? ARRRRGGGGHHHH. Eventually the lady at the desk agreed to accept an email of confirmation so half an hour later it was sorted out..... Summary: My biggest gripe about the hotel has to be how unhelpful the staff where when it came to having my wallet stolen and checking out. Lost in transalation is an under statement, the staff had no idea what I was saying and despite speakiing perfectly clear English, and this being a \"business hotel\" most of the time it seemed to take ages to get across what I was trying to say. Summing up in one line though, this hotel is unlikely to be the swish, cool place you expect it to be. If you are going to Barcelona on holiday I would suggest staying somewhere more central, there is nothing to see that far out . If you are going for business, you could do better than this. if you are going for a conference at the CCIB you will be much better off with the Barcelona Princess which is opposite the conference centre, or staying in the centre.", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire UK", "Title": "\u201cGood 4 Star\u201d", "Author": "GollMall", "ReviewID": "UR6457582", "Content": "We stayed here at the end of November 2006 for a short 3 night break.

Generally any visit to reception will take a while. There will be a lot of standing with the phone to an ear in silence....Eyes will not be raised from the paperwork being examined until an uncomfortable amount of time has passed. If the phone rings at any point expect that enquiry to be dealt with first! Despite the fact I had booked a double room and then followed up my booking with an email direct to the hotel to make sure I received a double room.....guess what! Twin beds!! I went straight back to reception and a nice guy (Claudio, I think) was apologetic but as the hotel was fully booked I was told i'd be moved the next day. I could live with this although it was disappointingly predictable. Unfortunately when I went back the next day the man I spoke to was sooo rude!! He indicated sneeringly (with a shrug) that I had booked a double and that just means two people to them - they just allocate a room with two beds, whatever is available!! I had to explain in a busy reception that that was not acceptable and that I had the choice of a twin or a double room in a number of hotels but I picked a double in theirs. We got changed. Next prob - Sound proofing!! Between rooms its fine but the doors to the corridor appear to be paper thin! A couple of times at night I actually got a fright because the voices in the corridor seemed so close!! I too was woken by the same noisy party people coming home as the previous poster! And whats with all the door slamming at all times of day and night!! Despite these things I would definitely stay again. It's a great-looking hotel and the rooms are clean and comfortable (our maid was excellent) Bathroom is nice and the shower is fan-tastic, me and my boyfriend are feeling a bit hard done by in our shower at home now!! The location is great - round the corner from the metro (altho the streets being dug up at the mo) and its about a 10 minute walk to the beach (our main reason for picking it). Its only 4 stops to the Olympic village area with loads of restaurants but I would recommend staying on the 8 stops to Passeig de Gracia - which is a really nice wide street good for a wander day and night. This is the street with the Gaudi buildings Casa Mila and Casa Batllo and these are a must see but its also a much nicer area than Las Ramblas at night. Las Ramblas....lets be honest.... is a dump. It has cafes and it has newsagent stands in abundance....and thats it. Some street performers/living statues are pretty cool and there are some interesting side streets off it but Las Ramblas itself is nothing to see. That said - The fruit market off it has some amazing prices for amazing delicious fruit - maybe I'm being a bit harsh. The area around the hotel seemed safe and is mostly residential. There are some amazing modern apartment buildings around. Its a block away from a nice modern shopping centre with many options for breakfast, lunch and dinner(if need be) as well as some great shops. Also a fab supermarket for snacks/drinks for the beach....The supermarket is the only place we got a smile or a please or thankyou with the service! Anyway...back to the hotel....In summary, I completely agree with the previous poster - it's a stylish, clean and comfortable hotel in a convenient location. The rating I have given it is based on the location and the overall feel of the room. Ps. Taxi drivers generally didnt know the hotel. Taking a piece of paper with the address on it out with you might be a good idea. A spanish pal gave me a useful phrase which you pronounce - 'Ah laddo day' meaning 'beside/next to' so when I got a taxi driver who didnt know I said 'Ah laddo day Diagonal Mar' which is the name of the shopping centre it's next to.

It's a great-looking hotel - very modern and minimalist design throughout. The rooms are very clean and comfortable (air con is great - we found it a life-saver!), bathroom is very big compared to the size of the room itself. All the staff spoke excellent English. The location is great - as most people have said in other reviews, it's a minute's walk from the nearest metro station. There's also a tram stop very nearby which also takes you to Port Olympico - you get a nice cruise down the Avenue Diagonal and a great view of Torre Agbar. You can use your T-10 or T-dia ticket on the trams. This tram also takes you directly to the entrance of the zoo (which is well worth a visit). The area is very safe as it's mostly residential. If you don't want to pay 15 Euros for breakfast - you can get coffee and pastries for 2 for about 5 Euros at the fnac cafe in the shopping mall down the road. Also, if you're on a budget - you can get dinner/lunches very cheaply in one of the food court restuarants - not very cultural but it is cheaper!! You're also really close to the Poblenou area, a new up-and-coming-area, where there are lots of great cafes and restuarants. It feels like \"real\" Barcelona i.e. it's where Barcelonese go to hang out. In summary, you can't fault the location for ease of getting to the city centre, safety and the convenience of local amenities. So that's all the good stuff - so here's the negative.... One review mentioned the noise - and we found that to be a real problem. The first 3 nights, we were woken up at 2-3 am by some party animals arriving back. We could also hear people entering their rooms not just next door but a couple of rooms down!! So I would say that if you're in Barcelona for the nightlife, have some consideration when you return and if you're an early bird, bring some ear plugs!! Another review mentioned that their \"double\" room consisted of two single beds pushed together. We had the same \"double\" room arrangement which was not ideal - they didn't even make up the bed as a double! We also had a problem with room service - first of all, we couldn't find the phone number, any phone numbers in fact! So I had to go down to reception to ask for the number. When I called Room Service, I was asked to call back in 10 minutes because the kitchen was closed - couldn't they have taken my order then, for the sake of 10 minutes? Anyway, finally ordered and was told that it would arrive in 20 minutes. A whole 45 minutes later, it arrived!! When it was delivered - it seemed that we should have been more patient because the waitress had another five meals to deliver! Also, when I went down to the outside bar area around mid-afternoon one day, hoping for a drink of some sort, I couldn't find anybody to ask for one - there was no-one at the bar and I couldn't get the attention of the staff in the adjacent restaurant. I got the feeling that they felt the bar was nothing to do with them and so left me to it. I gave up after a while. I called this review \"Style over content\" - and it's because although the hotel looks very smart and stylish, we felt that the service didn't meet up to image. Now you may think that we're being harsh for the sake of room service and not being able to order a drink, but in a 4-star hotel - you do expect a certain level of service and we felt that we didn't get it in this hotel. I think that if they put less effort into how it looks and more into the service, it would greatly improve the whole experience. Also, our criticisms are based on a stay that is probably a lot longer than most guests so we had more time to \"test\" the service. I also think the hotel is geared towards short visits and business visitors rather than longer stays like ours - which may be why we haven't been as enamoured with it as other guests. In summary - it's a stylish, clean and comfortable hotel in a very convenient location.

Diagaonal Mar is full of newly designed buildings and appears to be an up and coming area. Some may consider it a bit sterile but you have Barca centre for the feel and bustle of the old town. Yes you have to get the metro (efficient/clean) into town but that's all part of the experience. Hotel was minimalist,clean and functional with helpful staff. We had room 418 which overlooked a communial area in front of the hotel which consisted of a small football pitch, table tennis tables etc. No noise from children etc. Our room also had good lighting, shower and toiletries. Beds were really comfy, all very nicely designed. Shopping centre a few mins away is worth a wonder (Zara, huge supermarket, perfume shops, eateries (Dunkin Donuts, Ben & Jerrys etc). Better to vist the real thing - Mango restaurant right outside the complex. Menu del dia - 8 euros! (gnocchi in pesto sauce, fish cutlets with a mixed salad, individual tarte tartin and a 1/4 litre of wine) Superb value and service. That's around \u00a36, much less than 2 Big Mac meals! Many other places similar, no wonder why the spanish eat out more than other europeans. Why can't we do this in England? I would hire some bikes to wander around the sea front and other communal areas, they are well designed and marked out - running tracks, fitness trails, sports centre near by. You can walk/cycle directly to port Vell from the hotel (40 mins walk) and just catch the metro back. If you have kids they can climb various contraptions on the beach. Worth popping into the Hotel Arts (massive copper fish sculpture outside) just to see how the other half live. Wander around the pool area, all very swish. Make sure you look smart as not to attract too much attention from all the Armani clad staff. I did check the room price and was told they start at \u00a3350 per night! Vincci Maratimo breakfast was excellent (15 euros), fresh juices, pastries, eggs, bacon, sausages, good rolls, so approx \u00a370 for 2 which is superb value for a 4 star hotel. If you want to skip breakfast just copy the locals and pop into any bars for excellent coffee, pastries, tortilla etc, around 3-4 euros each! Hotel bar reasonably priced with comfy seats and sofas, welcomed after being on your feet all day. Free PC internet access as well! Must also recommend La Fonda restaurant c/dels escudellers) at the sea end of Rambla. Again the set menu 9 euros (e.g. chick pea/spinach soup, fried fish and veg, house flan, and wine/coffee) always packed with locals. Been there 5 times never hard a bad experience. We'll pop back again in the summer.Just ENJOY Barcelona but remember to keep you bags/wallets safe!", "Date": "March 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "bubblelush1", "ReviewID": "UR4583281", "Content": "An excellent hotel which we would highly recommend.

Starting with the positive, it has a good location, is close to the metro and cheap and painless to get into the city centre. The rooms are exactly as shown in the photos - cool and trendy. The reality however, is that the modern, minimalist look does make the rooms a little stark and unwelcoming. My real gripe though, is with the hotel facilities. In every hotel I have ever stayed in, from a 2 to 5 star, I have always had the use of an iron and ironing board. Not at the Vinnci Maritimo! 'It is not a service we offer' said the Duty Manager when I complained. If we wanted our clothes ironed, we would have to pay housekeeping to iron them for us. This would take 24 hours for them to do. Considering we were only staying for two nights, this was far from ideal. The staff were disinterested and unhelpful regarding our complaint and as a result we cancelled our second night's stay and moved five minutes down the road to the four star Barcelona Princess. What a difference! Fabulous rooms that have to be seen to be believed, free mini bar, heated roof top pool, friendly, helpful staff, two minutes to the metro and cheaper than the Maritimo! On balance the Princess is probably the best hotel I have stayed in. I am just disappointed I did not book the Princess originally and save myself the stress and inconvenience brought about by our short stay at the Maritimo!", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cGreat time in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "JollyHollidayer", "ReviewID": "UR3559033", "Content": "If you don't mind staying out of town, then this is the hotel for you.

On the negative side: The hotel staff was cool at best and we had problems getting clean towels each day. The hotel advertises that it has contour pillows and even has a card in the room saying so, yet when I requested one I was told by the person at the front desk in a very arrogant manner that \"contour pillows aren't available at this hotel, madame.\" The buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant is adequate, but don't have dinner there.

I don't think the 3 muggers were expecting to be chased and confronted by a large aggressive Yorkshireman but it did the trick. The incident was compounded further by the hotel's lack of interest in our well-being and refusal to call the police.
