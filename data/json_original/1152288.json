The modern fireplace seems to always be lit. As the city can be rainy, I felt this feature added a warm ambiance to the room. The front desk staff was impeccably \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Four Seasons.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you have not stayed at a Four Season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel before, you must just for the guest experience. Staff members are undoubtedly the most professionally gracious I have come across in my travels. While sitting in the lobby one day, I had more than one person (without knowledge that I am a travel writer) ask what they could help me with in such a way that I felt I was the most important guest in the hotel. LOCATION The hotel sits on a prime spot, honestly near everything. The famous Pike Place Market is a five minute walk away. Here you can watch the throwing of the fish, eat at the incredible Place Pigalle, shop for anything, and admire rows and rows of mammoth fresh flowers. The Four Seasons Seattle is also near five museums, making it ideal as a central point for those visiting for the bright art scene here. Of particular interest to me and my husband during our visit was the Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame. No doubt you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recognize the bizarre multi-hued metal building. The exhibits inside actually rock. ROOMS The accommodations are designed in signature Four Seasons neutral tones, allowing the art to take center stage. The art and artists of this hotel are a expressly talented motley group, all originating from the Northwest. The art of Francis Celentano, Kenneth Callahan, Morris Graves, Carl and Hilda Morris, Ambrose Patterson, Mary Randlett and many more grace the private and main rooms of the hotel. SPA The spa d\u00c3\u00a9cor, also designed by BraytonHughes, is a modern interpretation of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural elements of the Puget Sound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Great care was taken to incorporate an organic serenity into the spa experience here. The spa beds are especially comfortable and use the softest bedding I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in a spa. DINING The head chef of ART Restaurant follows a Best Source philosophy by hand-picking ingredients from the Pike Place Market and other Seattle sources. The dishes are inspired by the Pacific Northwest and take pride in presenting an amazing array of the highest quality seafood choices available. The menu here tends to change in keeping with this philosophy, so a new favorite entr\u00c3\u00a9e is likely from visit to visit. MY RECOMMENDATION This is a beautiful hotel grounded in grace, service and culture. I recommend booking your stay now.

The fitness center has pretty new equipment but not much choice. Nice views of the water from the treadmill. Pool was closed, outside only and pretty small.

It's a very beautiful hotel and has wonderful staff. While some of the clientele seem to be stuffy I have always found the staff to be warm and friendly. The doormen get to know you and everyone seems to love working there. I will start with the location. The hotel is located right across from where the Pike Place Market starts. A quick walk out the front door and you are walking into the south end of the marketplace. Pike Brewery is not far inside the doors and they have some wonderful beers. If the market isn't your thing then you are only a few blocks from pretty much any type of store you could want. The Seattle Art Museum is also across the street and walking to the stadium for a Seahawks or Mariners game is quite doable. The Puget Sound is about a block to the west, and the hotel sits up above it all, so the views from the restaurant and bar (and if you are lucky, your room) are pretty spectacular. I have spent a lot of time at this hotel and with it's great location you are close to pretty much everything. Now on to the rooms. Being a Four Seasons the rooms are very comfortable. Depending on the size you are looking for you will find two double beds (not very large for two people to sleep in each) all the way up to huge king beds. The bedding is extremely comfortable. The tv's are all decent sized flatscreens as well as the bathroom has one built into the mirror. All of the rooms I have stayed in have had both a large tub and a separate glassed in shower. The toilet is also in it's own glassed in room. Some rooms have a separate living room too. There is a mini bar as well as a safe, etc. I have never had any issues with a room at this hotel. The hotel has a restaurant called Art. Being the Four Seasons the prices are pretty high, but they do pamper you, so the food (and the view) are worth it. There is a bar connected to the restaurant as well, with the same spectacular views (not sure if the bar has it's own name or not). They have different specials in the bar (cheese, chocolate, etc) in the evenings and a lot of people seem to like coming in for those specials. I'm not sure if the specials are bar only or if you can get them in the restaurant too, but I would assume you can get them at both places. There is a business center with a computer and printer as well as an ATM. There is a spa I hear from friends is very good. There is an infinity pool as well as a fire pit. The hotel has a car service as well, so if the place you want to go is a bit out of walking range they can drop you off. This Four Seasons is exactly what you would expect from a Four Seasons. It is definitely expensive, but if you feel like being pampered while hanging out in Seattle it is the place to be.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, MD", "Title": "\u201cNice rooms and view\u201d", "Author": "dlcSilverSpring_MD", "ReviewID": "UR121380422", "Content": "This hotel has great rooms and the views on the water side are great.

Oh, and ART restaurant has great food. I have never stayed at a FS before, but I think I might just be a convert! I checked in on a Friday night, since I would be going to a winemaker's dinner at ART restaurant and didn't want to worry about getting home for the night. (And to wind down from a family vacation in the woods during the previous week.) I was checked in quickly (seriously, 2 minutes, tops! And that's probably because we requested a shaving kit, haha) and directed up to the room. On the way to the elevator there was a pitcher of apple cider to drink, and apple rings and a little thing about apples since it's fall and you're in Washington. The city view room was small, but nice - a bit dim, but clean and with an amazing bathroom! marble everywhere, tv inside the mirror so you can watch from the shower, ridiculously deep bath tub for soaking, and a shower with 2 heads - rainshower and normal, and you could have them both on at once or just one at a time. L'Occitane soap and shampoo, fluffy towels and robes. Heaven! The bed was super comfortable, and I could only barely hear the sounds of the street 8 floors below (the room looked out over the SAM). I'd heard a lot about the rooftop infinity pool, but didn't get a chance to check it out that night. Instead, I got up early for a swim. Well, we've been having some beautiful late summer weather lately, and I was surprised it was completely empty. Went for a swim and called room service to have breakfast delivered to the pool. YES, that's right. Pool breakfast. I figured if they can bring room service to your room, then why not the pool?! They sent someone down with menus, and sadly he didn't come back for like 10 minutes so we just called up again and told them what we wanted. Swam some more and then had a plate of hot, fluffy lemon ricotta pancakes with sides of lemon curd and blackberry jam, plus a nice big glass of ice water (yay! I hadn't asked, but was going to!) and a side of chicken sausage. Best breakfast I've had in a while - I am definitely going to get this again the next time I stay. $16 well spent! Really, my only complaint is that parking is $40/day, so we took the bus - I can think of much better things to spend my money on than that. Other than that, this place is just amazing - I think staying there is going to become a a regular occurence. I can't believe I paid even more to stay at the Edgewater recently!

This trip it was a toss-up between Hotel 1000 (where I have not yet stayed) and the (new) Four Seasons. The Four Seasons won primarily due to location. It is 1 block from the Pike Place Market. What sets the Four Seasons apart from other downtown Hotels are three things: The amazing outdoor pool (seasonal), its prime location particularly in proximity to the Market, and its exceptional service. Service, service, service. Before arriving I received a friendly email inquiring about what type of tea I like (prompted by my request for an in room kettle). We arrived at about 1:00 pm as they were preparing our room. We strolled over to the Market and returned about an hour later. Upon entering room 810 we observed the requested kettle and tea along with the refrigerator we wanted for our bottled waters, and the chocolate strawberries I had requested. A hand written welcome note, penned by Ms. Alana Jackson, was neatly placed on the table (nice touch). The interior of the room was comfortable and spacious-- higher end modern--comparable to many boutique Hotels you find in cities all over the world, nothing extraordinary. The bathtub was a standout, much deeper and larger than most. The artwork was interesting. Once piece was unusual if not a bit disturbing, reminiscent of Munch's \"The Scream.\" I noticed a piece in the Hallway that appeared to have been painted by the same artist. We threw ourselves onto the beds, temporarily exhausted. Eying the room service menu we opted to share a piece of decadent chocolate cake. Yummy. With a non-fat latte for me that ran about $27.00. (The room service is, simply put, too expensive and uninspired given the variety of nearby restaurants and cafes to choose from.) Likewise the spa is overpriced comparable to day spas and other Hotel spas in the area. Come dinnertime (around 8:30 pm) we were leisurely exploring the meaning of nothingness when I spied the Japonessa Restaurant across the street from our window. Not wanting to get all dolled up and go out we did the logical thing, which was to call the concierge to inquire about delivery service. Here is where the Four Seasons unsurpassed service comes in. The concierge advises me that, unfortunately, the Japonessa does not deliver. Without skipping a beat he asks if he can send up the restaurant's menu and offers to pick up and deliver our order. How cool was that? Meanwhile, we took a dip in the outdoor pool. A heated infinity pool under the stars is a thing of beauty. The food from Japonessa arrived; it was delicious. I highly recommend the vegetable tempura. We slept like newborn pups in under the crisp white linens. The beds are comparable to Westin's \"Heavenly\" experience. The next day we made use of the Hotel's car service--a Jaguar of course--which took us the several blocks we were too lazy (and too bogged down with packages from the fresh fruit stands at the Market) to walk. BTW, you can get a beautiful bouquet of flowers at the Market for a mere 5 bucks. Incredible. Staying at the Seattle Four Seasons was a stress free and very enjoyable experience; I highly recommend this Hotel, but politely suggest they lower the spa and room service rates a bit, particularly in view of the present economic climate.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "GIMD", "ReviewID": "UR117376456", "Content": "This is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.

After coming in pretty late from a concert it was nice to see the room turned down for bed, with the ice bucket filled and bottles of water on both nightstands. What a nice touch. We used the lounge prior to the concert. The cocktails are delicious if a tad pricey. But for being in a 5 star hotel I was not surprised at the prices. We also had breakfast in the hotel restaurant.

With hundreds of fans outside the hotel, kept behind police tape, my family and I were able to come and go without any hassle. Not even so much as being asked to show proof we were guests in order to re-enter the hotel. It's that Four Seasons magic-they had a security system in place that protected those that needed it but didn't hassle other hotel guests. The hotel rooms are beautiful. Our party had 2-one waterfront corner 1 bedroom suite and one waterfront deluxe room. The deluxe room was so spacious that I had to make sure it wasn't the suite before the kids settled into it! Location fabulous. Right across the street from the art museum, right at Pike's Market. Very close to lots of what's happening in Seattle. If you have the time arrange a tour of the city on your first day, DO IT!! The concierge set up small group van tour which was 3 hours and very interesting. Even went out to the locks and saw the boats coming through them. Also saw the \"steps\" at the locks. The fish ladder built to facilitate fish returning upstream to spawn. We spent about 1/2 hour at the locks. It was a nice break from sitting in a tour van and this part of the tour really catches the children's attention. If you're a fish lover than Seattle is the right town for you. We had some of the freshest, most creatively prepared fish on this trip. Don't miss the opportunity when in Seattle to enjoy the fish-and of course the coffee!! A coffee shop on every corner! My coffee addicted husband thought he'd died and gone to heaven!

We opted for a king bed over 2 doubles because sometimes our child ends up in our bed and it was worth a try to see if she'd sleep in a roll-away. The roll-away wasn't necessary because there was a chaise she claimed as her bed; someone from housekeeping made it up with pillows and blankets. This wouldn't work for a child over the age of 10 likely but, it works well for a younger child and gave us more space than we would have had with a roll-away As always in a Four Seasons, the service was friendly and accommodating. The pool was fantastic, although not large. Cocktail service was wonderful although it seemed there was an interesting LA contingent visiting the hotel that weekend, maybe a cruise crowd? I needed a refrigerator for medication and they were more than helpful. The refrigerator was large and had a small freezer, perfect for my ice packs for the trip home. The mini-bar is not suitable for refrigeration as it's one of those pre-stocked, automatic charge units that doesn't really refrigerate things so if you need a refrigerator, ask when making reservations. They mentioned children's amenities and we were given a child-sized robe & slippers the day after check-in. The cons... Typical of Four Seasons, the mattresses are dreadful and Seattle's Four Seasons does not buck that trend. I wish they'd contract with the W or Westin and use their mattresses instead. It's one of the few things that always deters from my stays at any Four Seasons. The food at ART was mediocre at best, tasteless like elegant hospital food. I made my reservations online and was automatically put into the bed and breakfast program so we ate there 2 mornings and I would say it is absolutely not worth it, particularly when there are good restaurants just around the corner (Steelhead Cafe is a good one). Due to weather issues, we were unable to depart on the day planned. While at friends', I called to extend our checkout in case the weather improved and late checkout is a mere 1/2 hour later than regular checkout (noon). While on the phone, it became clear that it was not safe to fly and I asked if they had availability for one more night (a Monday night) and was told no, they were completely booked. I found that odd since it seemed the hotel was not full but anything is possible. Twenty minutes after my call, my husband went to the front desk and said that we'd been told there was no availability; would they mind calling the W to see if they had availability for the night? Suddenly they had rooms available and we needn't move our things. Surely they could have bothered to discover that while I was on the phone with them.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new and modern and the location right next to the Pike Place Market was terrific. We booked a standard room and were given a room with a partial view of Elliot Bay not sure if that is an upgrade or not but I wouldn't pay extra for a partial view. The room is what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect in a business hotel but small in comparison to other hotels we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at in Seattle: Fairmont Olympic and W. The bathroom was nice and larger at the Four Season than at the W and Fairmont. The TV in the bathroom mirror was different; though after the first morning we never turned it on. The Four Seasons has a nice heated outdoor lap pool and a hot tub overlooking Elliot Bay. The workout room was one of the nicest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in a hotel. However, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blown away, only reason I would stay at the Four Seasons over the W or the Fairmount is its location, but in reality, those other hotels are only a few blocks away. Otherwise it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 really standout. If you like a modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor, either the W or Four Seasons will do; the Fairmont room had a unique historic character and was larger. The front desk staff was nice and efficient; I thought the room cleaning staff was average but not consistent day to day; the staff at the front door was ok\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it is obvious when a VIP is around\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 as the staff at the front door doubles and more hotel management people are hanging around to open the door. One minor experience that was momentarily irritating, was the one and only time we considered using the hotel car. Four Seasons promotes that they have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel car\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd service free for guests to take them within about a mile or so from the hotel on a first come first serve basis. One weekday evening, we inquired about having the hotel car drive us down to SODO \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less than \u00c2\u00bd mile away --we were told they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t because of the traffic from the Mariners game\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 mind you this was during the week of record breaking low attendance at Safeco. In the end, we enjoyed a nice evening walk and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but notice that unusually light traffic along First Ave through Pioneer Square and SODO. Seems like given it was a week day and a quick out to the street would have shown the complete lack of traffic - the front door staff should have at least offered to drive us down to Pioneer Square or until traffic backed up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 which they would have found it never did. It might be hotel policy not to drive the hotel car to the SODO area during a home game but it felt like the hotel staff just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be bothered; expecially since the car was parked in front and there were no other hotel guests in sight.

The restaurant ART and room service are impeccable and the rooms are first rate. In particular, the rooms are clean and roomy and the bedding is very comfortable, as one would expect from a hotel in the Four Seasons stable. One small criticism, probably not relevant to all guests, is the significant traffic noise that accompanies rooms that are not \"bay view.\" Finally, a word of caution to those who wish to avail themselves of cab service in the Seattle downtown area: we used cab service ten times during our almost week-long stay and found the drivers to be universally arrogant, angry, unappreciative of their clients, unethical, and just generally very unpleasant, among the most unpleasant, rude and incompetent cabbies we have ever experienced. We have been all over the free world over the last 40 years and were astonished at the lack of interest these 10 drivers exhibited in providing even a modicum of decent service.

They had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstay the 3rd night free\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offer on their website which cost us US$867 inclusive of taxes. The hotel has an exceptional location near the waterfront on 1st Avenue and Union street. It is right next to the Pike Place Market, opposite the Seattle Art Museum and a short walk from the main shopping centres along Pine St. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the doormen who opened the hotel doors for us. This made us feel very welcomed. When I walked into the lobby, it felt like walking into an art gallery with a lovely fire place. It was very sophisticated. Check-in at the reception was efficient but not extraordinary. We had a corner room on the 6th floor which looked out on to the city below us. The room was huge for a standard room. The interior design was very modern and chic but comfortable. There were two large heavenly beds and a large lounge chair with a huge over-hanging floor lamp. We had a nice view of the city below us and a peek of the waterfront from the side window. There was a large flat screen TV, an ipod/iphone dock and a spacious wardrobe. The sleep quality was somewhat ruined by the noisy vehicles in the city below even in the wee hours of the morning. The curtains and shades were also unable to filter the street lights completely even though they were fully drawn. Thus, my sleep quality wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t 100%. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sensitive, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a city view room. The mini bar was fully sensored. If you took a beverage out of its place, sensors would go off and you would be charged. It was disappointing that there was no coffee machine or complimentary tea/coffee in the room. Room service brought us an electric kettle. In response to this, the receptionist told us that there were complimentary coffee and apples in the lobby in the early morning. It would have been nice to have these in your room for a hotel of such standard. Unfortunately there was no complimentary free internet in the rooms. The bathroom was out of this world. The bath tub was big and deep and looked out on to the city below. There was a huge TV in-built into the mirror, luxurious towels, bath robes and L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122occitane products, and a separate toilet area. The shower area had what seemed like 2 rain showers which was great but the shower handles were quite confusing. The Conceirge is located right opposite the reception area and next to the internet room which only had 2 computers. One of the Conceirge staff, Justin, was extremely good and friendly. He was very knowledgeable and shared with us his personal take on the sights and sounds of Seattle and recommended his favorite restaurants. We went to Lowell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at Pike Market for breakfast which had great food in a casual setting and unbeatable views of Puget Sound. The best restaurant was Wild Ginger which was located near the hotel. We went there for dinner on our first night and were at first apprehensive about tacky/pretentious Asian food that could sometimes be served in North American asian restaurants. That idea went out the window as the food was authentic and delicious with great service and ambience. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants so we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment. Overall, I would give it a 9 out of 10. There was a small glitch in which our 4am morning call never came on the day that we were supposed to check-out. The hotel should have complimentary free internet service in the rooms and also provide tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms. They should also look in to the horrible traffic noise emanating from the city which reduces sleep quality in the city view rooms. Otherwise, everything was perfect. The service was top notch and the staff made you feel that you were a valued guest. Room service was excellent. Everything was brought up to us within five minutes including the electric kettle and bathroom slippers that we requested for. We ordered room service for dinner on our last night and the food and presentation was excellent. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly expensive either. The city of Seattle is great. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a single drop of rain during our entire stay. Who says that it always rains in Seattle? We even had 2 days where we could see clear views of the Olympic mountains and Mount Rainier.

I'd definitely recommend. Room was spacious, modern, and had a wonderful partial view of the bay overlooking the pool. We felt the stay was very good value given the experience. Here're a few highlights from the stay: ~ Loved eating by the pool on a hot summer day. Ordered food, and while the attendant was getting it from room service, I took a swim and enjoyed the view. Got out, sun dried, and then boom -- my lunch arrived. Fantastic. (He did forget to bring me water after I asked the first time, though...) ~ Bathroom had the most amazing (yet quiet) ventilation you can imagine -- there was a glass shower door, and yet I simply could not get it to fog up no matter how hot I would turn the rain shower on. I suppose that ventilation was important since the mirror had a TV embedded in it. Overall, this is the bathroom I'd like in my own house -- great extra wide/deep tub, nice shower with tiling and a glass door, high quality toilet, TV in the mirror, and lots of marble and wood and glass everywhere. L'Occitane goods, but I have to admit I dislike their bath salts -- smell like pine & mint, which was kind of strong smelling to bathe in. ~ The room had a pretty silent ventilation system which responded very quickly to any temperature changes. Outstanding. (Also, no noise at all from any other rooms, etc.) ~ In-room POWER breakfast was incredible. We got $80 of breakfast sent up to the room which literally covered the desk. Everything was delicious -- fantastic coffee, delicious chicken sausage, a belgium waffle with the lemon curd (from the ricotta pancakes), an omelet (which admittedly wasn't a superstar), a bread basket, and fruit. Softened butter, our own sets of jams, tons of silverware and china, really just a wonderful experience. Had a great conversation overlooking the ocean, in our room. (PS: Yes, we ate most everything. It wasn't wasteful.) ~ Happy, plush bed. Classic FS. ~ I had an upset stomach one day, and ordered just some plain chicken broth... they sent it up, but also it came with some bread that I hadn't quite realized I wanted too. The best thing was a \"homemade saltine\" -- no, really, their chef made a copycat saltine-like cracker that was delicious. What a hilarious way to be slightly sick! ~ They did a fantastic job with a bridesmaid dress that was smooshed into a suitcase -- we were super worried, but in just a couple hours (per request) they had the dress back pressed looking better than new. Same story with a suit, etc. House car was later available to help drive around the dress. ~ The Art lounge was pretty happening (lots of people), which was kind of surprising. We only found it on our last day, as it's on the other side of the restaurant. We never would have known there were a good number of folks there mid-day... Good place for us to kill some time before a flight. ~ Great location downtown. Walking distance to Nordstrom, Pike's, etc. Couple of confusing notes: ~ We had two buttons break off our clothes while staying there, unfortunately. We put the buttons on the nightstand on a piece of paper, in hopes that the maid would bring one of the little sewing kits to the room. She didn't. Some FS put the little sewing kit in the room by default, although Seattle doesn't, so kinda wish they would at least notice and help. ~ Front Desk agent told us we had a $50 spa credit, but I'm pretty sure we didn't. Later a runner brought up a note saying we actually had a breakfast and lunch credit. Kind of a confusing mix up. ~ No coffee in the room. I kind of don't care that you can call in-room dining to get coffee, and because in-room is brewing it you might get \"the best\" coffee ever (strong, hot, etc). Simply put, I want coffee & tea in my room, at all times, period. I found that whenever I wanted a cup of tea, I couldn't bring myself to justify the hassle of calling someone and orchestrating the whole event (including a tip) -- for me, these drinks are personal, and I'd like to take care of it in my own domain. (Also, please change tea brand! Not a fan of this tea Forte.) ~ Please, just buy the storage depot next door. Or at the least, pay them to allow you to paint it over with a light blue color.

The hotel room itself is an efficient lay out, sizable, and had a great bathroom. Separate tub & shower, tv in the bathroom mirror, integrated mirror lighting,... Also, the tv was probably the best I've seen in a hotel, and of course the bed was dreamy. On a rainy day, I wasn't much inspired to get out of bed!

Also, we did eat an early dinner in the bar -- a $12 all-you-can-eat cheese buffet, and we also had a $6 plate of sliders. Their happy hour (5p-7p) was very good. Great drinks & food, and amazing service. The staff really understands service, and was very knowledgeable with the food & drinks.

It's in a noisy part of downtown Seattle; while you have a view of the water, the view is over some industrial buildings and an always-busy and very noisy expressway (the Alaska Way Viaduct). It is convenient to Pike Place Market, but I have hard a time imaging that the clientele that can afford this hotel is going to make more than 1 trip to the market. The really annoying thing about this hotel -- and the primary reason for my poor review -- is their terrible policy toward charging for wireless Internet service. Upon signing in and paying for an $11-day-per-day rate (crazy in and of itself), they prompt you to pay an additional $4 for \"premium\" service. If you don't pay the $4 upgrade, you get mediocre service -- not fast enough to watch simple Flash animation, for example. So Internet service equivalent to what you get in a Holiday Inn Express for *free* will cost you $15 a day. I've read in the paper that the owners of this hotel are in deep financial trouble and have refused to pay the company that built the hotel. I can only assume that they're trying to make up the difference by charging $15 for Internet service.

We had a wonderful experience at this hotel. We arrived at midnight and I was greeted by name and after 6 hours on the plane and in airports, this place felt like an oasis. I traveled with my husband and two kids, 5 and 2. We walked into our room to find cookies and juice for the girls, along with robes and slippers just their size. It was a lot of fun. The room is very understated. You don't have the dark wood and rich colors that tend to give a more luxurious feel, but everything was clean and spotless. I usually do a wipe down with clorox wipes and find things missed by the housekeeping staff, but everything was perfect here. The bathroom was as great as everyone says-rain shower, very deep soaking tub, tv embedded in the mirror, I could go on.... The next day we \"rented\" some videos and books from the concierge for the kids-its all free. They had a large selection of books and videos appropriate for all ages. There were a few books on Seattle so it was fun to read the books and tell my daughters what we were going to be seeing that day. Others have mentioned the great location-I would ditto that. We could walk everywhere even with a stroller. We walked to Westlake and took the monorail to Seattle Center. I highly recommend the Children's Museum. It was one of the best I have been to. It was a great way to spend the afternoon. The pool was heated and beautiful overlooking the water. The fitness center was state of the art. We did not try the restaurants or room service. There was some issues with the bellman staff, they did not come on time and our taxi that they came early and then thought he was taking us to the airport.

Any questions or any comments were met with extreme professionalism and grace. The original room was not ready and the request for extra towels was fulfilled within minutes!! The room was comfy and decorated in a contemporary fashion - the view was in the direction of the entrance/Pike Place Market. Awesome to watch the sunset!

Turn down service was great, the attendant asked preferences and if anything was needed. There is an outdoor pool and lounge area - make sure you check this out! its a great place to just unwind and take it all in. The fitness center has lemon lime gatorade and lemon water. Also cool towels/purell/ clorox wipes for the machines. I had an employee ask me if I needed water and brought it over without hesitation. There are a few balance balls, a few weight machines, free weights, treadmills, elliptical machines and bikes. There is also a floor mat to do sit ups and yoga poses. My only gripe was room service. I had an awesome salad with chicken skewers - great presentation on day one. On day two ordered the same thing and had a not so nice presentation. Not sure if the breakfast crowd had just finished or what but I was a bit disappointed. :( You can also take the Light Rail from University station to Sea Tac - the entrance is thru Benaroya Hall.

We arrived late around 11 PM but we were still on NY time and it was 2 AM for us. We were very tired and were thrilled at how comfy the beds were and loved the delicious pizza we ordered from room service. The rooms/bathrooms were lovely but much smaller than the Four Seasons in NYC (the one in NYC is about $200 more a night also, so I guess you get what you pay for). We LOVED the tv embedded into the bathroom mirror..very nice unexpected touch. We had breakfast at ART and the lemon ricotta pancakes were to die for ( i have also had these at the NYC location but they were even better here).

I would recommend the hotel to other travelers. The hotel is a new structure, of modest height, right on Seattle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waterfront. A few of the rooms have direct waterfront views. Many other rooms (mine included) overlook the pool area and have diagonal views of the water. There are also rooms which look out over the streets that surround the hotel (I thiink I'd try to avoid those). The interior d\u00c3\u00a9cor is modern (think bleached wood, and Scandinavian design).

The easy chair suffers (just a little) from the modern design problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beautiful to look at but nowhere near as comfortable as a traditional overstuffed arm chair.

All of the linens and bedding were of the normal high Four Seasons quality. The service was excellent. All my interactions with the front desk were handled precisely and efficiently. The concierge offered a dinner recommendation, and followed up with an inquiry about the meal. The one breakfast I ate in the restaurant was very good.

I thought it was a very nice mix. The chairs were comfortable and the nightly happy hour with $5 food and drink specials was perfect and large. The room was nice and big. I was in a partial Bay view room which also looked down on the pool. The ferrys came in and out of port right next to the hotel so that was a nice addition to the view. The pool was the real treat. Unlike the old Four Seasons (the Olympic) This one is outdoors and gorgeous. There was a nice mix of both younger (20s and 30s) people as well as a few older couples, and the occasional child. The pool is full service with a bar on the weekends (you can have drinks all week but it takes a little longer). The view from the pool deck is perfect with almost no sign of the industrial waterfront below the hotel. All around I was expecting to hang out with friends and run around the city daily.

I was initially inclined to book Hotel 1000; however, due to the excellent rate that you can procure from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website (stay three nights for the price of two); I could not pass up this very worthwhile opportunity. I would encourage fellow leisure travelers to take advantage of the aforementioned rate plan because this is as close to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discount\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you will get. The ride from the airport is approximately $40 dollars or so and taxis are easy to come by at the hotel. The hotel is well located. It is steps from Pikes Market and if you go down the long flight of stairs directly adjacent to the hotel you will be on the water (well, almost) and you will find restaurants as well as the aquarium. There is a house car to shuttle guests around town (within a limited-mile radius of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI was a little underwhelmed that this hotel choose a regular Lincoln Town Car, other locales have much more exciting cars like BMWs, Mercedes, and at the NY location, a Maybach. We did not drive in Seattle, therefore, I do not know how much valet parking was, but I am sure it is expensive. Before checking-in, I wanted to see their Junior Suite and was shown to it before I checked-in to my double-bedded (2 beds) accommodation. The Junior Suite (a Four Seasons Executive Suite) was a very spacious room with a King-bed and sofa bed. The suite was tastefully, albeit minimally, decorated. The furniture was of good quality and consisted of blonde colored wood. It was easy to move around the suite. The bathroom was a sight to behold. Sunlight washed in through the bountiful windows in the bathroom. The view of the water was amazing. My Superior Room on the 3rd floor afforded me a view of the Vietnamese restaurant across the street. You could easily see the pedestrians on the street level. Even with two double beds, the room appeared large and again, was easy to move around in. The bathroom, sans windows, was still impressive. The lighting in the room was sufficient and you can even adjust the light setting in the bathroom. The single sink looked onto a TV embedded in the mirror. The soaking tub was nice and refreshing after a day of walking around the city. What I like about the newer properties is that they (including this property) use a rain shower head in the shower stall. The bathroom features the customary L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane bath products. Housekeeping was very efficient and always observed the Do Not Disturb on the door. Bottled water is provided at turndown, although you can always ask a member of the Bell Desk to give you bottles as well. In spite of a very difficult time for the luxury hotel market, the FS Seattle was still able to deliver in providing superior service for an excellent stay. The Concierge was very knowledgeable and was able to get the right information and make the last-minute reservations at the more popular restaurants in Seattle. The pool and gym facilities are top-notch. It is located on the fourth floor of the hotel and affords a glorious view of the water and water traffic if it is a nice sunny day like it was when we visited. It is a smaller gym; however, this is a smaller hotel in regards to the number of rooms/suite available for occupancy. The hotel offers a small business center with two internet equipped computers that is complimentary to guests. You can also print your boarding passes as well. The mini-bar is automated so do not touch anything; otherwise, you will be charged. Expect to add $4 delivery fee plus a 20% service charge for all in-room dining orders (room service). This is very subjective but I did not really care for the food that room service served. I am not a foodie by any stretch of the imagination; however, I found the food somewhat bland. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but I would not be inclined to order food from the hotel based on my initial experience. I will however give the hotel major kudos for allowing us to buy the very fresh seafood from Pikes Market and cooking it for us. If you see something at the Market and you want to eat it for lunch/dinner, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to contact the staff to see the feasibility of the request (although I am sure it will be accommodated).

Even before our stay, we emailed the hotel with our airline arrival and departure information so that we could get help booking airport transfers. It's a good thing I looked closely at the confirmation; the departure information was wrong, and it took several emails with their concierge staff to finally get all the correct information in writing. I did double-check my original email to them to make sure I hadn't given them wrong info, and sure enough, it was their error. To their credit, the limo service they made arrangements with was excellent. Another thing that surprised me was that after a full day out and about, we returned about 3pm to find that our room had not been serviced. Having worked in hotels, I realized that that's about the time that most of the housekeeping staff finishes for the day. We called housekeeping to inquire to see if someone would be coming to the room and to NOT have them come, since we were back in the room and wanting to rest. Well, I guess that's not what they do, since after talking with the attendant, someone was dispatched to our room to service it anyway, so we had to make a quick exit to the pool to let her do her thing. On the positive side, the staff are very welcoming and some do actually address you by name (room service) which is a nice touch. Pool attendants and porters were spot-on.

I had vowed we would try the new Four Seasons which opened in November of 2008, on a return trip and got the chance when I was attending a photo seminar downtown. Overall, we were extremely impressed. Four Seasons Hotels have hospitality and service down to a science and this location is no different. From the time we arrived to the time we left, service was impeccable, warm and welcoming, with just the right level of familiarity. At check-in we were pleasantly surpised to be upgraded two levels; the hotel felt quite empty as it was a weekend, and I suspect this is the reason why. The lobby is very modern with a unique fireplace, and very comfortable seating. There is a small 24-hour business centre located to the left of the concierge desk, and there was free computer access on a few brand-new flat screen computers, with a color printer. A nice touch as usually you have to pay a high price for internet at these types of hotels. However, there is a charge for computer access in your room. The room was decorated in bland beige tones -- my only complaint about Four Seasons in general, but was extremely spacious and we had a view of the pool, plus a bit of the ocean. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the shower had great pressure. L'Occitaine amenities are in the bathroom, and the maids are generous if you want extras. The gym has brand-new state of the art equipment and was empty the weekend we were there; the pool is heated year round, and wasn't a bad temperature, considering it was about the mid 40's and raining. The hot tub was great, plus there was an outdoor propane fire pit, which was lovely on the chilly nights. Everything is well-maintained and spotless, plus there is always lemon or cucumber flavored water available at all times in the gym area. What impressed me the most about this hotel were the little touches available that made you feel pampered and probably costs the hotel relatively very little -- offers of free bottled water whenever you leave the hotel; in the mornings there are tiny croissants and apple pastries, plus coffee and tea in the lobby; guests are welcome to use the spa relaxation room to relax and read up-to-date magazines and partake in the \"spa snacks\" -- little cookies and candies plus nut and fruit snacks -- all for free. Art restaurant serves well-executed classics, nothing overtly trendy or fancy, which is nice for a change. Everything we ordered was excellent, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It is in the restaurant, though, they could improve service -- I told our server I was allergic to an item, and then they included it on my plate. We had breakfast in the restaurant two mornings in a row, and I was given the wrong breakfast each morning. My husband and I were the only ones in the restaurant. However, at Art, I can highly recommend the fresh baked individual apple pie, homemade ice creams/sorbets, and the breakfast TV tray if you want something filling but don't want to feel overstuffed. You will not be disappointed in your stay at this Four Seasons -- there are package deals out there on their website, as with everyone else, they are trying to make it in this economy.

When we arrived at the hotel the door staff quickly jumped into action, taking our bags and holding doors opened. These are the same door staff who were there to hold the door open every time we left and returned to the hotel and who organised us transport whever needed. Check in was super efficient and we were on our way to our room within 2 minutes. The room itself was resonably large for a standard room and the bathroom was as big again. I loved the superbly comfortable bed and the very very deep soaking bath, big enough for 2! Also there were always replenished L'Occtaine bath products. I also loved how the maid service was very discreet and laid all of our toiletries out on towels by the sink. The view - It overlooked the city (Seattle Art Museum). You can however pay to upgrade to rooms overlooking the water if you wish. The hotel appeared very quiet so I imagine they can comfortable allow upgrades. They seemed to have no problem with us extending our check out time on the last day to 2.30pm. We had a walk around on our first day and found the pool and jacuzzi, both outside but I didn't try them with the cold Jan temperatures as they didn't feel hot enough for me! I imagine though that they will be lovely in the milder months. There is also a small business area close to reception with complimentary internet access, printer and all the usuals as well as an ATM. This was useful as there is a surcharge for use of the internet in the guest room so if you only need to quickly check email just pop into the business centre. We tried the bar for cocktails on Thurs and Fri nights after dinner elsewhere. On Thurs we were the only people in there and on Fri it was very busy so maybe this is a locals place to be on weekends, or maybe there were more tourists in town, who knows. The cocktails were lovely, if strong, in fact one of mine was so strong I couldn't drink it. The service generally was very attentive and we were often greeted by name in and around the reception area. The only thing I didn't like was that you could quite clearly hear the noise from the road below and we were on the 5th floor, however I am not sure how this could be avoided given the location of the hotel.", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location\u201d", "Author": "ryzee", "ReviewID": "UR23895969", "Content": "The Four Seasons Seattle is brand spanking new and was the reason we chose to drive down from Vancouver for a few days over the holidays. The hotel is perfectly located right next to the Pike Place Market with views over the water. The rooms are typical Four Seasons city hotel decor everything is perfectly in place but to be honest a wee bit boring. Common areas are lovely and the bar is a nice place to sip a cocktail and was quite buzzing. Staff were nice and attentive but not quite as polished as other properties that have been around a bit longer, to be expected given they had just opened. Would not hesitate to book here again next time we are in Seattle. One minor criticism we would have would be with housekeeping. One of the reasons we love the Four Seasons is the invisible housekeeping we have experienced. At other properties we have marveled at how every time we left the room it was miraculously made up when we returned and we never ever see a maid. At this location it seemed that we were always bumping into the housekeeping staff and the timing of the room refresh was always off, evening turndown service always came when we were in the room and we had to settle for grabbing a couple a fresh towels and a bar of soap from the maid through the doorway.", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Four Seasons Hotel Seattle", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d1152288-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Seattle-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$327 - $640*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">99 Union Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1152288", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5c/30/5c304588da68a3799ba9f4a3248c8bfa10large.jpg"}}
