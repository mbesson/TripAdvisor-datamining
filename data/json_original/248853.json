We were quoted at a 42 Euro Rate online and the reception delivered this excellent rate. The rooms were very clean and well appointed with a nice TV and cable. The shower was hot and the bed was very comfortable. I really enjoyed being in an older building using a key and an old Elevator and staircase. We have an infant child and the staff kept our food in their refrigerator and brought it to us in the morning. They made sure all of our needs were met and called a taxi cab for us at 4:30am in the morning. When we are in Berlin for a longer trip we will stay here again for a much better rate than the larger chains and less of a corporate feel.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cGreat for airport access, Good otherwise.\u201d", "Author": "inamesh Posted by a Cleartrip traveler", "ReviewID": "UR122021032", "Content": "This hotel is excellent value for money. We got a really good deal (40 Euros per night). Room and bathroom were standard and clean. The hotel is a short walk away from the Airport bus stop (which is also the U-Bahn station for getting to Berlin center). There are lots of cafes/shops around, and a big supermarket too (which also has a counter with freshly prepared food). There is a friendly Turkish Doner place right opposite the hotel, and a decent but smoky bar on the way between the metro station and the hotel.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for a stay if you have an early flight\u201d", "Author": "Anna K", "ReviewID": "UR120149969", "Content": "The hotel is situated minutes away from a bus stop to Tegel Airport. I wouldn't stay here for more than one night. The place is noisy not only because of the traffic but also because of poor sound isolation between the rooms. We heard our neighbors having really good time together in 1 o'clock in the morning so we couldn't sleep. On the other hand, I liked the room very much. The furniture is really nice and you have everything you need - a table with chair, wardrobe. There were also paper, envelopes, pen and other stuff in the table. Our big bed was comfortable. The bathroom was nice too. They got everything there including hairdryer. The stuff was helpful and welcoming. We came in the morning before check-in time so we had to put our luggage somewhere. The only place for that was little room meant for using computer, fax and other things. The elevator and stairs in the hotel are really narrow. But it's not a problem. I would recommend staying here to catch early flight from Tegel.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cbasic hotel near tegel airport so near you can see your plane!\u201d", "Author": "mykitten", "ReviewID": "UR114621983", "Content": "very handy for tegel airport.

The staff were friendly, and spoke some english. The location was 5-7 mins walk from the 'Kurt Schumacher Platz' U-Bahn station, just as advertised. There was a large supermarket between that U-Bahn station and the hotel. This was handy, because I just had the room only, without any breakfast. The hotel was in a nice, safe looking area. Bad points ;--- I stayed in a room at the front of the hotel, and there was noise from traffic most of the night. The window sound insulation was very poor. Although I knew I was staying on a 'Room only, excluding breakfast' basis, I expected at least a kettle in the room for making tea/coffee.
