We felt so much at home that we were sad to leave after four nights. Great location with all the historic sites- all within walking distances. We took the taxi only once to go to Eminonu and realised it is only walking distance. The hotel staff was extremely helpful . Mr Seljuk was so helpful that we felt he is one of our longlost friends. Bora was very kind. Suvat and the team in the restaurant were wonderful- excellent food. Fresh meat/ lovely fruits/ cakes/ sweets. The breakfast spread was amazing. Thanks to Abbas and Moran who helped with the baggage and all our heavy purchases. Everyone was so polite, nothing was too much trouble for them. Blue mosque, Hagia sophia (Big & Little), Topkapi Palace & Suleimaniye mosque were wonderful. Turkish Bath was wonderful too. Grand Bazar was an experience, to say the least. Once we got the hang of the haggling it was great fun. I got so used to it I have even started bargaining with the local fruit seller in my town in U.K, much to his annoyance (. He is hoping that I will stop this bizarre behaviour soon.) We bought lamps, Iznik plates, Iznik pomegranates, small jewellery sets, perfumes,curios etc. Well, we will certainly be going back to buy some carpets when we will be staying at the Rose Garden house again, nowhere else for us now. We have travelled widely and have stayed in many many hotels in all continents . This stay was one of the best.Excellent hotel and staff indeed!

One thing that makes this hotel special is the friendly staff who really make you feel welcome.

The hotel is very close to the Blue Mosque and a short (15 walk) to the tram lines which will take you up to Taskim Square (2 Turkish Lira (72p) the 2 Turkish Lira on the funicular).

I had one nights stop over in Istanbul, shame it wasnt longer. I was met by a smart looking young man who was my driver; the car was spotless, the driving was safe and easy despite the busy traffic. On arrival at the hotel I was greeted by a friendly Receptionist and The Manager (Mr Selcuk) met me and advised I had been upgraded. After a weeks healthy retreat in Gocek I was seeking some pampering. I didnt know what to expect. A guide through the hotel facilities (including free flowing snacks and drinks in the lounge area, sadly I didnt enjoy this but it looked great), and a walk through the beautiful, spacious gardens, up 2 flights of beautifully decorated stairs, and I was at my room. I felt like a princess, the room was fabulous - gold and decorated chair set and table, the biggest bed (was the comfiest bed Ive slept in, wish I couldve taken it home with me). There was a jacuzzie bath (which I enjoyed and floated in it was that big) and the floor was heated - sheer indulgence. There was a bottle of wine and water and fruit platter. TV was a bit limited but I wasnt in the room to watch a square screen. I opened the windows and enjoyed the sights, sounds and fresh air and smells of old town. The hotel was quiet, safe, comfortable, luxurious and exactly what I needed. It was spotlessly clean, the staff were impeccably dressed and respectful. As a sola traveller, I could not have felt more welcomed and relaxed, and in-place. Breakfast was amazing, and more than my requirements, home made omlettes a special favourite. My bags were stored safely for the day, I got changed and was chased as my car transfer was waiting for me to head to the airport. I can safely say with hand on heart that this was THE best hotel Ive stayed in, Ive travelled well and Im an ex HR Manager for Intercon Hotels, and I wish I had worked in a hotel like this. The management and staff couldnt do enough for me and were very personable. There are MANY hotels in the world that could learn a lot from this team. Thank you also to Mr Ayhan who I did not meet, who took my booking with faith and trust in me showing up.

The reception area needs to be changed as first impressions are very important and unfortunately the reception lets the hotel down.

We stayed in an 'ottoman' styled room in the new annex - nicely appointed, great bathroom, great shower (which tended to flood the floor), flat screen tv, minibar, soft towels etc etc. Downside was that if you are elderly or a small child the steps would be a serious challenge. Reception staff were really friendly and helpful - breakfast staff less so - a bit surly at times. Breakfast was fine - can't understand why there are a few complaints. There were european options and local delicacies. They could do with providing cappucino's but Turkish coffee was fine.

Mr Akkilic was even kind enough to accompany me to a local jewellers when there was something specific I was looking for and even enlisted a friend to do a search for me as well. The location could not have been better either since the hotel is in the heart of the old city with all the attractions well within walking distance.

It was a lovely room and even had a Hammam (Turkish Bath), the bathroom was cold as the heated towel rail was not working. We were then transferred to a room overlooking the hotel garden,( I did specify when I made the booking that we would prefer a quiet room on a high floor) this was rather small and claustrophobic and we asked if there was another room. We were shown a room on the street side of the hotel, which was slightly bigger, we agreed to take this room - big mistake it was very noisy as the street outside is paved with cobbles and the traffic is continual from 0700 until late. The room was cold as the radiator was lukewarn and hidden behind a heavy curtain, we did find a heavy blanket in a basket under the bed - we were not told it was there, the bathroom was cramped and cold and in need of some maintenance as it was rather tired. We had to ask several times for cups and saucers as housekeeping had forgotten to put them in the room. The hotel advertise complimentary water but we did not get any, we did have a bottle of wine in the room and fresh fruit on our first night. There were fluffy bathrobes and paper slippers, good quality toiletries, but the towels were on the thin side and off white. Now on to the restuarant - this is located in an extension to the rear of the hotel, and can be rather chilly, the breakfast choice was good, we cannot comment on lunch or dinner as we were out all day sightseeing. We did have the New Years Eve dinner which was 24.99 euros each and a fixed menu. Prior to the dinner there was a good selection of turkish mezes and wine free of charge, the hotel laid on live entertainment. I would say overall our experience of the hotel was good, however further training of the housekeeping staff to pay a little more attention to detail would be beneficial.

Mr. Ayhan was most helpful with email assistance before the trip and as the tour expert who put together a wide range of interesting options at prices that easily beat the big tourist operators. These were frequently tours for two with private car, driver, and knowlegeable guide (a school teacher in our case) at rates comparable or less than the standard bus for 60!

On arrival at the hotel, the manager took us into the dining room and gave us each a complimentary glass of wine as he explained what there was to see in Istanbul, complete with maps etc. He even recommended a local tour guide who could take us round the various sights of the old city on what was, in effect, a private tour. Three of our group were upgraded to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In reality, the suites were simply slightly larger rooms with a couple of armchairs. One or two of them also had traditional Turkish baths. Unfortunately, the upgrade to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was only for one night. On the second and third nights, the people who opted for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were then placed into another hotel (the Cesme) across the road. The problem with this is that these people lost the complimentary items, such as wine and fruit, that the rest of us got whilst remaining in the Garden House. And, of course, they had to come back to the Garden House for breakfast etc - which was not a big problem. The rooms were quite nice. Mine was on the third floor and had a double and a single bed. I had four windows and I found the room very cosy and spacious. There was a decent mini-bar and a working, electronic, safe, which is always a good thing. The safe wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually fastened to anything, though, so a thief could have simply walked out with it under their arm (unlikely, I accept). Bathroom was OK. No bath, but a dedicated and decent shower. The sink was not fixed to the wall very well and my toilet seat fell apart when I touched it (Management, please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say this should have been reported to the front desk as that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the job of the room cleaners not the customers!). Otherwise, there was a good range of toiletries available and sufficient, but rather thin, towels. There was a good range of food for breakfast which was taken in the small dining area which also doubled up as a bar and restaurant for the evening, though nobody told us about the option of having omelettes as a previous reviewer has described. Watch out for the breakfast waitress. She was so keen, that if you turned your head for a second (or even blinked), your glasses, plates and cutlery were gone, even if not finished, and you had to go up and get some more. We took it in turns to guard each others plates etc when visiting the buffet! Staff were always pleasant and helpful and even exchanged some old, obsolete, Turkish bank notes for one of our group. Some similar old money was then given to another of our group in change the next night. I am assuming this was purely an oversight on the part of the staff member concerned, who, to be fair, swapped it over again when it was queried the next day. Perhaps he knew he had been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrumbled\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Finally, the hotel is in a good location in Sultanahmet old city and we found that it was no problem at all to walk to virtually anywhere within downtown Istanbul. If you walked too far, there was always the tram which came within close proximity of the hotel.

We aren't too picky either really. Sometimes we stay in $5 a night places, sometimes $500. I have never written a bad review of a hotel of all the places we have gone until now. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this place. First of all, we booked the executive suite like 3 months in advance. There is only 1 room like this. When we went to check in they directed us to our room. Once we got inside I knew immediatley this was not the room I booked. We headed back to the front desk and told them we booked the executive suite. The man at the front desk proceeded to tell me that the room was occupied and that the room he put us in was just as good (which it was not at all). First of all, he should of told us the room we booked was not available...not just try to send us to another room and hope we don't notice. He claimed the people in the room we booked extended their stay and refused to check out of that room. If you are the hotel manager it is your job to tell them they need to move to another room if someone booked it in advance. Why should that be my problem. We booked this room 3 months in advance. I spent probably an hour researching hotels on trip advisor and picked that room because it had a terrace with a view. I looked at many hotels and decided on this one based on the reviews...big mistake! Here is where it gets really bad...we had pre-paid online. After much arguing with the man he told us he would give us a refund, but claimed the credit card machine was down and they had no cash. He told us to write down our information and he would refund the card when the machine was back up. To this day we are battling with the credit card company and have filed a charge back. I am shocked by the good reviews, I can only guess they are writing them themselves. After seeing the rooms, this place is 1) way overpriced 2) these people don't know the first thing about customer service and 3) a bunch of dishonest crooks!!!

The rooms in the hotel are spacious, extremely well appointed and the beds are super comfy. What is very charming is that each room is different in shape and size. The bathrooms are also very well done. A huge AAA+ rating to Garden House on the rooms and cleanliness. What I found incredibly charming about the hotel was the \"garden\" of Garden House. It is a lovely space for dining as well as comfortable sofas to hang out. Breakfast is served here every morning and there is an all-day bar service available, as well as complimentary fruits, drinks. The hotel offers a small but complete menu for all-day dining as well. Since my friends and I have been to Istanbul several times, the garden was a focal point of our stay. The breakfast was excellent - Garden House goes beyond the traditional \"B+B\" fare and offers a cooked breakfast to order. This is the only hotel I have stayed in Istanbul that does this - and it really makes a difference. What makes Garden House truly special is the warmth and friendliness of the staff and the very high level of service. Just to give an example - the sole of one of my shoes came off within five minutes of me stepping out of the hotel. The staff immediately bought me a tube of glue (no charge!) and also offered to fix it. Ayhan - the manager - is an absolute gem. He is very welcoming, very helpful and goes out of his way to ensure that the hotel guests have a good stay.

Our room had all the luxuries of a 4 star in that there were toiletries, hair dryer, mini bar, kettle, bathrobes and slippers. However, there was mould in the bathroom and the room was more like a 3 star in UK standards. None the less, it was a friendly little hotel with a great selection for breakfast and the staff were very helpful.

It is a 5 minute walk from the hotel to all the main sites and a 10 minute walk to the grand bazaar (which is over rated) I was expecting a busy bazaar with stalls and haggling, instead it was more like a indoor shopping centre with shops. The spice bazaar which is a tram ride away is much better. Word of warning:- Always check your change as the locals may try to rip you off. We bought an ice cream for 2 YTL and paid the guy with a 50YTL note, he gave us 2 YTL back in change and when we questioned him, he denied we had given him a 50.

For example, the lack of a comfortable lounge area downstairs is a shame. There are some nice touches - free coffee/biscuits all day and plenty of travel advice from the friendly concierges - but beware of one of some of the hotel recommendations - a restaurant called Yengec for example charged us almost \u00c2\u00a3100 for our first night meal - and was unashamedly touristy, whilst a mixed hamam (Suleymaniye) charges a cute price for a bath only with no proper massage - i.e. not the full experience.

My own recommendation for a great meal by the way is Magnaura Cafe on the Akbryik Caddesi - great value, authentic (not touristy) and brilliant food. We did not get treated to a free pick up from the hotel by the way - it was charged to us at 30 Euros - steep cost when a local firm just around the corner charges only 5 Euros per person!! So, to put it into perspective, a pleasant hotel with some good touches but there are better for the money.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and Cosy\u201d", "Author": "surferboykrishan", "ReviewID": "UR23578040", "Content": "I stayed at the Garden House Hotel for 3 days and 4 nights.

I had booked a room well in advance but only days before we were due to travel, I was told that there had been an over booking for the first two days of our stay. I was initially offered a room at one hotel for the first two days; but after I found through research that this wasn't very good and costed much less than I had paid for my room at the Garden House, I was instead offered an alternative next door to the Garden House for the first two days, after which I would be upgraded in the Garden House for the remainder of the stay. I accepted this. The first hotel next door was okay; the owner did book my wife and I a room with a very nice view over the Marmara Sea, though the room was small. The water in this place was also undrinkable and smelled...but it was okay for two days as there's plenty of bottled water around. Then we moved to the Garden House...and this was much better. A well designed hotel, friendly staff (especially Kadir who gave help and directions whenever needed), and the water was clean (though I didn't try to drink any - I opted for the bottled water they give you for free every day). The hotel It is situated in an old residential area which adds a touch of authenticity to a stay in the 'Old Part of Istanbul' as the area around the sights has been developed. The buffet breakfast is the same every day but there is a good selection, it is constantly topped up, and the jams are superb!!! The morning call to prayer isn't as loud as some people had said in reviews (maybe it's just me), but as a Muslim, it was enough to wake me up for the pre-sunset prayer - makes a change to my alarm clock which usually performs this function back in the UK. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the Blue Mosque and another 3 minutes to Ayasofia. Yes there is quite a steep climb from the hotel which my wife struggled with occasionally but it was fine - that can't be changed. Food is available during the day and we ate there twice - it was a tad pricy for what was offered but it tasted good. There are some very good restaurants around though. I would recommend Cesme (pronounced Cheshme) which you find by turning right out of the hotel, then turn right at the bottom of the hill - it is on your left). The food was nice, the staff very friendly, and for less 30 YTL, we ate handsomely - a very good deal. There isn't a no smoking area though and so smoke did come over to our table which was a bit unpleasant. Mozaik Restaurant which is a short walk from Sultanahmet tram station, and Sultanahmet Fish Bar which is close-by to that were also very good experiences which I would recommend - these are pricier than Cesme but the food is very good. If you get lost then the locals would be unlikely to tell you where the hotel is - it is buried amongst a maze of streets. You would be better to use the Blue Mosque as your Centre, as I did, because from there because it is a 5 minute walk back down the hill. Take a good pair of walking shoes too as the the cobbled streets going up from the hotel, and those in the Grand Bazaar can play havoc with your feet...

The room itself was lovely (number 603) with one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in (to the point where we found it hard to force ourselves to get up and go see the sights!). Everything was spotlessly clean and the bathroom was airy and well laid out with some very nice smelling soaps and shower gels. We decided to go out to eat and thought it would be a good idea to ask the receptionists advice but instead of a quick recommendation we were taken to the breakfast room for a cup of apple tea and a virtual tour of the city! Firstly, the manager laid out a big map of Istanbul and showed us where everything was, then he talked us through all the tours he could arrange for us before recommending a couple of nice nearby places to eat. I have to recommend Cesme - another reviewer mentioned it and it is truly fabulous - if you turn right out of the hotel and walk a few seconds to the bottom of the hill then turn right you'll see it on your left. We walked in and were taken to the upstairs dining room where we experienced some of the best food and service ever. The meze is great, the wine is gorgeous (we had a white called Andura), the main courses were varied and well cooked and the puddings divine (have the baklava!!) and after a truly chilled out 3 hour dinner the bill came to about \u00c2\u00a330, wonderful!! For a transfer to the hotel from Sabiha Gokcen (which is where you'll fly to if you go with EasyJet) use www.istanbulairporttransfers.com - they charged only 20 euros each person return and took you directly to your hotel door (the drive can be around an hour if there's traffic so it's a great price). The breakfast at Garden House is yummy and constantly freshened up by the attentive staff and the dining area is light and airy. At night they serve drinks and food in there and it's a nice place to relax after a long day sightseeing (or after your dinner at Cesme!). We took the all day tour that cost 60 euros and it was well worth every penny - it takes in all of the main sights and you have a great local guide who gives you the sort of insider info that you'd never get from guide books.

We stayed for 10 nights. The best thing is of course the people at the front desk. They always had a top-notch person there. Kadir, Selcuk and Bulent all spoke excellent english and gave us a lot of good advice. They were always very courteous, professional and patient. I had done a lot of research and every day would ask the best way to get somewhere, etc. They would find out if something was closed and when. These guys were like having the best concierges in town at your beck and call 24/7 with minimal wait, unlike some of the big hotels. Our room at garden house was a triple (for two of us). We faced the courtyard and the call to prayer was really beautiful. The first morning we did not realize one of the many windows was partially open so it was pretty loud...at about 4:30 in the morning. On subsquent nights we made sure all windows were closed and most mornings we didn't notice or slept right through and we are both light sleepers. The air-conditioning was excellent--something that was very important to us. It was also very quiet, not a noisy window unit. We had to be careful about space management in the room but there was definitely enough room for everything if you gave it some thought. No chairs in room, which was probably better for space, we sat on the beds. Some noisy construction only in the afternoon. The location is great. Close to everything, a hilly walk, not for people with mobility issues, but you can have a taxi in 2 minutes when you want it. Comfortable shoes are a must. If you need a taxi to get you back to hotel have your cell phone ready, they may need to get instructions from hotel , it is hard for drivers to find. Another suggestion is to have them drop you off near the Hippodrome/Blue mosque area and walk to hotel. Room was decorated prettily and fruit basket and bottled water were always on hand. We brushed teeth with tap water and had no problems. Our airport transfers were included due to the length of our stay and they really took care of that well. They know how much time you need depending on the day and time. I would highly recommend you use them for transfers. Breakfast was outside in a sheltered courtyard, some covered tables available if it rained, which happened once. The weather was perfect in the morning and large trees kept it even more comfortable. There were no bugs and no mosquitoes! They have a cook ready to make eggs or omelets to order. Everyone in the restaurant area was courteous and helpful. Housekeeping staff were also very attentive and meticulous. We sure hated to leave!

We booked Garden House via Venere.com for a last minute price of 99 euro per night. When we arrived, we took a taxi to the hotel for 26 euro - already we were impressed with the prices in Istanbul. The Garden Hotel is well known for its warm welcome from the front staff, inclusive of directions and recommendations (in english) and choice of cocktail to start you off. Location is awesome, 10 minute walk to the Blue Mosque and St. Sophia. A 5 minute walk and you will end up at the ocean near the fish market (I wouldn't recommend you be there at night). The hotel offers a daily newspaper in many languages and free internet. Tucked in the middle of a neighbourhood, we were lucky to be provided the 2 best rooms on the 4th floor. They were very roomy, appointed well with lots of windows, mini bar and coffee machine. One room faced the garden which became quite noisy when the prayers resinated from the mosques at 4 in the morning. The other room faced the neighbourhood road where families could be seen enjoying life. Lots of fun listening to the venders walking up the streets calling for rubbish disposal, for sale of watermelons or propane. The breakfast (included) is very good however, good luck getting any cooked eggs. The restaurant staff have very little english and they don't really seem like they want to make any eggs for you. One staff member, a woman, just simply ignores you - oh well, the beauties of a different culture. We were actually entertained by this and ended up talking to the front reception person who asked the staff to cook some eggs. The rest of the breakfast includes very good coffee, buns, meats, cheese and juice. Very nice to have breakfast included. A 2 minute walk to many amenities - liquor store, restaurants, farmers market on some days, and a great leather store called Trust Leather. We were so impressed with 2 jackets we had made for us, we bought 3 more. Trust Leather is just around the corner from the hotel and has is attached to a scarf & turkish delight store. The owner speaks excellent english and is very strong about what type of jacket fits what type of body shape - he did not lead us astray. Never leave the hotel or restaurant without a few crumbs for the neighbourhood cats - they are everywhere.

Each morning there is a continental breakfast and coffee/tea available in a beautiful airy garden courtyard.

They could not have been more pleasant or accommodating to their guests. If you stay at the hotel, make sure to bring earplugs, as the call to prayer from the nearby mosques will wake you each morning very early (at 4:35 am when I was staying there).

The most direct route is steep and may make you short of breath, but walking around the steep rise is easy and only takes you a couple of additional minutes. We also found that the staff provided us with very good advice on where to go and what to see, as well as restaurant recommendations which were spot-on. The hotel is not in the very poshest part of Sultanahmet, which we came to discover is wall to wall hotels and shops. There are, however, plenty of small and what seem to be relatively recently refurbished hotels and guest houses around the Garden House, too, and for your added benefit, you may get a feel for what the area was before the renovation started.

I was a bit disappointed that there was no comfortable chair but my wife tells me the room was great, so clearly I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrong! In the old city there is no shortage of mosques and each is equipped with loud-speakers so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss the opportunity to listen to the local mullah calling the faithful to prayer. Unfortunately at any given point in Sultanhammet you can hear three or four mosques competing in volume and anguish for the available Muslims to come and visit.

The front desk was manned throughout by English-speakers who had a good command of the language and who seemed always to want to resolve all of our problems and did so; in fact one is an ex-biology teacher who says that he chose to do hotel work because he likes to see happy people, and he is good at making that happen!

He picked us up from the train station the day we arrived from Athens, and he is taking me to the airport tomorrow, and he even brought me to the Spice Market and came shopping with me! I adore him and wish I could take him back to NY!! He would be a great manager at any top ranking hotel in NYC. He is a very special person. He recommended a local restaurant near the hotel, and we've gone there every night. It's called DOY DOY...the food is fabulous and cheap. It's where the locals go. In fact, tonight I was too lazy and tired to walk up the hill, and the restaurant has a delivery bike. The delivery is very different here. They bring the food on regular plates....you eat...and then they come back and pick up the plates, and then you pay. Very interesting! This hotel is in the old Sultamanet area of Istanbul, which is where you want to stay. It's very centrally located, and you can walk anywhere from here. Enjoy the Garden House in Istanbul.
