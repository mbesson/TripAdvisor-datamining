{"Reviews": [{"Content": "I loved this hotel I loved this hotel for a few reasons. It was beautifully decorated in cooling stone and had comfortable rooms. I had a lovely view of a field with cows in it and felt instantly Bali-ised. The hotel was not overly large, which was perfect for us and the pool and spa was lovely. It felt very Balinese. We enjoyed the food here and ate lots of meals by the pool without any complaints (even our son loved the food which was a mix of Asian and Western).the place is away from the crowded tourists areas which I liked and was really peaceful and relaxing. The bar was nice and the barman super friendly.The only issue for me was the location. It was far from everything though you could walk down the road through the nusa dua shops. We got ripped off with getting a driver (dumb tourists that we are) and paid twice what we paid in Ubud. In the end it didn't matter too much; just getting absorbed in holiday costs and i felt the hotel was worth it as a great place to come back to and chill out.Forget the beach though; unless they've cleaned it up. they drive you out to their stretch of beach and it's filled with rubbish. Really not sure why they bothered with that...Mind you we were there before tourism took off again and so everyone was stretched; they may have just neglected the beach at that time and it may be better now.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR904671125", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "sasssoul"}, {"Content": "Great hotel, chic rooms. We have been to this hotel multiple times since they opened couple years back. We love the rooms in this hotel. This is an apartment-type hotel, all have either 2 or 3 rooms, complete with kitchen, dining room and living room. The price is reasonable.The goods:1. Rooms: big, even for apartment standard. It is bigger than my previous 2-bedroom apartment. My son and daughter loved it there.2. View: is great. It is hill side, so we can see both sides of the island, Benoa and Kuta.3. Cleanliness: maybe because it is one of the newer hotels.4. Staffs: great personnel.5. Pools: 2 pools, one on rooftop and one groundfloor. Really loved the rooftop pool.Not so OK:1. Breakfast buffet is kind of boring, although they have complete menu. It is also on rooftop.2. Location: not beach front. But mid-way between Kuta and Nusa Dua.", "Date": "Mar 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR611884222", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Wilibona"}, {"Content": "Great Value, Great view, Inconvenient Location       Roof Pool", "Date": "Dec 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR137781183", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "WorldWanderMan"}, {"Content": "Its a business hotel with panorama       Lobby at night", "Date": "Nov 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR244867825", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ivanhoe2007"}, {"Content": "Honest impression Our stay was in the third week of August, we just managed to squeeze in a week of holiday before my daughter's summer was up. I visited the property before and had a wonderful time and so this time I decided to return to the same hotel. My impression was:- Hotel was definitely busier than the last time we stayed there, however the service during breakfast or room cleaning are still the same, very efficient.- Plenty of loungers available at the main pool as well as the roof-top one, no need to fight for lounge chairs.- The weather was awesome, cool during early mornings and evenings, a bit hotter noon time.- The hotel's rate has always been very reasonable and since I prefer a large space, even though it was only the two of us I chose the 3 bedroom apartment. I had a couple of friends came over and stayed for a couple of days and it was great to be able to accommodate them.- The apartment we stayed on supposedly had an internet connection but didn't work and so I used the wifi by the lobby and main pool area. You have to pay for the internet, but cheap (30,000 rph / 3 hours).- The staff was wonderful as always, sent us to Kuta market and Discovery Mall during the day and picked us up at night.All in all, it was a great deal and my daughter and I had a wonderful time together. We felt like we were not tourists there, somehow by not choosing to stay in Kuta or in one of those cookie-cutter 5 star Nusa Dua hotels we managed to let ourselves blend in into a more relaxed, a more 'down-to-earth' Bali.", "Date": "Oct 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR608794984", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Lovina"}, {"Content": "Very cool contemporary designed suites + 2 pools + 2 TV's (great for kids)       Our fav infinity pool with the bay in the background", "Date": "Jun 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR843310849", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "chuckchung"}, {"Content": "un appartement-hotel et non un hotel   showReview(19645408, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR423131043", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1191333-d631972-r17610237-Swiss_Belhotel_Bay_View-Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "631972", "Price": "$336"}}
