We then were given two single rooms (as two guys i'm not suprised at their backwards reaction, but irritated that i didnt challenge them at the time).

Needless to say we didnt challenge them as we were exhausted from travelling. We changed and went straight out. Throughout our stay i was very consicous of the security (or feeling of a lack thereof). Breakfast on the first day was appalling: arriving at the downstairs breakfast room were we're nodded at to take a seat and my partner was given a plate of eggs and toast - no asking what he wanted, just given it. (It seemed that someone had ordered it and then changed their mind so the lady placed in front of him. I had plain toast and had to ask for preserves and butter).

It seemed pleasant enough from the outside. Booking had been tricky as the hotel had messed up my credit card numbers and threatened to cancel my reservation with one days notice. They sorted it eventually however it was not a very secure method of payment. On arrival, I was then asked for my card again and charged the full price of the room (\u00a3220 for two nights I might add!) when I questioned that I had already given my card details the man at the reception said they had taken one nights payment as a deposit and then needed the full amount (essentially meaning the room cost \u00a3330 over the weekend) and leaving me short of spending in money. To add insult to injury, having paid for the room, the reception then informed us that they had no double rooms available and that we would be staying in separate single rooms on different floors. So much for a romantic weekend away. As two men travelling together I assume they thought we wouldn't mind however I was really disappointed that we didn't get the double room I'd booked. I would at least have expected them to tell us before we arrived let alone before they took payment. The rooms were cramped but clean however the bathrooms were tiny and barely usable. The shower was a dribble and leaked all over the room. There was water dripping through a light fitting from the room above in one of the bathrooms. Breakfast was terrible. The staff spoke no English and did not understand the orders that people were making. An extra portion of breakfast had been made for another table so it was plonked unceremoniously in front of me. 'Breakfast' was an omelette and three pieces of dry toast. You had to ask for condiments and these came in dishes that had clearly been out on tables then topped up and put back in the fridge. The breakfast room had fewer seats than the capacity of the hotel and people had to queue outside to wait for breakfast.

It's no secret that accomodation in London is a little bit on the expensive side so when we saw this hotel for just \u00a350 a night (including breakfast) it just made sense. And the fact that it's just a three-four minute walk to Paddington made it even more appealing, especially as we didn't roll into the station until nearly 9pm. As stated in other reviews the recpetion area at the Hyde Park Court is plush compared the rest of the hotel. You walk in and are greeted by a member of staff on reception; check-in was extremely quick and we were told that our room (B03) was downstairs - crossing the threshold and into a timewarp which sends you back to decour and furniture which resembles that of the 1970s. But it was clean - contrary to what others have said - with the only signs of uncleanliness the smattering of paint on the door and headboard etc from when the room was last painted. This bedroom was small and the bed wasn't really comfortable. There was a TV on the wall which provided freeview - though a \u00a310 deposit had to be left on reception in order to get a remote - and the bathroom, which had a shower, was clean and spacious. But being one level down you had to put up with the constant noise of the underground trains which whizzed by until about midnight, and starting up again after 5am. This wasn't ideal and did interrupt my sleep, but for the price for two of us to stay in London we had no real qualms. The bedroom was right next to the breakfast room, again ideal, and the offer of egg/toast was available from the couple running the small kitchen - who some would say didn't quite know what they were doing - along with the usual croissants, rolls, sesame seed burger buns (!), cereal, tea/coffee/orange juice, biscuits, and cup cakes....! Check out was at 11am and as we weren't planning to leave London until later that day I enquired as to where we could leave out luggage. The only option is to leave it in front of reception, in view of everyone else, and you're given a belt to wrap around it. And as we didn't want to wheel the cases around London we just did it, but made sure no valuables were left in the luggage. We wouldn't rush back to this establishment in any hurry, but for what you pay for in the heart of London then you can't really have any complaints. The staff were extremely friendly and if all you're doing is using the hotel as a base then you'd get by staying at the Hyde Park Court.

I haven't got much money so i felt lucky to find a central hotel with nice looking rooms (as shown in website photos) and breakfast included, for a decent price. Upon arrival on 10th September I was told that the room was not ready yet and that we could leave our bags with them. We had to tie them together for some reason. We agreed, thinking they would be kept in a safe, locked room but we were told to leave them in front of the front desk, whilst people were constantly entering and leaving the building.

Our initial impression of the room was that it was small, dirty looking, outdated and dark, with the only window facing the corridor inside so you had to have the curtains closed at all times for privacy and the window closed in case anyone broke in. We tried not to worry about it as we wanted to enjoy our weekend and just thought of t room as just a room and its condition didn't matter. However, we returned to the room at midnight after our evening out and took abit more time to examine the room. The shower curtain was old and dirty Red cushions on the bed were stained Carpet was dusty and had cobwebs all over it Cobwebs behind bed Exposed electrical wiring on fan wire Grill missing off front of fan - could cut off fingers where fan is in motion, which it had to be as the room was so hot. Nothing was PAT tested No television remote Bed bugs/fleas. We were both bitten by something and i squashed two fleas. One in the bed and one in the bathroom Noise from underground trains, guests going along corridor in morning No mirror in bathroom Springs coming through mattress!!! I had to call someone back home to check the tripadvisor website for reviews and there was a review for the room we were staying in. It was a bad review and they had found the same things wrong as we had. I straight away went upstairs to reception to complain and see about getting a different room. The night porter could not help us as he did not have the authority to give us a new room which was fair enough but he promised that the manager would be there in the morning and that we would get a new room then. He was lying. We would have left straight away if we knew we would not get a different room. Breakfast was poor. A small room with dirty wallpaper. We sat down and my boyfriend was offered toast, egg or beans. I was offered nothing. We were brought toast but not given plates so we had to ask for them. The butter, jam and chocolate spread had crumbs and debris in it. We were given cups for tea or coffee but there was no sign of where to fill it.The croissants were out of date. We packed straight away and went to complain to the manager but he was not there. We spoke to someone called Ash who could not give us another room as they were fully booked and could not refund us as we booked through an agency. This meant we had no money to find another hotel and at such short notice we wouldn't be able to anyway. We checked out on the 11th September, 1 day early and had to sleep in our car that night. The room is appalling and i would not expect anyone to stay in it, no matter how desperate they are for a room.

We specifically booked this hotel after checking that there was a left luggage room, only to find that the left luggage room was in fact a corner of the reception area (not even behind the reception), this meant leaving our luggage for all and sundry to have a fiddle with if they wanted. I would like to say though that we were given a piece of rope to tie our luggage together (dont quite know why). On checking in we were directed to room B01 (if you are unlucky enough to get this room, I would run immediately as it is the pits). After descending the stairs to the basement, down some very steep and very poorly carpeted stairs (each stair being half the depth of an average foot and the carpet overhung each step so this was very dangerous) we entered room B01..........oh my god, a room for 3, which would probably house 1 person in the real world. There was a small room with a toilet and a basin, which will only house you if you are about 6 stone or less. The worst was yet to come.......there was what was supposed to be a shower which was housed in what was once a cupboard in the middle of the open bedroom (glass shower doors!). Basically, you would have to strip off in front of everyone in the room, have a shower in full view of all your friends, then you would have to get someone to pass you a towel so you could step back into the bedroom to dry off. Realising there would be no privacy whatsoever, and that this was ridiculous, I went upstairs and asked to be given another room. This time we were give B02. A tad better than the other room, a little bit bigger and with a small shower room come toilet. The shower had no tray, but at least it had a door! mold everywhere The kettle didnt work, there was a blood stain on one of the sheets, the windows were all cracked (which was painted over so you could not see out!)_, the net curtains were filthy and way too long, the bed was adorned with fancy cushions that obviosly only get washed on a yearly basis, it was impossible to get enough sleep as the tube station was directly underneath the hotel and all you could hear up til about 12 and from around about 5.30 was the tubes whizzing by and staff in the reception above us (it sounded like they were playing marbles with bolders). The breakfast room was small to say the least, in fact I was embarrased for a larger built lady who had absolutely no chance of getting out of her chair once sat in it (elbow to elbow with people sat next to you). The cereals (choice of rice krispies, cornflakes, museli and cocoa pops) were in dispensers and my 8 year old nearly ate the lid of the dispenser on day one after it fell into her bowl with the cereal!!!!! on the first day the waitress offered toast, beans and egg (offered in that order, individually to each of us seperately)! the second day there was no offer of beans! she smiled a lot though so that was nice. The condiments for the table were spread, jam and nutella, all 3 (seperately) in a silver condiment style holder - obviously scooped out of their original containers and placed into this holder - I just could not face this, I much prefer to see what spreads I am eating - especially as on the second day we were given the condiment holder from the table next to us after the guest had left!!! crumbs and all - yuck No sniff of brown bread, cheap tea bags and sachets of coffee and people sitting outside our room whilst awaiting a table made breakfast an ordeal I have just asked my 8 year old if she wanted to add something to this review and she said 'it stank'.

Breakfast was included in the rate but you're better off skipping what they serve you altogether. Stale cereal and bread with tea/coffee.

The room was filthy, with rips and stains, including blood, on the bedspreads. The bathroom smelled like an open sewer and even with the one window propped open over night and the fan going, we could not use the bathroom except for emergencies. The smell was even coming from the shower drain! The photos on line looked nothing like the reality. The price included breakfast, however we were afraid to eat here considering the lack of cleanliness in the room. Stay away! It is better to pay a bit more and feel comfortable and clean.

Bed was quite old, same as all interiors include of the bathroom. Room and bathroom where very small and only 1 towel per person. Only small staircases, no lift, and no smoke detectors inside rooms. No hangers in whatsoever way. There was a waterboiler with coffee and teabags, but when opened the waterboiler there was old water inside together with lime inside swimming. Don't know how long it was inside. Rooms have to be paid in advance. If front rooms, nice view to small park. Quiet street, though only 2 min walk to shops/restaurants and 3 min walk to Paddington station. Breakfast was very simple. Staff was friendly, but not \"overfriendly\". Can only recommend, if budget is very tight.
