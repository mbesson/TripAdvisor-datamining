We just went with the flow & thought we'd deal with things as they came. It was all supposed to be stress free. When we got to Branson, MO, we saw this hotel on our way through downtown. The outside is neat & looks like an old Victorian house. We liked how the entrance was different. After my boyfriend went inside to see if they had any rooms available, he came out with three nights booked for our stay & an actual KEY. I guess that should have been our first clue since majority of nice hotels have swipe cards for their doors now. Walked in & it actually didn't seem too bad at first for what we paid... but our mind-set completely changed when we both sat down on the bed. It was HARD as a rock. I'm not being sarcastic. I could have laid down on a rock next to Fred Flinestone & been more satisfied. I was very upset about the mattress being so uncomfortable. You'd think they would have some common courtesy about what their guests would be sleeping on. While I was checking out other things in the room, my boyfriend messed around with our air conditioner. He flicked on the air as low as it would go b/c we both like the atmosphere to be freezing when we sleep. We then went walking for a few hours to sight-see. When we came back the room was still stuffy & hot. It was going to be a horrible night. In fact, when we both got in bed we started looking for another hotel to stay in. Neither one of us fell asleep until after midnight. I actually ripped the comforter off the other bed & put it underneath my sheet just for cushion. I had bad back pain most of the next day thanks to that bed. The only nice thing I can say about this hotel is that they didn't question giving us our money back & we were able to book at The Raddison for the next two nights. We were much happier with our stay there.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilburton, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "ladydiana_104", "ReviewID": "UR133712524", "Content": "They were very nice and attentive to your needs.

Unfortunately, there was nothing at all appealing about our room or our stay. We got the regular double queen room (and by looking in empty windows I could tell that the double queen room was the redheaded stepchild of the rooms and treated as such. First, it looked like a motel room out of the70's era. The coffee maker was in the bathroom (gross!) and there was a dead cockroach on the bathroom floor. This was suppose to be a non-smoking room but the stench of cigarette smoke was overwhelming when you first walked in and you could smell it on the covers...which makes you wonder how often they are washed. After getting settled we decided to try the outdoor pool and hot tub. After barely getting in the pool we noticed lots of spiders swimming around and one was rather large with hundreds of baby spiders on her back! I managed to fish her and the babies out with a shoe (and the babies all scattered in different directions) but when I saw the dead scorpion in the pool..I was done. We figured we would just make do with the hot tub. It was cleaner than the pool water anyways. We turned on the jets and got in..only to realize it was not a hot tub, as the water only barely got up to \"luke warm\" status. There was no option to make the water hotter... only a timer on the jet stream. After a fitful night sleep on the very uncomfortable beds we went to the \"delux\" continental breakfast at 8am...(which is about when the cleaning people start knocking on your door to come in. A little early, no? And they are dressed like street thugs besides.) The eating room was frigid and the food was gross. Cold, hard biscuits with luke warm white gravy. There was no French Toast as promised. And don't most \"deluxe\" continental breakfasts offer eggs and some sort of meat? This one had neither. There was coffee, juice, milk, cereal, pre-frozen waffles, biscuits and gravy and canned tropical fruit. There were about 10 people in there and nobody looked very happy.

This place isn't fancy, but for the reasonable rates I wasn't expecting it to be. Our first time here we stopped in because of the great rates listed on the sign. This place has several buildings, with the back two being surrounded by trees on all three sides (even though it's right on the strip). We don't ever book ahead (since it's the slower season) and we request a room in the back building. It's so quiet back there that we can nap during the day if we want. The rooms have always been clean, and except for the one day we slept in real late, the maids have always come by and cleaned our room while we were out for the day. We've only been to the breakfast room a few times, as we're usually not up for the early breakfast hours. It's not a big breakfast spread, but I wouldn't expect much with the reasonable hotel rates.
