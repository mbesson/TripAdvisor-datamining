{"Reviews": [{"Content": "dive and snorkel from the beach We arrived to see the young guy at reception glued to the TV screen watching the British Grand Prix. Whilst my husband talked motorracing, I was shown a large bright and clean room with ensuite bathroom. Perfect! Ten steps towards the beach was the washing area for diving gear and five more steps brought us to a large bar and restaurant area right by the sea. It had the usual wide range of fruit juices and a good selection of food. The staff were keen to help and very good humoured. The beach is black and very stony but at high tide it is easy to snorkel directly from the hotel steps. The water is very clear and the variety of reef fish is fantastic. If you walk a short distance to the left, you can dive or snorkel right above the famous shipwreck (mentioned in the guide books). This was the highlight of our stay. It was relatively easy to get transport here (we arrived here by local regular service bus from Singaraja and the driver drops you where you want). The only downside to Tulamben: we came from the west and north of Bali and this was the first time we encountered hassle from local beach vendors!", "Date": "Nov 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR151884850", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Englishtravelfanatic"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469406-d777208-r10726286-Paradise_Palm_Beach_Bungalows-Tulamben_Bali.html", "HotelID": "777208", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
