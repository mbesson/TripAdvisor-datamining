LOCATION a bit far from the city center. but it's right next to a bus that takes 5 minutes to get to Termini station (a lot of buses and both major metro lines of rome available). if you walk along Nomentana to the cross street Torlonia, there's the 62 bus. it goes to the major city center (via del corso, st peter's basilica). although it may get crowded on the bus it's worth it 'cause it's the fastest way around. because it's not in the city center, the hotel is quiet and in a safe neighbourhood. RESTAURANTS AROUND HOTEL WORTH YOUR WHILE (1) MERCURI - #65, Viale 21 Aprile (cross street Giacomo Boni, 15 mins away walking distance from hotel) - cafeteria/pick up and go style of restaurant, super good food, freshly made and various selection of pizza, pastas, salads and side dishes. great value for your buck. paid around 30 euros for such a good meal that filled us for the next 7 hours. my mom stated that they had the best eggplant parmigiana she ever tasted in her life. in all the restaurants we went to, this one was the best! (2) XIN DU - #13 Viale 21 Aprile (near Via Ridolfino Venuti, 10 mins walking distance away from hotel) - chinese cuisine, a la carte selection. very freshly made a great change from all the pastas and pizzas we had. we all took soup, spring rolls and ordered three dishes that we shared. it filled us up and was cheap (25 euros). we never though we would eat in a chinese restaurant, reading an english menu in an italian country... ironic but so cool. very good service and food. (3) MARINARI GELATERIA - #97 Corso Trieste (cross street Viale Gorizia which is the street right next to the hotel, 10 minutes walking distance from hotel) - had a bunch of selection of gelato, around 20-25. very cheap too. one of the cheapest we found in rome. (2.20 euros for medium size cup). (4) RISTORANTE CARLO MENTA - #101 Via della Lungaretta (not near to hotel but in Trastevere... take 62 bus and then switch off to take Tram 8, get off after too stops and you'll be in proximity to the restaurant, around 30-40 minutes away from hotel in all; it's worth it though) - we took from their fixed menu 13 euros per person and we all got to chose from a fixed menu with one choice of appetizer (bruschetta), 4 choices of entree, 4 choice of a main dish and 3 choices of dessert. the cover charge is only included in the fixed menu... so if you take from their wide selection of dishes (people sitting next to us had lamb and pizza), the cover charge is 1.50 euros per person. hope this information helps. to anyone who's going to rome, enjoy it. it's simply beautiful!", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "NordSL", "ReviewID": "UR123774080", "Content": "The hotel is a bit far from the center of Rome, but in very calm and attractive district.

There are the streetcars as well...Just hard to be fully informed at times! Also - subway closes at 11:30, buses at 12, and there are a few night buses in a few places, but be prepared that you might need to spend a bit on cabs as well as hotel rates.

My traveling companion has severe asthma, and we had checked the website ahead of time to ensure that the hotel offered air conditioning, which she needs when she stays overnight. However, contrary to what the website said, there was no functioning air conditioning at all, and the room was stiflingly hot and unbelievably stuffy, with no air flow even with the windows open. I mean, it was like Dante's inferno in there. My companion simply could not breathe. The clerk was very nice and found us another hotel at about 10:00, but we were also charged for the night, which I think is very bad customer service. (We didn't even stay there!) We arranged for this hotel because the website said there was air conditioning, and there was none. I don't know why we would then be charged for the night, especially because we had to leave for medical reasons at about 10:00 and didn't get to spend the night we were charged for! Because of this, we will not stay there again. If the weather were cooler, and if we didn't have this medical issue, I'm sure things would have been different, so I don't want to steer others away from this charming place.

For the first 2 nights the neighbors alarm kept going off all (I repeat, ALL) night long. To add to the traffic and alarm noise, our room was directly adjacent to the outdoor garden eating/smoking area, so we had that added nuisance all evening.

The bedspread on the bed was filthy and smelly, but when we put it outside the room, they replaced it with a clean one. Each room seems to be different in size and shape, from tiny to fairly large.

About 10 years ago I stayed here because it was close to the office with which I was associated. About two years later I returned on a business/pleasure trip and decided to stay here again. About 10 minutes after I checked in, a maid to came to my door with two dress shirts I had forgotten on my prior trip. They had been cleaned, pressed and folded beautifully, without charge, and with no indication from me that I had intended to return. On this last visit I took my daughter, son-in-law and 9 year old granddaughter for a 9 day visit at Easter. The hotel has been refurbished and the facilities are even more inviting than before, but the staff had the same personal concern and attention to our needs, arranging tickets for the Borghese Galleria and for the Rapido to and from Florence, with no extra charge and a with genuine desire to make our visit as convenient as possible. I have stayed in fine hotels in Rome (on more than 50 visits there) and throughout the world, including the Santa Caterina in Amalfi and the Mezzatorre on Ischia, but the Hotel del Parco always comes to mind when I think of my best hotel experiences.", "Date": "April 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201c4 star service at 3 star prices, location is a minus\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1774092", "Content": "We found this from Karen Brown's website. The B&B itself is wonderful - very nice rooms, staff speak english & wait staff were helpful & friendly. The cappucino in particular is good & free (breakfash could be healthier). The neighborhood is upscale & residential so its not touristy at all. You're living in rome as the romans do. Further, the hotel is well provided for - they have a recommended cab service that was quite reasonable & they sell you metro tickets etc. They even offer umbrellas for rainy days, something you don't find in even the most upscale places in the US. Rooms can be noisy if you open the windows, otherwise peaceful. Ask for rooms in the back, not facing via nomentana. Our biggest gripe is the location. Its out of central rome & roughly 30 minutes away from anything you want to see - vatican, colosseum, spagna etc. Further, if you don't want to invest in learning the bus system then staying here can be difficult (bus sytem is notorious for pickpockets). The hotel is a 7 minute walk from the bologna metro station & there are no real restaurants/osterias or grocery stores in the vicinity. So you either walk a lot every day to the trains or you take cabs. Being frugal & paranoid re. scams, we walked but that was a little bit of a nuisance given that you spend a lot of time standing in the museums.", "Date": "April 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redwood City, CA", "Title": "\u201cA very cute hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1648771", "Content": "A very cute hotel.

We stayed in an older room on the first floor which was very clean and small. We were greeted by extremely friendly, helpful staff who wanted to attend to all of our needs. We were also given a complimentary bottle of champagne upon our arrival because it was our honeymoon. The buffet breakfast did not include meat, but it could be purchased. The top floor rooms are suggested because they are newer.
