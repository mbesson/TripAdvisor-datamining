We planned to leave our car at the hotel prior to departure, but could not find the hotel - it is a bit out of the way; ended up parking at the airport anyway.

It's a very modern and of course it has a European feel. The price is right even when you book it on the hotel's website. It was a little less than a hundred dollar per night for a king bed room. You get free WIFI, a nice roomy shower, and quite a spacious room. The design of the room is modern and doesn't have a weird odor. In general, this is a very pleasant hotel and I will definitely go back. The staff in the front desk and the waiters in the restaurant are helpful and easy to deal with. The few things which it can work on are the price of the breakfast buffet which is a bit much. For that reason, it's better to order the \u00c3\u00a0 la carte menu. Also, the water of the pool is way too cold. The whirlpool is fine but really the temperature of the pool can be raised a little bit. Another thing, this hotel is not exactly right next to the airport. It's about ten to fifteen minutes to the airport, depends how fast you drive. Yes, it's a little out of the way but the good thing is that you get to enjoy the tranquility without having an airport right next to you. If you are going downtown, it's about fifteen to twenty minutes with no traffic. Nowadays with the traffic in Montreal, I would suggest you park your car near a subway station and take the subway to downtown.

Natural light is abundant thanks to big windows, but there are room-darkening shades if you have the luxury of sleeping in. The bedding is simple and crisp. The room service menu is limited in terms of selection and serving time [hence my 4/5 stars], but the morning breakfast is excellent. The coffee is uncommonly good - and I say that without the qualifier \"for a hotel.\" It's just excellent. And, they serve some of the best breads I've ever had.

But if you are trying to stay close to the west island, this is probably the best place to stay. The reason we didn't rate this hotel any better is due to the staff, who seemed very harsh. Front desk was average. We had asked them for some dish soap, so that we could wash our baby bottles but the answer was \"No we don't have that\" Considering there was a restaurant in the hotel, they usually bring a little bit in a small cup. Second night they rant out of towels, which seems odd even with a full house. Either way it was an average stay for us considering there are a ton of places we could have stayed if there was availability that weekend.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cModern Clean Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jackiechandc", "ReviewID": "UR73523184", "Content": "Very modern clean hotel.

This well located hotel meant a short commute to Pointe Claire and Saint Laurent (very conveniently situated mid-position between both on the 40 and Henri-Bourassa.) Please note that this hotel would not be a good choice to visit downtown Montreal for sight-seeing given the inevitable traffic and total lack of public transit choices. I booked on the \"Accor\" website since this provided the best price quote. The rate is a little above what I would have liked to pay for what is basically an airport hotel. Quebec's punitive taxes obviously inflate the costs of staying here. The hotel room is very nice, modern fixtures, bed, WC facilites, European style, etc. The room is very clean. The rate I paid included a buffet breakfast. Normally I wouldn't even bother with a buffet but this was quite good with an adequate selection of fresh fruit. (And plenty of other \"less healthy\" food, like croissants and \"les viennoiseries\" of course.) WiFi Internet is included without extra charge. (Very commendable for this hotel to provide. Many are sneaking in $10-20 / day surcharges for internet.) Parking is free and very abundant on the hotel site. (The website really should mention this.) There is a minuscule sports centre on site (open 24 hours) and a pool no longer than about 10 meters. There is a YMCA nearby on St Jean street so little need to use the hotel facilities. Given however that this is classified as a 4 star establishment, I have some reservations applicable perhaps for someone here for an extended stay. The TV is a widescreen LCD, but they disabled the control to squeeze a 4:3 image into the screen. Telephones are available although an extra charge is added (but these days anyone staying here almost certainly has a cell phone). There are very small refrigerators provided (I suspect with the intent to provide a mini bar service). A small microwave was proved when I asked. Overall this is a good hotel and fit my needs almost perfectly.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cNovotel Montreal Aeroport Ruined Our Wedding!\u201d", "Author": "campinglover", "ReviewID": "UR48898503", "Content": "My Fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I booked all of our friends and family into the Novotel Montreal Aeroport because we found it to be relatively clean and modern looking. The problems began while negotiating the group rate. The staff refuses to return calls or provide follow up. This was of course our first warning sign but we were already committed to the venue. The experience continued while organizing the Rehearsal Cocktail party. After many cheeky emails from the hotel staff, we finally had to schedule a meeting with the hotel management in order to get a reply to our queries. The final straw came the day after our wedding. We realized that while frantically packing our things for the honeymoon and rushing to check out on our way to the wedding, we forgot a full (still wax sealed) 1.75L/60 oz bottle of Knob Creek in our room. When we returned the next day, the front staff said that the room had not been cleaned yet so he would follow up. He then proceeded to compliment me on my great taste in Bourbon. It has now been over a month and no sign of the whiskey or of a credit! In keeping with the trend, the hotel staff refuses to even reply to my emails. Whether it was disposed of by housekeeping or stolen by the staff, I don't care. We only wanted to have this resolved amicably because I do enjoy the Accor chain of hotels.

We were looking for reasonably priced hotels downtown to stay at for two nights, and couldn't find anything affordable. Turns out that weekend was Quebec's provincial holiday, St. Jean Baptist day, and I guess most of the downtown hotels decided to raise 2their rates. So we ended up staying at an airport outside the city with little expectations at around C$80.00 per night, but were we pleasently suprised! We ended up at the Novotel Airport, a hotel that has not even been around for a year. It was very conveniently located off the highway towards downtown (though the street signs in Montreal made it a lot harder to navigate). Once we arrived inside the main lobby looked very modern and upscale. We were greeted by the front desk clerks, one being Russell, who was very helpful and even provided a container to put flowers in for my girlfriend. The room itself was just as impressive and modernly styled as the lobby. We had a king sized room which included a plasma screen TV as well as an office desk and chair, a very comfortable lounge chair, and various dressers. The bathroom was just as impressive with a huge glass doored shower as well as a modern styled sink. Little extras in the room included a alarm clock with the ability to hook up to an mp3 player/ipod to it, a mini fridge as well as special night lights built into the headboard of the bed which could be turned on and of via touch sensor buttons on the nightstands on each side of the bed. The room itself was very clean, and the windows were huge, offering much chance for sunlight to brighten the room. Aside from the room the restaurant seemed very nice. We had breakfast the first morning there and had delicious crepes. They also had a pool and hot tub which we used both nights we were there. The pool itself was a bit shallow, meant for a lap pool I guess, but the hot tub was amazing! There was also a gym facility with a decent array of machines as well as two plasma TV's. The location of the hotel wasn't so bad either. Only a 10 minute drive to the nearest park and ride for Montreal's metro (subway station), we had access to all of downtown from it.
