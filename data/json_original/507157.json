The nuns are lovely and they help you wherever they can. They only speak italien! Use your hands while you are speaking and they will know what you want to tell them.The rooms are clean, calm but without luxury.Villa Agape is surounded by a beautiful garden with lots of flowers and olive trees. It takes 20 minutes on foot to get to the city center of Florence and around 30 minutes to get back up the hill. There is a bus stop in fornt of Villa Agape.A disadvantage is, that you can not stay out at night. The doors are closed at 22:30/23:00. If you want to enjoy Florence night life, Villa Agape is the wrong place to stay.

The moment I walked through the big ornamental gates, I felt like Maria in Sound of Music as a lovely elderly nun greeted me by name. Once owned by a friend of Galieleo Galilei and later the Duchess of Aosta, this fifteenth century villa is now run by the Sisters of Stabilite Carita. The rooms are beautiful and very comfortable. The 3 tier gardens are spectacular and the air is cooler since the villa sits on a hill overlooking the city of Florence. It was quite difficult for me to pull myself away from the villa and its tranquility while I was there. But then again, there was Michael Angelo's David, the Ponte Vecchio, and Ferragamo's shoe museum to see, and we cannot forget wine tasting at Antinori. Tuscany is Italy\u9e93s wine country, after all.Don't miss dinner at Villa Agape. The sisters truly live the meaning agape which was originally the love feast shared by the early Christians during the eucharistic celebration. The sisters serve sumptuous meals with all natural ingredients many of which they grow themselves. If you're vegetarian, Florence most probably has one of the widest selections of vegetarian dishes in Europe. About a 10 minute walk from the villa you can find one of the best restaurants in Florence. Trattoria Omero isn't cheap but it's worth it to eat such fine food overlooking the olive groves of Florence.", "Date": "Jan 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR509657452", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "vanda23"}, {"Content": "Beautiful convent, but a little out of the way Much better than average, as convents go. The beds were comfortable, rooms spacious and well-furnished, lots of nice common rooms, and georgeous formal gardens surrounding the villa. Costs was around 50 Euro per person, 72 for half board. There is a curfew. The only disadvantage is that there is a 10 minute walk up a steep hill from the bus stop and you will have a 30 minute walk to town if the busses are on strike, which seems to happen frequently. A taxi ride is about 7 Euro. I would definitely stay there again--getting away from the noise, traffic, and pollution in Florence is worth the slightly inconvenient location.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR757897795", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ntaga"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d507157-r7839751-Villa_Agape-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "507157", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
