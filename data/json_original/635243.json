The whole place stank of cigarette smoke and some of the male clientele reminded me of the boys my daughter would bring home, hoping to frighten us, her parents. I asked for a non smoking room on the top floor (reserved a week ago) and was summarily given a room on the middle floor. The desk person seemed more interested in chatting with girl than helping. Finally getting a room on the top floor I discovered the room stank of smoke, half the furniture was missing, the other half broken and there was no internet. I grabbed my belongings and told the receptionist, still chatting to his girl, that I would not be staying due to the inability of the hotel to remotely meet my needs. This upset him and he insisted my credit card had already been charged. I told him, in that case, reverse it or I would be. Life is too short to stay in this dump. I told my customer I had moved and they moved a group they had coming in for a conference too.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cClean, friendly, but thin walls and bad location\u201d", "Author": "DCtraveler0009", "ReviewID": "UR124310899", "Content": "I stayed here for one night leading up to the Super Bowl. The hotel is about 25 miles from the airport, which can be a rather expensive taxi ride. It's about 11 - 12 miles from the stadium downtown. The room was spotlessly clean and they provide a safe and there was a mini fridge in the room. However, you can clearly hear TV noise from next door rooms, moderate to low voices in the hallways let alone anything loud, and the heat / AC is rather noisey as well. The location of the hotel is next to a Wal-Mart, near a Kroger, and a few other chain restaurants. It's not in the best part of town. On my way from the airport, when we were about 3 miles from the hotel, we passed a few strip clubs and trailer park areas. I wouldn't want to walk anywhere from the hotel. So aside from having a clean room and friendly service at the front desk, I can't imagine ever coming back due to the noise and location.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daleville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here for business travel.\u201d", "Author": "Julia171", "ReviewID": "UR119558658", "Content": "This was a business trip and I booked this hotel online at Hotels.com because it was close accommodations for me. (5 mins away from my site) I thought this is great. Appearances are ok. When I arrived it was clean and I was assigned to room 121, which was across from the vending machines. I thought nothing of it since it was quiet at the time. However, later in the evening you could hear people travel to the vending machines until 1-2 am. Since I am a light sleeper I never got back to sleep. When I wanted to check out at 4:45 am because I had an early return flight, the front desk clerk did not know how to check me out. He proceeded to check me in and then check me out taking 30 minutes to perform a simple transaction. It took two days to speak with the manager and when I spoke with the manager about the inconvenience this caused me, turning in my rental car and almost missing my flight her attitude was very unprofessional and she was not a bit concerned about the inconvenience this had caused me. She admitted that the clerk was not informed about check out procedures because they used expedia.com. I explained to her that the clerk had no one else to call to check me out so I advised him to seek help from the 800 number on his counter and they walked him through checking me out, but now my original reservations were gone. The representative at the 800 number advised him to provide me with a discount for all the inconvenience. Ultimately it was the hotel manager\u2019s responsibility to give the ok. When I finally spoke with her, she declined the discount and advised that her night clerk had no knowledge of the check out procedures and they were not responsible for providing me with a check out or final bill. This might be one for the books but I thought every hotel checked you out and provided a final bill for your stay. I would not recommend this hotel for any business accommodations. Stay in a hotel where management is trained and have trained their hotel staff. A hotel where they are honored to have you as a guest and you are not an interruption of their day. The amenities. The breakfast food was out too long and the eggs were dried out and burnt. They didn't think to refresh them. My room was cleaned when I arrived but was half hazardly cleaned when I stayed in it.

Before I left, I asked for a fridge in the room, but I guess my note was not received or understood. The clerk told me that it was $10 and wheeled out a fridge from the front desk area. I had to wheel it to the elevator and plug it in myself. Not a complaint but little things like this matter to me and make all the difference to a stay for me. There was mold in the fridge but I didn't want to lug it all the way down again and I was tired. We cleaned it best we could. The rooms were comfortable and very clean, we got a king sized bed. The breakfast is the usual, waffles, cereals, coffee, eggs, bacon, bagels, toast and was always a good stock of items. Front desk staff were nice. The hallways are loud, like most hotels. People can be quite loud and inconsiderate sometimes, especially late at night. It is 5 minutes from Fort Harrison State Park, Walmart can be seen from the room window along with many restaurants. Applebees, Bob Evans, Marcos Pizza, Steak and Shake. There was a pool in the hotel that looked clean but small, looked sized for children.

While the accommodations are minimalistic, the construction of the 1.5 yr-old building is frightening. We stayed in Rm 202 and learned during a 5 minute shower that there is no cold water running to the bathroom, except for the toilet. Both water lines to the shower and sink were for hot water. Toward the end of the 5 minute shower the water was reaching scalding temperatures and nothing could be done to bring the temperature down. When asking Mike, the night clerk, about the problem he indicated that this has been an issue since the hotel was built, it exists throughout the hotel and there was nothing they could do about it. He could switch us to another room, but there was no guarantee there would be cold water available. At 10pm and facing a 6am alarm the next morning, we declined his half-hearted offer. Also, there was no offer to reduce the room charge despite the \"100% Guarantee\" advertised in the room. The hotel manager wasn't available the entire time we were there and has not contacted us since. Besides the hot water plumbing issue, the elevator did not have an inspection certificate posted inside. I've contacted coorporate offices and will be contacting local building inspectors to do whatever I can to make sure no one gets hurt during a stay at this location.

The property is fairly new, so as far as the condition goes, there were no complaints. The continental breakfast was about what you'd expect: cold and hot cereal, toast, bagels, pastries, fruit, yogurt, juice, milk, coffee and the all-important waffle maker. They also had biscuits and gravy, which were just okay. The indoor pool is supposedly heated, but it was a little cool for my taste. My wife and the baby couldn't stand to stay in very long at all, but our three-year-old twins didn't seem to mind it. The hotel did provide towels and pool toys, which was nice. The room was satisfactory. It was clean. The beds were comfortable. The front desk had to check to make sure it was ready when we got there, which I thought was odd--especially since we arrived after 4:00 pm. No problems though. It's adjacent to a Wal-Mart, which is convenient, if you need to pick up anything quick.
