The ice machine doesnt work on 2nd floor but it does on 3 the pop machine is 2$ it woulda been nice to have a snack machine as well. I asked for late checkout at 1pm was granted no problem at all the decor was nice renovated def a 3 *** hotel. Free newspapers during weekday free tootbrush i left mine at home. The tub is small so if ur a bigger person its hard fit the water pressure was low and the shower ever got hot like i wanted it to. The view out window was horrid roof but i only slept in hotel so no problem for me. Housekeeping starts at 8am and u do hear them parking was free location out of the way nothing nearby at all. Restaurant on premises is pricey no free breakfast never heard any planes i swear i forgot this was supposed to be near airport. Overall nice experience and i would def stay again. P.S.

As for the rest of our stay I don't have many positives, the room was dirty like it hadn't been vacuumed in the past several stays, the paint in the shower was peeling, the bathroom was almost too small to be functional, it too was dirty which was unsettling. The sleep number bed was awful since it was broken and was stuck on the hardest setting. The fan in the room was really loud, but necessary to block out outside noise.

After I got this one and read some of the reviews, I was all ready to find fault with it. But I can honestly say it's a perfectly decent hotel - aside from the fact that it's nowhere near where I'm spending my days but that's the risk you take with Priceline. Indy is so bizarrely spread out that it seems like you have to drive forever to get across town. I bid $40 and with taxes paid about $54. It's a little older hotel but has modern, dark wood furniture, a nice deep red color wall and carpet, and the room was large and overall fairly attractive, with a flat screen TV and lots of cable channels. I figured they would stick the Priceliners in an older room but I didn't. It is true that some parts of this place could use a fresh coat of paint ... it's located adjacent to a now-closed airport terminal and obviously would have been a hopping place in its heyday. There's a standard hotel bar and a restaurant ... nothing else over here except a Crowne Plaza hotel next door. I didn't really care that much - I just wanted to hole up early and watch movies. The front desk gals were very nice and sweet. The Internet was great, started right up with no need for a password. The towels were pretty thick and soft. I was traveling solo and got a two bed room - one of the beds was firm, the other was, strangely, busted up or something because it was really soft and moved around like a waterbed. Being someone who likes a very soft mattress, I slept fine on that one. I couldn't figure out how to activate the sleep number thing so didn't. Also, I had my car so brought my own sleeping bag and pillows and towels in case the linens were gross - they weren't, and I didn't use my own stuff. The room and bathroom was very clean. All in all, really decent for the price. Next time, I think I would just wait til I got here and find a new Microtel or something closer to where I need to be so I wouldn't have to drive all over the place. But aside from location -- again, a Priceline issue and my not understanding what a sprawling city this is -- I was really pretty happy with the Radisson. Airplanes do fly over but there wasn't any noise that bothered me. Accessibility was fine too - it's right off 465, easy to find. It's really close to the airport that is in service, if that's what you're looking for, and the desk lady said the shuttle runs 24 hours a day, every half hour.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cFairly good stay, HUGE room\u201d", "Author": "Susan C", "ReviewID": "UR121216620", "Content": "I booked a room through priceline so I ended up not getting any reward points for it, but it was still a good pitstop on our trip. I was headed to a conference in Chicago but the drive was too long to make it in one trip so we opted to stay in Indianapolis for one night. We arrived at 11pm and left at 8am so I can't comment on much of the extras of the hotel. The front desk was very nice and changed my room from 2 double beds to a single king size bed. I know it's something they would rather do anyway but what I was surprised with was the absolutely ginormous size of the room. It's the same as the person who posted about being the Guest of the Day room. I took pictures but it's easy enough to see it with the other reviewers pictures. It could have been easily split into 2 rooms. The tv was very nice and I loved the large soaps. My boyfriend didn't like the shampoo/conditioner (I used my own) but the bath soap was great. It had bumps on it for massaging purposes. Unlike other hotels, the bath soap and the facial soap was made of different materials. I contemplated on taking the rest of it with me but I didn't have a zip lock bag. Now the cons of it. The shower head was new and was one of those large head rain drop type but it was not screwed in stably into the wall. I felt like I was going to yank it off the wall when I moved it up. I'm also not from around here so I was not used to the taste of the water.. I would bring bottled water next time. The couch was a bit old with some stains and patches but the rest of the furniture was very nice (coffee table, desk, chair, tv, tv stand, huge bed). I did find quite a lot of brown thin hair on the bed. It was on the sheet, the top sheet, the comforter, the pillows, etc. I could not tell if they just rearranged it or actually washed anything. I also found a single flea crawling on me. I didn't find anymore and my boyfriend didn't get any bites so I believe it was just a single incident. I meant to bring the flea we killed to the front desk when we were checking out but we forgot about it. Our room was right next to the elevator. The front desk lady took a while to try to find a room away from elevator traffic so it was around the corner but we could hear it go up and down all night long. It wasn't loud enough to wake me up but did take longer to fall asleep. I didn't hear any planes until we were already up anyway.

So now it was the moment of truth, Room 550, what was I getting myself into? The room was just fine and very clean. I was at the end of the hall and heard no noise during my stay. I'm not sure if I actually had the sleep number bed, but I managed to sleep just fine with or without it. Yes the bathroom is a little bit small, but it was clean so I was happy. If you are an above average height then the shower might be a bit of a squeeze but it allowed me to practice my limbo moves. The only thing that I felt the room was really missing was a hotel binder of the amenities. I don't know if the other rooms have one, but I certainly didn't and I would have found this useful. On my last night of my visit I experienced some water issues and the front desk was less than helpful with this issue. First off they didn't answer the phone until I called the on duty manager number and then I received the ever so useful excuse of 'we are really busy'. When I explained the problem of having no hot water and the fact that the water was brown she said she would call me back, which she did. However she was trying to radio with maintenance and couldn't seem to figure out the radio so she placed me on hold.....for over 3 minutes. Dave the maintenance man then showed up at my door explaining that a water main had burst that day across the street so that's why there were water issues. He was most helpful and after I explained my dissatisfaction with the front desk Dave apologized for them and for the hotel. I found Dave's apology very sincere.

Of course, since it was near the airport, it was noisy in early evening & early morning. The room was clean but dark, even with 4 lamps lit, and the air conditioner unit was noisy. The room was either hot or too cold after running it for a while. The place is obviously older, & could use some upkeep/update, but it was clean & room was good size. It is \"average\", low 3-star rating by my estimation, but for the price was a good stay.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "tucker81", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing, especially for price\u201d", "Author": "tucker81", "ReviewID": "UR36496836", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel on Thursday evening & then again on Sunday evening to make commute to/from airport easier.

We had 6 banquet meals there--lunches and dinners- and the staff was wonderful and the food was great. There is a little bar in the hotel and Lilay, the bartender makes a great vodka martini! This hotel has the sleep number bed. I was not impressed, but it was comfortable.(I was expecting lots of variation with the numbers from the radio ads but there is not much difference from 65 to 90 ) One thing I did not like was the flourescent bulbs in all the lights in the room. That gave it an unnecessarily dingy look. They only gave us shampoo and a bar of soap. No shower cap, lotion or conditioner. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice. If like me you are there with a spouse who has things to do, avail yourself to a great day spa called the Mystique about a 10 minute drive away on Rockville Road .You will need a car probably, but the hotel offers shuttle service and I bet they would take you.

So while waiting for my bag to be returned to me, I called information and then called the hotel to check on availability -- no problem they said. I caught the shuttle over, but truthfully, I could have walked over. You can see the hotel from the baggage claim area of the airport. I then went to get a room, woefully explaining that my flight had finally been cancelled. I was given the \"inconvenienced traveller\" rate of $69 which is much less than the normal rate of $119. How nice to NOT be jerked around or ripped off when you've already had a stressful day!! The front desk clerk was very friendly, sympathetic and soothing. Next on my agenda was food. It was around 9:15 p.m. and the restaurant was only open until 10:00 p.m. So, after quickly dumping my bags in my room, I scooted down to the restaurant . I asked if it was too late to be seated for dinner, and was quickly reassured that it was NEVER too late. Again, how nice!! The menu was varied, and even had daily specials. I ordered, and within just a few minutes my appetizer appeared. Fantastic tortilla soup! And the entree that arrived was even better (Tex-Mex grilled shrimp w/pico de gallo on black bean cakes). Don't let the appearance of this restaurant throw you off. It looks like a dim throwback to the mid 1970's, but the kitchen is totally up to date. The food is freshly prepared, and looks and tastes great! Whoever is designing their menus deserves an award. Some out of site stuff is coming out of that kitchen -- NOT your average hotel fare -- and certainly not what you would expect from an airport Radisson. Breakfast the next morning was insanely good (Bananas Foster French Toast). I hope I get stranded again in Indy, so I can eat at the Radisson!!! The hotel room was clean and tidy. Free wi-fi available. If I had to find anything to complain about, I guess it would be that the hot water took a little time to warm up for the shower. Small inconvenience in my opinion.

(seem like a scary hotel, what if something happen to me? I don\u2019t' think hotel's staff can help me on time) I had to call for 3 times to get someone answered the phone. It doesn't seem like this is a big chain hotel at all!!!!. 4. The next day, the house keeping didn't clean my room, didn't make my bed. just clear the trash and took out the towels. they didn't set up new shower set. I didn't even have shower cap to use and didn't have towel mate & small towels. I was lazy to call reception or guest service because it will just waste my time and made me upset as it was hardly to have somebody answer the phone! 5. I checked out on 13 Dec.

It was a small amount (just 1 dollar) but I don't think it was right. 6. the telephone was used at 15:35 hrs. mean... somebody came to my room to use telephone! because I was at my company all day that day!! Who else can access my room to use the phone??? In that case I haven't have time to check my stuff to see if something have been missing or not!!!!! 7. I told the reception to remove it from my bill. Poorly, they can't remove it. they told me to call General Manager. What?? Isn't it ridiculous??? What can you think about this??? I am wondering, How many customers this hotel did like this to customer?. 8. Charged small amount to customer and if they notices the customer has to call General Manger to delete employee mistake!!! I am sure many customer don't waste their time to do that. To me I just want to have something right! 9. I asked if the hotel has the commend card?? the reception told me to go online and fill-in the commend online! What?????Is it mean this hotel don't like to hear any commend from the customers? Who want to waste their time going online and fill-in the commend?? even me I like to do many thing online but not for filling commend!! 10.
