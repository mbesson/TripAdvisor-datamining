{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lovely hotel and great location We stayed here for one night on our way thru Florence to Northern Italy - it was recommended to us by a family member - it was very clean, spacious and comfortable. The breakfast room was delightful, and the breakfast adequate - the waiter was very friendly courteous and smiley. Reception staff were attentive and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a no nonsense, no big frill stay - ideally located near the train station and all the sights... we loved it - well done.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR921309396", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "robbo1963"}, {"Content": "Good location, mediocre hotel I'm not sure how this hotel stacks up against other two star hotels in Florence, but it was the worst two star hotel we encountered in our travels through France and Italy.The bedspread may have been cleaned once in it's long lifetime, but I doubt it. Same for the blanket. You would think that in a city renowned for art and architecture they could have done something with the walls other than dingy yellow paint. Even some sort of picture might have helped. The room was utterly depressing. It also didn't help that 5 feet across from our window the building was being remodeled (the noise probably only affected the room we were in to any degree, and to be fair it was only during the day, but did preclude any sort of afternoon nap).The staff was OK, but you wouldn't use the word enthusiastic. The breakfast room on the top floor was very nice and the food was typical except for the coffee which came from a machine and is in the running for the worst I've ever tasted.On the plus side, the room and the bathroom were large and the room had a mini-bar (not well stocked, but with room for our stuff). The location is probably the best thing about the Fiorita. It is very close to the train station, which is also the hub for city tour buses and for the CAF tour buses (which we took for a great tour of the Chianti region). And we found a wonderful restaurant not far away just south of the Piazza San Maria Novello. It is called La Martinique and it is on Via del Sole.If you want this location you might try the Hotel Desiree which is in the same building as the Fiorita.", "Date": "Oct 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR524716888", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hersheyabb"}, {"Content": "Hotel with lovely view from breakfast room A lovely small hotel.

The hotel is in a wonderful location, not more than 100 meters from the train station, but in a side street where there was little or no noise. The room had double windows for the sound. The room was clean, with a bar fridge as well. Breakfast was basic but adequate. The only odd thing was the bedding which looked like curtains, but at leas it was clean  functional. Will definitely stay there again as it walking distance from all the sites but outside the centre of Florence where it seems to be very busy  noisy.", "Date": "Jun 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR814990484", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great location - good value This pensione is in a great location near the train station and all the main attractions of the city. Our room was spacious with high ceilings/wooden shutters and tiled floor. Furniture is a bit basic but OK. Shower room v small but clean. Staff were pleasant and helpful although we didn't have much contact with them. Breakfast was fine. The 'savoury' bit was just cheese triangles.

The friendly hotel room-finder in the station suggested a place run by her friend, Roberto. The good news is that it was right around the corner from the train station, but far enough away to remain undisturbed by trains and tour buses. We were charged max rate the first night since it was an Italian holiday weekend and everything was booked, but they lowered it the second night--they could have kept it at its peak, but didn't. They also let us store our luggage at all times.Roberto and the other staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating for the duration and the room itself was more like a charming loft, seeing as how we needed 3 beds. The bathroom was the best in which I stayed in all of Italy, with its gorgeous shower and its spaciousness.I think the only thing that could have made this place better is if they would have scraped the dead, bloody mosquito carcasses off the walls, where the previous occupants had smooshed them. It was pretty gross but other than that, our experience at the Fiorita was sublime. The staff made this place amazing and it was clean and cheerful and spacious, as well. You really couldn't beat the location, either.", "Date": "May 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR766240430", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "morganaus"}, {"Content": "Me impresiono la calidez de sus...   showReview(19842252, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR968946556", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Personal muy amable.
