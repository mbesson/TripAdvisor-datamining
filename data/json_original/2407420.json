As you can see from previous reviews this is quite a new hotel and a dry one which isn't an issue with me. Here are my thoughts Pros Located right outside is the Emirate Towers Metro Station. Cons 1) Hard to find for Taxi drivers. (this will probably improve over time and more drivers start to know its location) 2) Poor furnitures. as mentioned before some of the furnitures are old and in poor condition, clearly taken from another hotel. 3) very poor fittings, the wash basin was loose and was moving around during use and on the last night of use the whole sink drain trap detached and waste water flowed onto the floor. 4) No hot water! - called maintainance and observed what he did to solve it. Basically all the taps to full for hot water and wait for 10 mins before there was any. 5) The elevators was very loud and can be heard from quite far away 6) Breakfast was on the 5th floor Metro restaurant, average food and slow service 7) The staff was friendly enough but the valet didn't speak very good english and when i asked for a card to show taxi drivers i was basically asked to go myself to the front desk to get it. 8) WIFI was slow and kept dropping. 9) The front desk upon checking out asked if there was any issues and when i mentioned the above issues ie wash basin, hot water and furniture the reply was like \"oh ok we know about these issues\" No apologies nor solutions was offered, why did you bothered to ask in the first place. A poor experience of this hotel and there is plently of choice in Dubai, will not be coming back.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOur stay\u201d", "Author": "Robin380", "ReviewID": "UR126311703", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for 7 nights in early February and early March 2012. On 4th Febraury we arrived at 7 am in the morning. As check in was later in the day, the duty manager, Arun Pillai made every effort to get a room for us and he did so and even upgraded us to a club room. Mr. A run was excellent is his service, professionalism and kindness. I must also make special mention of Chiarra at reception, who was very kind and provided an excellent service. The room was good on a high floor overlooking the city, and our return we had a same room but overlooking the sea. Breakfast had a good mix of food though the staff did not offer us tea or coffee unless we requested it.. Found the seating area in the Lobby area very limited and on many occasions we had no where to sit. The location of the hotel is excellent, right in front of the Emirates Towers station and very close to Dubai Mall, Burg Kalifa etc. Taxis found it difficult to find the new hotel, especially since the front entrance is hidden behind the entrance to the train station and the hotel sugars is not clearly visible from the road. The hotel provided good value for money but may not suit guests who require liquor as it is \"dry\".

Firstly, on checking in at 2pm following a very delayed flight due to fog, I was told my room wasnt ready - and wouldnt be for 4 HOURS because they hadnt finsihes cleaning the rooms yet. I stamped my feet a little and managed to get a room after 45 minutes, but this didnt bode well. The room was terrific; I'll concede that. And spacious. The bathroom overlooking the room is unusual and quirky which suited me. The work area was terrific too. However the wiFi didnt work for most of my stay, or when it did it was incredibly slow. We held a conference in the property at the same time, and the conference facilities were definately a concern. There was constant drilling for 2 of our 4 day conference. Not a great advert in a room full of travel agents from all over EMEA. A young chap named John though, who works within the Conference & Banquesting team was a real star and a shining example of service. He should be commended. During the event we learned that a number of our guests were outbooked to another property due to some \"operational problems,\" Finally on check out, the entire events charges were levied against my room bill, strictly against the arrangements made. While all of these were teething problems, first impressions count.

We decided to stay 3 in each room to get a bigger room. The room was ok and the view nice- But the rooms wasn't very big and sure not big enough for 3 persons. The extra bed which was just a folding bed, was very hard and uncomfortable. ( I am just happy I didn't pick the smallets straw ) The breakfast was ok but I have a better on a lot of other hotels. This is a dry hotel - so no alcohol ! - which is I guess is ok as you can go elsewhere. But as a thirsty Scandinavian I just find it strange that you got a hotel with No bar. It took us about 45 min to check in and about an hour to check out. Upon the check in - the hotel wanted a deposit on dirham 1500 ? which I had problems getting back on the check out because I have lost the reciept. The last day we had a late flght back and decided to ask for a late check out and keep the room for the rest of the day. We got a price from the reception the day before leaving which we accepted. But at noon the following day ( which is the normal chack out ) We got a call from the reception that the rate was extra 200 dirham on top on the rate given the day before. I guess the price would have been ok if we have got the exact rate from the beginning. But this surely pissed me of- so we decided to pack in a hurry ( which ofcourse was very annoying ) as we was on the way out. We got packed and then used an hour to check out- So 2 hours wasted mid day because the hotel didn't knew their own rates. The hotel is well loacated, nice pool area( but small ) I guess in total the hotel is ok, if it was rated a 3 star, we just had an bad experience. Would not go back and it's difinitely not a five Star.. who makes these stars ?

It` s more like a 64 floors hotel for business travellers, brand new, rooms from 26 to 64 floors. Good service, average breakfast, pretty good choice of food on the restaurant on the 5th floor. From the same floor you can reach the open air pool by crossing a bridge to the parking building in the back and by taking there the elevator to the top, where the pool is. I had a superior room, good in size, excellent big bathroom with bathtube and separate shower with rain shower. Very comfortable bed, clean room, daily cleaning of room. A litlle overpriced regarding the cloth washing. Nice staff, good service, reception staff a little slow. Even slower is the internet, chargeable, 20Dhs/h. I don`t get it. Why you have to pay for that? They don`t serve alcohol in hotel premises but you can easily find it on the bars and hotels nearby. For a 64 storey hotel, the elevators served pretty well, they also have shuttle bus in the morning to the Jumeirah beach and Dubai Mall which is 2 metro stations away. The Metro station is right in front of the hotel so you have easy access to transportation. Taxies are cheap, but drivers don`t know the location, there is another Millenium Hotel(Grand) but elswhere, so you can use Emirates Towers Metro Station or Crowne Plaza for reference.
