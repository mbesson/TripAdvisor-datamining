Convenient to Barajas airport in Madrid. Rooms are small, bathroom is small but adequate and little in the way of conveniences. Designed for overnight. My wake up call was 25 minutes late. Not an automatic system. Don't expect to read in bed. The matress slips away if lean against headboard. That said, the place looks new, is very clean and the staff very helpful and friendly. Especially Adrinna. Breakfast must be reserved day before. I would stay here again for an early flight.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medellin, Colombia", "Title": "\u201cApparently well but with a yellow substance in the bathtub\u201d", "Author": "ChipoChipolini", "ReviewID": "UR111494527", "Content": "We ended up in this hotel because it have good reviews and the parking was cheaper when compared to other hotels. The parking is tiny, but we were aware of that (you have to reserve a space PREVIOUSLY). When we arrived the hotel looked ok and the rooms, although old, were APPARENTLY clean (with a weird smell). Mini bar was locked. But we were terrified when we took a shower and the bathtub seemed to be clogged and a very weird yellow substance like drool began to emanate from the bathtub.

The hotel is located in Barajas which, frankly, is a pretty rough part of Madrid. However, the hotel is only 10 minutes' walk from Barajas metro (not easy to find, but if you stop someone en route they will be able to direct you!), and is also 5 mins' walk from the bus 101 stop which also goes to the airport. Rooms are big with bathroom (bath/shower), TV, minibar and ADSL internet. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Buffet breakfast is worth the cost, continental isn't. Barajas itself is a pretty shabby place but there are some SUPERB restaurants near the hotel notably El Txoko de Anders (upmarket tapas/wine), La Caprichosa (good value Spanish food), and El Principal (rough & ready workers' bar with great set menus). The centre of the city is around 30-40 minutes away by metro, for only 1 euro (has to be the best value metro system in Europe). In short, if you're in Madrid purely for tourism you're better off in the centre of town, but if you need to be near the airport or the exhibition centre, this place is a real gem.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cNice small hotel close to the Barajas Airport\u201d", "Author": "MalvolioBlanco", "ReviewID": "UR75140164", "Content": "Obviously, I chose this hotel because of the location due to my late arrival and early departure from Barajas Airport.
