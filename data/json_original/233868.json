The place looked right on its website, in fact I thought it looked a little too good and was ready to be disappointed, but goodness me we couldn't believe just how good for us it was and at a very reasonable price! We arrived at 11 in the evening and found the entrance shut, but by using the intercom near the door we were soon inside. The room was huge with its own kitchen - perfect for us as we like to get our own breakfast; the 'Kaiser's' supermarket opposite the hotel was also a big plus. The queen-sized bed was comfortable and the bathroom couldn't be faulted. U-bahn 5 minutes walk, and just 2 stops from Alexanderplatz and S-bahn and buses - good if you like to use public transport as we do. The only fault was that the room smelt slightly of cigarette smoke and we are both non-smokers.

The hotel was slightly difficult to find, being near the back of a mixed residential/commercial project. Check-in was quick and efficient and we were pleased to find out that we had been given a suite for the price of a standard room. The hotel had probably been constructed ten years ago, so the interiors were slightly dated. The staff gave us tips for a restaurant in the area, which was quite good. Otherwise, this is a residential area at the southernmost part of the Mitte district of Berlin. In order to reach other neighborhoods, one has to drive or take the subway. The beakfast was of a high standard, with a diverse selection of foods typical for a German buffet breakfast.

Even better once construction is finished.\u201d", "Author": "CCRR", "ReviewID": "UR75206017", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in August for a week. The first room we were given faced directly at the construction site. It was very noisy! We requested another room facing the courtyard and were given one later in the afternoon. The room itself was very large. We had nice views facing the courtyard, a large living room with the only TV, kitchen area with microwave, fridge and small freezer, tons of storage space for clothes. It does feel like you're in your own little apartment in a neighborhood. There are several--what I would consider--minor caveats about the hotel and neighborhood, but that I think deserve to be pointed out. 1. The construction is still going on and it's very loud. We were still able to hear it even though we were on the other side. Also, there are very loud church bells that go on for five minutes at 7:00am on the weekdays. Because our room faced the courtyard area, every noise outside was magnified. Someone rolling a cart outside can sound like thunder. If you're a light sleeper, you might want to take those factors into account. 2. The bed was comfortable for me but the mattress was very hard. 3. There was no air-conditioning but they did provide a fan that kept the room cool with it on. If there is a heatwave, however, the room might get too hot. 4. The tub was huge, which is nice if you like to really soak, but getting out was slippery and difficult for me being 5'3\". However, my husband also commented (unsolicited) that the tub was a bit too deep for him as well. 5. The TV only has German channels. It would have been nice to have CNN or SkyNews. 6. The hotel will give you a code for 30 minutes of Internet use per day with your own laptop but if you want to use it for a longer period of time then you have to pay. Some of the more positive points were: 1. There's a grocery store literally right outside the front of the hotel for snacks. Super convenient! We never bothered with the hotel breakfast because we were able to have whatever we wanted each day from the grocery store. There's also another larger grocery store less than a block away that's open later. 2. The metro stop is a five minute walk from the hotel. It's only a couple of stops to Alexanderplatz. We walked to Alexanderplatz one day. It's about a 30 minute walk at a normal pace. 3. The hotel staff are very courteous and professional. The housekeeping service was very good. They do the dishes and clean the room to the guest's schedule, earlier or later, whatever you prefer each day, and are quiet in the hallways. 4. The room is large, clean and comfortable. There are no restaurants really close to the hotel, but since we had the kitchen it wasn't a problem. You can also take a quick trip on the metro to busier areas. If you like to be in the middle of the action, near restaurants and clubs, you probably wouldn't be happy staying here. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would consider it again on a future trip.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful room - But the builders start at 7AM !\u201d", "Author": "kenandaxel", "ReviewID": "UR66864641", "Content": "We stayed in 2 rooms at this hotel in June 2010. We had originally booked a different hotel for our trip to Berlin, but changed the reservation to this NH hotel because of our excellent experience at the NH in Dresden at the beginning of the year. We arrived at the hotel at 10.30 PM after a relatively long trip via public transport from the airport (Bus 50 mins followed by 3-5 min walk to the underground, 2 stops, followed by 5 min walk to the hotel). We had hoped to be able to get a sandwich/snack and drink in the bar before going to bed. Unfortunately, the receptionist told us they only serve breakfast and there is no bar. The NH Hotels website lists this property as a FOUR star hotel. There is no mention of the word \"Garni\" or \"B&B Hotel\" on their website. The official German (DEHOGA) hotel classification requirements state that a four star hotel has to have a minimum of one a la carte restaurant and hotel bar http://www.hotelsterne.de/uk/system_kriterien.php. This was also our minimum expectation when we booked. Simply leaving out a reference to such a basic facility should not automatically mean that it does not exist. We had already read in trip advisor that all rooms are of suite standard with a small kitchenette, and we were not disappointed. Both of our rooms were very large, with a kitchen and living room, big bathroom and a very nice bedroom. All spotlessly clean. The bed was most comfortable, although there is no TV in the bedroom, only in the living room. At approx \u20ac80 per room per night, the rate was truly excellent for this standard of a room. Unfortunately our plan to \"sleep-in\" until 9am on our 1st morning did not work out as the builders on the site directly outside our 2nd floor window promptly started work at 7am. Even the bed shook when they started work with some kind of earth compressing machine. Thankfully my parent\u2019s room (towards the front of the hotel) was not so bad, however we did not get another minute\u2019s sleep once the builders started to work. We complained to the receptionist, mainly about the fact that we had not been advised in advance that the hotel was directly beside a building site (we had had phone contact with the hotel at the time of our reservation and the hotel\u2019s website makes no mention in regards to the building site) and she did offer us a room change to a side-room, but we turned it down as we felt that this would have only made minimal difference to the noise level. Furthermore, as we had already unpacked and had a tight schedule for the remainder of the day, we did not have time to repack in order to facilitate a room change. The next morning (Saturday) was not as bad, although the action did begin again early in the morning. We did not notice any noise on Sunday. This noise must be a big issue for the locality as several of the apartments around the square (facing the park/building site) had large banners hanging from their balconies with some choice protest messages for the builders and development company. We did not eat breakfast, as we felt that the \u20ac16 per person charge was excessive. Instead we found a bakery/caf\u00e9 nearby and had breakfast for all four of us (rolls, cheese, pastries and excellent coffee) for less than what one breakfast would have cost at the hotel. Contrary to other comments on this site, we did not find the hotel very central and other than the above mentioned bakery, there is not a great range of restaurants and bars nearby, unless you take the underground back to Alexanderplatz or further. On the Thursday night we arrived, we had to walk for nearly 10 minutes to find even one single restaurant which was open and served food. On the whole, at the price, if you can get a room towards the front of the hotel for this rate, and if you don\u2019t expect or require any services, this hotel will suit you perfectly. If you are looking for any kind of four star service or comfort outside of your room, our recommendation is to look elsewhere.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Almada, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - very good value for money\u201d", "Author": "rasilva", "ReviewID": "UR60049576", "Content": "Very well localized, 2 metro stations from Alexanderplatz, clean, friendly staff and HUGE rooms with living room and kitchen (3 small supermarkets in a 5 minutes walking distance).

This is my third hotel stay in Berlin. I previously stayed in NH Hotel Berlin City West, which is also excellent, but I think I would choose this hotel for my next trip because of the location. We chose a junior suite. Our suite was quite large, with a full kitchen, big living room (couch, coffee table, TV, desk, chairs), small bedroom (separated from the living room by glass doors), a large bathroom, lots of closet space, and lots of big windows. Our only complaint was the lack of a small dining table and chairs to go with the nice kitchen. The location is excellent. The hotel is on the block next to a large park (not visible from the rooms) with an artificial lake and lakeside cafe. There are many local pubs/restaurants with outdoor seating along the park that runs down to Oranienstrasse. On the same block you can also find a supermarket, bakery, convenience stores, and a nice restaurant. We enjoyed fixing breakfast in our own kitchen. Although it is in a residential area, the location is also convenient to tourist activities. It's a short walk to the U8 subway line (to go north to the Alexanderplatz area) or the M29 bus (to go west to the Zoo area). It's on the edge of the Kreuzberg district, a fun part of town with a large immigrant community that makes for a wide variety of restaurants and shops, some of the most diverse you will find in Germany. If you like to walk, a 20-30 minute walk will get you to the Jewish Museum, East Side Gallery, or the Museumsinsel for example. The hotel staff were outstanding. For the first night my room faced the back where there is a construction site that starts up at 7 am. I asked to move to the front of the hotel (facing the courtyard) and the gentleman in charge quickly accommodated me in the friendliest possible way. They were also great about small requests such as an extra blanket. In the first room I occupied there was some minor damage to furniture (rips in cushions and curtains). The second room was fine. The hotel does not have fantastic amenities or decor, which I don't care about. Considering the size of the suite and the location, I thought the value for money was excellent (in May).", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "Karol_Z", "ReviewID": "UR20124336", "Content": "Great hotel, huge apartments, quite place not far from underground stations, very good breakfast and really fantastic and very helpful staff.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA mini apartment\u201d", "Author": "zardoz1", "ReviewID": "UR8548499", "Content": "The enthusiastic reviews here are correct - this is amazing value for money. A big, big room with cooking facilities - more like a bedsit apartment than a hotel room. The location is inner-suburban, as other reviewers note. You are not in a tourist hot-spot but you have plenty of options to get to the hot-spots using public transport. If you want to avoid having to eat out all the time, you can buy stuff from the supermarket next to the hotel and cook it up (and you get a dishwasher to do the washing up!). Also you want to avoid the overpriced hotel breakfast and eat at the cafe in the shopping mall outside, or find the nice cafe near a small lake (reservoir really) at the top of the street. Here you can get a full continental breakfast and a couple of coffees for under 10 euros. It's worth noting that the downside of being in a residential area is that the streets are very quiet at night. And some of the streets are a bit dark. Since this area was in the Eastern sector, before the wall came down, some of the housing blocks look scruffy and there are some poor people wandering about. However I always felt safe. I recommend not trying to find the hotel at night unless you're absolutely sure where you are going. It is actually at the back of a little pedestrian mall and is easy to miss.

I was a little skeptical about the value since I booked the hotel for a special price on Expedia (I think it was less than 80 euros a night at the time). But I figured it was OK since it was affiliated with the NH chain, which is pretty well known throughout Europe (especially in Spain). We arrived pretty early from JFK on an overnight flight and got to the hotel at around 10 AM. Reception was very friendly and advised us that our room would be ready in 15-20 minutes. So, we left our bags with them and got some breakfast at the friendly bakery just outside the door. We loved the bakery so much we went there every morning for breakfast during our stay (and is much cheaper than the hotel breakfast). I could not believe my eyes when I saw the room. Spotless, tons of closet space and a kitchenette to boot. The bed was a standard European double (slightly narrower than a US full) and the mattress was a little firm, but not a huge problem to complain about. The bathroom was IMMACULATE and huge! It had a nice size tub (first one I've seen in Europe that actually fit me - and I'm only 5'10\"). Having stayed in hostels and mostly 2-3 star hotels, this felt like staying in a higher-end 4*. There's a supermarket almost directly across the street from the hotel where we bought a case of 11 beers for about 75 cents each! And having a fridge in the room comes in handy to keep them cool. There's also a bank around the corner if you needed to withdraw euros via ATM. The only drawback I would think of is that the neighborhood surrounding the Heinrich Heine is pretty quiet at night (though you always felt safe) and is a 10 minute U-Bahn ride to the center of Berlin. The U-Bahn is very convenient though and very safe. If you're okay with that and a five-minute walk to the U-Bahn station, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel for its value and cleanliness.", "Date": "April 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "stockton on tees", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel...!\u201d", "Author": "bigmarc2007", "ReviewID": "UR6647694", "Content": "My fiancee and step-daughter surpised me for my 30th birthday with a trip to Berlin, a first for me and them and thankfully, courtesy of her rather impeccable taste, we stayed at the Heinrich Heine. The hotel itself could, to the first time traveller, seem a little off the beaten track, not slap bang in the center of all the tourist hot spots, but that is well and truly the only chink in the armour for the Heinrich Heine. It is located about five minutes away from a U-Bahn station and is on several bus lines (if you walk 300m up the road to the Moritzplatz U Bahn station a bus will take you to Kurfurstdamm as well as other great places to see) and the area in which it is located is superb. There is a lovely little shopping precinct practically out of the front door, which is filled with little shops, tobbaconists, cafes and even an Aldi supermarket. There is also a wonderful little bakery which makes amazing bread and cakes plus another 2 supermarkets, so there is pretty much all you need within a stones throw of the hotel. So, the hotel. A comfortable and extremely clean environment, with front of house staff who can't do enough for you. The rooms, well, you really have to see them to believe them....They will sleep at least four people (for 2 couples it would be ideal). There is a master bedroom with loads of storage and is warm, comfortable and within minutes it almost feels like home. There is a HUGE bathroom with 2 connecting doors, one from the master bedroom and another from the living area and the living room is MASSIVE. A sofa, three chairs and a desk plus a sofa that transforms into a double bed. And, there is a kitchen. And not just the usual self catering three ring electric stove and a few cupboards, but a wonderful fitted kitchen with dishwasher, hob, microwave and all the things you would need or desire. The housekeeping ensure the room is kept in pristine order, they even load the dishwasher with items you may have forgotten!
