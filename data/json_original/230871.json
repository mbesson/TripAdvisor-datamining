The whole hotel and room was clean, tidy and cozy, which is the most important, I think. Cleaning service was great. The equipment is visibly getting old but it has some atmosphere (beside lightly cracked basin and scratch toilet). Breakfasts (open buffet) were good, enough of everything but we had to order tea or coffee extra at a waitress. What we did not really like was the fact that wi-fi was not free of charge, but 7 EUR a day. During our stay it was not available to pay by card. Reception was open 24 hours a day, which was fine \u2013 some of receptionists were nicer, other less.

The KaDaWe department store located there is worth a half-day tour. Be sure to check out the food floor. The other positive thing, value, was important to us. Our rate was 104 Euros for one night and 83 Euros for the other four nights. I never did figure out why there was a difference but I knew about it when I reserved the room. Of course, when there is \"value\", there are tradeoffs. Here are some important to us. The room was tiny. The bathroom was cramped. There was no elevator to our room on the first floor (second floor in U.S. terminology). The staff was very young and spoke only broken English. This was not a problem for basic information exchange but they were absolutely no help regarding local attractions or locating other things such as an Internet cafe. (It turns out that there is one two blocks away! Go to the KFC and look across the street.) Our traveling companions said there was no wi-fi for their laptop. The breakfast was nine Euros per person and was not as good as free breakfasts at other places we stayed, so we only ate there one morning.

No big surprises. The best thing about this hotel IS the location. It is only 1/2 a block away from a main street, subway stop, and the KaDeWe department store, but it is quiet. Yes the breakfast is typical rolls, cheese, and meats but then again, with KaDeWe and its prime selection of foods, just let this hotel be your appetizer for bigger and better things. the room I stayed in was small compared to American hotel rooms. However, this IS Europe. Most are small according to American tastes, and therefore I was very happy with it.

Its in an excellent location, really near the (Alexanderplatz?) metro station but remarkably quiet too. We found this a really good place to explore Berlin from, as it was so easy to get about. Plus the local area seemed very pleasant, with restaurants and bars not too far away. There was also a huge department store called Ka Da We about 5 minutes down the road and a cheap supermarket about 2 minutes walk away which was really useful for getting supplies. The hotel itself is in a really interesting building, with nice wide corridors and seemingly plenty of rooms, furnished/decorated well. The rooms were nice and clean and of a reasonable size, though I guess it depends what you're used to - For us as a couple it was ideal. Plus, the double glazing blocks out any sound and the beds were fairly large and comfortable, so you'll be sure of a good nights sleep! The breakfast was very pleasant, held in the modern looking bar and reception area downstairs. Admittedly, the reception desk is close by but this wasn't at all unpleasant or disturbing - We had a lovely breakfast every morning for the 5 days of our stay. Staff were all very polite and friendly, willing to answer questions about how to get somewhere or what to see.

They put me in a single room. The single rooms are VERY SMALL (mine was #205). Now, in their defense, I'll say that I got used to the room within a day or so, all I did there was sleep, clean myself and call my spouse back home, and that the bed was comfortable enough. But still, if you are an American used to having some room in your room, the singles will be a bit of a shock. The location is outstanding for getting to the U-bahn and seeing town and there are some good restaurants within walking distance (at least east, south, west). There is an internet cafe one block over but the staff don't appear to know about it. Don't consume the overpriced goodies in the room. There is a \"kaiser's\" within a block where you can get what you need. I even took the liberty of emptying the silly stuff they put in the fridge and replacing it with my own water. The maid didn't seem to mind. Breakfast isn't elaborate but it also isn't terrible. I'd call it functional. I certainly thought it was good enough not to go looking somewhere else. For the most part the staff speaks a little English (don't expect too much though) and is polite, but on the night shift they clearly had someone on her first night, who knew no English and couldn't manage the phone to forward calls. It took several tries for my spouse to get through to my room. If I were traveling to Berlin for a vacation, the first thing I'd do is check the reviews here and then I'd probably try another place. If you don't mind small spaces and can get a good rate, then this place is probably worth a look. One last thing. Unless there are ground floor rooms (which I didn't see) this hotel IS NOT handicapped accessible. I took the elevator when I arrived thinking it would save me lugging my bags. It stops inbetween floors and then you have to walk stairs.", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cranston,RI", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "oldexplorer", "ReviewID": "UR4950567", "Content": "WE enjoyed the location, large rooms, nice atmosphere,ample breakfast in comfortable room, and quiet of this hotel.
