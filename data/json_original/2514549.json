We stayed for just one (Saturday) night and paid \u00a3150 for a double room, en suite, including a full English and continental breakfast. Other hotels were double the price. Considering this was the Saturday before Valentine's Day when lots of people visit London's restaurants, this was excellent value. We booked on the Grange Hotels website and got the best price. I received a confirmation e-mail from the hotel very quickly, answering a question I had raised on the booking. All very impressive. We booked an en-suite room and ended up in the basement in room 6. The room had a view of a backyard, but we weren't there to admire it and it really didn't bother us. Here's what we liked: location - only a 10 minute brisk walk from Covent Garden and 15 minutes from the West End theatres and London Euston station, friendly, helpful and efficient staff on Reception and the breakfast room, decor: a nice balance between traditional style and modern ameneties, cleanliness, a modern and secure room key system, reasonably sized room, comfortable and warm bed, small but very nice en-suite bathroom, traditional, snug decor in the room, choice of food at breakfast and your ability to decide whether to pay more for a cooked breakfast, or stick with the continental options, which were plentiful, and finally, being able to leave our bag before check-in and after check-out for free so we could enjoy London without trundling our luggage behind us. There was nothing we didn't like, but be warned: rooms on the front of the hotel are at the mercy of noisy lorries passing through this small street. To ensure a good night's sleep either ask for a room facing away from the street or take ear plugs and turn up the volume on your alarm clock. It was a very cold weekend and there was an icy blast through the old window frames, which you only felt if you stood right next to them. The thick curtains kept most of the chill out, but unfortunately the raidators were belting out heat right behind them! Only a minor problem though.

It was only an overnight business trip, but I have to say I was highly disappointed by this hotel. Having already had to phone three times to get the correct name on my booking, I was greeted at the hotel with a room completely different to the one I had booked. Instead of getting a double room with its own en-suite, I was given a single room with no bathroom. Pretty different really, and considering the price my company had shelled out it wasn't a good start. The room was absolutely tiny, and was so hot it felt like a sauna. That was, until you opened the curtains, the windows were very drafty indeed. Nevertheless, despite being too tall for the tiny bed, I managed to get some sleep. The next drama came at breakfast, having already booked this I wandered into the breakfast room to have something to eat. \"Sir, you have not booked breakfast with your room\" I was greeted with, however I drew out my booking to confirm the fact I had purchased it. I was then made to stand in the corner of the room, like a convict almost, while the waiter spent 15 minutes discussing with reception whether I had paid or not. They still didn't believe me, and I was forced to sign several forms before being able to sit and eat. Honestly though, with the poor standard spread available I wish I hadn't bothered and had gone to Starbucks for a coffee instead. All things considered, I was left feeling very disappointed by this hotel, which is a shame as The Grange White Hall had left me with such a good opinion of the group.

I spent 2 nights at the Lancaster hotel in Bloomsbury. In short this is what I think of the hotel: On the down side: * we booked this hotel via our travel agent in March 2010, we specifically requested an en-suite room (so with toilet inside the room) because we had read on Tripadvisor that most rooms are only semi-suite. I do not like to wander the corridors at night in my PJ's. Upon check-in we learned there was no en-suite room available. We could check-in The Clarendon across the street (same hotel chain), but there would be an extra charge. We of course refused, it was booked half a year ago and confirmed by our travel agent! The receptionist asked us to wait in the lobby while she called the head of reservations. Through all this the receptionist was very polite and professional. 5 Minutes later she told us everything was fine, we could have an en-suite room in the Lancaster. * there were only 2 sockets in the room, both in use. So when we wanted to charge our cell phones and cameras we had the pull out the wires. This is just a minor detail!!! But it might be interesting to know if you're carrying a lot of electrical equipment that needs charging. On the plus side: * so eventually we got our en-suite room. It turned out to be a triple room on the lower ground level, located at the end of a corridor, no other rooms in that corridor, so we were very private. The room and bathroom were huge! We were only 2 persons, so we had all the room we needed. We had two seperate beds, a sofa, a writing table, a normal table, a tv, a wardrobe, a smaller closet and a table to put our luggage on. Since we were on lower ground level we had no view, we were looking at a wall, but we were only in our room in the morning and in the evening. The shower was in the bath tub. The beds were soft and comfortable. Room temperature was a bit chilly but that's just what we like. For your info: it was room 008. * baggage can be left at reception * every morning The Independant was delivered. The hotel staff put it in front of our door. Very attentive. * Staff was very friendly, helpful and professional. Even during our check-in, when we were surprised not the have been allocated an en-suite room, the receptionist handled the situation in a professional manner. On our second day (in the morning) we wanted to check the weather forecast (the previous day there was a printed sheet on the reception desk with the forecast). The sheet wasn't there, the receptionist immediately printed the forecast for us. Also on our second day (in the evening) we had to use the internet in the lobby (\u00a3 3 for 15 minutes), because we needed to check the Eurostar website, there was a strike in Belgium. We only used the computer for 3 minutes and when we wanted to pay the receptionist told us we needn't pay because it was so short. Twice we ordered a cab. It took less than 2 minutes before the cab arrived and the concierge escorted us from the lobby to the taxi, holding open all of the doors and carrying our luggage. * Breakfast was superb. There was a certificate on the wall saying that the hotel won the Breakfast Award in 2009. It was continental buffet breakfast, but you could also order English breakfast if you wanted. Within 1 minute there was someone standing at our table asking if we wanted to drink something warm (tea, coffee or chocolate milk) and if we wanted toast. Another minute later our order was delivered to our table. The buffet itself consisted had croissants, sandwiches and several other pastries. All kinds of jam, 4 kinds of cornflakes, milk, fruit juice, water, a lot of fruit, cheese and ham. An ideal way to start your day. I didn't need food until 2 pm after having had breakfast in The Lancaster! * Good location! We walked from St. Pancras to our hotel, a good 15 to 20 minutes walking. Most of the time we used the tube system of course. The tube station is Russell Square, 10 minutes walking from the hotel. The Lancaster is located in a quiet street between two parks. Several other Grange hotels are located in that street. So overall: - friendly, professional, helpful and attentive staff - good location - spacious and clean room with comfortable beds - superb breakfast I would definitely stay in this hotel, and recommend it to other people. I hope my review might be useful.

The location was perfect for what we were using it for \u2013 a gig in Camden and generalised tourist wandering. The hotel is in close proximately to Tottenham Court Road, Holborn and Russell Square tube stations and there are plenty of buses that pass in and around the area. There are so many amenities and tourist attractions within walking distance including banks, mini supermarkets, bars, restaurants and the fantastic British Museum. Once arriving at the hotel, the hotel reception staff were pleasant and efficient. We were given the general hotel policies and were offered help with baggage. We\u2019re used to stairs in our apartment building so it didn\u2019t bother us that there wasn\u2019t a lift service (that we could see). We received wake up calls and The Independent newspaper was delivered daily, which was a treat whilst drinking your morning cup of tea. The room itself was quite large by London standards. Our room was a Semi-Ensuite, which as you probably already know by now is a shower and wash basin in your room and shared toilet facilities outside. Don\u2019t let this put you off though, we never had to wait for the toilet facilities and it was cleaned and replenished as required. We had room number 105, which was on the first floor and facing the road. The room had two very large windows, which opened completely, which in hind side we were totally grateful for. Expect a little noise during delivery hours in this room\u2013 you are in London, not in the middle of the countryside. The weather was glorious on the days we were staying in London and the hotel unfortunately doesn\u2019t have any air conditioning. The room was absolutely stifling on occasions. However, the windows came into use and there was a small desk fan in the wardrobe that you were able to use. The general d\u00e9cor of the room was quite bog standard for England. The room could benefit for some slight renovations or aesthetic amendments for example, the sheet on the bed had seen better days, the wardrobe door never closed properly and the TV channel opportunities wouldn\u2019t really suit the foreign travellers who want to keep up with general affairs. However this is a three star hotel; there were opportunities in the Grange Hotel range to be upgraded to a higher star hotel in the same area. We paid \u00a3188 for two nights (inc. VAT/Room Only) and were quite pleasantly surprised. The only downside to the room itself was that the shower and wash basin area could probably benefit from tiling. Around the shower area the carpet was starting to smell musty and was looking worn from the water damage. We used one of the towels provided as a \u2018bath mat\u2019, which grated on me for all of about 5 seconds. The room was cleaned down daily and replenished with towels and tea & coffee items. We requested ironing facilities during our stay, which was awaiting use on our arrival. There was also a welcome pack including maps and general hotel/London information which came in handy whilst figuring out what tourist attractions we wanted to visit. We never tried breakfast/room service facilities; there are just so many restaurant and bar options in and around Central London. I believe the hotel were offering breakfast at \u00a317.50 for full English and \u00a315.50 for Continental if you have booked at a RO basis. We also never tried the hotels laundry, driver or internet facilities, so I couldn\u2019t comment. However I did see the one computer in the main lounge area which could be used for e-mails etc (at a fee I suspect). All in all \u2013 I would go back to one of the Grange Hotels.

Location is decent though, about a 5-10 min walk from the Russell Square tube station, and less than 5 minutes away from the British Museum. One thing that upset me the most was that we had asked them to call us a cab on the day that we were leaving and they called a gypsy cab instead of a regular certified cab.

I didnt have a problem - and as work was paying it was fine - when asked reception they said they do have some rooms with full en-suites so might be worth checking before you book if you want your own toilet!!", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cAre they having cash flow problems?\u201d", "Author": "Wafdof", "ReviewID": "UR29571134", "Content": "I was treated as if I were a flight risk.

I was aware that there was no toilet in the room and I hoped that this the only reason the the room was so cheap. The staff were polite, the room spotless and in good order with plenty towels, hairdryer and toiletries and even magazines to read. The toilet facilities were immaculate and there were plenty available for use. The continental breakfast was excellent with good quality produce and endless hot toast and tea.

We do like walking and are not very picky - in fact if you are looking for a safe, quiet hotel where you can relax after a whole day's exploration, this is an excellent choice. We have walked to Tower of London, the City hall, Westminster, etc without using pass, unless at the end of the day, when we were exhausted. When we arrived, we had fresh lilies in our room for our welcome. Granted, the toilets are outside of the room, but I never had to wait for any of them (we were on the second floor, our room was facing the garden). It's a charming hotel. It's not contemporary, but if you're looking for a 5 star hotel, you are obviously in the wrong place. The staff was very very friendly. I think they were all students. The breakfast is a big plus and although very small choice, it was really appreciated (food is rather expensive in London).

I booked before I read the reviews just because the location and rates were wonderful. I arrived at the hotel at noon and check in was fast and simple. My room was number 5 in the lower ground floor and was quite issolated from all the other rooms. There are no elevators in this hotel so I had to drag my suitcase down the stairs but it wasn't that bad. Having booked the hotel prior to reading the reviews I was ready for the fact the loo was outside the room but to my surprise I got a room with both shower and bath and a loo :) The room was big and spacious with a queen size bed, TV, work area, there was a ventilator, ironing board and coffee/tea making facilities. It was a great treat for a solo budget traveler and the location made it even more wonderful ! Althought in general everything was great , there are two spoilers that bothered me a bit . The first one was the strange noise I kept hearing which I figured out to be the noise of the tube on the Piccadily line that apparently passes right under the hotel :) but still it wasn't that bad as I didn't spend the day in the room and I was so tired at night that it didn't really bother my sleep. The one thing that did annoy me more than that was the fact that the hotel doesn't have a luggage room. This was especially annoying since my flight back was at 22:30 and the hotel staff weren't really keen on helping me , they could only appologise and say it was \"company policy\" so I found myself dragging my bags to Euston station (in case you would like to use this option it costs 6.5 Pounds per bag).

When traveling here however, make sure you give the taxi driver the address for there are TWO Lancaster Hotels in London. He took us to the Royal Lancaster first and then to our hotel.

There are no lifts and we had to haul our luggage up only 1 flight of stairs and there was no bell-boy. There is no available internet but WiFi cafes all over nearby.
