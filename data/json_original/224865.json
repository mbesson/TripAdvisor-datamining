Seemed like a mixed bag. Was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the rooms. Mine was recently remodeled. Location was ideal, close to West Seattle nightlife, so no need to drive around and around... Close-in to town. If there is construction on west Seattle freeway, you may want to allow 60 minutes rather than the 15 during commute times. And the cost is about HALF what the big shots in downtown are charging.

Definately skeptical, but was told that it had new owners. The positive: The bed and furnishing were good. The negatives: Endless. I understand the new owners put some money into the property, but obvious was guided in the wrong directions. The workmanship was obviously done by amatures. My teenage kids could have done a better job. Should have gotten a general contractor. The bathroom needed extreme help. The sink stopper did not work. Toilet flush took forever. The hot water took a long time to warm up. Hair in the tub. Pee around the toilet bowl. Heater did not work. I don't wish anyone to be terminated, but sometimes it needs to be done. The heavy set guy that works the late night should not be in the business. Terrible guest services. The lady that works the morning lacks confidence, but was nice. The rate of 79, was way too expensive the product and service I receive. Although the furnishing was nice, it is still a cheap motel.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lacey, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice Place\u201d", "Author": "Yrs1674", "ReviewID": "UR123995691", "Content": "My friend and I needed a room to stay in West Seattle this was the only option and I was a little reluctant.

The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The heat is controlled with controls for baseboard heaters, that was difficult to control the temperature.

In early November, we turned the heater on upon arriving at about 10pm but after about 30 minutes without noticeable change, we called the front desk. Their comment was that \"it takes about an hour to warm up.\" We did at least notice the register getting warmer so put our coats on the bed and, by the time we woke up, the room - which was a double - was warm. We were there again the next month - new grandbaby! - and wanted to try a King room. This time, as we were driving up at night from Oregon, when we were about an hour away we called and asked them to turn on the heat in our room. Which they did. The register was a little warm when we got into the room but the King room was much larger to heat and had a large window along one wall. We again put coats on the bed, the room never really warmed up and my husband says he's felt cold ever since. The rooms were still clean, the staff helpful and the rates very reasonable. HOWEVER, if you're there in the winter try staying in a smaller room and call ahead to get the heat turned on if you're arriving late. There should at least be blankets in the rooms. And why couldn't they turn the heat on at a minimal temperature for the rooms that are rented? This is still the only decent hotel in West Seattle, which is a great location to both the airport and downtown. Despite these experiences, we'll go back. I hope they'll continue to make improvements.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hernando, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cWe'd Go Again\u201d", "Author": "Libra1947", "ReviewID": "UR121878998", "Content": "My sister and I stayed at the The Grove, West Seattle Inn and found it to be a great place, the staff was friendly, the room clean and quiet.

We made a reservation in advance and specifically asked for a quite room in the back wing away from Alaska Street. Instead, when we checked in at 5 PM on a Satruday night, they gave us room 201, right on hte corner of Alask and a side street. Arguably, the noisiest room there was. The rooms are nicely appointed, though the lack of a door between the sink area and the toilet/shower seemed a bit weird. Anyway, the bus noise was loud while it lasted, and quieted down about 10 PM. Traffic resumed about 7 AM, so don't expect to sleep in here in the upstairs corner bungalow. The breakfast area is small, nice and offers a fairly healthy choice of cold foods. The decor and room appointments are first class.

It's still a TravelLodge in structure with small rooms and minimal space for clothing. Wi fi was free but nearly useless with very weak service. We were there during a very hot August weekend - unusual for Seattle - and the window air conditioner took quite a while to cool the room even set to 66 degrees. Perhaps we should have kept it on all day while we were gone. Double beds. Continental breakfast was typical - cold cereal, small pastries, juice, bagels and bread. We had minimal contact with staff but they seemed cordial enough. It's not the best neighborhood for walking at night but there's a grocery store about 2 blocks away and shops/restaurants within a few minutes' drive.The wake up call worked and that always makes me nervous.

Given some of the very bad reviews, I was a little leery. Also I had stayed here over 10 years ago when it was owned by Travelodge. It was pretty seedy then so I wondered how this trip would work out. In short, it was quite good. The new owners have done an excellent job of renovation and the motel is clean with all new furnishings. Check-in was easy and the attendant was reasonably helpful and friendly. Price was great --- $120 including tax for a two-bed room in a newly remodeled motel on a Saturday night during high season in a location with easy access to the heart of Seattle. Hard to beat. The room was on the south end of the motel, i.e., right on SW Alaska St., an arterial in West Seattle. However, street noise was minimal and did not bother us. The neighborhood was fine and there would be no problem walking around. There was a park about two blocks to the east with a view toward Seattle. We didn't have time to take a stroll but I'd say this neighborhood is quite safe. It's mixed commercial and residential and certainly not a \"high-end\" neighborhood, but nothing to worry about. The room was a bit small and spare, but everything was new and almost everything worked perfectly. The beds were fine, somewhat plush, with new linens and coverings. Walls were freshly painted and clean. Nice prints on the walls. Large flat-screen TV with modern desk and comfortable executive-type desk chair. The bathroom was excellent with new modern fixtures, and clean walls and floors. The only problems we had were with two noisy items, the air conditioner and the bathroom fan. Both were annoyingly loud and need to be remedied. The air conditioner disturbed our sleep. I put ear plugs in during the night and then had no problem. The bathroom fan was loud enough that we didn't turn it on because of its annoyance. We didn't try the continental breakfast because it sounded like coffee and sugar, i.e., pastries, and we wanted something more nutritious. (There are lots of nice restaurants in West Seattle and we had no trouble finding a good, busy and hearty place for Sunday brunch.) All in all, the Grove is an excellent value and well worth the visit. It's vastly improved over the Travelodge from years ago and it's much better than many budget motels I've stayed in over the years.
