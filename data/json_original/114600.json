The lobby and elevators are small, but that's part of the charm. The room was smaller than we expected, but that was okay, because we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. The bathroom was spacious and updated, and the bed was comfortable. It is in a fantastic location, right off MI Avenue. We had a couple of issues with the hotel that are worth mentioning. When we checked in, we didn't receive a couple things that we were supposed to get with our Groupon (breakfast tickets and internet password), so that was a bit frustrating, but not a huge deal. Also, we didn't get the bathrobes that were supposed to be in our room. Again, this wasn't a huge issue or anything, but a little disappointing. The walls in the hotel are very thin and we could clearly hear a conversation going on in the room next to us. Also, it took 30 minutes for us to get our car from the valet, which was longer than we were told it would take (20 minutes is what we were told). Lastly, the breakfast was a bit of a joke. Normally it costs $15.75, so we were expecting a good breakfast. The options for the continental breakfast were orange juice or grapefruit juice, choice of English muffin, toast, or 3 pastries, and a choice of coffee or tea. I really couldn't believe those 3 things added up to $15.75. The service was terrible and they weren't ready for all of the people.

The other cool thing is that it is an older historical hotel. I will say the hotel itself is worn and dated.

All that aside, the hotel lobby is small, but we never felt crowded in it. We stayed in room 304. The hotel elevators are small but we never had any issue with them and I found them to be very fast and efficient, mind you I was only ever going to the third floor. The room itself was large and it seemed like it had been recently updated/renovated. The bathroom was small, but gorgeous! (With the exception of the toilet, which was older). I really liked all the tile work/patterns they had done. I didn't really hear much in the way of hallway traffic or our neighbors which is always a plus. The view out our window wasn't spectacular but that's what the John Hancock Observatory is for. The quality of sleep was incredible. The mattress was king sized and probably one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Oh, and I can't forget the pillows! Fantastic! I noticed someone else had complained about the cleanliness of the rooms/the housekeeping. In my experience the housekeeping staff did a really good job cleaning/restocking our room. I would recommend this hotel, for not only its location, but the price point as well. Now for a few other tidbits about our trip that I would recommend. Talk to William Tune at concierge. He offers excellent insight into the local restaurants among other things. For breakfast I would highly recommend two places. The first is very close, Tempo Cafe. They are open 24/7 as well. The breakfast is awesome! If you like eggs, try an omelette, they are incredible. I'd also recommend their pancakes or french toast! Another good breakfast joint is called Yolk. Ask Mr Tune about it. He will give you his business card, if its really busy when you go, give the card to the host and you apparently will get seated a lot sooner. We went during the week so it wasn't busy. If you want an authentic rustic Italian place you should go to Quartino!

First to address some of the more common comments posted. I found all of the staff courteous and helpful. The lobby is small, very small and that can be a problem with heavy foot traffic. The elevators are indeed small but I never waited more than 3 minutes for one and I was on the 16th floor. The hotel is in an 80 year old building people, not like they can install new larger ones, so get over it. We squeezed in 5 with carryon luggage so the constant complaints are unfounded. I was booked into a premium king. This is the most expensive room I have ever stayed in, over $200 a night so I had high expectations that unfortunately were only partially matched. The good, very nice linens and bed, fairly new and clean carpeting, AC that worked well, reasonably quite if not for the morning construction going on next door. The bad, the rooms are small, think European size. The bed was only 4 feet from the door, the wall paper was peeling all over, and some of the trim and paint work is absolutely sub-standard, almost juvenile in its quality. The chairs were threadbare and stained, the TV a tube model and no way to turn off the closed captioning. The bathroom while nicely tiled had extensive mold growing in the shower/tub. The water pressure and temperature varied slightly but wasn't enough to annoy or scald. The space around the sink was nice but tight. But the real kicker was the commercial toilet, you know the same ones you find in the gas station or the local department store. The toilet paper dispenser was in such an odd position you had to maneuver around it to slide onto the toilet seat, I was resting my elbow on the toilet paper. There were also traces of fecal matter on the underside of the lid. WiFi wasn't included in the cost of the room. Hallways were dingy and hot. It is a true shame as this has a chance to be a world class hotel. Some things are really nice, and some of the old character of the place is in desperate need of restoration. Some lovely moldings throughout that are just beat to hell. Same with the exterior. It is clear someone spent a lot of money on parts of the building a number of years ago but it has since been neglected. Reminds me of a cruise ship in need of a total refurbishment but instead gets new carpet and linens to try to hide how poorly it is looking. The promised sedan was never available and I never did see the concierge staff. Two restaurants that I didn't try. Location is good, a block from the miracle mile and the John Hancock Building. Virtually everyone I saw check in and out was business people for one or two days and I would say this is a good bet. Not a place for family or long term stays. Not a bad stay, just not the great stay it could be.

I couldn't wait to tell everyone that my experience was much better and absolutely trouble free. I read about complaints of musty smells, dirty sheets, dirty bathrooms, rude staff, bad elevators, bad water pressure; the list seemed endless.... So, as I approached the hotel on super easy public transportation (Blue Line from O'Hare, walk 2 blocks to Michigan Ave, and take one of many buses north to Delaware, walk less than a block and you're there) I took a deep breath. The gentleman that greeted me and checked me in was very polite. There were no problems with my reservation. In minutes I was on the waiting elevator up to my room. Yes, the elevators are small. Big deal. I was on it a total of 30 seconds in the four days I was in lovely Chicago. On to the room: Another deep breath as I opened my door. It was quite warm in the room - 79 degrees. A/C was set at 62. Uh oh! Before I panicked I tried turning the thermostat up to a more reasonable temperature - 74 degrees. Sometimes older A/C units freeze up if you tax them too much. If it was trying to cool to 62 degrees as the thermostat was set to maybe the unit was froze up... don't know if that was the problem but the room cooled to 74 degrees within 30 minutes of my adjustment. It was perfect for my entire stay. The room was clean and nice sized. I got an end of hall room which meant 2 sets of windows and great views of the city. Also - no noise from neighbors. Fantastic.

The hotel itself is old but in good care and clean. The room we stayed in was spacious and the first night of our stay we were greeted with a lovely plate of fruit and chocolate. The concierge was extremely helpful before and during our visit there - pointing out locations, maps and instructions on how to get to and from. I highly recommend you use public transportation - the bus is great and inexpensive, very clean and never had to wait more than a few minutes for the next one. Bus 151 or 147 will get you throughout most of the city with ease. I would also not waste your money on a taxi to the airport directly. Take a $10 taxi to the Clark station and ride the Blue line to Ohare airport for $2.25. (or reverse that to get to hotel from Ohare) I frequently travel to NYC and Chicago's subway system puts NYC's to shame. Clean, efficient and well lit with signs everywhere and no guess work. I also recommend the Trolley Tour through Coach USA. The stop is in front of the Hancock bldg and is $27 online in advance. 12 stops gets you pretty much through the entire city within a few hours and you get a free sample coupon for Garrett Popcorn and Hershey. The Lincoln Park zoo is free and wonderful - take a bike or walk through and take a picnic. Don't pay the fees for the Willis Tower or Hancock Tower observatory - go to the Hancock Signature Lounge on the 96th at dusk or late night for a (pricey) cocktail or dessert, looking out over the beautiful city....with no admittance fee!

Once I get here I will update this if my experience changes, but right now I am very shocked by the rudeness and lack of service from the employees at this \"luxury\" hotel. My husband and I made a reservation through Expedia for this hotel. We booked weeks ago and are leaving next week. Upon reading reviews for Whitehall, I noticed that people who did not confirm reservations sometimes have their rooms given away and no place to stay once they get there. I also wanted to know the price for parking and deposits, since it varies with each hotel. I had already called the other hotels we booked with, and they were nice and friendly and had no issue confirming our reservation and giving me the info I asked for. The first person I talked to was very rude and stated that he doesn't know why I am calling if I have a confirmation email from Expedia. I told him I still need to confirm through a person. He transferred me to reservations and they stated that they do not have my reservation on file and that they need to transfer me to in-house reservations. I got the voicemail. I called back again and they gave me a direct number to in-house. Except it is not a number to in-house, it just continued to transfer me to the front desk where I was very rudely spoken to by the front desk several times. Two of them hung up on me without even transferring me and another one berated me for trying to call and stated that it is my fault I keep getting transferred back because there is no one in the office right now. I am beyond pissed. If my reservation wasn't non-refundable, then I would cancel. Since that is not an option, I feel I should at least warn everyone about the horrible service you will receive from what is supposed to be a four star hotel. I got better service from Super 8 when I called them today. I am going to call back after 5 and try to get someone who is not rude. If that doesn't work then I am going to speak to a manager. My main annoyance is that I was spoken to like I am an idiot for wanting to confirm my reservation, yet it is no where to be found. I am quite sure that once we get there we will have no room and they will rudely attempt to shuffle us off to another hotel, as they have done to other guests. Do yourself a favor and take your business else where. It is ridiculous to pay for 4 star service and get the same service from employees that you would from a crack-house brothel front desk. Unbelieveable. UPDATE: I called Expedia, whom I set up the reservation through. They called the hotel. The agent was hung up on twice before she could get to a manager. The manager told her that she was busy and they were having some issues with a customer in the hotel. The expedia agent left a voicemail for the manager who called me over an hour later. When I explained the situation to her she stated that it was a problem with the phone system. I told her that is not the case since the people were outright rude and that has nothing to do with how the phone systems are working. She then stated \" They were probably annoyed and wondering why the same person called 300 times.\" So because I want to confirm a reservation, I am a jerk? Are you kidding? She then was able to immediately pull up my reservation and inform me of parking and deposits. She offered nothing to me because of her rude employees and I hung up. I told my husband and he was beyond pissed because this is part of our honeymoon. We came to an agreement that we just want our money back and want no part of this hotel. If it is already this bad before we even arrive, I can't imagine what these people will be like in person. We contacted Expedia again and they called the hotel. The agent was on the phone a very long time and stated that she was transferred 3 times and was on hold for a very long time. She came back on the line 10 mins later and stated that they would not give a refund because the manager was gone for the day and to call back tomorrow.

The hotel room was ranked on Priceline.com's website as a 4 star property. Upon arrival on 8/6/11, the first room assigned, #1511 was unacceptable as it had an atrocious odor permeating the room. The smell was not unlike the hundreds of crime scenes I have responded to as a career law enforcement officer. I reported my findings to the on-duty manager identified as \"Michelle\" who told me that there were no rooms left. After discussing the matter with her for the next five minutes, she refused to issue me a refund. Soon thereafter, a clerk named Carlos - the only pleasant, honest, and friendly staff member on site - stated there was one room left (funny, as Michelle was unaware of the vacant room). Carlos - the clerk who found the room - provided me with the key and I discovered the room was located next to the room with the horrible stench; room 1510. Upon entering room #1510, I was horrified as to what I had been provided. I discovered that the wall paper was peeling; the room and bed were smaller than agreed upon; the comforter was torn; there were cobwebs on the windows; and to top it off, there was a substance on the wall which appeared to have properties consistent with dried blood to the right of the headboard. Based upon my experience with room #1511 and now, #1510, I contacted Priceline's customer service line and spoke to a service rep. The service rep, connected me to the next level of care a customer relations representative. Upon informing the customer service relations representative of my problem - and spending 15 minutes for them to understand my plight - she informed me that it was up to hotel management to refund my money. She stated that she would call the hotel to discuss it. The Priceline rep called the hotel - spoke to Michelle - and ultimately, the refund was denied by Michelle - stating that the deficiencies I pointed out in the second room were \"aesthetic\" and that she offered to use an ozone machine to fix the smell of the first room. The Priceline rep called me back and told me that there was nothing further she could do. I informed the rep that Priceline is a party to the civil matter and that they provided a falsely advertised product and were refusing to assist me. Meanwhile, after 45 minutes of arguing with Michelle - with the Priceline rep listening and recording the conversation - Michelle agreed to refund 3 of the 4 days of billing; refusing to refund me for the night of check-in. The Priceline rep stated she could only refund 3 of the 4 days and I would have to take up day 4 with the hotel. I have a claim into the hotel and my credit card company for the 4th day - as well as another call to Customer Service Relations Clerk \"Matt\" (placed on 8/11/11). Apparently, the Whitehall Hotel Manager - Abel Cartagena - approved the full refund (as I have his voice mail telling me so) but Priceline has no record of it. In all, my experience with Priceline and the Whitehall Hotel in Chicago was - and continues to be - dismal. As far as the staff, Michelle was downright rude, hostile, and condescending; she even lied to me and told me that she didn't know who the General Manager of the Hotel was when I asked her. As far as the hotel, I have the photos which depict what I wrote about above.

It was our first trip to Chicago and we weren't exactly sure what area of downtown to stay. I read the reviews of the Whitehall and was sold. This boutique hotel is old, so have no preconceived notions, there are cracks along the floor boards and in some corners or the wall. I think this added to the charm. We stayed in a King room and were immediately enamored with it. The room wasn't small per say but quaint. The bathroom was teeny and the toilet was broken. We called down to the front desk and they had a service man there within minutes. Our view wasn't the best (a back alley) but the charm of the room made up for it. The hotel itself is full of knick-knacks and pictures. The decor takes you back in time and so does the lighting. The elevator and hallways are very small, but again I think this adds to the charm. We wandered into some of the anterior rooms and were again very pleased with the decor and overall feel. We never had a chance to eat in the adjoining Italian restaurant and wine bar, but we will make a point to when we return. There is a Starbucks behind the hotel, get to it in 3 minutes by using the alley. We would go for a morning coffee then wander the streets. We felt very much at home. The Whitehall is super close to the Miracle Mile and other downtown must-sees.

This year, the hotel that popped up after our purchase was The Whitehall Hotel on Delaware. It was $73 for the evening which is VERY reasonable for that area. The room we got for that price was a \"Superior Queen\" room. It was small but we weren't spending much time in the room. The room was very clean and the bathroom - although on the small side again - was gorgeous and very functional. My wife really appreciated the built in lighted makeup mirror. Not many hotels have had that. The bed was very comfortable, the bedding was excellent, and the room included a Zenith standard tube TV (reception was sketchy on the local Fox TV channel and a couple of other channels) and a refrigerator. WiFi is available for a fee (come on...a fee...really?). They have a couple of restaurants attached to the hotel - a very nice Italian restaurant and a new Chinese restaurant. The lobby is very small and cozy as are the elevators. It's an older hotel to be sure, but it's very charming and that's just our style. We're not very keen on the new Chicago direction of the gleaming steel and glass Euro-style hotels. The location of the hotel is AWESOME. 1/2 block from Michigan avenue and about 1 minute walk to Water Tower Place, Bloomingdales and the Oak Street Boutique shops. It's directly across the street from the Four Seasons. As far as negatives, there weren't many. We couldn't hear people in other rooms, but you could sure hear the plumbing. When somebody would run their shower or flush a toilet, it was quite loud. But we were so tired after a full day of walking around and eating, we slept like babies and it was never an issue. Street noise was minimal - we never heard any horns or cars, etc. Delaware is a one way street that's fairly tight so there isn't a ton of traffic. Check their website for seasonal deals though. After we made our online purchase, I checked their website and saw they had a Superior King room including Valet parking ($48 value) for $119. That's a few dollars cheaper than what we paid and for a larger room. The valet parking is the way to go if you're planning to stay longer than 24 hours. There is self park across the street for $31 for 24 hours, but if you plan on staying any longer than that, it is more expensive than the $48 hotel valet parking.

We stay at a different hotel each time to experience the differences in location, ammenities, decorating styles and skyline views. We recently stayed at The Whitehall Hotel on E. Deleware Place and were shocked at the rooms. We knew it was a 1920's boutique hotel and had heard favorable comments from friends who had stayed there in the past so were eager to see what we would find. We stayed two nights checking in on Saturday left on Monday morning. This hotel is listed as a four star hotel and is priced as such. Shockingly, the rooms had not been decorated (or redecorated) in at least 15 to 20-years or longer. With all of the competition from new, hip hotels with current room furnishings and flat screen TVs, the Whitehall rooms were so outdated and worn, we wondered what was wrong with the management and hotel. There is a huge difference between good traditional furnishings and worn, outdated furniture. Our room was on the side of the hotel looking at a solid wall of the building next door. I have not seen an armoir in a hotel room in a number of years now that TV manufacturers have introduced flat screen TVs but there was barely one foot of space between the beat up armoir with the large outdated TV and the foot of the bed. Very tight and inconvenient for two adults to try to maneuver in the small room. The upholstered furniture was so thread bare that the stuffing was exposed. The plaster ceiling in the bathroom was crumbling and falling apart in two places from obvious water damage from what we assumed was the room above. Again, we were shocked based on the hotel's reputation and price. The hotel was fully booked on Saturday night but they moved us to a larger and different room on another floor on Sunday night when they had less guests in the hotel. That room, while still well outdated in its decorating and furnishing, didn't have the stuffing coming through the chair seat material nor ceilings falling in. I must admit though that the beds and pillows in both rooms were absolutely heavenly and I could have stayed in the pillow soft beds for days! Both beds had pillow mattress tops, thick downy comforters and large downy soft pillows. Both my partner and I admitted that we had two of the best nights of sleep we've both had in a long time by sinking into the beds. Almost forgot, the hotel has a very comfortable panelled lounge with deep couches and chairs which was perfect for curling up and reading the Sunday newspaper along with the complimentary coffee served in this room. If the hotel would update the rooms and ditch the armoirs for flat screen TV's, the rooms would be roomier and far more appealing.

Only problem (why I'm not giving them a perfect review on service) is that they never did bring me foam pillows to replace the feather ones. I called twice, asked the front desk, and each time after being told that someone was coming, nobody actually showed up. So I ended up using my towels to create a makeshift pillow.

It was fine for the two nights, but I wouldn't want to stay longer than that. My issue was definitely with the room service. My boyfriend and I came in around 11pm one night after visiting the city. We had just got stuck in the rain and we were soaking wet when we came in. I asked the front desk to send up a towel to our room, and the gentleman said he would. When we got to our room, my boyfriend then called down for ice. Less than 10 minutes later a gentleman came to our room with the ice, but no towel. The man looked, creepy, to say the least. He was tall, with messy hair. He then waited by the door for a tip. I obviously wasn't going to tip him for bringing us ice with no towel, so when we went to close the door on him he rolled his eyes at us. I am not at all impressed with the service at this hotel and probably should have stayed elsewhere.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stow, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful old hotel\u201d", "Author": "SusanMOH", "ReviewID": "UR77332617", "Content": "The room was gorgeous and comfortable.

After researching on tripadvisor.com, I decided to go with the Whitehall because it had the following amenities that I really like when in Chicago: 1) In the middle of everything for hubby and I, but on a one-way, lovely street off of N. Michigan Ave. 2) The Red Line El is an easy three-block walk. 3) The 145/146 buses that run up and down Michigan Ave. are a block away (I had business on South Michigan). 4) A huge variety of restaurants of every type and price point. 5) Boutique hotel with historic details. (Real historical details/interest, not \"run down\" details.) 6) Valet Parking package was available (it's normal to pay $35 - $50 a day to park anywhere in or around the Mag Mile or downtown). In brief, The Whitehall Hotel is a lovely gem situated on N. Delaware between Rush St. and N. Michigan Ave. The nice thing about it is that you really do not get the noise problem from Michigan Ave. even though you are a 1 minute walk from N. Michigan. The hotel is directly behind the beautiful Presbyterian Church that's covered in ivy. (Worth a vist to see the grounds and the inside of the church, especially when they have chamber music - a great respite from the crowds). The rooms at The Whitehall are beautifully appointed with a variety of pillows and great beds. Extra blanket and pillow in the closet, along with robes, an umbrella to use on stomy days, a safe, etc. Bathtub/shower, sink area, toilet are smallish. I've had smaller in NYC and San Francisco. I was frankly suprised at the size of the bedroom (rather roomy with ample drawer and closet space and a writing desk with internet plug-in). There are two elevators. They are small. When I say \"small\" I mean they hold four or maybe five 175-pound people comfortably. Or a luggage cart and two people. There is a wonderful restaurant with 24-hour room service. The room service menu prices are not as outrageous as you would think for a boutique hotel on the Mag Mile. I had tea or coffee in the morning downstairs and ate out in other restaurants the remainer of the stay. I did have iced tea and the bruschetta off the bar menu yesterday afternoon, and the bruschetta was fabulous. The concierge was beyond helpful. She was wonderful. I overheard someone put her on task to find a Chinese restaurant that had scallion pancakes on their menu. And she got it right off the bat. \"Red line to Chinatown, then across the street.\" Kudos to the concierge lady. The staff and management are very friendly. If staff are harried/hassled by confused tourists who hadn't done their research and didn't feel like walking one block to the Chicago Visitors Center across the street at Chicago Ave., they would get a little quick, but then so would I. Bellmen and valet staff were great and very responsive. This is an upscale boutique hotel in the Mag Mile area. If you like everything on the huge side (huge elevators, huge bathrooms, huge lobbies, etc.) this is not the hotel for you.

Our room was very clean, and housekeeping was attentive. The bed was very comfortable, with a pillow-top mattress cover. The bathroom was of average size but attractively updated with granite and tile. The room was tastefully decorated. Some of the furniture is showing a little wear but it is still in decent shape. The hotel's public rooms are beautifully decorated with a clubby, English feel. We did not happen to eat at the hotel's restaurant, but did look at the menu.

Understaffed: The staff were all very nice, but there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough of them. I had to wait in a long line when I arrived, as only one person was working at the front desk.

Turned out there was a trick to opening the door -- you had to hold the handle in the down position, and THEN insert the key card. So it took me close to an hour to get into my room. Basically, it seems like this hotel is riding on its location. It has the feeling of a place that hasn't been maintained well at all, and hasn't been invested in for many years. Many of the front desk people and bellhops were very nice, but world-class service can't make up for lack of sleep and a hotel that is shabby and falling apart. I actually changed my travel plans and checked out a night early. It was great to finally get a full night of sleep. Other cons: Limited room service hours.

Individual switches on each lamp made it a chore to arrange for sufficient light. Guests are limited to one very small drawers per person. We found a letter to guests, notifying them that since renovations were in progress, they should expect noise from 9AM, even on weekends. Not a welcoming message. The bathroom was immaculate and the sink tap brought forth plenty of hot water, inspiring hopes of a steamy morning shower. Those hopes were dashed at 8AM, when we shivered in the shower, as the water temps hovered roughly two degrees above tepid. As we arrived in the hotel restaurant on a weekend morning, we were turned away. The hotel management had booked a private party, despite the fact that there was a fully renovated dining room on the second floor.

Check in was quick and efficient and we didn't smell any strange smells in the lobby during our 8 days!! Our room was 1313, maybe unlucky for some but not for us.

The bathroom was also a nice size and very clean. Towels and toiletries were in good supply. We were obviously in one of the newly renovated rooms as there was no problem with tired looking furnishings, dusty carpets or peeling wallpaper. Facilities in the room included a minibar, TV, hairdryer, safe, iron/ironing board and robes. No tea/coffee making facilites are in the room but it is available in the lobby in the morning. Ice is brought by the evening turn down service. We were situated at the end of a corridor and rarely heard any noise from other guests.

There is a notice in the room to warn you of renovation work and they do have plastic sheeting down in the corridors but if we did happen to be in the room during the day (when jetlag kicked in) we didn't hear any extra noise. Probably the best part of The Whitehall though is its location. Just off Mag Mile its easy to reach most of downtown Chicago by foot and its very safe. We walked as far south as Soldier Field and as far north as North Ave beach. The only public transport we used was the water taxi but that was more for sightseeing than necessity. The John Hancock Tower is virtually on the doorstep as is great shopping and lots of nice restaurants.

The temperature controls responded, and when we set it at 69, the room actually cooled to 69, but for some reason, during the night, the AC did not work at all.

My family and I came to Chicago for a wedding and chose this hotel first and foremost because of the location. It's central location was key because we were only going to be in town for the weekend, and it was in the middle of everywhere we needed to be for our numberous weekend activities. When I arrived to checkin on Friday night around 8pm, I was told that all three of our rooms were unavailable, and the rest of the rooms were booked. They said that there had been a \"plumbing problem.\" No effort to contact me in advance was made, even though I had booked 2 months in advance. When asked what other options there were, I was told that there were 3 rooms available at the BEST WESTERN A MILE SOUTH of the hotel. Only after some haggling did they even offer to comp the first night. I thought that this was somewhat of a luxury hotel with luxury prices, and for them to offer me a night at the Best Western was incredulous, not to mention that it put us a mile south of where we had planned to be. They wanted us to check out of the Best Western the next day and check back into the Whitehall , which was impossible because we had a schedule to keep during the day. That is not the kind of service I expect from an establishment such as this. Only after complaining did they offer to put us up at the Talbott Hotel a block away. Why did they not offer this in the first place? It made the first offer at the Best Western feel like a huge lowball offer. Their explanation was that the hotel also owned the Best Western. I guess management cares more about cutting costs than about customer service. Two hours of my Friday night was wasted with this hotel which made me miss most of the reception that was taking place nearby. The best outcome of this whole ordeal was the TALBOTT Hotel. It was a beautiful and intimate boutique hotel, with spacious rooms and an incredibly professional staff. If you are visiting Chicago want to stay in a great location with wonderful comfort, service, and style, do yourself a favor and spare yourself the hassle, STAY AT THE TALBOTT Hotel.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "Sloane1121", "ReviewID": "UR30860174", "Content": "This was our first trip to Chicago and we weren't quite sure where to stay.

This visit, we had an unbelievable rate of approx $135 per night for a regular room. Well, as this was probably the cheapest rate ever, we were given the worst room. Unbelievable that they would even show a room like this to anyone, especially when the hotel was no where near capacity. Rm. 603 if you are interested. First, of course there is no view, we were expecting that for such little money. But then... we noticed an actual hole in the wall next to the radiator, and it went all the way to the outside... in Chicago, in Winter. The room was freezing! Was management aware of this? Well, there was a fur throw on the bed (and not one in the next room we transferred to). Because the room was walled in by larger buildings on all sides, it was dark dark dark. Now I realize if you get a bargain rate, you get a bargain rate room, but this was truly unacceptable. So we called downstairs to be moved to another room. They did not offer another room at the same price, but we could upgrade to Pinnacle level for $50 more per night. So we did. The room was actually the same size, actually the same room, on the 16th floor, with no hole and a great view. Unfortunately we learned early the next morning it was also right next to the maid cart closet... BANG BANG BANG! And if the first room is typical of all \"regular\" rooms, then only the \"pinnacle\" rooms are acceptable, in my opinion. I believe all the times previously we paid for the \"pinnacle\" rooms as well. Also, although the pinnacle level rooms are all the same price (except for the suites) I think many are larger and have bigger, four poster beds. On other Whitehall visits, our rooms were larger and nicer. This was by far the smallest room we had ever stayed in. So to get the best for your money, ask for a larger pinnacle room with four poster bed, away from the elevators, away from the maid closet and with a good view. My feeling is that Whitehall needs to be both price competitive (which it is) but also needs that special something (service... feeling that a guest is welcome and appreciated) that makes up for some of the inconveniences (small rooms, outdated bathrooms, tiny elevators, aging wallpaper and carpets, having to call down for ice) which can either be viewed as charming or a pain, depending on how you as a guest are treated.

The only problem I had was I do not use credit cards, I pay cash. For some reason this hotel does not appreciate this commendable approach and insists on you keeping a credit balance in their favour. I have never experienced this approach in Europe. Usually the norm is to settle your account on departure. Yes, they have all your details including passport. I found this particularly irritating as I had to constantly provide deposits of dollars to satisfy the hotel desk. You wonder why this is annoying?

That's it. Now to the bad: We were in Room 611 that overlooked an alley in which dumpsters from every nearby building were seemingly located. While the view was less than ideal, our issue concerned noise. On Friday morning at 6:17 a.m. (our first morning in the hotel and more than four hours before we planned on getting up) we were awoken by the incredibly loud sounds of garbage trucks backing into the alley (beeping every second or so), picking up dumpsters, and then dropping them onto the ground. If this only happened once it would still have been annoying, but might also have been a reality of staying downtown. Unfortunately, it did not happen only once. It happened repeatedly from 6:17 a.m. until around 9 a.m. (after MANY separate dumpster loads were picked up and DROPPED). Having our sleep ruined by dumpsters, we then had the rest of the morning ruined by constant whistles from bellmen hailing taxis (that lasted until at least 11 a.m.). We complained to the hotel staff who told us that there were no rooms available to move us until later that day, so we went about our business of trying to enjoy our long weekend in Chicago. When we returned to the hotel in late-afternoon, we were told that the hotel only had one room available on the 5th floor of the hotel - albeit not right over dumpster alley, but still pretty low. We asked whether dumpsters would be picked up in dumpster alley on Saturday morning (it being a weekend) and were told by the front desk person that the hotel's were not picked up on Saturday and that she did not \"think\" but (in fairness) could not be certain that other dumpsters would not be picked up the next morning. Having places to go and not wishing to re-pack and move to another low floor, we risked it one more night. BIG mistake. The next morning - at precisely 6:42 a.m. - we were greeted with the relentless sounds of dumpsters being picked up and dropped. Having a second morning completely ruined by the sound of crashing dumpsters, we again complained, and this time we did decide to re-pack and move to a much higher floor - further away from the dumpsters. It is scarcely believable that the Whitehall would not: a) warn their guests whose rooms overlook the alley; b) contact the waste management companies to adjust their pick up schedules; and c) work on soundproofing the \"dumpster alley\" rooms. Almost as bad as was the noise was the reaction of the hotel staff to our complaints. While they did ultimately change our room, most quality hotels would have comped both nights, but not the Whitehall - which ironically describes itself as a \"landmark destination,\" \"one of the eight great small hotels in the U.S.,\" and a hotel that \"will exceed all of [our] expectations.\" Indeed, we didn't even get a fruit basket. From this experience at the Whitehall, if you are planning on staying at the Whitehall you should definitely inquire whether your room faces the alley.

The staff at the Whitehall were all very professional and helpful. We called ahead and asked for a King pinnacle room. It was ready for us when we arrived later in the day. There are two tiny elevators for twenty floors. The elevators have recently had a facelift. The 17th floor appears to have had a facelift as well. We had room 1712 which is a corner room away from any other noise. The king pinnacle room was very tiny, but it was clean, the furniture all looked somewhat new, the newer bedding was very luxurious. The TV and the cabinet that held it were the only things that looked worn. The view out our window was of another building. This was ok. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there to sit in my room and look out the window. Our teeny room was nicely appointed, clean, odor free, and the bed linens were new and comfortable. There is a down type comforter also there was a feather bed over the mattress, which I found odd at first, but then I got used to it and it felt somewhat cozy. The pillows on the bed were feather pillows. I slept very well, kind of like sleeping on a cloud. Our room had a pricey mini bar and an in room safe. The closet was quite large with very nice wood hangers and satin hangers. Their was an iron and ironing board. The bathroom was clean with a blow dryer, magnifying makeup mirror, bath sheet size towels. The maid was very generous with refilling our shampoos and soaps.

One morning we ordered a continental breakfast and it was $25.00 for one person! Not worth the money, but works from a convenience standpoint. The parking is very pricy at approximately $44.00 a day. This price is inline with other Chicago Hotels. You do have in and out privileges. One night we ate at Fornetto Mei restaurant right next door. The menu confusing being Italian and oriental, but the food was good. The prices were average. It is a cozy, intimate, gold coast restaurant & pizza bar.

When I arrived to check-in at 5pm on a Friday afternoon, I asked the front desk personnel if it would be possible to get two double beds, or even a King (since I was travelling with a friend.) She looked at my reservation, then looked down her nose at me and said with snotty disdain \"Ooh, I see you booked your stay through a third party website. I am sorry, all the kings and double rooms are \"committed\" for this evening.\" (She implied that kings/doubles are only available if you book directly with the hotel. Otherwise, you're stuck with a random room that nobody else wants.) When she said that, I found it rather odd that (1) every other king/doubles room was fully occupied at that point in the day, and (2) that every other guest had already checked in for the night, and there was only 1 room left in the entire hotel for me. If the king rooms were already \"committed\" to some other guest, why did I not have the ability to have them reserve one for ME??? Very suspect, and very strange. As I was waiting for the elevator, someone else came in, and asked for a king bed. The clerk \"Yes, sir, we do have a king available for you.\" I was livid. But I proceeded to my room, and my room keys did not work. After another trip to the lobby to get proper keys, I promptly entered the room to find that it was a very odd-shaped corner room scarely larger than a closet. The foot of the bed (a double bed) was so close to the armoire, I could barely open the cabinet doors. Because of the odd shape, it was hard to find a place to set our luggage without bumping into something else. Furthermore, there was no furniture/drawer space to unpack your luggage if you are planning to stay in the city for more than one night! The furniture was terribly outdated, the table tops on the desk, nightstands, and side table were badly scratched/damaged, the airconditioner ran loudly and sounded like a washing machine in mid-cycle, the alarm clock was faulty, and kept \"crackling\" audibly all night, the TV cable channels sucked (a majority of the channels were either sports or news) and the walls of the room were paper thin. We could hear every conversation in the next room. The front desk staff didn't seem knowledgeable about the area. When asked where the nearest pharmacy was, she mentioned the Walgreens on Michigan (4 blocks away.) However, there was a Walgreens only about 1.5 blocks away over on Rush. The best was when I left early one morning, the door man was standing there picking his nose, then reached out to grab the door to open it for me. I made sure not to touch that door from that point on. The Whitehall should treat all customers the same...and not give preferential treatment to customers who book their room directly with the hotel vs. a third-party website.

Hopefully this review gives a more balance impression. If your looking for a 4-5* international chain hotel with modern bland features, an excessively grand lobby, vast corridors that stretch for miles and miles, and rooms and bathrooms so large that you could get lost in them, then the Whitehall is not for you. If on the other hand you're looking for a more than perfectly acceptable hotel in a superbly central location (just yards from the Hancock Tower), in a quiet location with friendly staff, then the Whitehall will suit you fine. If your budget can stretch to $600-700 and more per night then the nearby Four Seasons, Westin or numerous others (all with loyalty programs) will meet your every whim. Then again, if you're looking for change from $300-400 per night then go for the Whitehall. Sure the Whitehall lobby's small, and the elevators tiny as are most of the bathrooms, but if this means I save $200 a night then count me in. You simply can't go wrong. I also have a slight problem thinking of the Whitehall as a boutique hotel; after all it has well over 200 rooms - in Europe we think of a boutique hotel with usually no more than a few dozen rooms - but it's just a marketing label! The Whitehall will never set the world alight but I'd have no qualms in returning. It does exactly what it sets out to do. If the Whitehall can deliver what it does for the price then either the bigger chains are charging too much for what they offer or maybe we the customer should be looking for an even grander quality of service, delivering better value for money.

And it should be. When one stays at a hotel, three basic criteria should be met: 1) the room is clean 2) the room is quiet and safe 3) everything in the room should be in working order. The Whitehall is clean. But the service is lacking in many ways. The noise from hallway activity and other room doors closing is easily audible in the hotel room. Nothing seemed to be in working order. But, things were promptly fixed. I stayed at the Whitehall four nights and just checked out. I am now across the street at the Four Seasons, as a colleague allowed me to use the business center at the hotel there. They have complimentary computer access. The Whitehall does not. The Four Seasons also has nice little amenities, like complimentary drinks in the lobby, bottled water at the front door, and stuff that makes you truly feel welcome. The staff is friendly and helpful. At the Whitehall, there are no in-room coffee makers but coffee service from 7-10am. There are no ice makers but room service will gladly bring you a full bucket of ice. The staff is friendly, but at some points in my stay of little use. One person in my party who got a room on the ninth floor moved to a room on the 8th floor because the heater/cooler/air vent box had a pinging noise that wouldn't stop. Also, the bathroom smelled like a nursing home. Even the bell captain who came in to assist in her room move put his fingers up to his nose. My room was fine. The furniture is a little worn, but perhaps that is what \"boutique hotel\" is all about. My clock radio was broken, so that when you went to set the alarm the time kept winding backward. I called the front desk, and a Spanish-speaking housekeeper promply came up to my room and replaced the radio with a new model. She also volunteered to set the clock and the alarm, but she could not understand the Engish directions so I stepped in (I am bilingual). Later, I learned that my phone in the bathroom did not work properly, the cordless desk phone was inoperable, the knob for the bathroom vent was broken and that the colour settings of my television were off and there was no way to fix them. I told the front desk about all of this on Friday at about 10:30am, when a package that had been sent overnight via FedEx from Miami on Thursday morning should have arrived. It was urgent, as my convention sessions were rapidly coming to a midday end, and I needed it. Fast. I waited about 20 minutes for Heather at the front desk to track down the person that takes care of packages that are sent to guests. After 20 minutes, I was told no package was there. Frustrated, I ran back to the Drake, where I was certain things like this didn't happen. But the Drake wanted me to spend about $269 a night plus tax for a room. The Whitehall, with tax, was $160 a night. For that price, this hotel - even with the little things that mean a lot to those that travel extensively noticeably absent - is a true value. It's in the heart of the Gold Coast, literally steps away from the John Hancock Tower and the Magnificent Mile. For the price, you won't be beat. If it's first-class service you are looking for, go elsewhere. Just be sure your electricity is in proper working order. At about 10pm last night the woman in room 1110 came back to find that none of the lights would turn on in her room. Nice, huh? On a post-script, upon checkout an hour ago I was asked if I received the FedEx package that arrived on Friday. I was astonished. NO!!! It seems it came in at about 1pm - just as my convention was ending. The front-desk receptionist said a text message was left on my hotel room phone. OK - this makes no sense. How many hotel room phones have text messaging capabilities? And, if so, shouldn't there be a blinking message-waiting light on the phones - or at least one of the three phones in my room? I don't know when I will be back in Chicago again, but another colleague spent about $40 more to stay at the Hilton Suites.

We were promised a non-smoking room with 2 beds. When we were shown to our room, it absolutely reeked of smoke the minute you opened the door and we immediately asked to move. 2.The only room available had one bed, which was not preferable, but we were willing to deal with that. However, once we started getting settled, it was apparent that the bed had NOT been changed from the previous guest, nor had the room been cleaned. There was even still personal food items in the minibar. YUCK! There were no other rooms available at that time, so they did send up a crew at that time to clean it (who were very pleasant & apologetic....though see below about makeup bag!). We were in a rush to get to dinner, so left them there cleaning, and the room was fine when we got back. 3. The next morning, I realized that I could not find my makeup bag, filled with at least $250 worth of expensive cosmetics), which I had left out when getting settled. I thought that perhaps I had left it at home, but when I got home, it was not there. When I called to see if it had been found, my call was never returned. My only conclusion is that the crew who cleaned the room as were were leaving to go to dinner took it. 4. They ran out hot water in the showers after about 5 minutes & this was one of the coldest weekends of the year...5-10 degrees out! Brrr....thank God we had spa appts. & showered there. 5. When we checked out & reported these problems, the staff was not apologetic, not were they willing (or, according to them, sanctioned) to give us any kind of compensation, in fact, told us the room we were in was NICER than the one we had reserved and/or had a higher rate. WHAT?! We did manage to get the same rate, so we could get out of there. I also overheard several other guests complaining about the cold water, broken faucets, etc. My friend was in a hurry to get to the airport, so we didn't push it any further, but if we hadn't been in a time crunch, I would have spoken to the manager. Instead, I am (finally) speaking to you--the consumer! 6. When I wrote an email about my experience to the hotel management I never received any response.

I was expecting a nice, smaller, elegant boutique hotel. Unfortunately, this property smells of cigarette smoke and was somewhat shabby. We checked in on a Thursday evening. We were given a room on the 12th floor that can only be described as one step above flea-bag. The paint was peeling off the walls, the furniture was battered, the carpet was dirty, the bathroom was out of the 60's or 70's and dirty with burned out light bulbs. The entire room reeked of must, mildew, and cigarette smoke. The windows were frozen shut. When we pointed that out to the bellman and asked if he could open them, he shrugged and did nothing. The next morning the smell was so bad that we asked to be moved to a new room. We were then informed that the entire 12th floor was smoking. We had never been asked (either when booking the room or at check-in) if we preferred smoking or non (we are both non-smokers). We were told that our luggage would be moved to a new room while we were out that day. We returned to the hotel that evening and nothing had been moved. We were then given a new room which seemed out of a different hotel - clean and nice with a remodeled bathroom. It was 1000 times better. The linens and beds are very nice. I do agree with previous guests that the hallway carpeting is beyond shabby and stained. Also, the cigarette smoke smell tends to creep up and down the elevator shafts and you can still smell the smoke on non-smoking floors pretty strongly, even in the rooms. Avoid this hotel if you can't stand cigarette smoke. Unfortunately, none of the staff were very helpful.

We booked a hotel/air package. I called from the airport as we were leaving to check to make sure they were expecting us and talked with a very NEGATIVE lady! I asked if we could have a queen or king if not two double beds and she told me that since we booked through an internet website ( arrogance in her voice) we would be supplied with a double!! She was very short with me. As I was telling her that was fine and we'd make do, she transfered me to the front desk. I told the gentleman, that I'd just called to make sure we had a room and had just inquired about beds and had been informed that there was NO way we could change from a double to a queen, king or two doubles and that was FINE. No problem. I was really not upset about it UNTIL the lady was so rude to me. Anyway, be that as it may, we did have a very postive experience at the Whitehall. Freddie, who greeted us at the front desk is THE PERFECT representative for a hotel!! I apoligized for the misunderstanding and told him a double would be fine to which he agreed that we'd be more comfortable with more space and presented us with a king room! I have to say, his generosity and graciousness, along with the friendliness of the staff is what any hotel should strive for in order to add that extra touch often missing in the larger nonpersonal \"super-mega\" hotels. We stayed on the 8th floor. Unlike a previous review, we didn't have hardwood floors but carpeting. The bath and bed were spotless! I said before in other reviews that I love the covered comforter and the white bedding. You know you're in a clean bed because it's a little hard to mask spots on white linens. The furniture in the room was a bit worn but tasteful and the hallway carpet needs to be replaced. Having said that, I need to agree with my daughter that I'm glad the hotel took care of the most important things to renovate first, like the bath and beds. I can live with the other. There are no ice machines but the hotel provides ice which is complimentary (when you call room service ). We didn't use this service but I'm sure if used, a small tip would be appropriate. We did take advantage of the free coffee and tea in the lobby each morning. It was brewed perfectly. They offer REAL cream and not creamer which was a nice touch. There are only two elevators but we were there during the Labor Day weekend with an abundance of guests and we only had to wait a couple of times with the elevator being full and it returned to our floor within a few minutes. The location of this hotel is one of it's best selling points. It's a half block from Michigan Avenue and half block from Rush Street. You can walk everywhere from here if you're a walker and if not, there are cabs and transportation right out the door. This little hotel is unique. I hate hotels that are so large, you feel like you're lost on a cruise ship! This hotel isn't for everyone. It's older, therefore historical which is just another reason I love it. It's not lush, but is tasteful with a bit of European charm thrown in. The rooms aren't memorable but the beds are spotless and clean as well as the bathrooms. Our sink had a small back up problem in the mornings when everyone was using the plumbing but it eventually drained after a few minutes. You couldn't ask for a better or friendlier staff. Also, my daugther and I had a man follow us into the hotel and into the elevator and before we figured out what he was doing, he followed us out of the elevator. The moment we stepped out of the elevator, I put it all together and as the doors were closing I told the man on the elevator. He called the security. Also there was a maid on our floor and we told her as she was standing near our door. I had already confronted the man and she did too and told him he needed to leave if he wasn't a guest. The security were there within minutes to deal with this man and talked with us in order to make a report . We should have been more aware of our surroundings and I hadn't realized that he'd been trying to touch my daughter on the elevator! If I'd known, I'd never have gotten off and would have stayed on with the other guests ( a man and his wife) and reported it with them. (safety in numbers) This could have ruined our stay but didn't as it was handled very professionally and quickly and we felt safe and stayed more aware for the rest of our stay.", "Date": "September 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Napa, California", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "vingale", "ReviewID": "UR5783781", "Content": "We loved the Whitehall hotel.

(Super Sweet....she said 10-15 Minutes it would be ready) So instead of throwing a hissie fit, we asked where the hotel bar was. We sat down and my sister asked if we got a free drink because our room was not ready yet? TONY the bar manager at the time said \"Well sure you can\" So we did. And then we had another because the staff at the lounge bar was so fun and full of info as to where to dine, lunch, dinner, shop, dance, people watch. (Air Show was going on) Now off to the room we went.........Wonderful! We had two double beds and a view of the lake. We lucked out with a corner room!!!! The staff was so sweet to us, and yes they opened doors for us. Remembered our names and where we were from. The key at any Hotel is to treat the staff like you would treat your friends walking into your home. If you treat them extra nice, they will do the same for you. If I had someone come into my home and start complaining about the thread count or the selection of wine I picked out for the night etc, I will apoligize and tend to my other guests with open arms. But here is the deal........I do not have 20+ floors in my home. So I think all of you with bad remarks need to settle down a bit and look at the Whitehall as a great hotel. Tony, Joe, Leo.....Wonderful in the Bar/Reatrauant The location is wonderful!!!! The doormen are great. We keep our bags there after checking out and it was tip top. So, yes it is Chicago, and there are many hotels to choose from, BUT The Whitehall does do a wonderful job!!!!!", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Akron, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice - we'd go back\u201d", "Author": "sikronfl", "ReviewID": "UR3778717", "Content": "My daughter and I spent Aug. 12 -14 at Whitehall.

Most things are within walking distance. Hancock Observatory is right down the street with great meals at the Cheesecake Factory patio. We also grabbed a quick burger at Johnny Rockets on the other corner from Whitehall. An excellent Italian restaurant called Papa Milanos was a couple of blocks away. The reception girls were pleasant and friendly at Whitehall, as were the doormen, and valets. The room was nice with a double bed, new carpet, and plenty of lights/ lamps. The furniture was quaint and in excellent condition, as was the bed - great sleeping. Mirrors were plentiful - full length on the double sliding closet doors, huge mirror over the desk, and in the bathroom. Drapes were in fine condition, windows were clean. The air conditioner worked great. There were 3 phones - one on the desk, one on the nightstand, and one in the bathroom. The bathroom was large, and very clean, with lovely tile flooring, large vanity, and hairdryer. (The room also had an iron and ironing board.) The concierges were excellent - Ronald and Tim. They didn't rush us and had all the needed maps and info. To get ice, we had to call down to room service. They brought it up within 5 min. The adjoining lounge had a relaxing atmosphere with a piano player and singer. We didn't check out the fitness room - no time. We would stay there again.

Not the case. For $269/night, we were shown to a tiny, dingy, musty old room with a window facing a blank wall. The furniture was outdated, and wallpaper tried unsuccessfully to mask a large crack in one wall. The bathroom was not big enough for two people. It really did have old cracked tile on the floor and the shower was mildewed beyond belief! I called the desk clerk immediately and simply said the room was unacceptable and asked for another. She said she would call back in two minutes. After 15 minutes without a reply, I called again; she had forgotten! This time she said we could move to one of their \"nicest, recently refurbished rooms on the club level\" and when we got there had to believe that The Whitehall just doesn't know any better. The room was larger, with no apparent cracks, and a little view of the city around the corner of a brick ell. However, the dark granite that replaced the old tile in the bathroom didn't quite hide the mildew in the corners, and the furniture was exactly the same as in the first room. One good thing stood out--the beds in both rooms were the same: very comfortable, with luxurious fine linens. We were never offered the club level amenities, but what kept us here for 4 nights was the concierge staff (Tim is exceptional!), the location, and the bed! Take away those three things, and you have an $80/night Best Western with so-so housekeeping. By the way, our friends' room had such lumpy carpeting that it was a trick to negotiate walking; they were shown another room but it wasn't much better.

We researched the hotel on trip advisor ahead of time, and some of the reviews were admittedly a bit disconcerting. But we read enough \"between the lines\" of the bad reviews to realize this was probably our place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was! The most important thing to know about the Whitehall is that it is a boutique hotel, not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mega-tel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is small, quiet, elegant, and personal. This has to fit your personality or you will be disappointed. Otherwise it's like finding a diamond! Front Desk: All of the counter staff were superior, and they went out of her way to make us feel at home. Shift changes only proved that this service was status quo and every request was handled impeccably. Room: We stayed in a king-room on the Pinnacle level, which was fabulous. Our room's furnishings were very attractive and proper. Nothing was overused or worn. We saw no mildew, stains, peeling paint, or any of the other things mentioned in other reviews. On the contrary, it was very top notch and our linens were exquisite. Food: Multiple uses of room service proved the fare to be wonderful. We will crave the home made potato chips with fontina cheese fondue the next time we need a snack. Service was always quick and professional, and if you need some inspiration, they will give you some wonderful ideas for entrees and snacks. Concierge: Unfortunately, for us, this was a sore spot and a disappointment from some earlier reviews. I don't want to focus a hotel review on one person so I'll spare the details, but the resulting misadventures could have been achieved sans the $20 tip. As we planned to continue using the concierge services, we let him know of our misfortunes. Unfortunately, he made no attempt to recover. Therefore, we just spent $9.95 a day for internet access and did everything else for ourselves. Maybe it was just a bad day or a new/different concierge, but be aware. Location: Others have covered it, and even the bad reviews concur, so I won't belabor the point...it is PERFECT. The Whitehall could not be in a better spot for dining, shopping, or sight-seeing. So it comes down to what you want: if you do not see the historical relevance and charm in a small wood-paneled elevator (yes, wood creaks) then the Whitehall may not be the place for you. But if you find quality more important than quantity and enjoy the personal touches that come from a very accommodating staff, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got your place.

It was an absolute delight mainly due to Darrin (the front desk agent that checked me in) and Monica (the wonderful concierge). I was staying at the Whitehall over Christmas on business that couldn't be avoided & was naturally depressed and irritable about not being with my family for the holidays. I'll admit, I didn't want to be there and actually wanted to hate it. This must have been obvious to Darrin as he was checking me in because he thoughtfully noticed that I would be there over the holiday and subtly acknowledged that it must not be easy to be away from family. He said that maybe a quiet room on a high floor with a view would make it a bit easier! From that point he had me laughing so hard about my situation that I was almost GLAD to be there! He said that I can at least brag about my room while I am on the phone with my husband, etc. Darrin was great and obviously has a intuitive sense about people to know what I needed--a kind face, a good laugh, and a great room. He directed me to Monica, who was the greatest concierge I have EVER been fortunate enough to have. She was so knowledgable and accomodating! She is an EXPERT on the Windy City and has the gentle demeanor of a reliable friend. I will say, despite Monica & Darrin, the entire hotel could use a facelift. The lobby is a bit dowdy and the heating unit was loud at times. I could notice, also, a huge difference between the front desk day shift and the front desk night shift. Darrin and the young woman working with him during the day were wonderful, the night shift seemed immature and downright unprofessional and unruly. The restaurant, Fornetto Mei, was alright I guess; but it seems to try too hard and fumble over itself in the process. The obnoxiously loud, bawdy breakfast manager of Fornetto Mei needs to tone it down. . .alot. It is too early for all her noise.
