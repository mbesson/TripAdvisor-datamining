The breakfast was hearty and well-stocked, lots of teas, hot oatmeal, waffles, eggs, sausage, cereal, pastries juices, coffees, etc. Shuttle to/from the airport was prompt (just remember to reserve it for the hourly departure when you want to return to the airport). 24 hour free business center to check email and print boarding passes and all that stuff was very helpful, too. Really, Liz, Lisa and her staff were just wonderful for our family wedding party! And, before, I forget, there are other hotels and a restaurant/bar within walking distance as well as the Sam's Club.

She even gave me a map of the shopping areas which were about 3 miles west of the hotel. We found a movie theatre, several large stores and lots of restaurants in that area. Our room was large and included a king bed, a desk and a chair with an ottoman. There was plenty of room for a couch, which would have been more useful. The free internet was great. Our bathroom was clean, but the fixtures looked a bit dated. On the plus side, the shower had a variable speed head which I was actually able to adjust -- most of the time when you try to adjust them you end up just about unscrewing the enitre shower head. Our bed was adequate-- too hard for my liking. The HVAC unit wasn't terribly efficient either -- it was either on or off. When it was on, it was entirely too hot. If we turned it down, it did not keep the room at a consistent temperature. The breakfast was OK. They offered more hot items than most motels, which was nice. They had eggs every day and alternated between ham and sausage. There were biscuits and gravy, but one morning they ran out of gravy, another morning they ran out of biscuits. When I asked the breakfast attendant about them he answered that \"someone had gone to get them\".

By the time you add in the $14 per day parking at the convention center, plus the hassle of driving back and forth, and the fact that Wingate is a completely inconsistent brand, I should have booked at the Hampton downtown. The property looks great from the outside, and the lobby is fine. Hallways all seem OK, but the rooms do seem just a bit dated. The only real problem I had with the room was that the housekeeping staff DOES NOT know how to clean a toilet! I don't know about you, but from time to time you actually have to clean the *outside* of the toilet too!! I brought this to the attention of the fro0nt desk the first morning after I had arrived. I told them I wanted to speak to the Manager, but was told she would be in later. I told them what the problem was, in a very firm way, although not rude. Of course the guy at the front desk did absolutely nothing, except look like a scalded dog. He never even passed along my complaint to the manager, who of course was not there when I got back that evening, or any other time I asked for her, which was at least twice a day while I was there. Old and outdated is one thing, but you can clean a room, no matter how old it is. Other than that, the only problem with the room was that, as others have mentioned, the walls/floors must be made of paper-mache(?). Oh, and what others said about this hotel having a lot of drunks/partiers there on the weekend is absolutely true from my experience. On the night of 2/9, it was obvious that the party in room 317, right next to mine, were histing a party. There was lots of loud talking, running up and down the hallways, and general BS. I finally called the front desk at about 1AM, as I had to get up early. To his credit, the older gentleman (don't remember his name), came up and confronted the party, telling them that according to fire code, they could only have a maximum of 5 people in the room, so he broke it up. All in all, if it wasn't for the cleaning issue, the party-people issue, and the inability to talk with management, I might have given this place a better review.

We stayed in room 128, which was a nice and large room that was relatively clean but dated. It had a king sized bed and we requested a roll-a-way bed for the additional $10.00. After arriving at the hotel after an exhausting day travel and work I was hoping to take a nap. Both the bed and the roll-away-bed were the worst mattresses I have ever experienced in my life. I ended up putting the roll-a-way mattress on the floor and tried to take a nap while springs were digging into my body from various parts of the bed. After about only 10 minutes in the room I heard what sounded like a stampede of wild animals running through hotel (and this is not the Animal Kingdom lodge in Disney)... I was like, that was strange and went back to trying to get my nap in. And it happened again and again and again... Turns out we were by the stairs and they are hollow along with the walls and the mattresses. The hotel was also full of drunks that night, and they were making a lot of noise in the hallways (not the fault of the hotel, but it tells you the clients they attract). To top it all off, little kids (8-10 years old) were running through the halls knocking on all the doors as they passed. When bringing up the noise problems with the staff the following morning, all they said is \"that's strange/unusual\" and she did say she was working all night trying to keep the drunks in their rooms, but that she would look into it. The staff offered no concessions, and I ended up only getting 5 hours of sleep (even though I had been up for 20+ hours straight and I even took a prescription sleeping pill and wore earplugs). The only thing that turned out well is the fact that I was up at 4AM and was able to move my flight up from noon to 7am to get the heck out of there. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. If you are looking for an affordable yet nice experience go to the Microhotel a few hundred feet away, you can get two rooms there for about the price of one here and it was built in 2007 so it still has that \"new hotel/motel\" feel. Also, if you are looking for something to eat in the area there is a bar in the parking lot (along with a SamsClub) but we walked through there and the food looked terrible, so we tried the authentic Mexican restaurant across the street, and although we were the only two while, English speaking people in the restaurant we were treated well, and I have to admit it was some of the best Mexican (authentic) food I have ever experienced (and at a very reasonable price).
