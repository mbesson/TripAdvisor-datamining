Not only the city and the people are unbelievable friendly but the hotel we picked was awesome. When we first arrived to the hotel they greeted us with delicious orange/cherry juice and Turkish delights. The check-in process was fast and efficient, but above all it was friendly. The concierge was ready with a package of information and maps for us. The room was very nice. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were kind of hard. The good thing is: pillow menu! so, if you want a soft, feather or 'tempurpedic\" pillow they have it for you. Next day we got upgraded (for a small extra fee) and our room had a \"Hammam\" style (Turkish bath) shower, our view was amazing and the room was very spacious and nicely decorated. All the rooms we stayed (because we came back after going to the Turkish coast) were clean, comfortable, perfect in temperature and nicely decorated. The Staff was great. They made a true difference in our stay at the Ottoman Hotel. There's 2 guys at the front desk that alternate days and shifts: Erhan Deger and Ozgur Gundogdu. They are both fantastic.They were always ready to help us with directions, suggestions and to teach us some helpful Turkish words. The hotel provides breakfast and I have to honestly say that their breakfast overall was delicious and had plenty of variety but their soups are the BEST I've ever had. I know it sounds strage: soup for breakfast? seriously... TRY it. There's a different kind every day and they are all amazing. You'll be hooked! The hotel is located right across from Hagia Sophia. Our next room (at the tail end of our trip) had a view of the church/mosque. There's nothing like going to bed and seeing the breathtaking building from there. It's an experience you can't compare. Seriously, if you go to Istanbul, don't even think about it: stay here. You will not be disappointed. We originally booked this hotel for the 1st part of our trip and intentionally did not book the 2nd half of our trip in Istanbul (after our return from the coast) to keep our options open. We ended up booking the whole trip at the Ottoman and we would definitely do it again.

The tram stop is about 400m away and the hop-on tour buses stop about 300 m away. However, don't be influenced by the photos of rooms on the website if you've booked a standard room. Our first room, for one night, was barely able to hold the double bed and the bathroom was tiny. There was no view as it was at the bottom of an enclosed light well, barely 10 ft to the opposite wall and three floors down from reception - NO lift to help with luggage or if you have walking limitations. People with mobility problems should also note that the street up to the hotel is roughly cobbled throughout and would be difficult to negotiate in any sort of high heels. We were moved to a better room for the three remaining nights, but this was also quite small. It did have a view of the neighbouring buildings though. Our main disappointment again was the bathroom, which was the size of a normal British en-suite shower room. It was generally clean, but the shower cubicle was badly in need of a good scrubbing to remove the black mildew on the grouting. I will add photos to show this. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is satisfactory, although we have had better.

The location is central to most of the major sites and is in between 2 tram stops so very easy to get anywhere else. Tip: we bought an akbil pass which you can recharge easily use on all methods of public transport including the ferries and funicular railways. Much easier than having pockets full of tokens, 6TL for the card then you recharge as needed but we had just one card for the both of us which is accepted and each trip is cheaper than the normal fare. The hotel is fabulous, the staff, from Mary the guest relations manager who greeted, us to Hakan our chamberman could not of done more to make our stay so perfect. Breakfast was excellent with a large choice of hot and cold dishes I particularly liked the fresh honeycomb. The staff in the breakfast room were helpful friendly and were happy to cook fried eggs to order if asked. We were lucky enough to be upgraded and had an incredible view of Hagia Sopia from our bedroom window. Also lovely little touches in the room like turkish delight when we arrived, the following day we returned in the evening to find a vase of flowers in our room and then on international woman's day a card with another flower, we felt very special throughout our entire stay.

So much so that when we e-mailed the hotel to say that the airport in the city where we were arriving from was closed due to snow, they were kind enough to move our reservation back a day. They did this three times (once for each day that the airport was closed) and were gracious about it each time. It was frustrating to be stuck where we were but it was so comforting to know that once we got to Istanbul we'd have a place to stay.

The bath was small, old, bad fixtures. The bed and pillow really uncomfortable. I never thought to ask for a better room until it was too late. But I wonder, if better rooms were available, why didn't the staff automatically put us in one? The breakfast room was extremely warm, although the buffet was fine. I assume this had a four star rating only because of the location. The hotel seems more suitable for travelers who don't expect much from an accomodation; unfortunately we passed that point about twenty years ago. Lesson learned - I advise those of you who are planning to stay to contact the hotel ahead of time, ask what room is planned and upon checking in, ask to see the room first.

That was a bad idea, because now she thinks ALL the hotels I stay at are like this mini-palace, and nothing could be further from the truth. That being said, when I die and if I go to heaven, I hope it is as nice as this hotel. The logistics are a bit tricky. The hotel is located in a zillion-year old building next to the overwhelmingly huge Haya Sofia mosque and museum, which is a treat. You're right in the heart of ancient Constantinople, and history abounds. But the city has just turned the whole area into a pedestrian zone, so it's hard to find a taxi that knows the secret back roads that can get you to the front door of the hotel. It can be done, but we only had one taxi out of six or seven who managed the trick. Ask for the hotel car to pick you up; it's simply easier. The lobby is small and intimate, and although this is Ottoman heritage it almost had the feeling of an small English manor house. We were given Room 202, directly over the lobby, with a balcony and lovely views. The rooms are small and the air conditioning somewhat feeble, but the bed and bathrooms were a treat. In addition, the room had a huge balcony where we sat at night and listened to the laughter from the patio restaurant, below. It was charming. The real kick was the bathroom. It was very large and spendlidly equipped, with a shower bigger than some hotel rooms. Elegant appointments, handsome stone work, lovely amenities -- my wife was loving it. The food in the restaurant was great, although certainly not cheap. The breakfast buffet is more than enough. There was live music and dinner and on the one night we were there a dervish came and danced (whirled?) as an example of this unusual religous culture. The only problems: no luggage rack, and no 120v electrical power. Minor issues, really.

Aya Sofia's minarets were the view from our room at the Ottoman Imperial. On a hot summer day in Istanbul, it's a great luxury to have an air-conditioned hotel room just a short walk away - and that's the best part of this hotel. We were surprised by the size of the crowds and the length of the lines at the sights...when 3 huge cruise ships are in port (as they were when we visited), the tourist area of Istanbul is just overwhelmed by mobs of tour groups from the ships. The Ottoman Imperial gave us the ability to see the sights early and retreat from the crowds and the heat. The location of the hotel is simply wonderful. It's also easy to see why the reviews of the hotel are so mixed. We had booked a standard room, and were shown to a room at the back of the hotel that was so small there was no space for our suitcases. The window faced a busy street that was sure to be noisy at night. We asked for another room, and were shown another tiny room on the ground floor with a window facing a tiny interior space -quieter, but still no space for suitcases. The hotel then upgraded us to a larger superior room at the front of the hotel at no extra charge. Many thanks to the Ottoman Imperial for this - we enjoyed looking out at the quiet front street and Aya Sofia. I recognized the rooms we were shown from complaints in Trip Advisor. If you want a comfortable room with a a view, be prepared to pay for a superior room. The restaurant was located on a beautiful outside patio, and the food was good - but it was very expensive, and a bit formal for our taste. We found a wonderful little outdoor restaurant - Konuk Evi- around the corner at the end of Caferiye Sokak. A great place for a simple lunch in a beautiful garden. Inexpensive, and they'll even make a hamburger and fries on request! The breakfast room at the Ottoman is at the top of the hotel; sunny with nice views and open windows.

This is my main criticism of the hotel, as these rooms are really, really small, and the dark furniture adds a claustrophobic feel. The hotel also has light saving sensors on the corridor , so it does feel a bit eerie on this annex as you don't get to see the end of corridor when it's dark or when other people are not around. I was moved the day after to a room overlooking the mosque: still small, but much lighter. Thus, you should pay the extra to stay in one of the Vizir rooms or smaller rooms in the main building. Other than that the hotel staff is really helpful and accommodating, the rooms and bathrooms are quite clean, and the AC works perfectly. Breakfast is plentiful, and guests should at least once have a meal at the Ottoman restaurant onsite. They are one of the few places cooking traditional Ottoman cuisine, and the food is really delicious.

In the old part of Istanbul, Sultanahmet, the hotel was close to many of the main sites of the city - the Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sofia were right next door, the Blue Mosque a short walk away. The hotel was also close to many cafes and restaurants and within walking distance of the quayside for boat trips along the Bosphorus, and to the Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar. We normally look at 5* hotels but came down a star for the location. Very glad we did as this hotel's location was perfect and a little less expensive than 5* although without the routine spa, swimming pool etc which didn't matter on this occasion. We had a Premier Sultan room which looked out on to the Hagia Sofia. The room was not huge but perfectly adequate as we didn't really spend much time in it being out in Istanbul most of the time. Furniture was dark wood in Turkish style. There was adequate wardrobe space, a safe, a television, tea and coffee making facilities, a console table, plus a table and chair, and of course the double bed. The bathroom was big with modern amenities and a bath that had a jacuzzi fitment and also a shower.There were complimentary toiletries, hairdryer, and towels were plentiful. Altogether very nice and everything was very clean. The hotel itself is a former hospital and school converted in the 20th century so its layout and architecture is much more individual than some hotels. The dining room where we had breakfast looked over the rooftops of Istanbul. Breakfast was a modest affair. I'd give it 7/10, not perfect, but an adequate selection of basic hot dishes (sausages, eggs), cheese and cold meat, good selection of pastries, with tea, coffee and what was supposed to be fresh orange juice, but didn't taste like it. Was OK anyhow! We were not at the hotel for dinner. Most staff were friendly, one or two were a little offhand but this could have simply been because English wasn't their first language. Most staff spoke English quite well. There is a minibus you can request to pick you up from the airport which is a free service if you book three nights or more (we were there for four nights). The hotel also has its own car service for your return to the airport as well but you have to pay for this - a very reasonable E25 I think. They were very slow delivering our bags to the room on arrival.

But I assume that the closeness of the location to a mosque doesn't really matter since the chant is on loud speaker. Besides, it's better to wake up to than an alarm. Service - Impeccable, outstanding. The receptionists are ready and willing to help and assist in any way shape and form. Room - Although the room is beautifully decorated, it was very small. The queen size bed in my room took up 80% of the room. I'm not joking. And the shower! First, I had to take a huge step up and into the shower. And then after the shower, I had to get out of the shower room because there was no room for me to stretch my arms to towel dry myself. Fortunately, I don't need that much room. Not to worry. Not all rooms are small. My friend had a room double the size of mine. The breakfast buffet was great and the dining room has a beautiful view. I would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIdeal location, wonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "cesarblues", "ReviewID": "UR114978317", "Content": "We were very pleased we chose Ottoman Hotel Imperial for our visit to Istanbul.

The bedrooms and bathrooms were typical of Europe--attractive and clean, comfortable beds with nice linens, but the rooms are small with limited closet and drawer space. A/C and plumbing worked well. Internet was free but signal was very weak, and we had to connect in other ways. There is no exercise room, spa or pool. There was only one key per room, and it was required to turn on the electricity in the room. So, charging our laptops, phones, camera batteries. etc. when we were away, meant leaving the room key inserted in the electrical switch and then asking a staff member to let us in with the master key upon our return.

The staff were all very attentive, and welcoming. (In particular the kindness of Merih Demir went well beyond the call of any professional obligation. She helped make the holiday very special.) Our room was remarkably quiet given the central location of the hotel - just opposite the Haghia Sophia, and close to the tram line. Once we had worked out the heating and air conditioning, we slept comfortably. And we ate some terrific food in the hotel's restaurant. The Turkish elements of the breakfast were perfectly satisfactory (ignore the standard Euro-hotel fare on the hotplates), but the meals in the evening were really exceptionally good. The recreations of classic Ottoman cuisine managed to press all our diverse buttons (omnivore gourmand; vegetarian; 7 year old). Delicious - and the waiters were extremely kind to our son, bringing him little treats to keep him happy. It wasn't just him the staff kept happy. I had a birthday while there - and the staff treated me to a very good cake with candles etc. A nice touch. Our bathroom was spotless. The bath lacked a plug, but the shower was so efficient we were happy just with that. Our bed was huge, and our son was comfortable in an extra bed in the room. Bedlinen and towels were very clean and fresh at all times. An ideal room would have had a view, but that might well have meant noisier nights. If having a view matters to you, it is probably worth talking to the hotel about the outlook from your room before you travel. In any event, the view from the dining room is very attractive, especially as night falls. And after all, the heart of historic Istanbul is literally on your doorstep as you leave the hotel. In summer we might have been wary of having a room too close to the outdoor dining area; a large party enjoying itself over dinner might have made an early night difficult. But there are other room options, so it is worth asking about exactly where you will be before you arrive. if we had one very mild criticism it would probably be about the repetitiveness of the music played in the dining areas inside and out.

As everyone says - perfect location for all the main sights. Our 'free transfer' was waiting for us at the airport even after a long wait at visa and passport control. Our 'standard' room was small and lacked storage space, but we were comfortable enough and it had a great shower (more powerful than our power shower at home). Staff were friendly and helpful and seemed to enjoy my efforts at saying a few words in Turkish. Breakfasts were very pleasant up in the rooftop restaurant. Lots of choice including some more unusual breakfast options some days such as onion rings, chips and soup (the soups were lovely though - couldn't resist a bowl now and then!). Didn't dine at the hotel in the evenings as we prefer to go out - plenty of restaurants around - we dined in Amedros, Faros, Mosaik and the Passazade Ottoman (the latter being the most reasonable and yet currently No. 1 on Tripadvisor), and had lunch in Pasha Cafe & Pub, Cozy Pub, the Han Restaurant and Hamdi down at Erminou (before boarding the Bospherous Ferry). Most of these were Tripadvisor Restaurant recommendations and they were all great even though not particularly cheap if you want to order a bottle of wine with your meal. On average - a bottle of house wine (Angora) in a restaurant was about 45 Turkish liras (about \u00c2\u00a320) so it certainly pushed up the bill especially if you wanted a better quality wine - some of those went up to 97 liras!!! We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night city break at the Ottoman as there is so much to see and do all within walking distance, but by the end of it we had tired of politely saying 'No thankyou' to all the endless carpet sellers, fake guides and restaurant touts. Maybe it is worse in this area of Sultanahmet as it is so popular with the tourists, but I wish they'd realise it is probably counterproductive as it seems to encourage most tourists to 'walk on by'. It was particularly bad in the Grand Bazaar where browsing is virtually impossible before they are badgering you to buy. Consequently, I bought nothing in there on two separate visits and that's a shame. Finally, we flew with Turkish Airlines and they were excellent - flights bang on time and even a choice on the main course of the meal, but a second extra security check literally just before boarding meant all drinks/water were confiscated that had been bought in the departure lounge unless they were in a sealed duty free bag.

Be warned, ladies, that the street outside and in the surrounding area are cobbled - heeled shoes will not cut the mustard! The staff at the hotel are lovely - really really friendly and incredibly helpful. One strong point of advice is to trade up in room terms if you can, because the base level rooms are situated on the main corridor from the reception to the lift, or on the street side, and must be very loud! We paid the extra for a deluxe room which was really comfortable, overlooking the restaurant patio, with the most amazing bed I've ever slept in in my life! Soooo comfortable! However, they're a bit let down by the bathrooms - getting in and out of the shower (over the bath) was a bit like an Olympic event and despite being healthy and fit (and 6ft tall each) both of us ended up with huge bruises from slipping when getting in or out! Also, if you're a light sleeper, take ear plugs as the noise in the corridors was unbearable on occasion (I think this may have been a combination of an incredibly noisy French family being split through three rooms on our floor and the marble floors, but it's worth saying). The buffet breakfast was amazing - fresh and filled with all sorts of local delicacies (make sure you try the sesame paste with jam on croissants - sensational!) and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Every morning an army of staff appeared to clean and polish everything, and it was all spotless!

It was walking distance to everything. You do have to walk alot in Istanbul but this hotel is up a steep street, so definitely take that into consideration when booking if thats a problem. I would not recommend the single room. I barely had room to open my suitcase and switched to a double after the first night. Double room was still small but decorated nicely. You could hear praying 5 times a day but I found it peaceful, although the room was noisy (stayed in the back part of the hotel behind the restaurant). The service was fabulous. Front desk and staff were so helpful, knowledgeable and hospitable. They helped with suggestions, my room change and even fixing my broken suitcase. I was very impressed. Breakfast was a reasonable selection, varied slightly day to day. The only other caution I might mention, is that its hard to get in and out of the tub/shower, you have to use a stepstool. Definitely take this into consideration if thats a problem. I also have a horrible experience with the shuttle service I booked through the hotel to the airport. They dropped me off at international not domestic, when I was going locally in Turkey and had given them this information twice. It was a long uphill walk with 3 suitcases and I was not happy! Internet in the room was spotty, although free, but the outdoor deck had internet connection and was a great place to relax with a pretty view. But I do want to end the review on a positive note because I just thought this hotel was was a pleasure! Great location and amazing hospitality!!

Our travel agent had arranged for someone from the hotel to pick us up at the airport for a reasonable charge. We were with friends for a couple of days before joining a group and we wanted to visit the city at our leisure. When we checked in we were told we had been upgraded to the old building. The rooms are small but full of character. Breakfast, which was included, offered a wide variety of Turkish and western style breakfast items. Both evenings we decided to stay and eat in the hotel restaurant. The weather was perfect and we enjoyed cocktails and then dinner outside. The music and the Whirling Dervish were a nice addition. We can't say enough about the staff. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. We were pleased to meet Rita R., the concierge. She provided us with all the maps and information we needed. Erhan Deger, the bellman, was outstanding. On our last day there we had requested a cab at noon to move to the hotel where our group was meeting. It was raining and that made the crazy Istanbul traffic even worse. Yasar Celen, the manager, came to tell us that the cab driver had called and was stuck in a traffic jam. He offered to drive us to the other hotel himself. We were not in a hurry, so we declined his offer. While we waited, Erhan brought us Turkish coffee, then glasses of water. Twenty minutes later the cab had still not arrived, and Mr Celen reappeared, saying \"Come. I'll drive you.\" I'm sure the round trip took him more than an hour because of the traffic. I had read that the hotel was close to Aya Sofya and other important places, but I hadn't realized how close. Aya Sofya is across the street from the hotel! Because of its proximity to several major sights, we were able to enjoy them any time we wanted. We visited the Basilica Cistern at 10 p.m. There were only a handful of visitors and the guards. Quite a difference from our first visit two years ago, when we went in the middle of the day. You could hardly move, it was so crowded. We hope to return to Istanbul in the not-to-distant future and when we do, we will definitely stay at the Ottoman Hotel Imperial.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAllaround I would rate this hotel 10 out of 10\u201d", "Author": "christinwtravel", "ReviewID": "UR83096409", "Content": "Very beautiful hotel , my partner and I stayed for 3 nights and everyone in our party were very happy with all aspects of the hotel.

I've seen various reviews, some positive and some negative, depending on your room location. At the time we booked, we went directly to their site. There was only one option, basically booking the number of rooms you want, coordinated by an online booking site. With further investigation I realized we had a standard room (I believe all standards located in a 2nd building). I emailed the hotel directly and asked to be upgraded to the main building to a Premium Sultan or Premium Vezir room. They accommodated us and even located us on the courtyard side. The view was magnificent. This hotel was so centrally located and an easy walk to everything. The staff was amazing and the rooms clean and very Sultan. Our rooms each had a queen and a tiny room with a twin. If booked, check out a very charming Sheraton just around the corner. Small and Sultan in its decor. The Ottoman would still be my first choice. The breakfast buffet (included) was delicious and an evening cocktail on the patio, enjoying a live Kanum (zither) performance is so peaceful with views over the city. The restaurant right next to the Ottoman (Green Corner) is so great for lunch. Dinner also, I'm sure. Rather than ordering a la carte they suggested two gigantic platters, one a salad and one meats which was delicious and perfect for us and our two college students. Some reviews comment on the Call To Prayer at 5 am. Just turn your air conditioner on or enjoy this cultural and respected highlight of Turkey. The Hagia Sophia (2 min from hotel) alone is worth a trip to Istanbul. It's one of the most magnificent architectural feats in the world. Loved the Grand Bazaar, but if you can't tell real gold, silver or gemstones, stick to the textiles and Halloween costumes! We were ripped off on all !! And do negotiate. The Spice Bazaar was even better. Plan on hours there. Prices are listed, no negotiations. Skip the touristy dinner cruises. Food and entertainment very so so. A better option is the daytime ferry cruises where you stop for lunch along the way. Absolutely not to be missed are live and very authentic performances at the Hodjapasha Cultural Center. It was a 20 min walk from the hotel. Not easy to locate as in an alley just off main street. We attended a Whirling Dirvish performance and felt it was a real highlight of our trip. I wish we had another night to go back for a different performance called \"Turkish Dance Night\" on Tues and Thurs. Well worth it to plan on both. 70 min performance and fun restaurants to choose from on way back to hotel. We loved our visit to Istanbul and need to go back there and also explore outer areas.

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable, going so far as to get a cake for my wife's 30th birthday. The restaurant (which is also the breakfast lounge every morning) is really nice and they put a good, diverse spread out each morning. It was January, and snowing/raining most of our visit, but it is clear this dining room has a great view. The hotel room was a good size for our needs, but located at the back of the building and consequently had no view. Definitely try to get a room with a view if you can. The bed is very comfortable and the hotel offers several different kinds of pillows for those in need of a specific type. Everything was clean and tidy and the daily housekeeping was impeccable. The complimentary wireless internet access is a definite plus. A Few Issues: - The doors and windows (to the outside) in the room did not seal properly and allowed the cigarette smoke from neighboring guests smoking outside to filter into the room periodically. - The wing our room was located in (three floors of a few rooms each floor) had a pretty consistent smell of cooking food for the duration of our stay, not particularly unpleasant, but definitely strong and noticeable. - The bathroom tub/shower leaked out onto the tile floor from somewhere underneath the unit for the duration of our stay and as a result of this clearly chronic condition there was mold in the grout in some places. Also in general the bathroom workmanship was shoddy with very messy silicone sealing and so on. - Thin walls and false, shared ceiling spaces mean that you can hear your neighbors talking. The location and service really make this place great, but be aware of the limitations of some rooms.", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch Location\u201d", "Author": "agamy1", "ReviewID": "UR55633142", "Content": "This hotel has a great location, close to all the attractions in the Sultanahamet area.

However, my biggest gripe is I found the front office staff consistently \"unfriendly\" and unhelpful, which is unfortunate given that Istanbul is not easy to move around.

So, it might give you an idea of how amazing it is... If you haven't been to Istanbul before, I can highly recommend you this hotel, nothing is going to happen if you pick another one, but I can tell you for sure that your experience if you stay here is going to be the greatest in your life, it would change your ideas of how a host can be... You just have to live it and then you know what I am talking about. If you make your reservations through their web page and stay more than three nights (you have to check if they still have this available at the moment you do it), they will include one way from the airport to the hotel (or from the hotel to the airport), their site on internet is very friendly and have several options to offer, it's up to you. From the moment to get to the hotel you will feel the warm welcome that they'll give you, you have to know that the Turkish hosts are the best of the world, their culture is reflected in that warm smile and the care they take of you in order to make you feel even better than home... You will enjoy their comfortable rooms (try the Turkish Delight they will leave it near the bed, absolutely fantastic), take a warm bath in the lovely bathroom, they will have all you need to feel in your own relaxing place... Every morning if you listen carefully, you can't miss the wonderful sound that comes from the mosques... For us it was the best way for waking up and feel the energy and the peace that can be heard all over the city several times during the day... I haven't experienced anything similar in any other country I have ever visited... The breakfast is more than you can ask for... anything you feel like trying is going to be absolutely delicious, if you want a sweet breakfast, try the cake, the sweets, if you like eggs, make a choice, they are all great and tasty, if you love bread, this is the perfect time to eat them all... (by the way, try the simit, it's great), if you rather something light, try the yogurt or the fruits... do you like orange juice, the tea or the coffee?? It doesn't matter which one you choose, it's going to be the best tea, the best coffee or the best orange juice you have ever had... besides a great view to enjoy and the great and warm staff that always keep coming with more great food... believe me, it's going to be hard to make a choice everyday... but, you must try a bit of everything, it is worth it! At night don't miss the performance of the traditional Sufi dance (it isn't actually a dance, it's more some kind of prayer), and try the food from the restaurant, try the lamb, the natural juices and the deserts (don't forget to try the backlava). Since you get to the hotel, the fabulous staff will guide you and explain to you all that you need to know to have the best experience in the city... they are able to make all the reservations you need in order to take advantage of your time in the city... Do not hesitate to contact them or ask them for information, they will always have a warm smile and all their best intention to help you, believe me, even if you have a list of all the places you don't want to miss in your visit, talk to them, you might be surprised to know that the day you planned to go there, the place is closed, so, they might suggest another activity and I can assure you that they can give you great details about their own city, such as taking the Bosforo trip in boat until Anadolu Kavagi... Wow!! This was the best... We really enjoyed it so much... If you are wondering about the location of the hotel, I will give you the following example: We went to Hagia Sophia (it's next to the hotel literally, yes, look at it in google maps if you don't believe in the \"literally\" I mean), after we bought the tickets and we were inside of it, we realized that we didn't take the battery of camera (don't worry after all we could take pics with the video camera), so, when we left the museum before going to the Blue Mosque, we went to the hotel and in less than five minutes we were taking pictures again with our camera... it was great! We were really glad that the hotel was so near... What else is near?: The islam and turkish art museum, the Blue Mosque, Yerebatan Sarnici, Topkapi Museum, G\u00c3\u00bclhane park, Binbirdirek Sarnici, Mosaic Museum, Archeological Museum, and a lot more... even if you want to go farther you can take the tram, it's very very close to the hotel, about three minutes walking... I think there's only one way to understand this all and that's only living it... I am sure that you will want to come back as I did... as I do... Maybe we can meet there next year... Have a great time in the best city of the world...

It was like a sauna as the air con only pumped out hot air, but with windows open we only got about 3 hours sleep a night as was so noisy due to the trams.

Being a Turkish style half bath/shower it is too high to get in without having a step, so they provide you with a cheap, broken plastic one. We took it to reception & asked for a new one & after 3 hours we still hadn't received a new one. Called them and they brought us another broken one! We said it was no good & they then walked into each room in our area (3 were occupied by guests but no-one was in... Nice breach of privacy there!) and took their foot stools to try and find one which wasn't broken. On the third attempt they found an unbroken one for us but as soon as we put one foot on it, it broke. We gave up & dragged the chair into the bathroom to use, but with space so small we couldn't get to the toilet. Nightmare!

We finally decided to be in the thick of things and chose the Ottoman Imperial in Sultanahmet. The location is unbeatable; the Byzantine cisterns and Aya Sofia a few metres away. The Blue Mosque is across the gardens opposite, and Topkapi Palace round the back of the hotel, no more than a 5-minute walk. Amazing. You can get to these famous sights before the huge coaches arrive ( just) and go back later to watch the sun set, when the multitudes have melted away. The hotel is compact, the staff friendly and helpful, and everything spotless.. Breakfasts are good and served in a very pleasant raised room with large windows that let in the morning light and a view of the surrounding buildings ( NOT the Aya Sofia as seems the case on the website).There is a pretty terrace too for a drink, but the food for dinner is average and overpriced for what it is ( eg we were given stale bread ). We had a premium room in the main building ( standard rooms are in the annex across the terrace, and can be vulnerable to street noise, like the tram, or one we saw faced a solid wall !). Our room was not big, though the bed was large and comfortable. However, the bathroom was miniscule. My husband is 6 ft tall, and I wasnt sure how he would be able to have a shower without risking if not life certainly limb. You have to climb into the shower and then be an acrobat to get out again without the aid of a safety grip. I certainly found every morning a challenge and we stayed 6 nights so this was not ideal. Other guests also mentioned the size of their bathrooms in negative terms. The other annoyance, basically because of poor design, is that even in the permium rooms our bedhead was on the same wall as the bedhead of the next room. We were woken up, sometimes in the middle of the night, by guests talking,sometimes loudly, but not unreasonably, in their own bed ! But the location of the hotel is perfect. The tram is nearby, allowing guests to travel down to the Bosphorus ferries or up towards the university and the Suleimaniya Mosque ( have lunch at the Ali Baba cafe, but see the menu first for prices !) Take a commuter ferry from Serkeci to the Asian shore ( a mere 3 TL return, set fare,) to eat in Uskadur, or Karadoy where the locals eat. Walk to the Galata Bidge (20 minutes). Eat a fish sandwich near the bridge and enjoy this vibrant, bustling city. Or just stroll around Sultanahmet. It's all very accessible from the Ottoman Imperial, and the staff will give you all the information you need. We took the stress out of arrival by ordering a hotel car to meet us at Attaturk airport . It's a 25-minute drive, and costs 50 TL.

The hotel's location couldn't be better - it's right next to the Aya Sofya in the middle of the tourist area of Sultan Ahmet. The Blue Mosque is just 5 mins away and the Grand Bazaar is a ten minute walk. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms are well appointed with a lovely welcome of Turkish Delight, robes and slippers. One warning - be sure to ask NOT to be put in room 101 as it's right by the reception area. We spent our first night in that room and were kept awake all night by the noise from people coming and going. The next day we asked to be moved and spent the second night in a lovely, bigger room on the third floor. No compensation was offered but we were given the upgraded room for free. The rooms were on the small side - we had to pay extra for our good-sized rooms. I think this would be a problem throughout the city though as it's a very busy place. Other reviews have mentioned the noise. I think it's unrealistic to expect a good night's sleep in Istanbul without ear plugs and even then it's a very noisy city. The morning call to prayer is around 5am and sounds across the whole city, plus there are dogs barking and other noises all night. However, none of these are the hotel's fault and would be a problem all over the city. It probably didn't help that we were there during Eid so the city was in full celebratory swing. The breakfast was lovely and the whole hotel is friendly, warm and beautifully decorated.

There is a certain apprehension that goes with going somewhere new, having no idea of what to expect and wanting to experience a culture but enjoying the comforts of \"home\". From the car service at the airport to every smile that greeted me everywhere I went I can honestly say the hotel and staff have managed to exceed lofty expectations and add value to everything we wanted to do and did. (example: We were celebrating a birthday, and as a surprise on the big day, they brought a beautiful (locally made) cake and bottle of wine to the lucky persons room) (and if you are wondering, yes! it was delicious) We came with no real itinerary, but the staff took the time to explain all the options and even developed a personal touring programme. And the private guide they were able to get for us was FANTASTIC. We did a group tour one day, but unfortunately there were some barriers in the language. Our private guide (Taner) had no such problems, he provided fantastic insights, took us to the best Kebap in town, and gave us all a new appreciation for the country, its history and traditions. The girls of the front desk, what can I say. They are charming, very attractive, friendly and love to have a good laugh. I doubt you will find a more helpful staff in Constantinople. We did not have dinner in the hotel, but with a little local insight we did taste some of the finest food in all the city. I can highly recommend Poseidon (restaurant serves the freshest fish, sits ON the water with fantastic views and the food is phenomenal) Also worth a trip is Sunset!!!! The cab driver couldn't find it, (went to several shops to ask help) but we got there, no problem :) Once at the restaurant, East definitely meets West. Heated lamps, everyone sitting outside, great service, delicious food and the most scintillating views. An exquisite menu and wine list to choose from and I think it is fair to say that at neither of these restaurants did I see any tourists. This was where the locals came to eat! Reservations and taxi's were all arranged by the hotel (and I am not sure how easy they were to get) The hotel rooms were clean, it was great having air conditioning and nice to see linens being cleaned daily for a change again. The location is second to none, from the cobbled streets to Aya Sophia everything is a stones throw away, most of it even closer than you think. I would recommend all those visiting this beautiful city to stay in the old town if going for pleasure and sightseeing. After a long day it really is lovely to sit on the hotel terrace with a good stiff drink!

Most of the other locations can be easily and very quickly reached by tram, which can be taken from the nearby station (by the way, try to avoid taxi drivers in Istanbul; they are typically incompetent - not aware of any destination except for the \"big ones\", stop the car in order to get directions form other locals, and almost inevitably try to trick you). The hotel in itself is nice, but nothing extraordinary. We stayed there for several nights. Our room was small, with a view to some backside houses. Every morning the cleaning personnel talked very loudly and inevitably woke us up with their chat. It goes without saying that the walls are quite thin and noises fly freely. We were lucky that it was in spring and there were not \"tones\" of tourists. However, in the first night I heard a neighbor snoring. The personnel is very friendly, but not in all respects. For example, not flexible in respect of late breakfast. For example, if you fancy a longer sleep in the morning, you will need to buy your breakfast else where. In addition, pay attention to the Turkish friendship. To all trips or programs they arrange from the hotel, they add substantial commissions, without making you aware of. For example, we went one evening to a Derwiches dance (Mevlevi ceremony). The hotel kindly offered to book us the tickets. When we arrived at the place, we surprisingly saw tickets being officially sold at a cheaper price. This is also valid for trip boats. You can buy them directly in the harbor at cheaper prices. You can take all the brochures and advice from the hotel, but it would be safer for your pocket to go for them directly and not via hotel. In respect of restaurants, the hotel will also make some recommendations. If you are prepared to pay the Paris or London prices for something nice, but average, go for it. Don't expect to find any local as customers, as the recommended places are \"dedicated\" to tourists. Alternatively, if you really want something really nice and with Turkish prices, go to places like Daruzziyafe Restaurant (located in the old annexes of the Suleymanyie mosque) or Hamdi Restaurant (with wonderful view on the harbor and bridge).

First thing is the amazing location - across the street from the historical architectural masterpiece the Hagia Sophia. The views are breathtaking especially on the higher floors. All of the famous historical sites of Sultanhamet are within short walking distance. Also the excellent tram service into town passes the hotel this was useful when I was attending meetings during my business trip as often the tram was quicker than the taxi due to traffic. The rooms are decorated in a traditional Ottoman style offering great light and comfort. I enjoyed the relaxation and comfort of the rooms on both my visits when alone for business and with my partner on holiday. The traditional Turkish buffet breakfast is a great start to the day and the views from the glass constructed restaurant over look the real old Sultanhamet. As in the rooms the light in the restaurant is fantastic even in December.The staff are extremely friendly and informative and the service is personal. They all remembered me from my first trip and made me feel welcome. I have fallen in love with the city after many trips and have stayed in a few quality hotels in Istanbul prior to my last two visits as well as staying in hotels all over the world in the course of my business trips.

The short form of this review: this is a fine, small hotel that is very clean, reliable and a great value. If you don't like smaller rooms, reserve one of the bigger rooms. You won't be disappointed, and I liked it well enough that I'm planning my third visit in a year to Istanbul and hope to stay in this hotel again. In what follows I'll comment on what some of the other reviews have discussed. After a great experience at the hotel on a business trip in January when my son and visited Istanbul in August I knew I wanted us to stay at the Ottoman. We had a tough itinerary planned with a late night arrival and an early morning departure, so I needed reliable airport pickup. I also wanted us close to the main historical sites - can't get any closer than this hotel, which is right across a narrow street from the Aja Sophia church/mosque/museum. I booked my room directly with the hotel and exchanged email with them about the airport pickup. I planned the trip two months in advance but the hotel did not lose any info about the pickup and was right on top of it. We stayed for three days. As before, the service was flawless, from airport pickup to welcome at the hotel to a ride back to the airport. I had reserved a larger room with a view of the Aja Sophia. See my other review for photos, which could have been of this same room and the same view. In the winter the hotel served breakfast in a somewhat unappealing lower level room. In the summer it is served on a delightful terrace. Some other reviewers commented that there are stairs involved, as indeed there are. The seating area for dining is on the outdoor terrace while the actual buffet is located in a glass-enclosed room that is a flight of steps up from the terrace. Both have very appealing old Istanbul, leafy urban views. There are large umbrellas or canopies covering part of the terrace and breakfast continued to be served there during light rain, with staff members holding umbrellas over guests in the open spot between terrace and the steps up to the buffet. This sounds not-so-pleasant but in fact it was somehow a very charming experience, a somewhat unexpected combination of endearing hospitality and an authentic sense of place, not overly manufactured to the point that rain is denied any part of life. Breakfast itself has been criticized in some of the reviews, and I suppose that depends upon what one expects. This is not a five star hotel with multiple omlette chefs and endless array of breakfast foods. The buffet has a good variety of foods but they tend to simpler Turkish fare, with slices of different sorts of local cold cut meats, odd garnishes like crushed black olive paste, Turkish breads and bagels, sliced cucumbers and olives, local cheeses and some hot choices of the runny scrambled eggs sort. Think of it as a local alternative midway between the absolutely unappealing European continental \"breakfast\" and the more elaborate display at some of the deliberately international, big-breakfast buffets. I'm a big breakfast eater and liked it just fine, especially since it had a local style to it. One other reviewer criticized the hotel staff for recommending a restaurant not to his liking. I think that's harsh and a bit unfair as there are many restaurants within a short walk with a wide range of prices. I'd give the restaurant at the hotel a try for convenience, and if you want something else read the many reviews here in tripadvisor. I don't mean to discredit the staff at the hotel but I would not expect them to be as good at recommending restaurants as the collective intelligence of many travellers on this website. We ended up eating on the rooftop terrace of a restaurant called the Seven Hills, a truly outstanding view with (astonishingly for a place with a great view...) outstanding food. As they say, bring your camera. Bottom line: great small hotel with personal, warm, welcoming staff. It has a perfect location for tourism, in the middle of where you want to be while still being quiet and restful. It is clean, reliable and an outstanding value for your money.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cWill return back soon\u201d", "Author": "gibsonsally10", "ReviewID": "UR22160345", "Content": "Wow, will make this review short and sweet.

We were pleasantly surprised to find it so well located-right next to the Hagia Sofia. The hotel is spotless. There was always someone cleaning . The hotel has a lovely rooftop terrace with wall fountains and a spectacular view. To add to the magic, there is a musician who plays the zither in the evenings. We were told that there was a whirling Dervish performance every evening at 7:30 but we were never there at that time. The staff was very helpful. We complained that our room might be noisy as it faced the street with the tram. They immediately volunteered to change our room the following night as the hotel was full. (The noise was not a problem once the windows were closed and the air conditioning was turned on. ) They upgraded us, at no additional cost, to a larger corner room with windows on all four sides. The room overlooked the tiny street that separates the hotel from the Hagia Sofia. The room was lovely, spacious and very clean. It was nicely decorated with Turkish ceramic plates. Breakfasts were served in the rooftop restaurant and these were very plentiful. The turkish cheeses and fresh vegetables( tomatoes and cucumbers) were delicious, as were the unusual sweet tahini spreads and rose jams. There were also scrambled eggs, Turkish sausages, cereals-corn flakes, cocoa puffs and fruit loops, Turkish breads and whole wheat buns. Coffee was good. Lots of fresh fruit-apples, plums and grapes, as well. They also serve dinner as well ,until 10:30pm. We tried it one night when we were too tired to look elsewhere at 10pm. The meal was excellent value. Salads were fresh and could easily make a meal. The eggplant appetizer was unctious. The lamb which came on a sizzling plate was aromatic and very tasty. The price was extremely reasonable for the quality and portions which could easily feed two people.( prices at the Grand Bazaar were higher for less). Internet use is free-watch out for the key board and the different letters, though. There was a concierge who appeared very helpful although we did not use her services except for help on the computer. All in all, all the staff were courteous and helpful, including the bellhop-Kaza.

Also, as taxis are relatively cheap, it doesn't cost much to get to the Taksim Square area, which has a great selection of bars/restaurants.

The breakfast buffet was well stocked with a good selection of options and the breakfast room had the added bonus of fantastic views. The rooms were of an adequate size (v compact bathrooms!), but we knew this as we'd booked only standard rooms as they were good value. Throughout, the hotel was clean and well maintained. The only downside we experienced regarded noise levels. As all our rooms were facing on to a semi-busy road and we were near the mosques, we all encountered some issues with the noise - from noisy neighbours, early morning calls to mosque and the road being dug up at 2 in the morning (none of which being the hotel's fault)! However, as all the windows are double glazed, it seems that the hotel has done what it can to remedy the noise issue.

Please let me be clear that this hotel is not terrible. Its location is wonderful, being so close to some of the major sites, and it is reasonable for the price, and it is clean. But there are some major concerns. As one reviewer wrote, the mattresses are incredibly hard. I like a firm bed, however, I have never slept on a bed that was so hard. It is literally like sleeping on the floor. The greater concern is the same thing noted by the same reviewer. The walls are paper-thin and you can easily overhear the conversation from the adjoining rooms. If they are watching TV, you will easily be able to follow the programing. This noise is heightened if you are in a room that is in the back of the hotel. While the front of the hotel faces a quiet street, the back of the hotel faces a major street where one of the city trams runs. I was forced to use the fan continuously to drown out the street and neighbor's noises. The last concern or problem was the service. It was terrible. The desk people were not terribly helpful nor friendly. When I got to the hotel, they could not or would not give me change for any denomination, and when I asked for a city map, they did not have one to give me but they were willing to sell me one for the equivalent of $2. Additionally, trying to get them to serve me a drink on the patio was a problem. Despite the fact that I sat there for 15 minutes while the server went back and forth in the small patio I was sitting, directly in front of me, I was never served until I chased him down. The same thing occurred when I wanted another drink and when I wanted to pay the bill. This occurred the very next day with a different server. By the end of the second full day, I checked out and went to the Four Seasons Hotel, not far from the Ottoman Imperial. The service, recognizing the difference in the room rates, was impecible. One other warning. While my room was rather spacious in relation to other European hotels, a floor map of the rooms on that floor suggest that rooms are not similar in size or shape, and that you may have the misfortune of getting one of the smaller rooms. Finally, be aware that while free transportation is provided to and from the airport if you stay three (?) or more days, the service is available only if you book directly with them.

Very convenient for seeing the major mosques, churches and palaces. The hotel feels mid-sized and the lobby is a little old fashioned. However, the staff are excellent: friendly, accommodating and providing excellent dinner recommendations. We were in a \"standard\" room in the annexe of the hotel proper, we didn't feel cut off from the main building. Prospective guests who are unable to easily navigate stairs may want to confirm that they are in the main wing as I don't think the annexe has an elevator. The room was large by European standards and clean. The bed while comfortable was the hardest I have ever slept in. The bathroom was adequate with a toilet, sink and half tub with shower which like many European showers leaked after use. The free WiFi worked well throughout the hotel, except for the dining room, but did work on the patio which provided an excellent spot for afternoon drinks. Breakfast was included and was a buffet affair, I didn't find it very interesting but that could just be my food preferences. We did eat dinner in the hotel one evening and while not an adventurous menu it was quite tasty and not too expensive. It is close to a tram stop on the main tram line in the city and from it one can get to the waterfront, spice market and over to Taksim Square, although it is a total of 45 to 60 minutes depending on connections via tram, funicular and tram again (all to be paid for separately). Taksim square is the area for night life; restaurants, bars, coffee houses. The hotel area is not (in my opinion) a great place to eat. We arranged a car from the airport through the hotel and were very pleased to see the driver waiting for us at close to 2am. There are a number of disadvantages with the hotel. While the room was quite large there was a paucity of storage space; one wardrobe, two small bedside tables and a tiny desk. The bathroom was equally short of storage space, one small shelf inadequate to hold toiletries for two people. The room was warm and while there appeared to be an air-conditioning unit on the wall we didn't use it (in fact I couldn't figure out how to turn it on), preferring to open the window which presented its own problems. Our room faced onto the major street which carried continuous traffic until late at night and which started again early in the morning. The bedroom walls were thin, we could plainly hear the television from the next room late at night. While they had an in-room safe it was too small to hold a small laptop.

We booked the room for between 94 and 109 Euros/night which was very reasonable, especially considering the continual rising of prices in Istanbul. We heard about the hotel through the Rick Steves' book which afforded us an additional 5% off. If you pay with hard currency you receive a 10% discount.

If you have a Rick Steves Istanbul book you get a 5% discount plus a free airport transfer by the way. Originally, they just wanted to give us a 6% discount and i had to go through all my printed emails to show the man that we were suposed to get the extra 5% due to the book. Some other guest got 10% right away, so i guess this is negotiable. After this was settled everything was fine. They prefer you pay in euros or US dollars, not turkish lira. You can get either currency at ATMS. They don't explain to you in the emails, that they charge a 6% ( i think) fee for using credit cards, which seemed way too much. We got in early, so they gave us a standard room for a few hours until ours was available. very small on ground floor. Our premium sultan room had an amazing view of Haghia Sofia. I think the room was 201. Room was much smaller than expected. We had a tiny sitting room to the side with two chairs, which was pretty useless expect to store luggage. The bathroom is very small. The shower tub is too small. It's a bath/shower combo, but half the size. If this makes sense. It's more like a large foot bath, half of it is the bath/shower and then a seat of some kind. Getting out of it is very tricky, especially with a wet baby. Everything is clean and the bed is very comfortable. We had no problem with hearing other guests, but we only had guests on one side. The baby cot is quite good and appropriate for older babies. The baby cot looks like a graco pack and play. But it really makes the room small, since you have little free space. There is a lift in the buildng. They have internet access in the hotel, but if you don't have a computer they have a few laptops which you can check out and use in the hotel. A great idea. We used this a few times. The highlight of the hotel for me was the terrace. I loved having breakfast out there in the morning. You have a view of one minaret (which they light up at night), some houses and buildings. You can hear the boat's horns on the river/bospherous. If you go by the lounge area of the terrace, you can see one of the minarets of Haghia Sofia. For breakfast, they had a decent spread of breads, turkish cheese, some meats, scrambled eggs, semi cooked tomatoes, yoghurt, but the highlight to me was the homemade jams. Wonderful! At night, the food is so so, but it has a nice atmosphere. The night we had dinner, they had a musician and a whirling dervish performing. The manager of the hotel is very nice.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston-Salem, NC", "Title": "\u201cNice Place but not for everyone\u201d", "Author": "jw71", "ReviewID": "UR10060306", "Content": "We had booked two, superior rooms through the hotel web site.

We had sent inquiring e-mails to a number of hotels located in the ancient part of the town. The main reason we decided on the Ottoman Imperial versus the others was the promptness, clarity and re-assurance of their responses to our questions. Little did we know that this hotel has also the most remarkable location!! A narrow side street separates it from Aghia Sofia, the entrance to the TopKapi palace is a hundred yards away and the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome and the Museum of Turkish and islamic Arts (great antique carpet collection!!!) is only a little further down. In the five days we stayed there, we took taxi only once (to go the old Byzantine church of Aghia Irene which has the best mosaics east of Ravenna, italy). We walked to the Grand Bazaar and the Spice Market, Istanbul University and Suleiman the Magnificent Mosque. For trips to the modern part of the city (Taxim Square) or the harbor to take the inexpensive public ferry to where the Black Sea meets Bosphorus, we boarded the clean, safe and frequent trams from a nearby stop (tram fare was about $1.3). We were also fortunate to be there at the time of Ramadan, a major Muslim holiday, since the square close to the hotel is designated by the city for the nightly celebratory feasts by working class Turks (who had been strictly fasting all day). Getting back to the hotel, it is a renovated old building decorated in a beautiful,elegant and understated manner with Ottoman art. Our room was beautiful, clean, with all the comforts Americans are used to from the big hotel chains. What however made this hotel so special aside from its location was their remarkable staff, especially the front desk people. We are frequent and fussy travelers but we have never met more helpful and delightful hotel professionals as Yasar Celen, the front desk manager, and his assistant, Gonul Akkaya. Their genuine interest in their guests and ability to promptly provide satisfactactory solutions was amazing. As an example, the day of our departure, the taxi we had ordered to take us to the airport seemed to be delayed because of a traffic jam; Mr Celen noticed our anxiety of missing the plane and immediately drove us to the airport in his car with lots of time to spare!! We left Istanbul with wonderful experiences of the city and its people; this hotel and its staff made our trip even more memorable.", "Date": "October 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Whinbrook", "ReviewID": "UR10038595", "Content": "Have just returned from spending 4 nights at this hotel. We were a party of six in three rooms, two Premium rooms and one Junior Suite. We studied Trip Advisor frequently prior to our trip and expected to be in for a real treat based on the all glowing reviews we read day after day. It was disappointing all told. The location of the hotel is unbeatable. This was our first visit to Istanbul and it was thrilling to stay right in the historical centre, none of the essential sights was more than a 10 minute walk, while the Hagya Sofia was adjacent. Despite being in the thick of things the hotel is in a quite location on quaint cobbled street. There are plenty of good restaurants close by, the better ones being down the less busy streets. The staff were helpful and friendly and always on hand if required. We used the comlimentary airport pick up which worked a treat. The public areas are small but the delighful outdoor terrace with a linden tree for shade, makes up for this. The weather was warm and sunny, so we used the comfortable well furnished terrace frequently, especially to have breakfast on. If the weather had been inclement, then the public areas would have been crampt and uncomfortable. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant on our first evening and we all enjoyed everything, with good service as well. Breakfasts were only adequate though, perhaps a little too biased towards local tastes. The fly in the ointment though were the bedrooms and bathrooms. The two premium rooms were quite pleasant, fairly spacious and airey but the Junior Suite was cramped and claustrophopic despite tall ceilings. We asked to be moved and were disappointed to be told we could not change. We did hear several people asking to change rooms during our stay. If they were accommodated we do not know. The dark wood furniture and trim does not help, making the space more opressive. The lighting as very poor too in all the rooms which did nothing to alleviate the gloomy atmosphere. The beds were very hard and unforgiving in all our rooms and a good nights sleep was difficult. The pillows were poor too which added to the misery. The so called sitting area in each bedroom was a tiny space off each room, part of the original layout no doubt. It was practically useless except for storing the suitcases (no where else to put them). With a little thought and redesign, these rooms could so much more comfortable. The bathroom was tiny too. The hip bath is a bad choice - its too small to use as a bath and the moulded seat makes it useless as a shower unless you are a contortionist. The tub is set too high off the bathroom floor and the shower screen slides the wrong side against the wash hand basin so entering and exiting the bath/shower is not only very awkward but quite dangerous, especially as the shower screen is totally inadequate in containing the shower spray, so the floor is flooded after a shower. There is no storage space in the bathroom either for toilet bags, make up etc . The towels are very thin too. You must bring a plug for the sink if you intend to use it as none was provided - an important oversight I think! And this claims to be a 4 star hotel? The rooms have minibars and a complimentary tea and coffee tray. However, although the rooms were adequatley cleaned, the replenishing of the tea tray varied between none existant to over zealous. We had over 10 creamers, no tea, one coffee, no sugar and one sweetner during our stay. What is the point of having this extra if it is not correctly provided? I'm sure the front desk would have rectified it immediately (they brough extra hangers immediately) but it should be automatically done without having to ask. The Junior Suite's a/c worked fine but the other two rooms machines worked irratically. We sound like picky miserable complainers don't we! But this is how it was during our stay. We still greatly enjoyed our visit to Istanbul and will return, its an amazing city. We did have a splurge meal at the Four Seasons hotel not far from here and chose to have the Ottoman Buffet as part of the Ramadan Festival. It was superb. The hotel looked beautiful too and be all admitted that we would have liked to have stayed there - cost be damned!", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cThe Jewel in the Crown\u201d", "Author": "GUINNESSVancouver", "ReviewID": "UR10030219", "Content": "We have just returned from a cruise Istanbul to Athens with hotels each end.

Clean and comfortable. The hotel is pretty centrally located in the Sultanahmet district, within walking distance of all the major sites: Hagia Sophia (across the street), Blue Mosque, underground cisterns, museums, Tokapi Palace, covered bazaar, Hippodrome and Egyptian spice market (which we liked much more than the bazaar). A bit more expensive than other hotels, but heck, you get more for your money than you would for the same price room in New York. Staff was great.
