I arrived at the hotel which is very conveniently located next to Termini station (hopping distance) and a nice 30 min. walk to Piaza Venezia. My room was not ready but I was checked in and my luggage left there. Upon my return I found a beautiful and huge room awaiting me. The bed could fit three people, there was a jacoozi in the bathroom, the drinks at the minibar were free of charge and there was free wifi in the room. I don't think you can expect anything better. The breakfast was good and fresh (lacking a bit on the variety side) and there was coffee and tea in the room. A gym was ready for use and was small but useful for my needs (especially since I was there on my own every time). The staff were very friendly and helpful and on the first day it was convenient that my suitcase was waiting for me in the room when I arrived.

If you want to go to the Papal audience on Wednesday dont get ripped off by the travel companys which were charging 44 Euros, go to St Peters Basilica at the exit steps on the right hand side there are two swiss gaurds, if you speak to them they will give you free tickets which allows you to sit in the seated areas in St Peters square.

We are very glad we did. *Bear in mind we stayed at the beginning of March, so all our comments here may or may not be appropriate to other times of the year* It's situated close to Termini Station. Before booking, we were a little peturbed about the location based on other reviews of different hotels, as well as sites such as Wikitravel. It's true, there are some interesting characters knocking around Termini, and I should imagine that during high season it's a place to keep a close eye on your valuables, but we didn't feel at all threatened there, and the Diocleziano itself is situated on a very quiet (Roman standards!) street. We wandered around the area quite happily at night without any incident at all. Being so close to Termini means that it is ideally situated for travel around the city - it's literally 2 minutes to the Metro and Bus station. The metro station is currently undergoing quite a lot of renovation and upgrading, so double check you're on the right platform. The room we had was really, really good - spacious and equipped with quality items. The bed was firm and comfortable (so comfortable that I kept my wife up all night snoring - sorry dear!), the shower and bathroom were modern and spacious. The whole hotel was spotlessly - and I mean SPOTLESSLY - clean. We loved the free mini-bar in the room as well. There was no booze in it, but hey, after a hard days sight seeing you really want a nice coke or orange anyway rather than wine right? It was replinished every day. They forgot to do it on our last but one day, but as soon as we pointed it out they did it while we were out. The breakfast was absolutely fine. It was the same choice every day, but when there's so much on offer we were fine with it. Everything tasted nice and fresh. We loved the freshly squeezed orange juice and the made-to-order cappucinos and espressos. My wife noticed that the pictures on the hotel website don't do justice to the breakfast room - it was really nice. The staff were also fantastic. Polite and friendly and knowledgeable. It's nice at smaller hotels when there's fewer staff because it's easier to form a relationship and know who's who and who to speak to for what. The lady who served the breakfast coffees and juice was lovely - really chirpy and happy, was nice to see a happy face at the start of the day! Overall, we really loved the Diocleziano. Can't think of anything bad to say about the place. Oh, wait, the lift was a bit small. That says it all really - if the worst thing you can find to say about somewhere is that the elevator was a bit cramped, then you should definitely think about staying again sometime.

The room we had was on the first floor, just off from the main check-in desk. It was small, but comfortable and very clean. Oddly enough, the bathroom appeared larger than the room! There was also a cute little deck with a bistro set. Some small complaints: The shower is tiny! And if you move the shower head so that it faces the area where you enter/exit, you will flood the bathroom, as the water goes through the curtain and the drainage system is slow. Hopefully it's something they will fix before the next guests stay. Another complaint is there is some noise, not sure what it is, every morning. It's almost like some ice machine above or something. So if you're a light sleeper, or don't like noise, this may be something to consider. Ask to stay in another room. Some people have written that you can go on the roof of the hotel and get a great view of the city. This is true, ONLY if you are a guest in the top floor room. That's the only access to the roof. So unless the guest staying in that room is you, or really friendly and let's you in, you won't be able to access the roof. Just felt I should make this clear. Another thing to mention is that they only serve breakfast. No lunch, dinner or food available at any other time. Luckily there are several eating places nearby. I can't say anything about the breakfast buffet as we did not eat breakfast here. I also can't comment on the gym or sauna b/c I didn't even check it out, but I know they have one. Perks: They leave you coffee, tea and other beverages daily. This was great. Especially after some long days of touring. It was nice to come back and have something easily available to drink. It's so close to Roma Termini. A stone's throw away really. This was incredibly convenient!! It's also close to several eating places. They exchange money for you at the front desk. And the rate is fair. Comparable to most other places. I had a hard time giving this hotel an overall rating. It's definitely better than a 3, but not quite a 4. I've stayed in some of the best rated hotels in the world, so a 5 is something I don't easily give. I'd say 3.5 is about right.

So I decided to splurge a little more this time, and after looking at all the options, I liked the location and perceived quality of the Hotel Diocleziano. And I was not disappointed - I would not even bother looking for another hotel in Rome, as HD suited all my needs. I like the idea of being close to Roma Termini (train station), and this hotel couldn't get much closer, with it being located virtually across the road. The rooms were excellent, proof that you get what you pay for in Europe. The room I had was massive, with a large anteroom and bathroom. I slept well there, and only woke to my alarm. The wi-fi was steady and did not disconnect at any time during my stay. I am returning to Rome in February and have booked again at HD. The hotel is right next door to the side walls of the villa that forms part of Diocletian's Baths, and was handy when I had an hour or so to kill before taking the train to Fiumicino Airport (the hotel even gave me a late check-out). I could get to the centre of old Rome (forum) very quickly by train, and reasonably quickly by foot, as it was a walk down the Via Cavour. The breakfast is a buffet, and while I usually don't like buffets, this one was ok, and I got a decent breakfast. The staff were very helpful, and although they hadn't readied my room when I arrived at about 1pm, I went and got some lunch and came back, and my luggage was in the room waiting for me.

The hotel met this first requirement with ease; it is about 2 minutes walk from the train station and with the help of the map on the hotel website, was found very quickly.

Despite complaining about this several times, there didn't seem to be any effort to resolve the problem (we were simply told they were having problems with boiler) and we were offered no apology or compensation. Furthermore, whilst the location was indeed central, it wasn't a particularly nice area. For example, there were at least 2 homeless men sleeping rough in the same road as the hotel and the area to the side of the Termini station was even worse (a whole camp of people sleeping rough on mattresses and in tents). Not a huge problem as I didn't feel unsafe, but there are certainly nicer areas of Rome. In summary, the Diocleziano is a lovely hotel with excellent breakfast and spotlessly clean rooms.

The only weakness of the hotel, in my view, is also one of its strengths, and that is its proximity to the train station. The hotel is on a quiet side street so unlike other hotels in this area noise is not a problem, but as a general rule the area right near the train station is not the nicest part of any Italian city and Rome is no exception.

I can definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who can afford the price. This place is definitely worth the price you pay for the stay. First of all, the location is superb. It is located about 7-10 minutes by walk from Roma Termini (the train station of Rome) and another major Metro station (Republica) which you could take to reach important sites of interest such as the Colosseum and the Vatican. I have observed that when a hotel is located in such close proximity to a train station or on a main street, there is often a lot of noise and your night's sleep could be compromised for the convenience of the location. However, this hotel is located in a secluded side street which offers enough quietness at night despite being so close to a major street. Safety is not at all an issue. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They provide information and help with transfer to the airport. I arrived from Florence by train and I could easily walk to the hotel from the train station with my travel bags as they had wheels. Rome was my last destination and I flew back from Rome. To get to the airport, I used the affordable taxi arranged by the hotel staff. If you don't have big bags to carry along, you could also take the air-train connection from Roma Termini station. The hotel provides complimentary internet, spa and gym although I never had the opportunity to use these facilities as I was busy enjoying Rome itself. The room was very cosy with a spacious bath/toilet. The only shortcoming that I noticed was that hot water was not hot enough after 11 pm. I wanted to use the bath-tub before I went to sleep, but noticed that the water was just warm enough to wash hands or brush. Another huge plus is the breakfast that they provide. I had stayed in 2 other hotels (Venice and Florence) prior to my visit to Rome. The other hotels provided great breakfast too, but comparatively this was the best. This is very important because the major purpose of my visit was touring and sight-seeing. Having a good breakfast gave me enough time till early in the evening to concentrate the bulk of my sight-seeing in the daytime when attractions are open (many sights close 1-2 hours earlier in the winter months). I did not have to worry about where or when I would have my next meal. All I needed to do was to grab a quick bite during the day and have a good dinner earlier in the evening. For a single person, this hotel could be on the pricier side, but if you travel as a family or couple, then I can seriously recommend this hotel as you would be saving on time spent looking for a cab or public transport as well the money spent on them.

Two of us travelling alone, having managed to leave the kids with their grandparents. We had booked on the strength of Trip Advisor reviews and booked through the hotel website, getting about \u20ac400 of a saving for web booking direct. We only noticed the negative comments about the hotel location just before we left so we were a little nervous. Starting with the location, we got a train direct from the airport to Termini station and then had less than a 5 minute walk from the station doors to the hotel (just make sure you walk out the correct door). Some people have commented that the area is very dangerous etc. All I'll say is that it's a city centre location and is exactly the same as any other city in the world with the usual odd types hanging around drinking etc, not too many of them either. I work in a city centre and once you walk around with your eyes open watching out for yourselves you'll do fine. The hotel itself is fantastic. I have never seen a city centre hotel this clean and well maintained. The rooms are clean and will be made up whatever time of day suits you. There is a free soft drink mini bar in the rooms, free wi-fi and decent tv. Could be a few more English tv channels but overall not bad at all. Also, there is a new gym opened with 3 cardio machines and a half dozen free weights. Not going to do for a hard weights session but will let you stretch out. I was going to drop a point for a buzzing noise from the circuit board in the room but once the key was out of the slot the electrics went quiet. inconvenient but not too bad. Finally the staff. Before travelling I sent a couple of emails to staff looking for help with booking restaurants and stuff. They really couldn't do enough to help at every stage of our visit. I could go on all day about them, assisting with booking tickets, restaurants and making a genuine effort to make sure our visit went as well as possible.

Due to the spread out nature of most of the attractions in Rome, this is a perfect home- base due to the convenience of having buses as well as the subway station so nearby. Upon arrival, we were checked into our hotel room, which was fairly small and crammed with beds. I was traveling with my two sisters so the room, a standard triple, was litterally two twin beds with a folding bed in a row with just enough room at the end of the beds for a little desk. It was tight! The only way out of bed was to scoot to the end, there was no room between the beds to get out, and of course no nightstand in which to place a clock or water or even my glasses. By far, the smallest room we had on our trip, and among the smallest I have stayed in while traveling in Europe. The bathroom was spacious and the room was clean. We didn't come to Rome to stay in a hotel room so overall the small size was laughable, especially when we were trying to get up and having to scoot down the bed. Breakfast was the best we had while in Italy, plenty of fresh tasty pastry, yoghurt, coffee, fruit and the breakfast staff was extremely friendly. The morning we left my sister went to go get an apple and she was handed an \"on the go\" prepacked breakfast which was very thoughtful. The hotel booked a car service to the airport since we were departing from Rome and the cost was 45 Euro for all three, which was very reasonable. Due to the close proximity to the train station there is a population of homeless people with obvious mental illness, one of which came up to the car window as we were leaving and babblling. One of my sisters did not like having to go past them on the dark street to the hotel, but the area was populated enough where I never felt we were in jeopardy. Overall the staff was extremely pleasant and the price was excellent and I would recommend without hesitation. Room was also very clean. One last thing, not related to the hotel, beware of taxi drivers trying to rip you off. One driver cleared the meter then asked for almost double the fare. When questioned he claimed it was his English...which was pretty good. I asked the hotel for a number to report him, but even with his license number it was obvious the officials could not be bothered.

We would like to give some context to our comments. Diocleziano is a small boutique hotel in a major city. If I stay in a similar CBD hotel in my home town of Melbourne the tarrif would be similar if not more (unlike Diocleziano where breakfast, mini bar, internet, gym are included this is not always the case in all city hotels). Lets face reality, central CBD hotels cost, no matter where you are. Having stayed in European Hotels we found the room size to be quite spacious compared to other European Hotels. I know rooms are bigger in the USA, Asia and Australia. Again, the bathroom in our room was fantastic and again spacious for a European hotel. Our room and bathroom was spotlessly clean. It was made up beautifully each day. However, most importantly the service & welcome we received at Diocleziano was wonderful. All staff were friendly, welcoming and no request was too much. When we checked in our room was not ready (we knew this would be the case). We were shown to a sitting area to rest and organise ourselves. Shown the restrooms incase we wanted to use same. The concierge tagged and stored our luggage in a locked storage area. It was explained that our room would be ready by 2:00pm. The staff provided us with suggestions on sights to see nearby, provided us directions and a map. We set off to explore. We went to a nearby museum not returning to hotel until 3:00pm (time escaped us). When we returned there had been a change of shift & Valentino greeted us at the front desk. He made sure we had been shown everything, answered any questions and provided us with our internet access codes. He arranged for us to be shown to our room, where our luggage was waiting for us. We were very impressed on first sight of the room. If Diocleziano advertises a room with its description, it is accurate. The bed was described as a large double (in Australian terms this is a King Size bed) upon checking in our bed was a King Size and it was very comfortable. In contrast at our London hotel they advertised as having a King Size bed, but we found the bed in our London room was infact just a double. At Diocleziano we were shown how to work everything in the room. The room came with airconditioning which was wonderful and a room safe. We rested and freshened up. Valentino suggested places to dine and made restaurant bookings for us. Everyday of our stay was wonderful. Always greeted in a warm & welcoming manner by all at the hotel. The breakfast staff, the front desk staff, the housekeeping staff, porters etc. Everyone was always helpful. My husband wanted to have a haircut & shave and the staff found a suitable barber for him. He also wanted news where to see Australian Football (as it was our finals series at home) again, the staff investigated and located a Bar where this could be seen. The staff could recommend were to get the best gelato and provided directions on how to get places. We wanted to check in on line for our flights to London. When checking in we requested that the email be sent to the hotels reception desk - but there was a problem with the airline's system so no emails were being sent out. Valentino said, you have tried enough this way, now you come and use my computer. So we checked in online again using the reception computer where we could print the boarding passes directly. Staff provided warnings about personal safety. Lets face it no city any where in the world is 100% safe. I never felt unsafe anywhere we went. Staff would ask what are you doing today, and would give tips on personal safety if they felt there was anything we needed to be concerned about. The hotel is well located to the Termini (for trains, buses etc.) and we were able to walk to many of the sites. We do like to walk, but public transport travel was so readily available if we wanted to use it. The hotel arranged for private transfers for us from the curise terminal in Civitavecchia to the hotel and from the hotel to the airport. These were of a high standard. We decided to take a day trip to Florence. We were booking online our train tickets but having difficulty understanding some of the website. Valentino was busy but asked Anna from the office to come and help us. After all the help they provided, we then realised the cost of train tickets would be more than taking a tour but Anna and Valentino were not bothered, they recommended a tour and booked it for us. As I said all of the staff were friendly, professional, welcoming and helpful. One day we were out seeing the sights and we heard, \"hello mame, hello sir\" when we looked towards the voice it was one of the staff from Diocleziano on his afternoon off, walking past - he took the time to stop and say hello and wish us a good day seeing the sights of Rome. Each morning at breakfast we were greeted warmly and enthusiastically by the breakfast service staff. they were always chirpee and helpful. We sent items to the Laundry. One item i ticked to be dry cleaned, but the Laundry sent word it could not be drycleaned. Immediately the front desk staff came and found us in the breakfast room and explained this and asked if we wanted to launder the item in the regular way. He then adjusted the cost in our presence. Staff are very aware of who is a guest at the hotel or not. If there is a staff shift change new staff enquire discreetly as to whether you are a guest. Another aspect of making sure we safe. There are so many more examples I could give of the wonderful service and helpfulness of the staff at Hotel Diocleziano. We did not feel like we were in a hotel, but that we had made a home away from home. We will be visiting Rome again in 2 years time when we will travel with our children. Without hesitation we will return to Hotel Diocleziano. The dollars spent are worth it, it is a hotel when one considers the inclusions, it provides in my opinion good value for money. The following are the items which are included in the tarrif at Diocleziano and these should be remembered when thinking of the room cost, that is, what you pay is not just for the room, your room charge is inclusive of: 1. The tariff includes breakfast and what a fantastic breakfast it is. Breakfast buffet at Hotel Diocleziano is a traditional Italian Breakfast buffet. Pastries (to die for), cold meats, cheezes, breads, cereals, yoghurts, fruit (both preserved and fresh), tea, coffee (including cappaccino, cafe late, expresso etc), juices - the breakfast staff will squeeze you a fresh orange juice), a selection of hot foods - eggs, bacon, mushrooms etc). The breakfast at our London Hotel consisted of Toast and boxed cereals, no name brand tea & coffee. 2. Free Internet. There was a free internet station with 3 computers. When you book in you are provided with a password & user name for 'free' use of the internet for the period of your stay. If you need to print something, simply send an email to the hotels info email address and the staff will print for you (free). After our stay in Rome we had time in London. The hotel we stayed at charged 5 pounds for 3 hours use of the internet. If you clocked on at 9:00am your 3 hours was up at 12 midday, even if you only used 1 hour of it. The London hotel would not print for you free of charge. 3. Free Mini Bar. The mini bar has bottled water and soft drinks which are replenished daily. It was wonderful to return to your room at the end of a day knowing there was a cold drink waiting for you. We didnt even have a fridge at our London hotel, so couldnt even chill bottled water if we wanted to. 4. Small fitness centre and sauna - whilst we did not make use of this it looked great. People we saw using were happy with it. 5. In room coffee/tea station with biscuits etc. 6. Airconditioning, room safe, lift. (not all European hotels have a lift or airconditioning) We recommend the hotel Diocleziano to all. Thank you Hotel Diocleziano for making our stay in Rome a truly memorable one.

The mini bar in the room also had complimentary soft drinks, replenished daily - what a fabulous touch!! The hotel also had free Internet with 3 PCs and a small sauna/gym (we did not make use of this, but had a look and were impressed). The hotel is in a quiet street, beside other hotels, 5 minutes walk from the main Termini Railway/Bus/Metro station, so is very well placed for getting around the city. We mostly walked to see most of the sights and got the Metro/Bus back - very easy and convenient to use. You are best to buy a \"RomaPass\" travel ticket for public transport. (To get to The Vatican/St Peters from the hotel, you will need to get the Metro or Bus) Lots of nice restaurants/pizzerias in the area - try the Ristorante/Pizzeria \"Da Dino\" in Via dei Mille - excellent value, no frills, just authentic Italian food and good service.

This was our first oversees experience and did not start off well but Tomasso and the other front desk guys at the Doicleziano made everything so much easier. We had booked a \"shared\" transfer from the airport to the hotel. There were 15-17 other people in this van. The driver went hotel to hotel dropping off guests. We were the next to last to be dropped off. When we got out to retrieve our luggage I noticed that my husband's suitcase was missing. The driver insisted we did not load it in the van while we were the airport. We knew we had and that he had mistakenly left the suitcase on the sidewalk at another hotel while unloading someone else's luggage. The driver, who spoke very little english, went inside the Diocleziano and spoke to Tomasso who was on duty at the time. After an overnight flight, we were all exhausted and upset about the situation. Long story short, Tomasso and the concierge, (I'm so sorry I can't remember his name), made several calls and two hours later our luggage showed up !! The entire staff at the Diocleziano went out of their way every day to make our first stay in Rome wonderful. Everything from their restaurant suggestions to their daily freshly stocked mini frig was great. The last morning of our stay there, we decided to sleep in for a bit. My daughter and I missed breakfast so I went down to the bar area and asked for a cup of cappucinno. I was going to take them both back up but the bar tender said he would bring them up for me. A few minutes later, he showed up with a beautiful tray of pastries, toasts and nutella, and our cappucinno ! What great service.

We couldn't have asked for better care from the staff. Polite, professional, and above all helpful, the holiday went off without a hitch. Two major considerations for choosing this hotel were it's location in regards to walking distance to the places they wanted to see, and it's location in regards to noise level from the street. They had no problems at all walking to the furthest points in their plans: Piazza Del Popolo to the north, St Peter's/Vatican to the west, and Circus Maximus to the south. They didn't have to take a cab, bus or metro once, as everything was within walking distance. And plenty close to shopping and restaurants but tucked away half a block from major streets makes all the difference; it was extremely quiet and a great place to relax in the evenings. The price was very reasonable for being in City Center, and for anyone wanting to use buses or metro it's only a block away from the terminal. From airport pick-up and drop-off, to information about the city and where to shop and eat, to addressing all requests immediately, this hotel and it's superb staff get top marks.

This was our third hotel stay in Rome, the previous two were Capo D'Africa and the Hotel Forum, both very good hotels. We chose this hotel for a few reasons: Firstly, breakfast....., not a great priority amongst Romans, but for someone brought up in Scotland and the North of England, something of a priority. On this count, The Diocleziano comes out tops. Bacon,sausage, beans, scrambled egg, toast and any type of coffee you require, will set you up for the hike around the monuments. Secondly, we wanted to concentrate on the museums and sites around Termini, plus a trip out to Ostia, so being close to the station was helpful, but think twice about using the train from Fiumicino to this hotel, it is a stiff trek from the Fiumicino train platform and in 100f temps and the gauntlet of shady characters (at Termini), you would be better advised to arrange a shuttle bus from the airport (56 euros for 2 ,both ways,as of 2011). Incidentally, a single taxi fare is still around the 45 euro mark (fixed rate). The hotel staff could not be more helpful, we were booked in a standard room with Expedia, but on arrival asked what upgrades were on offer. We were shown room 103, which had a large terrace with brolly,table and chairs. The room also had a 2 seater whirlpool bath/shower (fun), a safe, fridge (with free water and pop), and daily replenished coffee/tea maker. This room was described as superior with terrace and was an additional 100 euros for four nights. There was no view to speak of, but still worth the extra, as far as I as concerned. There is a VIP room on the top floor which has a fine view of the cloisters at the back of the Diocletian Baths/Museo Nazionale Romano. Within 100 mtrs on Via Marsala, is La Famiglia restaurant, not bad and quite reasonably priced. There are other decent places nearby and there is a handy asian run shop (on Via Marsala) selling chilled wine and beer,plus bizarrely, cameras and TVs , but we did return to Angelino al Fiori, at the bottom of Via Cavour, directly across the road from the entrance to the Forum, it is still very good. I could not fault this hotel, if it were situated near the Hotel Forum, it would probably be No.1 on TA, having said that, it would be twice the price and booked solid, so there has to be a trade off between location and popularity.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "YYC", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location, rooms relatively small\u201d", "Author": "bauwens", "ReviewID": "UR117360475", "Content": "We spent a night in Rome before flying back next morning, having arrived by train.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, they even provided us with a map and sightseeing suggestions. We stayed in the \"superior room\" and it was very nice, the rooms were large for a central hotel. The bathroom was also nice and large. Some things to be warned about the walls seem to be very thin. I also think that we were in a bad area of the hotel with our room. We were on the first floor of the hotel over looking the air-conditioning unit, which was quite noisy when you are trying to sleep. Also there must have been a bathroom from another room right beside us because you could hear everything! It was not just the people using the water or flushing the toilet, you could even hear them putting on lotion!! This made it very hard to sleep. The beds are also ROCK hard, which was ok for me, but I know it may not be for everyone. They did have complimentary soda and water in the fridge for you which is refilled daily. A very nice touch! The \"Superior\" room was an upgrade we choose to do because we thought it would be on a higher up floor and would there for give us a better view. Clearly I was wrong about that. When we first went into the bathroom it looked like the bathtub was dirty but it appeared to just be run down, there were marks all over it. This really did not help make you want to take a bath. So I would say the upgrade was a waste of money. The breakfast was ok. Nothing special. As it is a small hotel there was not much selection. Typical Italy the bread/buns are hard but the coffee is great! The staff in the breakfast room were nice, but I did not find things replenished quickly. The staff at the front desk were also very nice. They arranged a car service for us to take us to the airport for 45 Euros. The Taxi was there early and got us there in plenty of time. The hotel is located near the train station. This is the reason that we booked this hotel as we took the train in from the port in Civitavecchia (a VERY bad idea with your luggage). When we arrived at the train station (which is huge) we went out the only exit we could find. This left us with a very long walk to the hotel. We have done this many times in other cities and not had a problem, but I think with all your luggage this was just too far to walk. The area may be a bit sketchy at night but during the day it was fine. We did not return to this area, we instead took the streets north of the hotel and it was fine at night. The hotel is central and is easy to walk to everything. We waked from the hotel to Piazza Navona without a problem. It is also fairly close to a metro station. I would recommend this hotel because the rooms were nice and the staff was friendly. But I am not sure if I would rather stay there again or try something new. I would not do the upgrade to the \"Superior\" room, I do not think it was worth it. Also if you are on your honeymoon this hotel does not do anything extra for you. But get out and enjoy Rome!!!

Additionally, you are provided with a refrigerator with a complementary Coke, Fanta, water, and a juice box daily which was great. FREE WIFI INTERNET.

Additionally, if you ask the attendant for an espresso or cappuccino it is free of charge. The hotel also has a sauna and a gym, although we did not use these amenities. It is also really close ~ 2 blocks to the Roma Termini Station, no cab needed, walking distance. The Bad: The air conditioner took a really long time to cool the room. The room required the key card to activate the electricity so I'm not sure if it controlled the AC and the mini fridge but both were sub par. It took hours to cool a drink. I will admit that the weather was hot ~ 95 degrees Fahrenheit daily but a cool shower and ice bucket from the bar downstairs was necessary to cool off. The bed was also supposed to be a queen but were two twins pushed together, and were very stiff. It is also very expensive to get drinks at the hotel bar ( around 9 Euros for a shot of Jack Daniels). Overall: The hotel was nice and service was exceptional, the location is good but you will have to walk ~15 minutes to get to places like the Fountain of Trevi and other main attractions which isnt bad but not optimal, but being close to Roma Termini Station may be a plus to others so make your own decision about that.

What separates Hotel Diocleziano from the other hotels that we stayed at was the service provided by the staff. Tomasso and Valentino made us feel extremely welcome and helped us out with every request, and every query. At no point were we ever made to feel like an inconvenience and our expectations were often exceeded (like when we were provided with a drink and snacks at the bar free of charge while waiting for our airport transfer - I wouldn't expect this though!) The location is great, only a quick 5 minute walk to the main transport terminal and 20-25 minutes walk, if you'd prefer, to most of the fantastic tourist attractions such as the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, etc. The rooms are very clean, reasonably spacious and the bathroom was better than most other hotels that we stayed at. Breakfast was great- each morning we enjoyed an array of scrambled eggs, cold meats, cheese, yogurt and cereals as well as the service staff happy to accommodate coffee requests (even those made by some rude American visitors, \"that's no coffee- I want American coffee...\") One for the girls- like many European hotels, there are no irons in the rooms.

First of all, we would like to thank tripadvisor.com for giving us a possibility to learn about this great hotel. To cut a long story short, here are some pros and cons: Pros: 1. Great location. The hotel is situated in a very calm street (there is practically no traffic) with a view of the Terms of Diocleziano (it was interesting to find out that the embassy of our country, Russia, is located on the same street). On the other hand, it\u2019s only 7-8 minute walk to Termini railway station (the junction of the two underground lines of Rome), 5 minute walk to Piazza dei Cinquecento (the biggest bus terminal in the city), 8-10 minute walk to Reppublica underground station, and 6-7 min walk to hop on/hop off bus stop of the main city lines, including 110, Archeobus, Roma Christiana, etc. The walking distance between the hotel and the Forum is approximately 20-25 minutes. 2. Outstanding staff. We couldn\u2019t but appreciate the professionalism of the personnel who did their best to make our stay in Rome most pleasant (our special thanks to Valentino and Tomazzo). On our arrival, Tomazzo informed us about good restaurants near the hotel (when I checked this information on tripadvisor.com, all the mentioned restaurants had perfect references) and the ways of travelling in the city. Any questions that arose during our stay in the hotel were solved quickly and professionally (for example, we failed to make a preliminary registration for our flight, and Valentino did his best to solve this issue very quickly). Thank you very much, guys! 3. Very nice rooms. We got a room on the third floor, and we loved it very much. It was not our first visit to Rome, and we know that to find a normal room (in size) can be rather problematic there. Diocleziano can really boast of rooms of good size, with big bathrooms, and a nice view. We were a little bit afraid that the beds would be too firm to sleep normally, but they were quite OK (see the photos attached). 4. Good breakfasts. Cold dishes: three types of ham, salami, various cheeses, vegetables, fruits, yoghurts, etc. Hot dishes: scrambled eggs, beans, mushrooms, bacon. The breakfast starts at 6.45, and this early start really helps to enjoy some pleasant moments of calm atmosphere in S.M. Maggiore (or even S. Pietro) (the \u201ctourist hour\u201d in Rome usually starts at about 10.00 a.m.). 5. Wi-Fi connection: perfect in our room.

It was very close to Termini station which was very useful to get to and from the airports. When we first arrived we were not happy with the room so we moved immediately. The room was fairly large with a very large bathroom area but no windows and right next to the entrance and lift area. There was no problem with us moving. However, our next room was very small and had a very small shower cubicle. We were very disappointed as this was our honeymoon after all! After the first night we were able to move rooms to a much bigger room with a bigger bathroom and 2 windows, therefore bright and airy. But still no bath after I had requested one and we were lead to believe we would have one from booking online and talking to the receptionist before moving again! Although we were not in Rome to spend alot of time in our hotel room we were disappointed that we were not able to have a bath. After walking all day it would be a god send to have a little soak before heading out again for the evening. Also the staff were aware that it was our honeymoon (after we told them when we arrived and my husband had emailed before hand) but we had no little touches to make it extra special. Breakfast was fine and again the staff were very helpful. The concierge staff were excellent too. It was great to have wi-fi in your rooms and the free refills of soft drinks was fab too. The hotel was very clean and again the staff were very friendly and helpful!! We were able to walk to all the sights of room (with sore feet at times!).The red hop on and hop off bus was a good experience (but avoid doing this if it is the weekend or raining as sometimes you may have to wait a long time to get on. There was a great restaurant right near the hotel (as you walk out it's to the left la fambilia i think) which was excellent.

Also, only a ten minute walk. The \u201cLa Famiglia\u201d is only a one minute walk from the hotel. Same price to eat as the \u201cLa Lampada\u201d but the food was not as good quality and the ambience is more noisy and fast-paced. I would only go there if nowhere else was available. The \u201cBabbos\u201d was also recommended to us but we didn\u2019t try it as it seemed a little too expensive at approx 40 euros per head for evening meal.

The hotel was incredibly clean as was the room and the breakfast bufet had a huge selection. Location wise is that it is close to the station and not far away from the main attraction. I would deffinitely recommend the Coloseum tour, Vatican museum and St Peters tour (both times get queue jumping tickets as you will need), view from Vittoriana (wedding cake monument) is amazing. It is a must see to go to the top as you see the whole of Rome! Beautiful! We were recommended Hi Res restaurant; food amazing, not horrendously expensive, it is not an Italian style taverna restaurant but more of a trendy restaurant but is incredibly intimate and feels like a members place. The trip was topped off by a chauffeur driven merc to the airport which the hotel organised, this is much nicer (and cheaper) than a taxi to / from the hotel!

Throughout our stay, we encountered consistently superior service. From Termini station, the hotel is about a 5 minute walk to one of the smaller streets in the area -- Via Gaeta -- which actually has 2 other hotels on each side of Hotel Diocleziano. Since this is the main bus hub, there is a lot of traffic to navigate, but it became a simple, quick jaunt for us after one day. (Since the hotel is north of Termini station, we didn't find the location to be problematic and we felt comfortable walking to & from at night, 9pm-10pm.) During check-in, the front desk gives you a map without asking and writes down what transportation options are available to get to the major sights in the city. The hotel elevator can comfortably can fit 3 adults with accompanying luggage. To get to the penthouse suite, the elevator stops at the 4th floor and you take a short flight of stairs directly to the room door. The junior suite is not large, but can work for 3 adults like we were. In the immediate first room which is a small area that connects with the terrace and bathroom, there's a bed (daybed twin size) that can fit someone who is not bigger than let's say 5'8''. The bedroom is more spacious and there's a king bed (2 twins together). Closet space was adequate, though we could have used more space for 3 adults (unfortunately the first room with the daybed has no closet space). The TV is a small 20 inch in the bedroom with various international channels, though we didn't use it heavily. Underneath the TV is a little refridgerator that is stocked with complimentary drinks. We used it everyday when we headed out and it was restocked everyday. The bathroom does give you plenty of room with shelf space and I was greatly relieved to get a true bathtub. The bonus in the package is the terrace with an umbrella table that seats four. Bun and her cousin took coffee out there one afternoon. It was a pleasure to enjoy some fresh air. The view from the terrace looks towards the Terme and we could peope-watch tourists milling around below. Breakfast was complimentary throughout the stay and the girls ate heartily -- the selection was fantastic. The ground floor of the hotel is definitely 4-star quality: to the right of the check-in desk is a bar with plenty of seating, then the breakfast room is a large space that can pretty much hold every guest in the hotel if they decided to eat at the same time; to the left of the check-in desk is a library with comfortable couches and a large flat screen TV, then there's an area with 3 computers for guest use and then there's a gym for light exercise. The free WiFI service signal was strong in our room. The staff were always friendly. I had to check-out at 5am to catch a flight and the front desk person kindly and quickly put together a breakfast bag for me without my asking.

First, the hotel was easy to find on leaving Termini station and the staff were more than welcoming on first arrival (later in the evening), and very friendly. We were shown around our room and told how to use everything (safe, TV, Air Con...) (we were staying in the standard double) which was more than spacious for our needs. We were given our username and password for the free wifi in the hotel - we didn't use this as we don't bring things like laptops or our blackberries on holiday, we want away from the world of work!!! The bathroom was big (bigger than our one at home! But then everything is relative) and sparkling clean. The bed was large and comfortable (two singles pushed together - but the single beds were a good size, not tiny like you sometimes find in hotels). Air conditioning worked very well - to the point we were cold if it was was on 'full blast' - a welcome relief though coming in from the humid heat of August in Rome. The mini-bar is FREE! They give you 2 bottles of water (1 still and 1 sparkling), a can of Coke, a can of Fanta and a carton of juice everyday. This was brilliant - as each morning we took out a bottle of water each and were able to simply refill it at the numerous drinking fountains around Rome for the rest of the day - no need to fork out 2 euros a bottle each time from street vendors. And the water from the fountains is freezing cold! Even in August :) The windows are sound proof - there was some building work going on nearby during the day, and if we were having an afternoon kip (recommended if you are in Rome during August - we did most of our walking in morning and evening) you could not hear a thing with the windows closed. Silent nights every night :) Breakfast in the morning was more than enough to keep us going until dinner time, bar a sneaky gelato in the afternoon ;) There was a wide selection of bread, pastries, cheese, fruit, meat (including boiled eggs), yoghurts, cereals and a small selection of hot food (eggs, sausages etc). Ask one of the lovely, friendly breakfast staff if you want coffee other than Americano and they will make it for you :) The food was constantly replenished, so whether we were down for 8am or 9.30am there was always a full selection available. As for the area, you really are only near the front of Termini and you can avoid the darker streets of that infamous area by simply not going near the actual station and beyond at night. We always felt perfectly safe walking around during both the day and at night. We loved sitting out at the fountain at Piazza della Repubblica (2 mins from the hotel) in the late evening, watching the cars goes by :) On the day we checked out we were able to leave our suitcases at the hotel until the late afternoon before we caught our evening flight - on picking up our suitcases we were offered a towel and the use of the gym shower facilities (which looked very nice - wish I had investigated them during our stay but we had no time) to freshen up before our flights. I want to thank all the staff - the front desk, porters, breakfast staff and cleaning staff for being helpful, friendly and for making our trip the best holiday we've had :D", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStar quality staff\u201d", "Author": "HenryXKnight", "ReviewID": "UR77491015", "Content": "Friendly and attentive front office staff, clean rooms, nice big bed, great shower, very good AC, conveniently located near to Termini and Republicca for bus and train for short journeys to Colosseum, Vatican and Villa Borghese.

We chose this hotel because it was very close to the Termini train station and we were only staying one night in Rome. It was very close to two metro stops and walkable to many sites. It is right next to Santa Maria della Angeli. It is very close to the metro--we walked there easily with two bags and two rolling suitcases. We arrived around noon, and were happy to find the room was ready and they let us check in--we really needed to take a long nap after being jet lagged. The room was rather small, but not unbearably so. The bathroom was also rather small, but we had a huge jacuzzi tub and shower that took up most of the space. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and gave us directions and a map of Rome. There are not a lot of restaurants near this hotel (and most towards Termini are \"touristy\"), so we did find we had to walk around a bit at night to find a nice place (which we did, a few blocks over). there was also complimentary breakfast the next morning--it was average, nothing special. We at some yogurt and croissant, and quickly left to find a good espresso at a cafe. This was an affordable hotel that satisfied our needs for one night in Rome very close to Termini. If you are looking for something with a bit of nightlife, more restaurants, or close to ancient sites, or you have more time to stay in Rome, this might not be the location for you.

We had two rooms: a regular double room, and a \"twin\" room for our kids (their room, with two single beds, was actually slightly larger and had the benefit of a real window in the bathroom). Regarding location, I disagree with those who say this is a \"bad\" location. Admittedly it is not in the center of town, but given the hordes of tourists who invade Rome during the summer, we actually liked being slightly outside the main \"sightseeing\" areas. The hotel is on a quiet street off the main drag, and we found with the combination of subway and buses available at the nearby Termini station, it was extremely easy to get anywhere we wanted to go - and for all the \"main\" touristy areas (Trastevere, Vatican, Piazza Navona, ancient Rome) it was never more than a 15-20 minute trip. Our only disappointment about this particular neighborhood was that there wasn't as much of a concentration of good restaurants as some of the other neighborhoods, so we did travel to eat each night.

Metro is an option, but there was a strike and at any rate, we prefer to walk and explore. There was just too much walking through uninteresting commercial areas that were a bit rundown. Not totally unexpected because it is near a train station and it wasn't our key reason for choosing the hotel. However, if we had more than our brief stay there, I think I would have been disappointed.

They provided good recommendations for local restaurants, as well as other services (banking, laundromat) in the neighborhood.

Simple outside on a small street. The sign is hard to see as it is over 6ft up from the sidewalk level. (not sure why \u2013 they need to lower it) I checked google street view before we arrived \u2013 just remember \u201cgreen shutters that are round on top\u201d. }First Impressions of the lobby \u2013 [above average] - very nice, better than I expected from the pictures online. It is shallow in the front, with rooms going back on each side. Felt like a quality hotel once we stepped inside. }First Impressions of the room \u2013 [above average] - (keep in mind, we got upgraded to the VIP room, since we paid for a superior room). It is what I expected for a quality hotel in the city. Small space, but nice. (more on the bed/bathroom/extras below) The private patio that comes with the VIP room is well beyond expectations. You are thinking to yourself \u2013 oh some 2foot patio to barely stand on \u2013 not in this case \u2013 it is large \u2013 very large \u2013 3 times the size of the room (yes really). But just for the VIP room \u2013 no other rooms have this. All the other items are there \u2013 safe, small tv, refrig, coffer maker. }Room \u2013 The Bathroom \u2013 [average] - medium sized but nice. What you would expect from this level of hotel. This VIP room has a whirlpool bath (we did not use that). The Shower/bath is one unit that takes up half the bathroom. Had a bidet. Note \u2013 there was not tissue/Kleenex in the bathroom (just a little travel size pack). Seemed odd at this level of hotel. Note \u2013 it is a long step down/over the whirlpool bath side \u2013 with not much to hold onto. }Room \u2013 The Bed \u2013 [failure] \u2013 this is unfortunately where this hotel falls down flat. The bed is the usual 2 twins pushed together. Ok fine \u2013 you will be used to this after some time in Europe. (and this was no problem at the hotels we stayed at in Paris and Florence). BUT THIS BED IS ROCK HARD. If you like to sleep on your side \u2013 your arm will be asleep (from lack of blood flow in a few minutes). The first night was very very disappointing. So we asked for options the next morning. I was offered one options, and they said they would make a change. They basically added a small top mattress (more like an outside bench seat pad). This was not much help \u2013 and it created 2 new problems. It was thinner than each side of the bed (so a small bed was now super small \u2013 less than twin). Also, this new mattress had a vinyl cover and they do not use a mattress pad (something to let the air move between you and the mattress). So while your front is cold from the AC, your back is sweating from lack of air flow. I did not sleep for 3 nights. (my wife complained as well) My neck/back was stiff/sore all day from this. For what you are paying \u2013 you expect the bed to be very comfortable \u2013 not perfect \u2013 but comfortable. }Noise \u2013 [average] \u2013 most hotels in Europe are noisy. We could here every foot step on the main stairs as people walked down past our floor. (not sure why they do not close the doors from the room hallways (which are small) to the stairs to cut the noise.) Noise from room to room was low/good. }Heat/Cool \u2013 [average] \u2013 it has the usual +/- dial control you see in europe. So you have to figure out where on the +/- dial you need to set it for day and night. It certainly can make the room cool at night. When the AC kicks on it does make some noise. }Service \u2013 Housekeeping \u2013 [above average] \u2013 they did a good job and did not miss anything. Never intruded. }Service \u2013 Front desk and Concierge \u2013 [average] \u2013 it was good and what I expected from a quality hotel. They are not easy fluent in English at all times at the desk, but you can manage. (hey \u2013 you are in Italy \u2013 and you don\u2019t speak their language \u2013 so just relax) }Service \u2013 Food \u2013 [average] \u2013 we had the included breakfast \u2013 it was good \u2013 Orange juice is made fresh right there (they have a machine \u2013 drop oranges in \u2013 get juice) - if a bit lacking in warm food options. (eggs or toast) }Service \u2013 overall attitude from mgmt through to the staff \u2013 [below average] \u2013 I found the front desk people to be good. We had to talk with the managers (yes 2 different people) about the bed. The first time to ask for help, and then upon checkout when I had really had enough from 3 days of no sleep and wanted them to know they had an issue and I would not recommend them. (I did not want anything from this \u2013 I paid my bill in full \u2013 and just wanted to leave). The desk person at checkout of course called the manager to talk with me. I explained my issue and expectations. To be fair we was trying to do his job, but while I explained and offered advice on how to make things better \u2013 I kept hearing those phrases that tell me they don\u2019t understand the hospitality business mind set: \u201cwe have had good reviews about our beds\u201d \u2013 has he read trip advisor about his hotel \u201cdid you tell us\u201d \u2013 yes \u2013 but as I explained to him, I should not have to tell you \u2013 this is a 4star/quality hotel \u2013 the basics should be good \u2013 only the little things (can I have a different pillow) should need to be requested by the customer. \u201cit is hard since we have to try and make everyone happy\u201d \u2013 this shows they don\u2019t understand - of course you do \u2013 this is your business \u2013 making each customer reasonably happy \u2013 welcome to the services/hotel business. He was trying to explain, but really missing the point. He did pay for our car to the airport \u2013 which was nice \u2013 I did not ask for this and told him it was not necessary \u2013 but he insisted \u2013 so I would like to say Thank You for this. }Little Extras \u2013 [above average] \u2013 )There is a refrigerator in each room, and they put a few drinks in for free each day (coke, orange, water, juice). )Bed slippers for each person. ) There is a power adaptor built into the bathroom wall. Can pick 120 or 230, and it has the us (non grounded) plug. Very handy. }Other Notes \u2013 ) It has 3 PCs with internet in the lobby (for those of us on vacation that do not want to even think about dragging around a blackberry or laptop) ) It has a nice workout room with sauna (we did not use it) ) We were asked to leave our key at the desk when we left, since it had the name of the hotel and room number on it. This was fine. ) As mentioned, it is very close to the ROME Termini train station (just out the front door and across one main street) \u2013 which is very handy. Both for arrival AND for jumping on the metro. (as the 2 main metro lines cross/junction at the Termini) }Would I stay there again? \u2013 NO \u2013 I need my sleep. (which is too bad, as the rest of the place is quality) (they would need to show me the beds were fully replaced \u2013 OR I could pick before I arrived what bed type I wanted \u2013 and I mean a real bed change \u2013 not some mattress on a mattress) }Would I recommend this place to a friend? \u2013 NO (not attaching photos of the nice patio - since I can not recommend)", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent All Around\u201d", "Author": "JM92009", "ReviewID": "UR68320479", "Content": "My family completely enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Diocleziano.

We opted for the hotel shuttle which was a nice van since our flight arrived at night. It saved us the hassle of taking the train to the Termini station or a taxi which has more limited space for baggage. It took about 30 min. to get from the airport to the hotel by car (not much traffic at the time). The hotel is conveniently located on a side street, about a 5 minute walk from the main Termini train/bus/subway station. This side street location made for a nice and quiet stay. We didn't find the hotel area threatening and have often returned to the hotel from Termini late at night. There were a few bums/weirdos around (no different than other areas in Rome) and it's pretty quiet with few people at night but we weren't afraid of trouble finding us. Once at the Termini station, it's a short subway ride to the main city attractions (around 2 stops to the Colosseum and around 7 to the Vatican). The bus system provides a good backup to the subway that doesn't cover all areas of the city (like the Trastevere area which is a good spot for nightlife). We did do a lot of walking in central Rome which isn't very large by comparison to other major cities and attractions are within walking distance if you're wearing a pair of comfortable shoes and travelling light. During our stay, the hotel staff all round were very courteous and helpful. As in many hotels in central Rome, the classic building has been remodeled into a hotel. The hotel looks very well maintained and the rooms are modern/clean. It is a small hotel with about 40 rooms. There isn\u2019t much of a bar and if you\u2019re looking for a good bar/lounge, look somewhere else. Don't expect to find a room the size of a North American hotel. The room is small. The twin beds were more like 1 king bed cut in half and were virtually right next to each other. The bed though was comfortable and I had a good nights rest after a long day walking around Rome. There was a large desk area in the room as well as a good sized closet. Television was nothing to write home about with 1-2 English news channels and the rest in Italian. If I recall, it costs 5 Euros for a PPV movie which were in English and Italian. The minibar had limited items (soft drinks) but all were free and were refilled every day. The best thing about the room was the bathroom which was large by comparison to the bedroom. It was very clean and modern with a toilet, bidet, sink and walk-in shower which was very good and had good hot water pressure. My parents stayed in a superior room which had a nice hot tub and a large balcony. Their bedroom wasn\u2019t much larger than our twin room. The room internet WiFi was free of charge (remember to get the password from the front desk) as well as the internet station in the hotel lobby. The room safe was large enough for small items and was simple to program. My larger laptop didn\u2019t fit in the safe so I handed it over to the front desk who kept it safely during my absence. I haven\u2019t used the fitness center although there is one in the hotel. Breakfast had an OK selection but wasn\u2019t very good in our opinion. The Good: - Location - Staff - Modern/clean hotel/room - Free minibar - Free high speed wireless internet in room - Nice bathroom - Comfy bed The Bad: - Small room - Breakfast All in all, I definitely recommend this hotel which is ideal if you\u2019re planning on spending all day exploring the city, only to come back at night for a nice shower and bed.

The room size is typically of hotels in Europe, but everything is well laid-out so there is no problem. Presumably you are not spending too much time in your room anyway. The bathrooms are clean and spacious, the airconditioning worked really well, the mini-bar had free soft drinks, juices and bottled water, and the hotel provided free internet which we really appreciated. In addition, we got an upgrade, so my husband and I had a huge terrace. Wish we were able to stay longer to really use that space. Although we did not use the small \"gym,\" it appeared well kept and we were able to fill our water bottles with water provided there. The complimentary breakfast was also a big plus -- not really an American buffet, but a lot more than standard Continental fare: scrambled eggs, bacon, cold cuts, cheeses, tomatoes, fresh and canned fruits, pastries ... and cappucino. Considering the prices the hotel charges, I cannot understand the complaints about the breakfast variety. It gave us a great start, and because it opens at 6:45 am, we were able to have breakfast before setting off on our trips outside of Rome. Despite choosing the hotel for its location, I was a bit concerned before our stay based on prior reviews. Yes, the area around Termini is charmless, but definitely safe. In addition, there must have been a major clean-up campaign because the shaded area at the start of Via Gaeta was fine -- nobody hanging around and no smells. A pleasant surprise.

Proximity to Termini - Because our arrival and departure from Rome were both by train, we wanted a hotel within easy walking distance from Termini, so we don't need to pay for taxi. The distance from Termini's front entrance to this hotel was only 300 yards. We knew it will be farther away from most tourist sites, but it didn't matter to us. We didn't want to walk there anyway. We had gotten the Roma Pass, which included 3 days of public transportation, and Termini is a main hub for both public and HOHO buses and the Metro. We were able to save a lot of walking by taking the bus/Metro to everywhere we wanted to visit. We only had to walk at the site and between the nearby sites. For example, we took the Metro to the Spanish Steps, then walked mostly downhill to Piazza Navonna with stops along the way at Prada/Gucci/Dolci...stores (to appease my wife), and visited the Pantheon and the Trevi Fountain. After we had dinner at Navonna, we took the bus back to Termini. If we had stayed somewhere near any of those places, we probably wouldn't have been able to use the public transportation as effectively. 2. A Newer Facility - Call us prejudiced, but we prefer newer or newly refurbished properties. We have heard too many horror stories, and experienced some ourselves, about older properties with the musty smells, creaky floors, questionable A/C, etc. This hotel is only a few years old, so just about everything felt new 3. High Quality Service and Amenities - Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and helpful! The breakfast was wonderfully prepared and ready for us each morning. Unlike what we read about other properties, there were plenty of seating. In the 3 days we stayed there, we always had a choice of tables. They offered scrambled eggs and bacons, pastries/croissants, along with the typical cuts of cheese, meat, and fruits. In the room, they provided daily non-alcoholic drinks in a small refrigerator. They offer all the standard convenience items in the bathroom. They offer free in-room wifi service (started in late June) as well as a public computer in lobby. For those who needs more exercises than walking all day, there's a nicely equiped gym along with a sauna. 4. Good Value - I'm a sucker to good value. The price we booked for a superior room at this hotel can't be beat by any comparable level properties closer to the many tourist sites. If there wasn't a Roma Pass and if the public transportation wasn't so convenient, we wouldn't have bothered. But, since they were, we found this hotel to be the best choice for us! As for the other major downside to its location that other reviewers mentioned - questionable security at nights - we didn't have any problems. It was quieter than most tourist locations, but we never felt unsafe. We had dinners at 2 nearby restaurants (Babbo's and La Lampada).

After searching through many hotels in Rome we decided that this was the best 4*, based on the lovely photos and fabulous reviews. This hotel is nice, but nothing special. Based on other hotels I've stayed in I would definately not rate it as 4* but 3*. The staff were friendly, and spoke fairly good English and the hotel was clean and fairly modern. The room was however quite small and the bathroom was a terrible layout (you had to squeeze round the toilet to get into the shower and to sit on the toilet you virtually had to put your legs inside the shower.) The minibar in the room was free and was refilled each day, however it only contained 1 bottle of water, Coke and Fanta, (no snacks or alcohol.) Although the hotel is close to the station, it isn't in the best of areas. During the day it's fine and an easy walk to the station or bus terminal, (less than 5 minutes,) however at night this area doesn't feel terribly safe. There are a lot of homeless people hanging around, and after dark the area is fairly quiet compared to other parts of the city. The hotel itself is down a fairly secluded side street, and the road leading from it to the station reeked with the smell of urine each day, (not very nice in 36 the degree heat!) Taxi drivers also found the hotel difficult to locate and even when given the street name generally went to the other end of the street, which crosses a more major road. All in all I'd say that this is a nice enough hotel for the price, providing you can afford to get taxis to and from it after dark. However if I went back to Rome I'd stay closer to the Trevi Fountain or Pantheon area, which is more central if you want to explore Rome by foot and be close to the shops and restaurants.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bromley", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Waterloosunset1", "ReviewID": "UR35919738", "Content": "As per the other reviews I would say this is an excellent hotel.

Also the breakfast buffet was really good. The hotel also has a pretty good brand new small gym. I thought the location was fine because it was easy to find just 5 mins from the station and although it was a 20 min walk into the centre it was so easy to jump on a bus at the termini bus station across the road where the buses are regular and go everywhere. It was also just as easy getting back because they all head back to the main station. The trip into the centre takes 5 mins on the bus. I would imagine that for a similar hotel in the centre that the price would be double so unless money is no object I would advise you to stay here.

The staff is just incredibly friendly and helpful. They all were not just nice, but very warm and welcoming.

Where else is the cleaning staff constantly greeting you, and when you leave the breakfast room, someone gives you a nice \"bye, thank you\" through the whole room? Our room was a good size, had good a/c and a comfortable bed. But most of all, it was really clean. My partner is extremely picky when it comes to cleanliness, and she was very happy with this hotel. In fact, it was the cleanest hotel-room we ever stayed in. By chance, we got a superior room, although we booked a normal one, so we got a whirlpool. This was a nice feature, but I would not pay extra for it (although my partner probably would). The breakfast was very good. There is a good selection of stuff to eat, very good fruit juices, and more. Btw, we recognized that some people ordered extra coffee from the staff, so we did too, and got very good cappuccinos instead of the not-so-good coffee at the buffet. The extras offered by the hotel are amazing: every evening, the minibar is filled with just the right amount of free drinks after a hot day in Rome, and there is a selection of shampoo, bathing foam, and much more in the bathroom. We also liked the slippers to stroll around with in your room (or, as some people do, in the breakfast room). The whole hotel is very nicely built. All common rooms are bight, spacious and look and feel valuable. Two cons: First, the location is not perfect. It takes you some minutes to come into the centre by foot or public transport. But its perfectly fine. There are stations at Termini and Repubblica. Tourist buses leave at Repubblica. The neighbourhood was fine for us, we never felt unsafe. All in all, we thought the location is ok, because it may be a bit off, but it is very, very quiet at night. Second con: low water pressure in our room, but not too bad.

Our room on the 1st floor was very spacious and the bathroom was big as well. Our room was kept extremely clean during our entire stay and the cleaning service really did go out of their way to ensure that the room was cleaned before we returned from touring. We enjoyed the free drinks in the refrigerator and really felt that this was a great touch. We were in Rome during a heat wave and there was nothing better than coming back to our room after a long day of touring and have cold drinks waiting for us that we didn\u2019t have to pay for at the end of our stay. The free breakfast was the best we had in all of Italy. After almost 2 weeks eating croissants, it was great to have scrambled eggs, bacon and toast. They also had hard boiled eggs, cereals, fruits, cakes, croissants, small rolls, salami etc. Their American coffee was also the best we had during our trip. The location of the hotel was excellent. It\u2019s less than a 5 minute walk to the Stazione Termini which we used everyday to take the metro to the major attractions. Not once during our entire stay did we feel unsafe. The area is not dangerous, but like any major city you need to be aware of your surroundings and just be cautious when walking at night. The hotel is also very close to two great restaurants: La Famiglia and Babbo\u2019s. We ate at La Famiglia three times for lunch and Babbo\u2019s three times for dinner. La Famiglia is not a tourist trap, in fact its patrons are mostly all locals and the food is typical Roman cuisine.

The hotel was only a short walk from the Termini station, so although we carried quite a lot of luggage, there was no need for a taxi. Moreover, the hotel's vicinity to sights like piazza navona and the spanish steps could of course be better. Most of the sights are within walking distance though, and if your feet are tired, the metro is always an option. The stations closest to Hotel Diocleziano is Termini and Piazza della Repubblica. Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly faces, the piccolo helped us with our luggage and showed us to our room. We stayed in room 205, which was a twin room with separable beds. The room was just the right size, and because of tje high ceeling, it did not feel claustrophobic in any way. The minibar was free of charge, but only contained soft drinks and bottled water. Nevertheless, a nice geisture. One thing that must be mentioned when reviewing this hotel, is their breakfast. Italian hotels normally offer a very limited breakfast, but in Diocleziano we got a full continental breakfast with scrambled eggs and bacon every morning. This made the start of our busy days in rome so much better. Bravo! For our departure, we decided to book a taxi to the airport in order to avoid the stress of termini station and the leonardo express train. However, the reception staff had a better idea: For just a few \u20ac extra, they could offer us a car service that was supposed to be both safer and more convinient than a taxi. This turned out to be just right. When we was checked out the morning of departure, there was a black mercedes and a nicely dress chaffeur waiting for ous outside the hotel. This service dotted the i and crossed the t of our stay in rome. If something were to be critisized, I can say that there could have been WiFi hotspots in the rooms. Thank you for a delightful stay!

The buffet breakfast includes several meats, cereals, eggs and bacon, pastries, coffee, and cappuccinos (upon request). The hotel does offer internet access via two terminals in the lobby; my only suggestion would be for Hotel Diocleziano to consider installing wireless internet, which they could charge customers for. Also, upon our second stay, the concierge and staff remembered us! We were quite suprised at this. Also, there is a really wonderful restaurant around the corner named Babbo's Pizzeria Steak and Fish (Via Volturno 9/11/13) that had some really wonderful food at very affordable prices (several fish dishes were under 10 Euros).

Rome is a busy and noisy 24/7 city, so I wanted to stay somewhere close enough to the centre but not IN the centre - the Diocleziano fits the bill well. The hotel is 4 stars and felt it: air-conditioned rooms; generous beds; free mini-bar stocked with bottled water and soft drinks (updated daily!); courteous and friendly staff. The breakfast is included and is self-service. It comprises tea, coffee, selection of juices, toast, cereals, yoghurt, cold ham/salami, cheese and tomatoes. The selection was great and replenished often. The breakfast room is spacious and you could eat what you liked and as much as you liked. The hotel has a bar but we never used it. Our room was neither huge nor small, but was certainly big enough for a couple in a capital city (double bed, ensuite, TV). It had air-conditioning (controlled by us) and apparently we stayed in the hottest May in Rome for 200 years! Daily temps hit 30C, 32C and 29C so the air-con was a must. The hotel area is fine even though it is not in the centre of the city. There are plenty (10-15) restaurants within a 5 minute walk (2 literally around the corner, 1 min away) so there is enough choice for a short break. There were no downsides. Yes, Rome is noisy, but that's to be expected. But we had double-glazed windows so the noise was not a problem at night. Keeping the aircon on all night was noisy but if you switched it off the room because too hot - probably not an issue if you travel when the days aren't 32C! The hotel is 5 mins from the Republica metro or about a 30 min walk to the Colisseum, eg via Via Cavour. The staff were friendly and all spoke English. The hotel is good value for money (\u00a3550 for 3 nights) though it would be even better if the Pound to Euro wasn't so poor at the moment. We didn't try any of the hotel facilities so can't comment. For a longer break than 3 days you *could* consider a more central location but then it would be noisier at night.

Now i'm on tripadvisor searching for a hotel for my upcoming summer holiday i want to take the opportunity to thank the staff and the hotel because they deserved it. When i'm reading the reviews which are posted the last weeks i'm happy to see that nothing has changed. Unfortunately also not the position 16 in the rating which was the same when we where visting Rome, to be honset this should be much higher. The Hotel rooms are really perfect, nice quit airco well maintained and modern with a very nice bed and of course the free minibar which is a very warm welcome when you enter you room after a long day exploring the city. Termini station is only a few hundred meters away which makes the location perfect. Connection to the metro and bus can not be better. You can buy a ticket for 7 days for subway (metro), bus and tram for 11 Euro per person at the small shops at the bus stand. When you take the bus at the evening to go to the several romantic areas in Rome, it takes you only ten minutes and till deep in the night you can come back to the hotel, which is by the way in a quit street without traffic noise The staff is very helpfull and when you ask for a nice restaurant they will not send you to one which is known to tourists but to the one which they like themselves. In this way you will expierence the nice romantic parts of rome which makes the evenings one of them which will stay in your memories for ever. Thanks again for everything and i hope you will be number 1 because you and the hotel really deserve it.

Not knowing the city, I wanted just the right location in a good part of town. After hours and hours of surfing and reading reviews, I came across the Hotel Diocleziano. I read nothing but good reviews and it was located just across from the Termini, which I thought was a plus. The hotel was very unassuming on the outside, but when we walked in the front door, I was amazed. It was beautiful. Brand new. The breakfast was incredible, with eggs and bacon, plus all of the usual continental offerings. The room we were in was large and the bathroom was larger than mine at home, again all brand new and decorated beautifully. After reading horror stories in other reviews about the size of the rooms and bath, I was very pleasantly surprised. If the weather had cooperated, it would have been a walk from most attractions, but as it was, we booked tours through the hotel. Now here is where it really gets good. We booked a private car transfer from the aiport based on recommendations of the staff before we arrived. That was the best decision we made the whole trip. Only 99 euros round trip and the driver was waiting for us with a sign (even though our flight was delayed by one half hour). Then the tours we booked, which were wonderful, each agreed to deliver us to the hotel after. On 3 different trips this did not happen. They put us out fairly close, but especially the first time when we didn't have a clue where we were, it was very scary. The manager and staff got in touch with the tour company on 2 different occasions trying to straighten it out. We eventually cancelled the last tour since it was at night and we didn't want to chance it, even though the hotel manager had gone to bat for us once again, at that point I didn't trust the tour company. The hotel even went so far as to write a letter to the head of customer service of the tour company and in turn the tour company offered us a partial refund after we got home. Now that is customer service. I would recommend Hotel Diocleziano to anyone travelling to Rome.

We wanted to stay in Rome proper and not somewhere in the outskirts, but also did not want to pay too much. I read the reviews on the Diocleziano on Tripadvisor and went by those suggestions. As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is close to the main train station and is easy to get to from both airports. It is in easy walking distance to the main sights of the city. It is situated not quite in the city center, more on the edge of it. I was quite happy that I had chosen the Diocleziano. It is an excellent hotel for the price: clean, comfy, friendly and safe. As mentioned, for sights and food one has to walk between ten and fifteen minutes into the city. There is no restaurant or snack place at the corner. Although I do recall seeing a couple of snack places close by, I do not remember whether they were open at night. The amenities in the hotel were excellent. The beds were good. I tend to get back aches with most mattresses. I had no problems here. There was a desk, a small tv that had the regular Italian TV channels plus a German and a Spanish TV channel. The bathroom was very spacious. Our room, however, had the bathtub in a corner with shower stall walls installed on the tub. It was a little difficult to get into the tub for a shower. I think for somebody with hip or knee problems, this might be a little problematic. Breakfast was included in the price. The little restaurant downstairs was nice, with plenty of food. I think they serve breakfast until ten thirty in the morning, which is nice if you want to sleep in. The girl cleaning the tables and filling the food trays was a little overworked one day because she was alone that morning - the other days, there were two of them - and we had to wait for a few minutes to get a table cleared. My mother, however, is rather easy going, she started to clear the table that she wanted by herself, which got us immediate attention and the table was cleared and laid within a matter of minutes. The hotel offers a car service to the airport for a fixed price, which, if you prefer going by cab, could be a life saver. The traffic in Rome is so bad that it might take you a few hours standing in traffic to get to an airport. Paying by the meter would be prohibitively expensive in that case. We took the airport bus from and to Ciampino which arrives at and leaves from Termini, the main train station. This is a good low budget option, but we also got stuck in traffic. Make sure you leave way ahead of time when flying out, otherwise you'll miss your flight. All in all, I would recommend the hotel to \"normal\" travelers, families, regular travelers without party or romantic aspirations, families with kids and similar people. It's not a party place and it's not close to party places, it is not overly romantic, but it is excellent value for the price and very comfortable.", "Date": "January 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cPreferred Hotel Diocleziano to Westin Excelsior\u201d", "Author": "CardsFan59", "ReviewID": "UR23725665", "Content": "My daughters (ages 20 and 16) and I stayed one week in May 2008.

What set this hotel apart, however, was the extraordinary service we received beginning the first day. From the General Manager down, every employee was helpful and kind. Alitalia lost one of our bags, and the staff kept in communication with the airline and provided me daily e-mail updates. The recommendations for restaurants were superb and included several that were within walking distance, very reasonably priced, with outstanding food. One experience in particular exemplifies the level of service we received. I wanted to purchase a vase from a nearby shop. The vendors spoke no English. The GM helped me negotiate the price and researched shipping options for me. He then asked one of his staff to accompany me to Poste Italiano and handle the insurance and shipping. Of course the vase broke in transit. When Poste Italiano denied my claim, I wrote it off as a life lesson. The GM did not. He prosecuted the claim for several months on my behalf and recovered the money I paid for the vase as well as for the shipping. When I offered to split the proceeds with him for his substantial effort, he politely declined and wire-transferred the full amount to my account. I have stayed previously at the Westin Excelsior.

It only took us 10mins walking - with cases - from Hotel room to a seat on the Leonardo express. Its location down a quiet side street meant you had the feeling of being in the coutryside! In fact the air conditioning was all one could hear unless you really tried! We walked everywhere and it is ideally situated so to do but if you wanted public transport it is all to hand at Termini with its trains, metro and buses. Only two minor points: 1) No in-room tea/coffee making facilities, quite surprising for a Hotel of this obvious quality. 2) Its secluded location can make it annoying to find, very poorly led by myself it took us about half an hour! So a tip for when you go - stand with your back to Termini and across the main roads to the front are the old Roman baths.

I had booked a superior double room for myself and my husband, which had a huge (two beds together) double bed, very comfortable, a large bathroom with huge jacuzzi tub/shower (one person only in jacuzzi, it's not an American one), ample storage for all our clothes and places to put cases out of the way. Shower was superb. Good large free safe for valuables. Internet was a deal at 16 euro for four days. Every one of the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Immaculately clean and very quiet indeed, no noise from within the hotel or outside. Free minibar with water and soda. Room is small, but we were out most of the time. Nice breakfast as described by others. The area around the hotel is typical of other cities near main railway stations, but Via Gaeta is a small secluded street. We did walk through the Piazzo dei Populo nearby at around 9.30 one evening. Lots of people there, it was like a street party which initially looked intimidating. However, everyone there was interested only in each other, not in us and it was fine. We did not feel threatened or vulnerable at all in Rome. I see more homeless in Chicago. There is litter around the place, but it's all around Rome, which is a messy city. I will stay at the Hotel Diocleziano next time I'm in Rome, it's a great find and you get full value for money.

We booked this hotel mainly because of all the good reviews, price and location. We landed at Ciampino and easily found our way to Termini Train Station. From Termini it was a 5 min walk with luggage, not far at all. We got there mid-day, so we didn\u2019t notice any of the \"seedy\" bits people have been talking about, it just seemed like a wonderful/normal neighbourhood. The first impression of the hotel was great; friendly and welcoming reception, receptionist and \"bellboy\" who brought our luggage to our room. The room (double standard) was spotless; Big and lovely room, overlooking Via Gaeta, lovely big bed and closet. Bathroom was big and spotless, but as others have mentioned, they should change the hanging on the shower-doors, as you basically walk into the toilet getting out of the shower unless you are \"petite\" The room is 100% soundproof, the easy way to check this is by opening and closing the windows to the street :) Neither me nor my boyfriend agree with the \"negative\" comments about the neighbourhood and nearby streets. The street and the area in general felt perfectly safe, no threatening people, no litter etc. We found the hotels location to be absolutely perfect, 2 underground-stations within roughly 3 mins walk (Termini and Repubblica) and Termini itself (starting point for several buses and trains), you can easily get anywhere from Termini, and it makes it easy to find the way back should you get lost. (As Termini is the main station in the city) The hotels location was in the middle of everything, super-easy access to every major and smaller sight, not that far of a walk either. We will definitely choose this hotel next time we are in Rome (Because we will come back!). The breakfast was excellent, nice and fresh bread, cheese, ham, tomatoes, cereal, egg & bacon (nice and thin bacon), yoghurt (the yoghurt is wonderful!), fruit,tea & coffee(the cappucino was excellent!) etc. Basically everything you would want for a good breakfast. The free mini-bar was a lovely touch :) We had a late flight going back to London, so the hotel was nice enough to give us a late check out and store our luggage for us (they locked it up, nice and safe) . On our last day in Rome we got back to the hotel abit too early, but the hotel had a lovely waiting area with a sofa, some chairs and a nice flat screen TV (right next to the gym). The gym looked wonderful, and the 2 changing rooms/showers (had a quick look to change into traveling-clothes) were huge! The shower (one of those fancy huge types, with different types of settings where the water comes out) looked amazing, wish we didn\u2019t have everything packed, otherwise we would have tried it :) (Nice tip for other ones returning late, if you have a towel handy/on top of your luggage you can shower and change before the journey home. It does get \u201cquite\u201d hot in the summer) All in all we don\u2019t have a single bad word to say about this hotel, as it exceeded our expectations, and was very good value for money. (We paid 412 Euro for 4 nights, standard double for 2 adults, notice we went in the hot off-season August) The main receptionist (cant remember his name) was also very friendly and helpful, he probably gets the same \"tourist questions\" day after day, but that didnit affect his mood/helpfulness one bit :) Will definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers :)", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "The-Mimmo", "ReviewID": "UR19359206", "Content": "Hotel Diocleziano is located within walking distance of the train station metro and local bus station.

We had read many reviews on Trip Advisor and the reviews sounded fairly consistent, so we decided to give it a shot. Thanks for letting us share our opinions on the following aspects of the stay. Staff: Each staff member we met was friendly and very helpful. We loved Anna at the front desk! The exceptional level of service would stand out anywhere, but it was especially appreciated and noticed in Italy, where we sometimes experienced service standards that were not what we had hoped for. The team at Hotel Diocleziano was helpful with everything: suggesting places to eat, helping with tour reservations, arranging car for the airport, etc. Facilities: The area where the hotel is located is a little run down and there are some homeless people who live close by across from the train station. However, the location is convenient, very close to transportation and the hotel itself is spotless. The common areas are small and the elevator is miniscule (three people max, with no luggage) but everything sparkled and nothing was worn or dirty. The dining area (free breakfast included!) was roomy and pleasant. The room was small and we had four bags; there wasn\u2019t enough room to put them without stacking them on top of each other. There is no bureau to store clothes, so you have to live out of your luggage if your clothes do not hang up. The bathroom was also small, but had a large Jacuzzi-type tub and shower in it. I would have preferred a regular shower and more floor space in the room or bath. However, everything was clean and well-maintained so the room was very nice, aside from the size. On the main floor, there is a small fitness room as well as two computers for internet access. Internet rates are very reasonable at 8 euro per day if you have your own laptop. Highlights: The location is great; very close to the subways and buses and within easy walking distance of many of the sights of the city. The breakfast was very nice and when we had an early tour, Anna made us a boxed breakfast to take with us. There is a free mini-bar in the room with a daily supply of water and soda. Areas for improvement: I really liked most things about this hotel, so these are just a couple of small suggestions. \uf0a7 Supply washcloths in the bathroom. \uf0a7 Provide more than one bar of soap so one can be kept at the sink and the other in the shower. The shower was so big that if the soap was left in the holder, you had to climb into the shower to get it. \uf0a7 Another couple of English-language channels on the TV. CNN and BBC news are very repetitive, but I did get hooked on the Italian game show \u201cJackpot\u201d. Overall impression: Compared to other rooms I\u2019ve stayed in while visiting Rome, this was probably the smallest, but it was also the cleanest and newest. The entire staff takes hospitality to heart and made me feel like a valued guest. The management of this hotel has done an excellent job of training and developing the service team. The price seemed very reasonable considering the quality of the facility and the level of service provided. A bigger room would have been nice, but we didn\u2019t spend that much \u201cawake\u201d time in the room anyway. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend who was looking for a great location with outstanding service.

We were automatically upgraded to a room with it's own veranda, which was nice, but it looked less safe than if we'd been up on a higher floor with nowhere for thieves and lowlifes to sneak into the place. (Don't worry, there are surveillance cameras to scare them off.) The mini bar was stocked with sodas and water (which we could imbibe free of charge) and the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub big enough to hold two or more (!) people. We were disappointed that there was a charge for internet service and even local TV was on a pay-per-view system. The highlight of our stay was breakfast service which came as part of the hotel stay. The breakfast room was large, bright, and cheery, and the kitchen staff was friendly. The selection of food and drink was varied and pleasing. It's a nice place to stay if you want to be close to the train station, but I wouldn't recommend it for an extended stay in Rome. If you're only looking for swanky hotel accomodations, this place is the way to go, but we prefer the cozier and quirkier family owned and operated hotels.", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bean, Kent", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "heinzBean_Kent", "ReviewID": "UR13934701", "Content": "This hotel was just perfect for a city break.

We have been to Rome many times and always stayed in the Termini area for the convience. In the past we stayed at the \"old world\" hotels, the Bailey and the Mecente Palace. Both were elegant and old. The Mecante recently began showing its age. The Dioclezaino is neither elegant or old, but a new modern hotel that is clean and very nice. Don't stay here if you want the Hilton, but stay here for a good central location, spotless rooms, and friendly and aknowledgeable staff. The breakfast is very good, the free mini bar is nice, although personally I would prefer a coffee pot. We arrived very early and were given rooms immediately. Our friends who have never been to Rome loved the hotel and would also stay here again on their return visits. The only down side to the hotel is the very short walk from Termini. Although we never felt unsafe, there is a quarter block of the walk that really stinks. We walked in the street to avoid the smell which is really only on the sidewalk area. It would not deter us from staying here again. A few tips. The hotel offers a car service to and from the airport. It is pricey, but negotaible. There were 4 of us, and we negotiated a rate only slightly above the taxi rate. Taxis are a hassle here, as the drivers do not want to accept the law mandating a flat rate of 40 euro. The amount you have to fight to get them to accept this rate is not worth the effort. It is just easier to take the train.

Their attention to detail was impressive, as they knew our names on check-in before we even said a word. Bathroom: Although it does have an awkward layout as other reviewers have noted, the bathroom was large and with modern amenities - a bidet, a full/half flush toilet and a spacious hot shower. The hotel stocked the complimentary beverages in the fridge daily, cleaned all towels even when they weren't placed on the floor, and on the second day even provided a cup for our toothbrushes! I particularly liked that the towel bars and tiles were heated, making a shower on a cool winter's day feel like an spa experience. Room: The bed was queen sized and firm. The windows were shuttered and you could open both glass and shutter and lean out. I would be worried if I had children with me, but as I didn't, it was great to have the fresh air. Although BBC news was the only English channel on television, English pay-per-view movies were available. Location: This hotel is 2 blocks from Termini station, which has a bus terminal, shuttles to the airports, the metro and national/international trains. Unless you are a wary traveller and/or look Italian (my blond husband was targeted by pickpocketers on the Metro), I recommend taking less crowded buses instead of the Metro since buses from around the city can be found that go to Termini. Breakfast: included breakfast was varied and tasty. It inluded coffee, juice, and milk, breakfast breads, cereal, yogurt, scrambled eggs and meat among other things.

The A/C is very efficient, with the hotel having this modern system of having a computer card activate all electricty, thus saving energy. I would suggest you take a room facing the back.

It was literally a stone's throw away!) We found the staff to be absolutely wonderful -- they were very helpful in recommending restaurants to exactly match our desires, even calling to make sure space was available. They also had the ability to arrange tours efficiently and knew the best gelaterias! The hotel was peaceful on a quiet street in a safe area. Our room was comfortable and nicely decorated and had a beautiful large bath. The water and soda that were replenished daily in the room's refrigerator were welcome refreshments! The hotel breakfast was excellent in a bright, cherry setting. The cappuccino was the best I've ever had. My husband really enjoyed the ham. We are both walkers, and enjoyed trekking from the hotel to the Roman Forum, Colosseum, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona and many other places along the way. The architecture is too splendid to view from a bus (plus it enable us to make frequent gelato stops!) Relatives joined us at the hotel on the second day, and we spent the third walking to all of the same places, but did invest in a guided tour of the Colosseum and the Ancient Ruins -- it helped us to better understand what we were viewing. The Santa Maria degli Angeli is very close to the hotel, a small part of the enormous Baths of Diocletian that was converted with Michelangelo's help into one of Rome's grandest churches.

The immediate vicinity had a local feel to it as well - with a guy who runs a cafe fixing my mate's sunglasses for free after getting out his bag of tools [maybe a lot of tourists have problems with their glasses in his cafe?].

Duirng my stay some people were having drinks at the bar at night and i had to ask the porter to get them to keep the nosie down to get some sleep. That said there was only about 8 people in the bar and were not behaving excessively, it was just the room was too close to the bar. When i asked to move to another room, there was no attempt made to accomadate me.

Most taxi drivers didn't know where hotel was so ask for Hotel Fiamma on Via Gaeta, hotel is next door. Getting there - You can use Terravision coach from Ciampino airport which is cheapest option, the coach stops at the Train station and the hotel is 5 minutes walk. As you get off the coach the hotel is located at the North end of the train station, across the road next to the Dioclezian Baths. If there are more that two of you travelling you can get a taxi for around 50 euros. Hotel - Very nice, newly refurbished. Very clean. Free minibar with water and soft drinks. All usual facilities, TV, safe, hairdryer, but no trouser press or iron. Hotel does have laundry facilities. Breakfast was usual standard continental fare. Staff helpful and professional, especially Matteo. Drinks in the bar were expensive but other than that, and the average breakfast, you could not fault this hotel for the price (We booked through hotel's website). Around the hotel - plenty of restaurants at reasonable prices, there is a nice restaurant called Famiglia just down the road on the right as you turn left from the hotel. The hotel will reserve a table for you, recommended as it is quite busy. Sightseeing - we bought bus tour tickets on line for the green bus tour. This is good way of seeing Rome and you can hop on and around the city at the main sites. We got a two day ticket which didn't cost much more than a one day ticket. The queues for St Peter's and the Vatican Museums (Sistine Chapel) are much smaller if you go mid afternoon. We also booked the Angels and Demons Tour (based on the Dan Brown book) this was an excellent way of seeing most of the main sites and gave you a lot of information not relating to the book too. The views from the top of the Castel Sant'Angelo are stunning. Rome is the most beautiful city with stacks of history.
