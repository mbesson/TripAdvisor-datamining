We always love bali, and visited there many times. So we decided to get it over with the sad memory and starts a new one.Our wonderful journey starts like this, as soon as we arrived, there were staff from the bali-concierge welcomed us and helped with the visa on arrival and baggage reclaims. While we were waiting at the lounge to chill out and have a refreshing drink. It would save you about 30 minutes and not being waited in a long queue without air-con. We were then greeted by the hotel representative and brought us to the nice Mercedes Benz, with a lovely car-seat prepared for my son. Served with a cold minty towel and a very tasty chocolate truffle. We were addressed by name by the guards when the car enter the gate and i was given a beautiful frangipani. When we arrived the hotel lobby, all the baggages are well taken care of and we could have a sip of ice tea and stunned by how nice the hotel is. The suite is very cosy with a large balcony and a lovely walk-in closet and with plentiful mineral water bottles are provided in the room. We just relaxed in the room for the first day, and ordered room services for most of the day also, with a 15 months can't sit still baby is not easy to eat in a restaurant. The food is tasty, pricey as expected but quite a bit small in portion, the main course somehow look like the size of tapas. And i guess they should put on more choices in the menu. Also the prices of food at the gourmet deli(where they serve some light food)being marked up too high and again in small portion. But the ice cream are totally yummy.On the next day, we started our day with a very sumptuous breakfast as described by the hotel. They have a buffet area for cheese, salads and bread, the waiters would bring around some freshly baked croissants, smoothies, salmon roll, bloody mary, bagel with cold cuts and many more and are different everyday. While u can order from the menu from oysters , foie gras with fried eggs, my favourite egg benedict, sushi, dim sum ( not quite taste right for me as a chinese),nasi goreng,chicken porridge (for my baby),oatmeal and can't list them all. They all tasted as great as it looks from the outside, with the relaxing music and the view overlooking the whole resort. It's by far the most delicious breakfast or brunch i have ever had, but also the services is impeccable. We were so filled up so could only feel like to have appetite again when it's about 3 to 4 pm. All staff are very well mannered and i was impressed by their English standard too. Every staff would greet and smile when they see you, for any requests , they would respond 'yes,certainly,my pleasure, u feel very much respected.We payed extra to stay for the last two nights at the Gardenia VIlla, after we've seen all other type of rooms by the staff on the first day. We decided to have our full indulgence in this stay. They all looks lovely, the suite with plunge pool is on the ground floor where the indoor size is about the same as the suite we have stayed, while they've a plunge pool and bale in the garden. It's actually quite nice that u can have the outdoor feeling, however, it's opposite where the sun is, so , it's quite dark and u cannot enjoy sunbathing. While the lagoon Villa and gardenia villa have a huge living room , oversized bathroom , beautiful garden, very comfortable bale, butler's quarter , kitchen, extra bathroom,but a however small in proportion's closet. The former one has a nice lagoon view where u can access the main pool easily, however, it's with much less privacy. The gardenia villa where we first had was absolutely too warm inside, they have sent someone to fix it, not really worked out. After two hours, the room had not cool down So we requested to change to other villa, and then they prepared two villas for us to choose whichever one we feels it's cooler. Very much appreciated how their arrangement. But problem seemed to come again, the tele in the living room was only in black and white . The staff couldn't get it fix after like 30 minutes, they decided to replace by another tele.Again, impressed they have done it this way. You know, it could happen on some hotels would just apologise and let it be. The main pool is very nice and quiet , they've staff to clean my sunglasses as well, however, the stone inside the pool is very rough and is dark in color which u would only noticed it after hurting by it, which left me wounded. And i have a lot of mosquito bites just by sitting at the sun bench in the beach at sunset for 5 minutes, seems to be still itchy now. And would suggest to have a kids room where children can around there and parents can have a quiet time in spa or a nice dinner. We've received a beautiful cake for our anniversary, thought if we might be upgraded when check in ,but no (greedy),haa. It's the thought that count but can make it more personal by putting a small note with it. The butler services was a good experience, u feel like being served and pampered at all time. The house keeping was also immaculate too, they tidied up the villa very efficiently. On the day of departure, we had our breakfast in the villa, for the services fee of 20USD, while we can be relaxed and wear the PJs to enjoy it and baby could sleep longer in bed. We had numerous of choices as if we have eaten at the restaurant, they delivered sharply on time and i think it's well worth the surcharge.We were then picked up by the butler to check out at the lobby, u can also have it done in the room or villa, but it's actually easier for both parties. Noted,they don't accept US dollars printed before 1996 or have chips. And sadly, we had to say goodbye to this beautiful hotel , the staff were there to show their warmest farewell with a bow. With a nice and comfy ride to the airport, even my cheeky monkey took a nap . And the hotel representative were there to help with your check in. He called the airline to have our boarding passes ready before we arrived,impressive. We had a unforgettable experience, the most luxury one at all time, and hubby said it's the best one we have had for the 50 trips we have made. The services standard is so high and flawless that i think only the Peninsula in HK is comparable but still not better. Love this hotel would definitely return soon , and it's a good time to visit where the hotel is still nice and quiet and staff are high in spirit. Hope they can maintain it well and be the best in Bali. And thank you for giving us a new happy memory of bali too.", "Date": "Dec 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR627950324", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "IreneY105"}, {"Content": "A Dream Come True Impeccable service.

There are some kinks that need to be worked out. I think the menu for the in room dining needs to be reviewed and also the experience of their staff.

The pool villas are situated right on a pool lagoon that runs through most of the resort, and kids would love being able to get up and just jump into the pool lagoon. There is also another pool with an underwater bar. The pool suite was great with an outdoor plunge pool, Thai outdoor dining platform, Boffi-like egg bathtub, and toiletries by Remede. Would have been perfect if there was just a little more privacy when we were in our private outdoor courtyard which was part of our suite- people walking by outside would be able to peer in and we didn't feel like we had as much privacy as we would have liked. Service is good- the staff try very hard to please, and we were very happy with our personal butler, and the concierge. A few minor cons: 1) We wished there were more Balinese or Indonesian dishes on the menu, and 2) St Regis not the best place to watch the sunset. We caught it at Seminyak.

Our transport to the hotel was a beautiful new Mercedes, and this was just the beginning of the pampering.

Breakfast was truly fantastic, with most dishes freshly prepared when ordered. Servers and Chefs were constantly passing by our table with yummi goodies for us to try, while we were waiting for the food we had ordered. The hotel also has a Deli and another restaurant on the beach, which serves a lighter menu for lunch and a more fine-dining menu for dinner.

The breakfast is a definate highlight, with a large selection cooked fresh to order. Our only complaints would be in relation to the limited selection within the Minibar (although supplies are available from the Gourmand Deli), the lack of a conveniently located PowerPoint in the Bathroom for drying hair and the lack of water sports equipment on the beach (an area the management must improve as good watersports facilities are essential for a beach resort) .
