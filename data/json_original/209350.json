I was trying to find a reasonably priced place to stay as I was booking this sort of last minute and most places in town were either booked or out of my price range. The resort looks like and appears to have been a decent place years ago and the ownership has neglected the place as it is pretty run down. The place was clean on the outside but on the inside the rooms had old carpeting and the bed seemed old as well. The room we stayed in, room 112 had a slight roach problem. This was a problem. I asked for a different room and was told they were booked as it was st patricks day weekend and spring break. Asides from the roach problem the continental breakfast was served in the tv room and that room was not very clean either. Luckily I packed my own bug spray and repellent. This place would be great if the ownership put the money into it and give it a makeover.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westfield, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cweb site needs updating\u201d", "Author": "Christine G", "ReviewID": "UR126111276", "Content": "Don't book this place according to web site.

We picked it because it was affordable and had good reviews, or so we thought. We were told that check in was at 3:00pm, which seemed fine. And after waking up at 5am and walking around Key West all day, all we wanted to do was check in, and go lounge by the pool. So we arrived just after 3pm and checked in. We all went up to the room to discover; none of the beds were made, there was still trash on the floor, and there were no towels, toiletrees, etc. We saw the maids cart a few doors down, and figured she wasn't done. But like I said, check in was 3pm and it was after that. We went back to the office, and they told us it should have been ready and to wait while they could see if there was another room avaliable. It took 1.5 hours before they told us that our original room was now ready. Tired we took the original room and walked back to the room. When we opened the door to the room, it was over 100 degrees in the room. We turned on the AC and the ceiling fan, hoping after we came back from the pool it would be cool. In all the paperwork for the hotel it said they provided towels at the tiki bar by the pool for guests. We went down to the pool and there was no one at the tiki bar. We waited for over 15mins and no one came. One person in our group had to go back to the room to get our own towels. We were in the pool for 1/2 hour before anyone showed up at the tiki bar. We later lounged out by their beach (the only good part of the hotel) for about 2 hours. When we went back up to our room, it had cooled down some. Instead of 100 it was now 90. The AC was working, we could feel cold air coming in, but the room wouldn't cool down. We were leaving to go out to a few bars, so we figured, \"hot day, its just taking a little longer to cool the room\" and proceeded to get ready. I went to take a shower. The bathroom had tissues all over the floor, once that was cleaned up, I looked at the faucet (which side was hot, which was cold). I turned it to cold (remember the room is 90 or so) and very very hot water came out and the shower head was pointed outside of the tub. The floor became a large pool of hot water before I had a chance to turn it off. After that fiasco, we went out. We came back several hours later, to a still 90 degree room. By then the office had been closed and there was nothing we could do. The AC was useless and the ceiling fan didn't throw off any wind at all. I pulled the duvet off my bed and started to get read to try and sleep when my friend discoved, the maid (who we waited 1.5 hours to finish cleaning our room) and never put sheets on her bed. They put the duvet cover on all nice and neat, but not the sheets!!!! I had to give my top sheet to her to put down of the matress. With the heat and the horriable bed, needless to say it was not a pleasent night. We woke up early and went to their \"continetal breakfast\", not very good, a few muffins, bagels, and cereal. No fresh fruit. When we checked out I complained about the conditions that we had to stay in that we paid for. Needless to say $40 was knocked off the bill because of the 1.5 hour delay but not for the no sheets on the bed, and sauna like room, and dirty bathroom. We should have been paid to stay there!

After reading mixed reviews, I was a little nervous but we went anyway. I know that some people have much higher expectations than I do, so we took the chance. We arrived on check-in day at 1:30 PM, check in is not until 3:00 PM, but our room was ready and they got us right in. The rooms are very nice and big. We had a basic room with king canopy bed, bathroom and a kitchenette. Room also had a balcony overlooking the pool. It is not a new hotel, so yes, the room does need some remodeling work. New paint, carpet, etc. But everything worked fine (TV, A/C, plumbing) and we were not dissapointed at all. Only had one incident of our room key not working, but we took it to the office and it was immediately replaced. You just have to keep it away from all cell phones, wallets, credit cards, etc. which is what we did after it was replaced. The pool has a Tiki Bar that was open from about noon to 6 the entire weekend. Decent drinks, average price. It's nice to have that available at the pool. The beach area is nice, lots of chairs and shade on the water. You can watch the sunset from here in comfort. Continental breakfast was basic, but free so who's complaining? WiFi is not in all rooms, but you can get in the common room and some people were able to access by the pool. If you are looking for a \"fancy\" hotel and lots of amenities, don't stay here. But if you are looking for a comfortable place to stay, away from the partying but not to far, this is it. We were able to take a cab to Mallory Square for $10 with tip, same on the way back from Duval Street. Cost of the cab really beats a DUI. We really enjoyed our stay for the price, and would definitely come back here when we return to Key West.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cHorrible, horrible and never again\u201d", "Author": "SandraEN", "ReviewID": "UR114184774", "Content": "We decided to stay there because of the cheap \"romantic getaway package\" that is offered on the website\".

The wall near the \"bar\" were filthy, sink was leaking, plug didn't work for coffee pot and the same for the bathroom. We waited 2 days for them to replace the plugs. The air condititioner leaks onto the TILE FLOOR on the patio...beware of trying not to fall and were cracked with water underneath.

There were only enough towels for one person and the hangers did not fit in the brackets in the cupboard. In the evening we went to check out the Tiki bar by the pool. It was deserted.

The shower in the room could not be adjusted and only scalding hot water came out of it. Wednesday - Went to get breakfast in the breakfast room. Fairly basic continental style selection of food and drink. Only sofas and armchairs available to sit on inside. If you wanted to sit and eat your breakfast you had to go and sit at the outside table and chairs. Room had a funny smell because of the aircon I think. That same evening the toilet in the room overflowed. Tried to call front desk only to find that reception closed at 10pm. Very bizarre!! Had to mop up the mess (luckily only water) with towels. Thursday - after going for a swim in the evening we came back to the room in swimsuit and towel only to find that the key card would not work. Of course no one at front desk. Eventually found a security man to let us into the room. In my opinion this hotel is not a RESORT hotel. No one at front desk after 10pm is madness. What happens in an emergency.

I decided on this hotel because most hotels in Key West and the key areas were sold out. Also, compared to regular hotel rooms in Key West this was a bargain. And i thought since we were staying only one night, this hotel would do... BAD mistake!. I had read the mixed reviews on this hotel and i did not expect a luxury hotel, but this was ridiculous. I went with it against my better judgement. This hotel has seen better days... years ago!!. The hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. The room was old and tired, the bathroom very outdated and small, no central AC but a wall unit, the carpet was old and stained. I would NOT walk barefoot at all in this room. They say in the website ( i booked through Expedia) that the room had a queen size bed. It didn't. That was a full size bed to me. The mattress was terribly uncomfortable, cheap, you can definitely feel the springs in the mattress as you toss and turn. We were really dissappointed because we went to celebrate a bday and this just put a damper on things. To top it all off, the TV did not have a remote!. And get this: i was tying to cal the front desk to complain, but the phone in our room was not working!!!. Since we were just staying there for a night, we decided to make the most of it and go to the pool area. This is actually the only good thing about this hotel, The pool area was nice setting, with a small and quaint beach area, tiki bar ( although the tiki bar closed at 5:30). WTF? The pool and hotel is addults only which is always a plus in my book (no screaming kids by the pool). But beware it is clothing optional pool, which its ok with us. The bartender was nice guy, the drinks he mixed were ok, but he was nice enough to recommend a restaurant in Key West for dinner which was excelent!. Before we head out to dinner, i stopped by the front desk area (which closes at 7-8 pm) and told the front desk girl our TV in the room had no remote, and that i was trying to call her from the room but the phone in our room was not working either. She just kinda shrugged and said she would \"leave a TV remote by the front desk area\" for us when we came back. Needless to say, when we came back (around 12 or so) the front deks area was closed and locked, no body around and of course no TV remote anywhere in sight. They have a \"continental breakfast\" from 7:30 Am to 10 Am., I don't know where the people that had said in their reviews that the breakfast was ok are from or where they have stayed, but this was NOT a continental breakfast at all. Coffe was ok, hard boiled eggs and some package cheeses, some boxed croissants and breads. The only saving grace that you can actually go to the beach area and sit outside and relax and enjoy the view. Overall, bad.

There is a pool, there is a sandy beach for relaxing, but there is no swimming in the bay--it's very shallow and weedy. There is a \"marina\", which is a narrow channel (in which apparently manatees actually do appear). But you have to also be prepared for a rather poorly managed motel where you have to stay on top of the front desk manager to get basic things like the proper number of hand and face towels, replacement packages for your in-room coffee machine, etc. The front desk clerks seem to do their best to keep guests happy, but the service staff can be seen moving at a snails pace to do the minimum necessary. The fault seems to lie with \"Steve,\" the owner (?) or general manager(?)

Otherwise, look elsewhere and be prepared to spend more for your accommodations.

Having said that, the term \"resort\" has changed somewhat over time. Back in the day, if your Florida motel had some acreage, a pool and some palm trees it was called a \"resort.\" Now of course the word has a different meaning. The Banana Bay is certainly not on a par with a 5-star luxury hotel with all the amenities, but it is a fine place to stay if you're not Mick Jagger, and you don't want to spend a fortune on a place where you're basically just going to sleep. My buddy and I took a trip on our motorcycles to Key West. We *could* have stayed at the Casa Marina, but didn't want that. We arrived on a weekday. The Banana Bay is out-of-the-way, and separate from all the other typical chain hotel/motels you find when you first get into KW. The staff was friendly, the place was clean - it got us wondering if the people who wrote bad reviews even stayed at the same place? Yes, yes, the carpeting in the rooms should be replaced with tile. Other than that, the room was fine, and had the usual microwave/refrigerator/iron/hair dryer that we've come to expect. We liked the ceiling fan - nice touch! It's the tropics, after all. And we liked the little balcony with table and chairs. The pool area was nice and clean and well-maintained. All in all, a very nice hotel! By the way, the Banana Bay had the most comfortable bed/pillows of any hotel I've stayed at recently, which has been mainly Holiday Inn Expresses and the like. As for the breakfast... As hotels get more competitive, they offer bigger and bigger breakfast bars, to include eggs and waffles and stuff. It gets silly. You want a big breakfast? There's a Waffle House right up the street. The Banana Bay advertises and provides a continental breakfast of cereals, bagels, and muffins, with plenty of coffee and juice. What part of \"continental breakfast\" do people not understand? It was fine for us. Oh, there was no fresh fruit, boo-hoo. Like I said, some people are never happy. You could eat your breakfast outside under the palm trees on a little patio by the water, which we did. Marvelous! Nice way to start off your day. Alternatively there is another patio with tables that overlooks the pool/jacuzzi. We liked the tropical setting of the place. Yes, it was on the water but no, it had no beach. Big deal. Being right on the water is a BIG plus in my book. Few hotels in KW are actually *on* the water. There is no wireless internet in the room, although the breakfast room is a wireless hotspot and has a desktop computer for guests to use. No problem for me, as I left *my* computer home (we were supposed to be on vacation!). My riding buddy brought his, and got online in the room through his cellphone, which worked fine. Whatever problems this hotel may have had in the past, they seem to be corrected as of August of 2010. We had a great time staying there, and when I go back to Key West, I'm going to stay there again. Can you do better in Key West than stay at the Banana Bay? Not for the money you can't.

THE PROS: --My first impression of BB (Banana Bay) was decent. One of the associates, Matt, held our baggage when we arrived early from the airport. He recommended several restaurants, activities, beaches and bars to go to... and they all turned out GREAT! I really enjoyed several of his choices. He also gave my sister and I coupons for them... which was a plus since everything on the island is so expensive. --The pool was always clean and a very nice temperature. I even sat in the hot tub once and it was very very enjoyable--even on a hot day. --The private \"beach\" was quaint and nice... you can lay out in serious silence --The pool seemed to be never busy... it was quiet and there weren't a bunch of kids screaming and jumping in the pool. The pool was very relaxing. --Military Discount (if you apply...) THE NEGATIVES: --When I called & made a reservation (at the actual hotel) I clarified that the tiki bar was open and actively being used... the woman who helped me said it WAS open.... to my surprise upon check-in, it was not. I was really disappointed. --Almost every time we went to the pool, we had to ask/call for pool towels... and most of the time they were out. This was frustrating since we had to use our bath towels. For some reason they seemed stingy on towels... --The heat/AC in our room was inconsistent. It was either blazing or an igloo in our room. It was so frustrating. We had to get up in the middle of the night to either turn on/off the AC... seriously ridiculous. --The Housekeeping cleaned at very weird hours.... we had to call to see if they were coming to our room, and to our surprise--they forgot. They came around 6pm after we called... it was odd. If you need any other info, let me know.

We found Banana Bay Resort on a website, and I quickly read the reviews here. With a bit of trepidation, we booked, and I'm SO GLAD we did!!! The ADULT ONLY hotel property is not fancy, but maintained quite well for it's age. The pool/beach area were beautiful. Again, not a 5* resort, but definitely not the \"dump\" that some other reviewers would have you believe. First the outside: the pool area is very nice with plenty of towels, shaded areas, tables, and cushioned lounge chairs. The sandy beach area looks out onto a pretty bay and the crystal clear water. Like most resorts in KW, this is not a swimming beach, so don't expect that. The \"pile of sand\" that people speak of as being \"Gross\" was leftover sand they use to keep up the beach area. It looks as though there was an old pool they've filled in on another part of the property, and dumped the excess sand in that area. No, it's not pretty, but No, its not visible from your room/balcony either. We were able to sit on our balcony each day/night and not be bothered by mosquitoes, which was an unexpected surprise. Rooms: We stayed in room 116 which had a view of both the beach area and the pool. I think the primary flaw with this hotel is that the rooms are carpeted, which is never a good idea in a tropical area. There was a bit of a musty smell which one would expect in a humid climate where carpet is concerned, but it was not a deal breaker for us. The rooms are a very nice size for the price, and come with a good sized refrigerator, a sink, some cabinets, and a microwave. All of which come in very handy should you care to buy food to make your own lunches during the day (or even dinner to save a few bucks). There are no utensils, so be sure to grab some plasticware along the way. The King sized bed was VERY comfortable with great pillows. For the budget minded traveler, this is a great water front hotel not far from the action of Duvall street, without the lofty price. If you're looking for the Ritz, the Westin, or even the Sheraton, this isn't it, but neither is the price tag!!! Also, be advised that topless sunbathing is welcomed here. Just a tip, if you've never been to the Keys, I suggest you travel by car from Miami instead of simply flying directly to Key West. It's a beautiful drive and only takes about 3 hours total. We rented a car for less than the cost of a daily bike rental or taxi ride in KW!!! EZ rental car out of Miami airport (you have to call them for a shuttle driver) has rates of $13 PER DAY!!!! it's an easy scenic filled drive, and you can always stop off at the other keys for a quick swim along the way :)", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cStay Here if You Want to get Robbed\u201d", "Author": "hurrikate", "ReviewID": "UR68112329", "Content": "We were turned off by the unkempt condition of the pool and beach area, however, we decided to brush this aside.

I had read the reviews and knew the hotel was not going to look like much pulling up - it was bad, but the hotel is really nice. My first thought at seeing the front is some horror movie where the teenagers stop and get killed. It's NOTHING like that - it's very nice. The staff is super friendly - Very friendly, at first you might not think so as they are getting you checked in but soon as you get to talk to them, they are nice. Check out was super easy and again, friendly staff. Our room was larger than I had expected and clean - which is a big thing to me. The bed was really nice and the windows so clean on the balcony it could have been easy to miss them and walk right into them. The hotel is adult only which I think is WONDERFUL. You must be 16 and over to stay here. The pool is topless only although it used to be fully clothing optional so some guest who have been coming for years still go in their b-day suits. If this bothers you, this is not the place for you. We didn't have a long stay here, but we would no doubt stay again. The bathroom products are bath and body works. The wall paper in our bathroom could use a replacement as it's coming off the walls behind the door, but that's hard to avoid with hot showers being taken constantly Our Room had a view of the pool and some of the \"beach\" . Keep in mind Key West is not known for it's beaches and besides the man-made ones, there really aren't any to visit. If you are looking to spend time at the beach, you need to look at another location, Key West isn't it. The hotel is a short drive to downtown where parking is a pain in the butt. We chose to drive and park, but many people take a taxi down (was told it's $10 each way). Downtown parking 25 cents per 10 minutes - it can get costly so try to find free parking or a parking lot that charges a flat rate if you are going to be there a while. There is no shuttle offered by the hotel. Overall, I was impressed, the outside of the hotel is very deceiving, but the rooms are very lovely.

Banana Bay seemed to fit the bill. After reading some of the reviews here we were pretty nervous about it. As it turns out, none of these concerns were valid. The room was great, the grounds were beautiful, and the overall value was excellent. Highlights: * There is a 24-hour fitness gym with weight machines and step masters. * The outdoor pool is very nice. There are some topless sunbathers, but that is not unusual at all for South Florida. The Jacuzzi is warm and holds around 6 people. There is a Tiki Bar open at certain hours for drinks. * The \"beach\" area is very nice. There are no real beaches per se in the Keys, so this man made beach area is really a treat. There is a gazebo, hammocks, deck chairs for sunning, bar-b-que grille, and even a large outdoor chess set. The sunsets here are almost as nice as you see on Mallory Square. * The free Continental Breakfast was great. Hot coffee, orange juice, boiled eggs, a variety of cold cereals, milk, bagels, breads, and mini muffins were available. The breakfast room was nicely appointed with tables and couches. There is also a free Internet accessible computer in this room to check your e-mail or web surf. * We had a room overlooking the pool. The room was nice and had a balcony where we had our breakfast in the morning. The room is 3 star quality. The carpets are indoor - outdoor, as you would expect for an area where most of the time you're going to be wearing a bathing suit and have sandy feet. The furnishings are rattan and tropical. The bed was comfortable, King size, and had plenty of soft pillows. There was a work desk, big comfortable chair, and a TV. Also great was a mini refrigerator where we kept cold drinks and a supply of local freshly made conch salad. If you know anything about the Florida Keys, you know that there are NO bargains. A simple 2/2 condo costs over $1 million here. If you want a 5 Star hotel in Key West with marble baths, concierge, valet parking, and big restaurants...then Banana Bay isn't for you.

I dont know if they have them on site to release for a wedding moment or whether they are just there for people to look at. Its just awful to see such glorious birds caged , just plain sad.

They said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no problem, come on over\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So we did\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Keep in mine it was 10:00am when we got to the front desk. The staff were so nice and friendly.

So they gave us our key and we went up to our room. What a surprise. Room was very nice, great view overlooking the pool and bay. So we decided to pass on going to the beach and decided to go sit at the pool for the day. We get down to the pool and there is one couple there. She is topless and he is bottomless. No problem for us, being the nudists we are. We take off our suits and enjoy the sun. A short time later a couple comes down and sits next to us. They are telling us that the resort is not really clothing optional anymore. Well we were told that is was when we made the reservations and checked in. We did ask the manager again and he told us that because we had been told this when we checked in we could be nude during our stay. We also came to find out that this couple was not even staying at the resort but lived in the area and just like to use the pool here. After a few more days, we met many other nudists who use Banana Bay to lay out. None of them were guests. Kinds pissed us off, we were paying $184.00 per night and these people were just trespassing. The icing on the cake was when a group of local teens showed up and started drinking. After about 2 hours they did get kicked out, but the nerve\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.

She flew in from Cincinnati (I live in Fort Myers, FL) and we drove down (5 hours on a good day)and arrived at the Banana Bay Motel at approx. 3:30 p.m. When we first pulled in to the parking lot, my heart sank to the floor, because at first glance it looked like a cheap roadside hotel. I had made reservations 2 weeks earlier and requested to be near a handicap spot, needed two queen beds, with the nicest view they could get. When we checked in, the young lady was working alone and was quite busy. She seemed almost robotic and my daughter didn't think she was that friendly. I think she was just busy, because she was alone working. I was really nervous, because I wanted my daughter to be very happy, since I had not seen her in a long time. She gave us a map of the premises and told us to drive all the way in the back by the swimming pool and that is where the surprise took place. It was just lovely in the back of the hotel. We got an excellent handicap spot right in front of the ramp going up to the room. There were two luggage carts available right there too. When we opened the door to the room....just beautiful. Nicely decorated with a Tommy Bahama theme, cute floor lamps with monkeys climbing on it. Very clean. Lovely balcony overlooking the pool and parking lot. Two very nicely made up beds with great pillows. (I usually bring my own pillows). A wet bar, an ice machine readily available. We put our bathing suits on and went down to the pool area. There was a jacuzzi and then a little beach area with very nice lounge chairs, hammocks and a lovely view of a bay. Non swimming beach, but lovely anyway. There was alot of shade trees and everything was immaculate. A giant outdoor chess board in the sand. One warning, this is tops optional and 18 and up only. A couple of gals went topless in the pool, doesn't bother me, but it may others. It was very quiet(off season)and when we got back from dinner that night (10:30) we put our suits back on and went down and sat in the lounge chairs and watched the stars. No one else was down there and I would think if it was just my husband and I, and not my daughter it would have been very romantic. There was no one in the pool, which was lit by soft blue lights and only one guy in the jacuzzi. The front desk clerk got us a taxi in 5 minutes (use the pink taxi company (forgot the name)and ask for Nicole as your driver, she was a hoot!) when we went to Mallory Square for the sunset earlier that evening. The reason why I was so impressed with Banana Bay was that 3 years earlier, my husband and I had stayed and the Comfort Inn in Key west and yes it was cheap then (July-off season $89.00) but it was also very dirty and the room was dark and dingy...almost like a smell of old beer and partying in it. The beds were awful etc. BANANA BAY IS MY NEW ECONOMICAL, CUTE HOTEL TO RECOMMEND IN KEY WEST. The room was a good value for $138. plus tax ($159.00 total) and I had looked at dozens and dozens of hotels, some running into the $500 range for one night (ridiculous). I would highly recommend this hotel also to honeymooners on a budget. It was a very pleasant surprise! Hope to go back soon with my husband. One thing to remember in Key West, it's a rock and I think there might be 2 little beaches for the public, so there are few hotels with the set up that Banana Bay had with the little beach and view of the bay.

It is small (48 guestrooms), away from the hustle and bustle of Duval Street (about 1 1/2 - 2 miles away but accessible by car, cab, bus, etc) friendly and clean! I read a few reviews that stated that it was \"tired,\" \"rundown,\" \"past its prime,\" \"dirty\" etc. and I was quite honestly expecting the worst. We nearly drove right by the place, but I saw the Taco Bell....thanks to everyone who mentioned that! The front desk clerk was extremely friendly and helpful. The reception area was bright and tropical in color, in perfect Key West tradition. It appears that the buildings have been recently painted and there is a beautiful tropical mural in the main entry staircase to the two-floor complex. There was no garbage laying around that we noticed and the only \"dirt\" in the pool was occasional leaves that blew off the surrounding trees, but the maintenance guys were out there cleaning it regularly. Our room was wonderful and I had wireless access on my laptop from the room. We immediately checked out the pool area upon arrival, as this was the only picture I had ever seen online, and it was beautiful! The picture really doesn't do this place justice at all! All the lounge chairs have thick cushions and there are plenty, both around the pool and several out on the bulkhead beach area, as well as rocking chairs in the gazebo and along the bulkhead, and a hammock strung between the trees. The Tiki bar at the pool was open from 11am - 7 pm, and we had a wonderful bartender pampering us daily. The continental breakfast out by the pool each morning was wonderful. A nice touch. This is not an all-inclusive fancy schmancy resort. However, it is clean, comfortable, and a great Key West treasure. If it is the cookie cutter resort atmosphere you are looking for this hotel probably isn't for you. But if you want to experience the tropics in a quaint, quiet, tropical property, then give this great little place a try! We will definitely return to Banana Bay in the future and we'll bring and recommend it to our family and friends.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cWhat happened to this place?\u201d", "Author": "visit0r789456123", "ReviewID": "UR7632112", "Content": "We stayed here in March and in May.

I mean \"totally naked\"......not just topless. It just said \"adult exlcusive\". We had reservations to dive one morning at Subtropic. Our dive was cancelled due to the loss of the boat captain..........very sad. He had died the night before in a very tragic accident (not scuba diving......just too tragic to talk about). Our hearts were very sad for this community of people that are so close. I want to put a great word in for Dive Key West. Eric and Jeremy were great with us and made our diving experience wonderful. They are very accomodating and professional. Also, you must eat at \"Sarabeth's\" on Simonton St. Great romantic restaurant with fabulous food and staff.
