It is nothing more than a dolled up bad Holiday Inn. The lobby is tacky with a small coffee bar (no gift shop or anything that exclusive) and the furniture is something out of a Motel 6. The \"suite\" I upgraded to is a joke. You walk in the door to a dark, windowless room with a desk and chair and then walk into the actual room with the bed and they call this a 1 bedroom suite!! Once again, the furniture is very basic, no shelves or drawers for clothing (only a small closet). The lighting is out of a bad Chinese restaurant, extremely bright and no dimmers on anything. There are 3 channels in English on the television and of course no extra blankets or pillows in the closet (I guess they couldn't fit them in) The bathroom is small and only has a shower with a plastic door and wall around it. There was no wine openers or bottle openers and when I asked for one they brought up another bottle of water (no, the staff is not bi lingual either). The \"bar/restaurant\" on the roof is just a large room sans bar (a few bottles on a bus tray was the bar) brightly lit with what is the best thing about this joint, the view. I booked this hotel for a birthday celebration and upgraded for a suite in the Polanco and got a two bit tacky room in a less than desirable area paying more than I normally do in a very decent hotel in a better part of town.

Seriously, I'm ashamed I hadn't done this sooner, as I really value the reviews others post for me to read. A friend, and I booked our stay at the Wyndham Garden Hotel Mexico City Polanco for this past New Year's Eve. Every part of it was really delightful, from the room to the hospitality of the hotel staff. The rooms were very comfortable, and well maintained. The location made accessing the various areas of Mexico City very convenient. But, the hotel staff really made it top class for me. I wish I had the names of those we interacted with, but the two staff members that worked the overnight on New Year's Eve were by far the most superior, not just New Year's Eve, but during our entire stay. I believe the female staff member was a manager, and then there was a gentleman that worked that same evening with her. They were so quick to accommodate our every need, and made our stay easy, and enjoyable. The next time I'm in Mexico City, I will be staying at the Wyndham Garden again. Thank you for an enjoyable, and memorable stay.

However, I've got 3 complains: 1. beds are very soft so sleeping is difficult, 2. breakfast is very poor, and 3. lighting throughout the hotel and the rooms is a cold light, blue colored, not very bright (those awful energy-saver bulbs), and it can turn your mood down very quickly.

I have just paid 26,50 US$ / night (10 nights for a total of 265 US$) for a suite (a little office with a sofa bed and a bedroom) with Orbitz. Incredible I know !!!! BUT please note that at the rack rate this hotel doesn't worth it an it is possible to find better places for less in Mexico city. Unfortunately they try to sell you the services of there own taxis at the door. The personnel is always waiting outside to be sure you cannot catch another one, Be carefull, They will charge you an eye and a leg, check always the fare in advance.

They have a travel agency that books tours, I wouldnt recommened the city on (use the panflet that they have at the entrance for the hop on hop off bus instead) The Pyramid tour is well worth it! They also have the hotel taxi but they are a bit pricey. Also if you are going to use them, first ask the hotel about how much it would cost, then when u get in to the taxi ask again. To get to the center you will need to either take the taxi, or the bus. This is the onlly one thing I didnt like about the hotel was the location.

We had to upgrade to a suite because we were three and we had made reservations via an online source. The transaction was painless and actually a good deal compared to their advertised prices for a suite. The room was clean and comfortable, not big but not small either. After traveling throughout Guanajuato and Oaxaca, this was definitely a treat, since we were able to have a restful night in the plush king size bed. My boyfriend slept on the sleeper sofa and felt it was slightly more comfortable than other hotels we had stayed. Hotel staff were soooo nice and accommodating. The two gentleman who worked either day time or afternoon/evening shifts were excellent! The hotel car was convenient for a quick Polanco drive to a restaurant. Very nice guy too. He even gave us his cell number to call him for a pick up from the restaurant. Unfortunately, the restaurant could not call personal cell numbers (???). Location was just okay. I like taking the Metro ($3 pesos per person), but the walk was a bit far and not the best at night. There are some places to eat across the street, but we really didn't venture out in the area, except for Chapultepec Park. Its walking distance where you'll find museums and the Turibus stop. Lastly, make sure you tell the cab driver the hotel is located in Colonia Nueva Anzures. Otherwise, they'll have a hard time finding it, costing you much pesos. Also, same street as Fiesta Americana POLANCO, practically across the street.
