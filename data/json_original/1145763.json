Before we got to the hotel we received an email from them telling us exactly how to get to there and gave us warning of 'touts' (randoms who want to take advantage of us). The hotel is located in a huge building, as is to be expected in Hong Kong, and is on the 15th floor. The front entrance has upwards of 15 hawkers at one time trying to get your attention, walking in front of you, saying variations of; \"room?\", \"watch?,\" \"suit?\". There are two elevators. One services the even number of levels and the other services the odd numbers. During peak times there is a line to these elevators and a guard is around to monitor or shove more people into or out of the elevators. The elevator is tiny. We're talking public toilet cubicle tiny. Most of the time if we saw a queue of people we opted for the stairs since the elevator would take forever. Take note, if you do decide to use the stairs they can be a bit eerie. Though we were never met with any danger per say it did make us weary. On our first adventure up the stairs we were asked if we wanted any drugs! Onto the hotel! The rooms are tiny. To be expected. The shower is literally over the toilet so I suggest you remove all the toilet paper from the bathroom before taking a sower. The bed can move up to the roof level which we found handy to clear up some, minimal space, by putting our bags under the bed. This at least made a clear pathway to the door. You have a tv, air conditioning and mini fridge. The tv worked well. Room service was daily. The woman who worked there was lovely and had little English but tried her best when we asked her questions about places. There is a hot water dispenser available and we found a dry cleaners on the first floor of the building. There was work going on when we were staying, and I imagine it will forever be going on, but since we were on the 15th floor the sound was minimal. There is a station close by which made it incredibly easy for us to travel around. The hotel is also located within walking distance to the art gallery and space museum which have free entry on specific days. Also across the street from the hotel is an imax cinema. A block away is a post office, especially awesome when you happen to buy a lot of stuff to send back home. There is a supermarket by the train station, about 2 blocks away. It has a bakery out the front which proved to be a necessity in providing us with our lunches for the day. Also the airport bus is right outside of the hotel. Made it super easy for us when we had to leave at 4am in the morning. I was very satisfied with this hotel. It provided what I expected. However the hawkers out the front just do. not. stop. Literally we would walk past the same people and they would still harass us even if they only saw us 15 minutes before. We had one guy follow us for a block yelling obscenities because we didn't care about what he was selling. If you cannot deal with hawkers then I suggest you stay far far away from the Park Guest House. If you can deal with hawkers then I would recommend the Park Guest House as a place to stay.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seremban, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cSuper small\u201d", "Author": "WeilekHo", "ReviewID": "UR131753241", "Content": "Small room is expected before I check in, but I was shocked the room is smaller than my expectation.

For those tall guy please check before you stay in. In the same time I also visit others room when the maid cleaning the other rooms, I found that 3 single bed room is the best, endless city view and space enough. Single bed room is no window, dark in the room. Recommended if you have a bit extra money and want to stay more comfortable, 2 people can select 3 bed room, 1 person can select twin bed room. The building is a bit old, but this guest house has been refurbished, feel comfortable. What others said, the ground floor is a bit mess, while there are many stalls and money exchange which very convenience tourists. The building management is well managed, everything arranged in order, tourist needs patient to queue and wait for the lift. The location is good, Chung King Mansion is well-known, just mentioned the building name to bus driver, he will stop at the closer bus stop, just walk within two minutes distance.

The hostel itself requires a key card to enter. We were able to check our luggage the next day. The location is very convenient - walking distance to the MTR, Ferry, History Museum etc. Chungking Mansion itself does look a bit seedy, but it's not nearly as intimidating as places like Pahar Ganj in India or Khao San road in Bangkok, and the neighbourhood itself is fine. You will have to wait for the elevator, as there are only two tiny lifts for the whole building. The room wasn't silent, but was surprisingly quiet for the middle of Hong Kong. So, if you need a place to stay in Hong Kong without spending $200 a night, and want somwhere basic, clean and safe to sleep, I'd definitely recommend this place.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon, UK", "Title": "\u201cSpotlessly clean but small...\u201d", "Author": "faceman01", "ReviewID": "UR62752771", "Content": "We stayed here in early April after staying 1 night on the 3rd floor at some cockroach infested place I can't remember the name of! We visited about 10 other Guesthouses in Chung King Mansions and chose to stay here. The room had only just been renovated, the aircon unit, tv, bathroom fittings were all absolutely brand new! The sheets were crisp and clean, it was great. The only thing that was wrong was the size of the room, it was tiny!! Most of the rooms we saw in Chung King Mansions were tiny so this came as no surprise but I hd to put my backpack under the bed so we had space to walk around the room! On our tour of the mansion block we did find bigger rooms (on the 5th floor but they were much more expensive) but the rooms at Park House GH were the best we saw. We paid 220 Hong Kong$ per night which was pretty good value as Hong Kong is an expensive city to stay in!", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Park Guest House", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1145763-Reviews-Park_Guest_House-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$48 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">A1 15/Floor Block A, Chung King Mansion, 36-44 Nathan Road, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1145763", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/bb/3d/ce/a-standard-3-bedroom.jpg"}}
