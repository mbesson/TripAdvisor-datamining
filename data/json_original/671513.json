The front staff were terrific and very friendly. I can't recall a hotel where the front staff says hello to you every time they see you. The room itself was spacious. I got a one queen bedroom suite with pullout sofa bed on the 3rd floor. One issue I had was that the bathroom door wouldn't close properly. They were sliding doors and it just wouldn't lock. The wait staff during the free breakfast hours could also be more friendlier. For the four mornings I had breakfast there, they wait staff had sour puss looks except for the chef!!!

ROOMS: Very big. Ours had a very comfy bed, a nice big TV, and a kitchen (huge fridge, microwave, dishwasher). Great water pressure in the showers. Gorgeous sheets with a high thread count. SERVICE: Very friendly staff! Helpful, welcoming, happy to speak either French or English. PERKS: We got two vouchers each for a drink during the Manager's Cocktail Hour. Generous pours of wine, beer, and soft drink! Ample snacks - corn chips, pretzels, vegies. This was a nice little touch and we enjoyed having a pre-dinner drink in the evenings. We also got a free newspaper on Saturday morning, which was nice. BREAKFAST: Great! Big selection - crepes, oatmeal, cereal, gorgeous fresh fruit, yoghurt, eggs, sausages, potatoes, omelette station, pastries, OJ, coffee. GYM: Huge gym! Free weights, several treadmills/bikes/etc. Lots of floor space. CONS: It's sort of irritating having such a big space for a kitchen, yet no hot plate or cooking utensils...but oh well.

We all stayed at the Embassy Suites. What a great hotel! From the effortless check-in, the free parking and the warm greetings by every staff person we met, to the beautifully appointed suites each of the two families had, the Embassy Suites was a perfect place to stay while visiting Montreal. The suites are large and decorated with beautiful wood accents and wonderful paintings; our suite had a gas fireplace (which was a surprise to us) which provided just the right extra warmth after a day exploring Montreal in the cold weather. Our suite actually felt very homey. The beds were superb, and the fold-out couch was also very comfortable. The internet access was flawless, much to my daughter's delight. Not to be repetitive, but the staff were all terrific, warm, friendly, knowledgeable and professional with nearly all being being bilingual and fully able to accomodate us both in English and in our (unfortunately) poor French. The location of the Embassy Suites is incredible; a couple blocks from Notre Dame Cathedral and the Old City, a couple blocks from Chinatown, and just a ten minute walk to the sites of \"Montreal En Lumiere\", the Winter Festival. There is a Manager's Reception every evening with two drinks per person free, and a full breakfast with a great buffet menu every day. The lobby and restaurant area are beautiful and spacious, the furnishings are stylish, and the clientele is a pleasant combination of business travelers, and tourist couples and families. Fantastic place! We had no problems and a wonderful time. I can't imagine going to Montreal and staying anywhere else.

We requested a room with a kitchen expecting that we would be able to use it during our 5 day stay in order to avoid having to eat out constantly. We couldn't have been more disappointed with the 'amenities'. I have stayed in many properties that advertised kitchens and in all but this one there were at least provided SOMETHING to cook with. There was not a scrap of cookware, knives to prepare food, cutting board, can opener, utensils or anything else one could use to prepare a meal. We called the desk and asked them to bring some cutlery and a dish so we could at least have something to eat with. Unfortunately the kitchen was not even equipped with dish soap to wash our plates! and the 'dishwasher' is NOT a dishwasher - it's just a decorative door that looks like one. This was a colossal failure as a kitchen and a waste of money for the company. If you plan to use the kitchen pack accordingly. The bathroom was very large - unfortunately the space was wasted by the tub. The shower 'stall' reminded me of a locker room. It was absolutely tiny with no real space to do anything at all. Bathing in a big Jacuzzi tub daily is not only a waste of water but considering that the tub takes almost half an hour to fill it is also not practical when one is on a schedule. As members of the honors program we were also provided with vouchers for the breakfast buffet. The quality of the food and service was lackluster. The 'cook to order omelet' was made with boxed egg product and the toppings were just dumped into the middle of the mass of egg without ever being cooked. The result was an omelet with raw crunchy filling in the middle - our associate was presented with one that was so undercooked it was running on his dish. The rest of the buffet was of the same quality and the staff were completely dis-interested in anything at all. The first day we were 'accosted' for our ticket and then not even provided with any instruction as to where we could find coffee, what was available, where it was..nothing. We sat for 5 minutes waiting for a server to come over but got nothing at all. The location is nice, the bed was very comfortable.

Since I was going on a camping trip after my hotel stay, I had items that needed to stay in the car and thus I needed a secure place. I went to the front desk to explain the situation and I was recommended to a nearby parking lot. I decided to check again with the concierge about indoor parking garages where I might fit. At that point, I was again given the recommendation of the nearby outside lot. I later learned that the hotel offers guests to park in their secure courtyard area. So, I parked my car in the recommended lot. When I arrived the next day to retrieve something from the vehicle, I discovered that my back window was smashed in and the vehicle was ransacked. Aside from the expense and hassle this created, when I went back to the hotel to inform them of this, they then told me I could park in the courtyard! AFTER this incident. They also demanded I pay them for parking. When I questioned this further with a manager, this was dropped.

We were traveling with our 2 year old, and were a bit apprehensive about it all: getting to the event on time (and on foot), potential \"Canadian winter\" outdoor temperaatures (in November), the need to access food (milk, yogurt, pastries) at all times... and were delighted at the end of our stay. The Embassy Suites (by Hilton) meets all our expectations. - Location: the hotel is situated near what looks like the financial / business section of downtown - it's not close to the main shopping or dining drags, but it's perfect for us because our main goal was to be close to the Conference Center (which I could have sprinted to, toddler in arm, without taking more than 3 breaths). One evening we walked back from the main shopping area (where H&M is, you get the idea) - via the awesome Montreal underground network, and remained indoors all the way into the Conference Center. We walked very slowly, with a tantrum-ing toddler, and the walk only took us about 20 minutes. You'll spend longer if you end up walking into any of the thousands of shops, of course. The hotel is also little more than 2 blocks away from the Basilica Notre Dame - and the rest of Old Montreal. Walking distance (even with stroller) to many bistros and cobblestone streets. Many bistros though, only open after 5 pm - but that's not the hotel's fault! The hotel is also walking distance to Chinatown, where restaurants open late and you can get decent food relatively cheap (and up to 10 pm). - Room: this is the most spacious room we have ever gotten for under $200. All the rooms in this hotel are suites - with a kitchenette, extra sofa bed in the \"living room\", very large bathroom, and a entry foyer / closet area. The kitchenette has a real-life sized fridge with ample freezer space for a few gallons of ice cream if you wish. There's a full function microwave, a kitchen sink that i want for my own home, and a very basic coffee / tea brewer. What perplexed us was that there was no stove or cooktop / heating element - not a big issue since it's not like we were gonna actually cook... but why the huge freezer and fridge if we weren't gonna be storing groceries to cook?? We filled up the fridge with milk and yogurt we get from the complimentary breakfast buffet instead, so that our toddler can eat all the yogurt he wants even at midnight. The large two-person sized (square shaped) jacuzzi tub is the best i've seen inside an individual hotel room. It's conceivable that some lesser hotel would have called that a public jacuzzi in the basement floor for all to share - it's that big. and clean - very important. - Food and Drinks: We were offered complimentary breakfast buffet for each of the 3 mornings we stayed there, and on the weekends it lasts till 10:30 am (9:30 am for weekdays). Selection was decent. We were also given complimentary beverage coupons (covers even alcoholic drinks) to be used each evening between 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm. We filled ourselves up with cocktails before dinner. - Service: Front desk staff were all Francophone, but all speak decent English. They were very friendly when we stumbled in at 9 pm with our toddler - immediately giving our toddler a goodie bag to keep him occupied while we sort out rooms. Our booking was a conference-special rate, and only entitled us to a room with a Queen bed (plus the sofa bed in the living room), but they spontaneously offered us a King bed suite when they see us scrambling with a kid. Conceirge is helpful. There is also self-served coin-operated laundry in the building (basement) - bring your own detergent. All in all, we were very happy with our choice. Not sure if we were stay here if our main goal was to sight-see, but then I never gotten around to do research for the sight-seeing type of Montreal trip. I have a feeling that the \"downtown\" hotels that are close to all the shopping will all be in older buildings and less spacious.

We had asked that plates and utensils be already in the room when we arrived, and they were. We had asked to be on a top floor, and we were. We had requested early check-in, and they did. I had mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and next night they surprised us with a bottle of wine! Very nice indeed. Breakfast was included with the room, and there was plenty to eat, including an omelet station. The chef new my wife by the 2nd morning and had her omelet ready for her! In the evening you were given a coupon for 2 drinks each at happy hour(5:30-7:30), and there was free snacks. Chips, salsa, et. The hotel itself is in a great part of the city. To the right is Old Montreal, and to the left was Chinatown. The subway was one block away, and took us everywhere needed. We walked most of the time. We had dinner at two great restaurants, both with Jazz. The first one was Modavie, at 1 Rue Paul. Very good service and wonderful food. The 2nd restaurant was Jardin Nelson (www.jardinnelson.com) , also in Old Montreal.They are now closed till May. Again, the staff was wonderful, the Jazz great, and the food delicious. We did eat twice at the Embassy Suites and found the food very good. Nothing to complain about. The staff could not have been nicer, and would do anything for you.

I used my Hhonors points to stay here and I was blown away. The lobby is really nice and modern but the room is what was so good. I booked a suite with a king bed, that's all I chose. When I got to the room, it was a corner suite first of all that was probably twice the size of my condo. It was a 2 bedroom suite with a queen bed in the other, massive bathroom, and down the hall a huge living area with giant kitchen with fridge, stove microwave and dishwasher. It had a fireplace, a huge table with seating for 6 people and other couches and chairs. I couldn't believe how nice it was. You could honestly have 5+ people comfortably stay in this place it was that big. I kept forgetting there even was bedrooms as I'd be in the living room mostly and the rooms were down the hall. The room comes with 2 free alcoholic drink tickets plus breakfast buffet.

Conveniently located, this hotel has a no nonsense facade and common areas but boasts comfortable and compact suites with well used space. We stayed on the sixth floor near the elevator, usually not a great location for a room but we didn't notice any elevator noise at all. Entering the suite, a large closet with iron and board were to the right. The bathroom had a huge whirlpool tub, vanity with shelves and storage space, a granite dressing table and a shower. The bathroom opened into the entry foyer as well as the bedroom. The kitchen had a built in microwave, more than adequate cabinet space, large fridge/freezer, coffee maker, sink and dishwasher, though we couldn't get the dishwasher door open. Two comfortable bar chairs provided seating for meals at the granite counter top.There were also numerous garbage cans, though all very small so it was tough to fit anything into them, and a recycle bin. The work desk was spacious and in the corner of the living room near the window with free high speed internet. Both the living room and bedroom had TVs and the bedroom had a closet with shelves, two nightstands with drawers and a small chest with three more drawers. The king bed was comfy and the bedroom could be closed off for privacy via pocket doors. We were thrilled to find the windows were functional and enjoyed fresh air on warm nights. The hotel offers free breakfast with made to order omeletes and a buffet and a manager's reception each evening with two free drinks per guest and snacks. The hotel also served full meals in the same dining area and offered room service. Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful as was housekeeping. Major attractions like the Notre Dame Basillica was a two minute walk and old Montreal and the port were all within a very easy 10 minute stroll as well as many restaurants, coffee shops and bistros. Underground parking is also available at a fee. The only downside to my stay was construction in the alley between the hotel and the next building so there was early morning noise from trucks and construction crews. Also, one curiosity was the hotel's choice to install a very small Euro style shower in the corner of the bathroom. There was room for a larger stall as the bathroom was huge. Luckily the shower looked brand new and spotlessly clean but my long arms kept banging into the somewhat claustrophobic glass walls. The entire suite and lobby was fresh and clean and overall, this hotel provided a great experience.

The magnificent facilities of the OLYMPIC BASIN were the site of the Olympic rowing events during the 1976 Olympic Games. The hotel had a great location about 4 miles from the race site and Montreal Casino. Check-in: Flawless, the bi-lingual staff are eager to help, knowledgeable, and friendly. Each night of your stay comes with two free drink coupons for the managers reception, and a breakfast pass. Room was ready as promised, stayed on the 8th floor. My room was a king-size bed, pull out couch, desk area, front closet, with a large tub and shower, full refrigerator, micowave, and plenty of cabinet space. Parking: They have there own, which is under the hotel. Parking is $25.00 USD including taxes. This is the going parking rate. Like most Montreal garages, it's tight, be aware of the parking posts as you pull in. Elevators on each level will take you to the lobby and upper floors. You do have to swipe your hotel room key, to gain access to the upper floors, this is a security measure. 24 hours access to your car and the garage.

Inside the convention center are multiple shops and food options. You can gain easy access to the major highway, by taking a right out of the hotel garage, traveling 3 blocks and enter Rt. 720, on your left, this will bring you to Rt. 10 the major route thru Montreal. The hotel is located on the edge of \"Old Montreal\", an easy walk, highlights include the Notre-Dame Basilica ( a must see) quaint shops and restaurants. St. Patricks Basilica. St Catherine St./McGill University, would be a hefty walk, better to take the Metro, or taxi. Manager's Reception and Breakfast: Both are included with your stay, they take place in the lobby of the hotel. You are issued two drinks coupons for the manger's reception, and a pass for the buffett type of breakfast, both are well run.

Due to the constraints there was capacity issues in the lobby and elevators when a large group checked in, causing significant delays to access the rooms. The food quality during the morning buffet was relatively low quality. Also as space seems constrained the flow of the buffet is best described as anarchy.

The woman at the desk was very helpful and nice, and took us up to see a room on the 5th floor. Unfortunately, the noise level was about the same. Ultimately, we decided we couldn't stay there, and switched to a hotel up the street. They must have much thicker windows, because there was no street noise. The staff at the Embassy Suites were all very nice, and tried to be helpful. If you're sensitive to noise, however, stay elsewhere. If you're not, this is a good choice.

The room was not yet ready, so we waited. Within a few minutes we were told to go up. The room, although large, and somewhat newly furnished, was so filthy that I was gagging as I walked on the carpet. The problem was with the carpet and tile surfaces. The carpet had been so stained and spilled-upon, that apparently even carpet cleaners cannot clean it. Looks to me like it should just be ripped out. Needless to say, no one would want to walk on it in bare feet. The kitchen and bath tile surfaces had not been mopped since the previous occupant, whiich was disturbing. There were two light bulbs out in crutial light fixtures. The bedroom reading light was more of an \"ambiance\" light, with not nearly enough light to read in bed. In addition, the toilet seat was barely hanging on by a thread, apparently some screws needed to be tightened. I called the front desk, and they agreed to send someone to \"freshen up\" the room. That person used a dirty mop and swiped a bit at the kitchen floor and by no means gave it a good cleaning. Then he took a small carpet cleaner and ran one or two passes over the worst stains in front of the TV area. In taking the carpet machine back out he managed to leave black tracks all across the some-what clean kitchen floor. In disgust, I finally went down to the front desk to talk to the manager. She was very agreeable, offering us some compensation via parking fees, and hopes to move us into a cleaner room tomorrow. I have trouble believing that there is a clean room in this hotel, but I remain optomistic that tomorrow night will find us in a less disgusting environment.

Dominique at the front desk seemed rather inexperienced. We left a message for the manager and went to the King room. It was terrible. The closets did not open and the sofa bed was rock hard. We had a 7:00 pm dinner reservation so we left hoping when we returned we could change rooms. Luckily when we got back they \"found\" a twin room with 2 beds. We had contemplated staying only one night and moving to the Westin or another place for the second night. The second room was better but the hotel itself was just average. I am not expecting a lot for an Embassy Suites but we were underwhelmed. Lots of people in the lobby drinking. I guess it was the free cocktails. We drink but that is not a draw for us. It kind of seemed like a party scene. Perhaps over the weekends the crowd is different. The beds were very comfortable but the view outside the window was of an office building where you could see papers and computers. The free wifi worked pretty well but it does work in the lobby. The location is perfect as we could walk to Old Montreal. I tried to find a pharmacy nearby you we had to walk about 20 minutes northwest. Hotel breakfast was good with fresh omelettes. Emilie, the hotel manager did apologize to our room problem the next day when I was outside trying to get a taxi. Overall I would chose another place for a future visit to Montreal. We stumpled upon Le Crystal Hotel when we were looking for a restaurant. It was beautiful and more our style. My main reason for booking the Embassy Suites was to acrue my yearly qualification of 4 separate hotel stays for my Hilton Honors Silver VIP. I still need 2 more stays before December 31.

The main reason we chose it was for the space. The room was very well appointed with extremely modern fittings. A few of the lights did not work for a start, but maintenance came to fix most of them. It was useful having the small kitchenette, but we found it weird that no cutlery or crockery were provided with it. On arrival, we had to ask for simple things such as spoons and saucers. When we asked reception why this was, they said they don't provide anything in the room and that you just have to ask for what you want. It worked fine, but we just expected that these simple items would be stocked in the kitchen. The bathroom was extremely large and well-lit, with ample mirrors (from experience this is useful when more than 1 person is trying to get ready!!). It had access from the bedroom, as well as the living room. There is a large jacuzzi in the bathroom, but we did not use it. There was also a self-service laundry in the basement, which was very useful. The lobby had a small business centre with 3 computers offering free internet and a printer. I was able to check my email but noticed that the hotel's server had blocked some sites like Facebook, which was kind of annoying. The internet speed was also pretty slow, but since it was free and I only used it for 10 min a day, it was bearable. The restaurant on site was very nice. Although on some days the breakfast was a complete shambles. Part of our stay coincided with the Labour Day long weekend, and on those days it was just like a mass feeding frenzy and really quite disgusting. LOTS of kids running around, food thrown on the floor etc. Not enough room to sit and lots of people ended up taking their trays up to their room. Once the weekend was over, it was noticeably quieter, however. In terms of the food itself, they offered the standard mini cereal boxes, toast, fruit, omlettes to order, fried eggs to order...one day the chef was able to do me poached eggs as well. The manager's reception from 5.30pm-7.30pm was a nice touch. The food normally consisted of corn chips, salsa and celery sticks, and certain beverages were also available for free. We also used the restaurant for dinner and found it to be nice most of the time. We did have one incident where the dish was not satisfactory and had to be sent back, but all in all, it was ok. Over the stay, I tried the salmon, chicken, steak and toasted sandwich. Huge serves, good quality in general, and good value for money. And it also stayed open til quite late, which was great when we arrived from the airport hungry at 10.30pm. The hotel's location is excellent. About a 5 min walk to the Old Town, and about 15 min or so to St Catherine street where the shops are. There is a convenience store inside the train station about 2 min down the street (you have to go into the conference centre, so it's a bit hard to find). We didn't try the metro, but it was also close by. The concierge in the lobby helped us arrange a half-day tour of the city and a full-day tour to Quebec City.

Montreal did not have a lot of options that would accommodate us in one room, but the Embassy Suites offered good-sized rooms with a King & sofabed and a rollaway could be ordered for an additional cost. There was a kitchen area with a nice frig, dishwasher, etc... but no dishes/utensils/pans, etc so it was somewhat useless. The unit was quite upscale with granite counters, nice bathroom fixtures, etc.. It appeared to have been built for another purpose: perhaps a longer-stay hotel or a an apt building. The kitchen area was really just wasted space, since there was no way to use the appliances unless we brought our own dishes. The King bed was separated from the rest of the unit with sliding doors, so it offered a \"private bedroom\", which was nice so we could use both TVs. The room was quiet, even with a full hotel. The breakfast offered a full range of items, some better than others. My primary complaint is that on the weekends, it was chaotic, with long lines for the grill blocking the other items and things ran out regularly (butter, coffee, OJ, steam table items). On the weekdays, the atmosphere was calmer and more orderly. They appeared to offer the same items every day, but there were so many choices, it was okay. I loved the small croissants!

I did not quite understand what that implies, but I was too tired to further investigate and just wanted to get to the room and rest. Then I realized they made a mistake with my reservation. The excuse I got was that they have trouble accommodating to HH Diamond members. How is this acceptable? The front desk manager said I should have called the HH Diamond line 24 hours ahead to request the type of room I reserved online two weeks prior. This is a first!! How was I supposed to know that THIS hotel has trouble accommodating to my reservation ahead of time? After being on the phone for over half an hour, he finally accommodated and gave me what I have asked for in the first place. THIS hotel throws in a complimentary breakfast for all guests which is a nice touch, but the restaurant was terribly under-staffed. Tables were unclean, dishes were piling up everywhere and utensils were dirty. Needless to say the eating experience was quite pleasant. The night prior to leaving town, I called reception to request a late check out. The evening staff rudely told me to call back the next day because it cannot be done. This, in my mind, is someone who either does not want to be bothered or is not properly trained to do his job. To top it off, my invoice came back with over $50 additional charges. I was not the only guest with billing issues as there were a few people I saw with corrected bills in their hands. When I requested the front desk to amend it, it took a long time to finally get it resolved. During this time, I looked around and it became clear to me that all the problems I encountered throughout my stay at THIS hotel were attributed to extremely poor hotel management.

It is very highly rate on Tripadvisor, and although we generally enjoyed our stay my wife and I think the Embassy Suites is a bit overrated. I'm going to break this review into sections, as I believe that will be easier to follow and may be more helpful to others. Location: The location is decent, not great (as others have stated). It's a moderate walk (about 15 minutes) to the main area of Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) on Rue Saint Paul and a long walk (25+ minutes) to the main area of downtown towards Rue Saint Catherine and Rue Crescent. If you are looking for a hotel close to View Montreal (which is the area we preferred in Montreal), the Saint Sulpice is probably your best bet. If you are looking for a hotel near downtown, look to the Loews. I should note hear that the Embassy Suites is located on the same street as the Westin and InterContinental....and fairly close to the W. The Embassy is better located and less expensive than those three in our opinion. Front Desk/Concierge: The staff at the Embassy Suites were outstanding. One of the concierge (Frederik?) was particularly helpful. While we're not 100% sure of his name, he definitely resembles Hugh Grant in terms of appearance. All the staff were friendly, helpful, and efficient. Breakfast/Cocktail Hour/Room Service: The breakfast was complimentary, but was less well organized than other Embassy Suites we have stayed at. There was an omelette station, bacon, sausage, and some croissants, but there were no pastries, pancakes, or other items we're used to seeing at an Embassy Suites (at least the two days we went down for breakfast). I should also note that during the week breakfast ends at 9:30AM, which is early for some people that are on vacation. The cocktail hour was nice and the service was good. You get two drink coupons a day, but many guests that are departing will offer you more. The service was good. Room Service was fast and the food was decent; however the menu is a bit limited. There's no stand alone restaurant at the property, which would have been nice a couple of the days for lunch. Rooms: We were first placed in a corner King instead of a Custom King (which we had reserved). The staff were completely up front about this and said to come down if we were not satisfied and they would place us in a custom king. We did end up switching to the custom King, as it was much nicer and roomier in our opinion. Our room was on the 3rd floor facing the street. Please do yourself a favor and do not accept a room facing the street; definitely not on on the first five or six floors. The traffic outside was very loud at times and would often wake us. Yes, we could have moved our room. But we had already unpacked everything and didn't want to go through the hassle...which was a mistake. The Embassy Suites could certainly invest in some thicker glass, which would definitely improve its guests experience. The custom king itself looks exactly as pictured on the website. It's a nice room, but for almost $200/night (including all the taxes and fees) we expected it to be a bit more taken care of. There were stains on the carpet and some of the furniture is starting to look a bit worn. The bathroom was also large, but the shower is tiny and the water pressure is not great. Parking: The fee is about $24/night + tax and the garage is very tight and difficult to navigate in. I'd recommend parking elsewhere. Overall: It's a mixed review for us. Probably a solid B if we were giving it a grade. I would have no problems recommending the Embassy Suites if the rate is under $200; and would note the actual location and the traffic issues. However, we would probably stay in Old Montreal at the Le Saint-Sulpice or another hotel if our travels take us to Montreal again.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is infested with spiders...\u201d", "Author": "Bennyblanco111", "ReviewID": "UR75849344", "Content": "This hotel is infested with spiders everywhere.

I stayed 5 nights, and I would say the best part was the suite -- really felt like I was renting an apartment rather than a hotel room. Its central urban location is ideal, directly across the street from the convention center, and on the northern edge of old town. It's really an easy and safe walk to most places you are likely to go in the central Montreal area. A metro station is one block away. Unlike most E Suites, there is no atrium here. The lobby is small and efficient, not lavish. This building used to be condos (I think) and so each room is really a small apartment, with a separate kitchen, living area, bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom is huge by hotel standards and mine included a large whirlpool tub plus a walk-in shower. There were two LCD TVs. My room on the back (south) side was very quiet, but it was off-street and the view was limited to the office building across the courtyard. A room on the north (street) side will be more scenic (and probably more expensive), but you'll likely get some street noise. Also should mention that I was visiting during a heat wave in early July, and the air conditioning worked great. My room was very comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful in the usual Canadian way (ie, more European than American), and I encountered no problems. There is the standard manager's reception and hot breakfast like at all E Suites; it's nothing spectacular but it is complimentary. It does get a little crazy in the lobby/dining area during those times so consider arriving early. Internet is $10/night in your room, but free in the lobby area, so you can easily check your email while enjoying a complimentary beer each evening and not have to pay for it in your room. There is parking underground, but presumably expensive. In short, you'll give up a bit of luxury (say compared to the Westin or Intercontinental, both just a block down the street) in exchange for a very comfortable and functional room. If you're seeking an opulent lobby or creative restaurant, this isn't the place.

The room carpet could have used a cleaning. The customer service that we received from the entire staff was just wonderful! That is generally a very rare thing these days.

Unfortunately, the hotel restaurant and lobby did not have the same type of cooling. The food at the hotel restaurant is great, and that surprised us as well., but hot evenings and lack of air did force us to eat elsewhere for dinner a couple of nights, and order room service (from the restaurant) on a another night.

The suite was clean and comfortable and included a kitchen with large fridge, microwave, and dishwasher. The living room had a fireplace and pull-out bed, which my son used. There was a separate bedroom and huge bathroom, accessible from both the bedroom and the living area, with shower and Jacuzzi. The breakfast was wonderful, offering a huge selection of cereals, yogurt, pastries, fruits, pancakes, bacon, sausages, and made-to-order eggs--something to suit every taste. Another bonus, as previously mentioned, was the nightly manager's reception that offered each guest nibbles (veggies and dips, tortillas and salsa, and pretzels) to accompany the two free drinks. Now, one might expect that because the drink was free, it would be small or somewhat diluted. Not so ... my red wine glass was filled to the brim, and there was no skimping on the liquor in hubby's mixed drink either. My only complaint (well, not really a complaint) was that I didn't sleep at all the first night (<nuit blanche>!) because of the traffic noise, which could be heard from our sixth floor room that faced the street. In all fairness, this was not the fault of the hotel, and I am a particularly light sleeper. I asked if another suite was available, and they would happily have moved us to another one had it not been for the fact that they were fully booked for the weekend. I understood that it wasn't possible but really appreciated their trying to accommodate my request and providing me with some ear plugs, which helped me to sleep well for the rest of our stay!

It was more amazing than the reports I received from my colleagues! I had no idea how big the rooms were and the bathroom was huge! We (hubby and 17 year old daughter) had a suite with a separate bedroom for the adults, daughter on the pull out couch in the living room/kitchen area. This was a great set up as we had our privacy with sliding doors, our own TV and she had her own TV in the living room area. Not that you're in Montreal to watch TV but it was just nice to have our own space at the end of the day and unwind. You could seriously have a party in the bathroom and the jacuzzi tub was great after 2 days of walking! The location is great, so close to the old town and close enough to the downtown area too. Notre Dame is just around the corner. I liked that you could easily walk to the downtown area almost the entire way via the underground pathways! That is really cool, especially when it was raining. Just ask the concierge for directions. The room was spotless too. That is so important to us. I am so tired of going to hotels, only to be disappointed by a dirty room or those inconspicuous hairs (UGH!) you find hiding in bathrooms. I never felt like i was going to be surprised with something nasty on the toilet or under the sheets. We do a lot of travelling and I've seen some pretty gross things! Even the kitchen area was spotless, the fridge, cupboards and sink immaculate. Breakfast was included and it was good. There was something there for everyone, as far as our family is concerned. We had such a great time In Montreal and would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone! You won't be disappointed. And let my finish by saying it was soooo quiet for sleeping. Nothing worse than going to a noisy hotel when you're trying to relax and enjoy your vacation. Never heard a peep ever from the hallway/neighbours!

The bathtub/jacuzzi was a delight after a long day walking in downtown and beautiful Old Montreal. The hotel is located ideally close to Old Montreal, and downtown is not too far off.

Having 2 teens and one tween, we generally book 2 suites. Both suites were terrific. We had a king suite and the kids had a 2-queen bed room, so the teenage girls took the bedroom and our son had the pullout sofa and living room to himself. The kitchens and bathrooms are great: kitchens have good size fridge, microwave and sink, bathrooms have showers (kind of small) but really nice jacuzzi tub. A really nice touch! We stay at Embassy Suites wherever we travel, in part for the breakfast and the manager's reception in the evening. With three growing teens, having the breakfast thrown in the mix saves a bundle of money. We were not disappointed here. Plenty of choices, from fresh fruit and yogurt, to made-to-order omelettes, eggs and pancakes, and yummy pastries. And all the bacon an 11 year old boy could eat. :) Do not miss the little croissants with chocolate! My only comment here was that there was no decaf coffee or decaf tea, but after all, you are in Montreal! Manager's reception was also nice, plenty of snacks and tasty cocktails. Location is all important as well. Our intention was to park the car on Friday when we got there and leave it in the parking garage until departure on Monday. You are a very short walk from Old Montreal, Notre Dame, Montreal Science Center, and Planetarium. Chinatown is also just a short walk away. Need to explore something further away? The metro station at Place' de Armes is just across the street--make sure to hop on it and zoom to the Underground City. Montreal's Metro is very fast! The concierge on duty that weekend was so very helpful, from guiding us to family friendly restaurants that had kid's food that picky eaters would eat, to directing us to where we might be able to look at some fur coats, to providing us with all the maps we could possibly need. Minor complaints: the parking garage is fairly difficult to find on Saint Antoine. Even my husband, who has travelled many times to Montreal, had to make several loops around until we finally found it, with all the one-way streets. Also, this particular weekend, the hotel was very packed (perhaps for Valentine's day) and one of the elevators was not working on two separate days, which created some congestion in the lobby.

Steps away from Old Montreal and Chinatown and walking distance to the rest of downtown. There was also great perks: included hot breakfst and drink tickets during happy hour.

We actually had a different hotel booked when a deal came through on Travelzoo for the Embassy Suites by Hilton that was a little cheaper than the original one we'd booked so we switched bookings. I'm glad we did. The square where we would have been staying was bogged down with construction and it would have been noisy and dusty all week. Embassy Suites is on Rue San Antoine right across from the Convention Centre, Palais de Congress, which includes a Metro stop and gateway to the underground network. You walk up a short incline beside the hotel and you're standing across from Notre Dame Basilica and have Old Montreal at your feet, with shops and restaurants and all the old streets and buildings. You're spoiled for choice! On the other side of the hotel, you're a block or two from Chinatown and Only a few blocks from St. Catherine's street going north and the Bell Centre going west. We walked most places and only took the Metro a couple of times. The hotel itself was clean and the staff were always helpful. The suite was a King suite with the bed in a seperated \"room\" that you could close off with sliding doors. The bed was quite comfy and the pillows awesome! I think the living room couch was a sofa bed, as well. The bathroom was large and it had a jacuzzi tub. I couldn't figure out how to turn it on but hit the control by accident so that was sorted! Plenty of hot water, lots of towels and soaps. They brought up some dishes and cutlery but you do have to ask for that. We didn't bother getting the dishwasher unlocked because we weren't planning on cooking, just using the microwave for reheating and we washed up coffee cups by hand. Having read the reviews, I already knew to bring my own dishcloth and towel for that.We didn't see a supermarket nearby but there is a convenience store in the convention centre and a couple in Old Montreal as well. Breakfast was included and it was a full cooked breakfast if you wanted. You could have your eggs any way you wanted and if you want omelets, you put the ingredients you choose into a little bowl and hand it to one of the chefs. There is fresh fruit, croissants and pastries, bagels, toast, cereal (a couple of choices, in little packets), juices, coffee and tea ( though my partner thought the coffee was a bit on the weak side). Every night there is a \"manager's reception\" and they give you vouchers for two free drinks per adult guest. We took advantage of this a couple of nights. Only one caveat, though, the only beer that is covered by the free vouchers is Keith's draft on tap. Other than that, all mixed drinks and, I think, glasses of wine are included. We had a couple of cocktails that would have cost $12 to buy so I don't know why they won't include bottled or other types of beer in the free drinks but it doesn't really matter. As i said before, the staff was always helpful and friendly and any questions asked were cheerfully answered. The concierges were great help too, though one did direct us to a restaurant in Old Montreal that was only open at lunch on that particular day. Oops! There's free wifi in the hotel lobby and i was able to get it in the suite once or twice if i was still connected from being in the lobby but usually it wanted a log in password. I didn't bother calling to get that because i only have an iPod touch anyway, not a laptop so it wasn't a major consideration. Apparently there is a temporary fitness centre in one of the suites on the second floor. I didn't see it but i imagine it's pretty basic. I don't think parking is free but there is parking beneath the hotel and there is a laundry facility on one of the parking levels too with coin operated machines. It feels a bit remote though, i am not sure i'd feel all that comfortable using it on my own. There is a small business center that is free for guests to use, with two PCs though some websites are blocked (social networking ones). The restaurant is basic, and doubles as the bar and breakfast room. Room service choice isn't extensive but it covers the basics. We had a very nice burger and fries which was very reasonably priced considering how expensive room service food usually is.

Kitchen have all stainless steel appliances and dishes, utensils, for 2 with a modest array of pots & pans (though no sponges, dish soap or kitchen towels). 2) Breakfast was also in line with others in the chain. We saw no lenghty lines nor lack of breakfast items as described in some reviews. Having stayed Thurs, Fri & Sat I think we got a fair sample of both weekday and weekend crowds. Manager's nightly reception was also the standard exemplary Embassy Suite variety. 3) All the staff was friendly and helpful especially the breakfast and reception manager and concierge. 4) We saw no overcrowding at the 2 elevators as someone else had mentioned. 5) The 2 things which puzzled us were the funky room key swiping mechanism in the elevator (never did figure out the function) and the opposite-side- of- the-road traffic pattern in the basement garage (why?). 6) All in all we found the hotel far better than a number of the more negative reviews found by us before our trip.

The Montreal Embassy is very centrally located just a few blocks from Vieux Montreal and just steps from the Metro (Place d'Arms stop) and the Underground City, which our 9-year-old son loved. Our room was smaller than other Embassy hotels we've visited, but much more luxuriously appointed, with a granite/stainless kitchen with full fridge and freezer, beautiful bathroom with jetted tub and above-mounted sink, and cute pocket doors to the small bedroom. Our room was clean but housekeeping was a bit iffy -- glasses not replaced, stuff on the bathroom counter not straightened. Unlike other Embassys, the rooms are not around a central courtyard, and the lobby is very small and narrow. Some outdoor seating helps, but seating is at a premium at breakfast and the evening manager's reception. We felt crowded most of the time. The two free drinks and free snacks are very generous -- we never used all the drink coupons. Our biggest complaint: the elevator situation is terrible. There are two guest elevators and a staff elevator. Mid-way through our stay, one passenger elevator broke; it was quickly fixed and then the staff elevator broke. We could not find stairs that go to the lobby -- we tried one and it went to the basement (though we never asked, so maybe the other staircase would work). One morning, I forgot my camera, and going back up and then down again took 15 minutes. Another morning, there was a 10-minute line for the elevator. (Yes, a line, like at an amusement park.) Air conditioning was also spotty in the elevator and hallways; our room was fine, though others I talked to had problems with it shutting off. That added to the crowded, cattle-call feel of the hotel. As others have mentioned, the breakfast waits are long, especially on the weekends. On weekdays, go to breakfast before 8:30am to beat the crowd. On weekends, there was a long line even at 8am. The staff is very nice but cannot keep up with demand -- bowls were missing, no milk for coffee, etc. However, the food is very good and much better than the typical Embassy breakfast. And it's included, which is a huge money-saver in this expensive city. The hotel has a concierge desk, and they gave us great advice about visiting a farmer's market (Jean Talon).

First off, the rooms are huge and utterly gorgeous! Simply put, these are apartments, not standard hotel rooms. Floor-to-ceiling windows, central climate control (more on this shortly), a huge in-room jacuzzi-style bathtub -- for one in my room, for 2 in the larger fireplace suites -- and a great kitchen. The most glaring problem is the breakfast situation. It really is as dire as depicted. There is a cafeteria-style lineup that is simply not needed, as its only purpose is for custom-cooked eggs/omlettes. If you arrive after 8:30 for breakfast, be prepared to queue for around half an hour. As you make your way down the line, you are blocking access to plates, trays, cutlery (they are perpetually short of knives, it would seem) and the bowls of fresh fruit. At the end of the line you'll find three chafing dishes (breakfast potatoes, bacon and saussages), two harried cooks managing 5 pans and a pancake dispensary at the far end. There are three more identically-full chafing dishes at the far end of the dining room but they are not signed in any way and most guests don't know of their existance. I would *strongly* recommend they consider ripping out the cafeteria-line, put three large tables for the self-serve chafing dishes and a fourth specifically for eggs/omlettes, as is done in almost every other hotel I've stayed in. My second gripe was the air conditioning. It's on a motion detector and hard-set to default to 20 degrees. Great for energy conservation when the room is unoccupied -- not so great when you need it to be cold to sleep...and since you're not moving around, the detector shuts the A/C off and you wake up in a stuffy hot room at 3am. It took three nights for their maintenance staff to resolve this issue but in the end it was fixed, and my bill was reduced by a fair amount for the inconvenience. The corridor on our floor (6th) wase *not* air conditioned and were very stuffy, also. The next issue was Internet connectivity. There were many times my wife and I were unable to connect, either from her Mac or my XP box, both in-room or in the lobby. Even when connected, it was very slow. Since we were part of a convention whose guests are highly 'Net-savvy, I'd say we maxed out their bandwidth in short order. What few problems we did encounter were more than made up for by the fanstastic staff. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, from the Concierge to the chamber-maids, were wonderful and made us feel welcome. This is a model staff that every hotel in the industry should strive to emulate, and I compliment whoever in management has set the bar so very high in staff training. You got it right, plain and simple, and we *will* be back! The only thing that would make it perfect for us would be a fitness centre with pool and jacuzzi.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester,MA", "Title": "\u201cWow\u201d", "Author": "Cliff0rd", "ReviewID": "UR37193121", "Content": "We had a very enjoyable stay.

We ordered room service a couple times--the food was great and service was quite prompt. Self-parking was a big plus, too. I much prefer it to valet. There are only two elevators serving 11 guest floors and 5 parking levels, so there was sometimes a wait. One of elevators was not working one morning, and the management staff were telling guests they could use the nearby service elevator. That message was not being conveyed to the rest of the staff, however, resulting in some confusion. I didn't much care for the restaurant scene in Old Montreal nearby. The restaurants were crowded, pricey, and very tourist-oriented. On my next trip to Montreal, I'll focus more on the restaurants on Rue Ste. Catherine. Only areas for improvement were that the supplies of plates, glassware, etc. in the kitchen were quite limited, and the TV's, though flat-panel, only received analog channels (no high-def).

I booked a room for 3 adults and 1 child. Our room is lovely and modern. The fireplace is all-electric, really more like a picture of a fire that emits heat than an actual FIREplace. The kitchen is disappointing; though it has a very nice refrigerator it's not really a kitchen. It's more of a wet-bar with a microwave and fridge and lots of empty cabinets. Our dishwasher happened to be unlocked when we arrived (others have said theirs were locked). I have not yet tried the lovely jacuzzi tub in the spacious bathroom. The shower is nice; I wish it were a bit larger and had someplace to hang the towels where they'd stay dry, but you could reach them from inside. I've taken to placing them on the rolling vanity chair before I enter. The hotel will bring you dishes if you ask but they really don't seem to understand what \"kitchen things\" mean. When i first asked, they asked me how many people I wanted dishes for. They brought me 4 plates, 4 forks, 4 butter knives, and 4 spoons for 4 people. No bowls, no extra glasses, no service pieces, no microwave cooking pieces. When I asked again later, they brought me some bowls, a cutting board, and a sharp knife, but said they did not have anything like a colander or service pieces. We have asked for dishwasher detergent twice and still have not gotten any. They do arrive promptly with the items that they are willing to bring. I've just given up on asking. When we arrived, there was a wet spot on the carpet. Soon afterward, we realized that the air conditioning was not working. They promptly sent up an engineer who then had to remove 10 or 20 pounds of ICE from the thing. This left an even WETTER spot in the bedroom in front of the bathroom. Yesterday I asked for someone to come and deal with these wet spots. They tried, but the one in front of the bathroom is still wet nearly 2 days later. Quite annoying to step on in bare feet. They provide only 3 sets of towels for the 4 of us. There are no extra towels for use as kitchen towels. If I call for extra towels, they do not replace them. I must call each day to get enough towels for all of us. While they do arrive promptly, it's annoying to have to keep asking over and over for stuff. I feel like I'm calling them twice every day for something... and it's much more annoying to call for something like extra towels over and over when it would be simple for the housekeeper to replace as many towels as she took away. About the internet: we had to file a ticket with their ISP to get the wired internet working in our room. Internet in the rooms requires a code that the front desk will tell you, but there is no way to know that. (A friend told me the code.) Their website says that there ought to be wireless access (as well as wired) in all the suites, but there is no wireless here in suite 507. When we called the front desk, they told us that the suites only have wired access. You can get wireless access in the lobby. Breakfast is served 6:30 to 9:30 on weekdays and 7:30 to 10:30 on weekends. Don't plan on rolling down there at 9 or 10 and getting fed; if the hotel is full the lines get long unless you get there early. They stop serving promptly at 9:30. If you can't get a seat it's okay to bring the stuff up to to your room. You can get made-to-order omelets and eggs. I saw someone with pancakes but don't know how to get them. There is a separate table with breakfast meat & scrambled eggs if you don't want to wait in the big omelet line. Look behind the omelet line for the fresh fruit. Their chocolate croissant are very good, paw around under the regular croissant to find them. There's a toaster if you want your bread, english muffin, or bagel toasted. There's coffee and juice at the bar. My opinion so far: This hotel could be OUTSTANDING if they examined their processes from the guest's point of view. Some simple things that would make my stay much more enjoyable: - Replacing all the towels instead of just providing a standard set of 3 (in a room that 4 people are staying in. Children use at least as many towels as adults, y'know!) - Providing basic kitchen supplies like dishtowels, dish soap, kitchen tools, basic dishes and cutlery by default instead of by demand. At least STOCKING additional supplies like colanders and service pieces for folks who ask. If I wanted to wash and cut up some veggies, how would I do it? - Reorganizing the breakfast area. I should not have to ask a line of people to move aside so I can get some fruit. There only have to be 3 people in line and that area gets blocked. The hotel is OK. You could probably do a lot worse. If you are prepared for a bucket of minor annoyances in an otherwise very nice place, then this is a good choice.

I had the chance to stay a sixth time in less than a year this past week-end at the Embassy Suites in Montreal. Over the past few years, I've tried quite a few other Montreal hotels, including the new Hilton Garden Inn on Sherbrooke, part of the same Hilton family brands and the attitude I got at check-in made me cancel my reservation on the spot and I went back where I should have booked in the first place: this hotel. This stay, once again, proved that this hotel's staff is eager to please and really cares about the guest's well being. The managers I've seen also are ALWAYS on the ball and available. Two of the front desk staff now remember me when I check-in, and by that I mean I don't even need to say my name that they're already typing it in their computers before I even get to the counter. I've never, ever, in my 5 young years of fairly extensive traveling, experienced something like this in a large hotel. Seeing them interact with other guests, everyone is equally well-treated. The service staff during the happy hour are running around on busy Saturdays making sure everyone has one of the free drinks included with all room rates and picking up dirty dishes. The suites are immaculately clean. I won't repeat what everyone else has said about the layout, the pictures speak for themselves. This hotel being relatively new (opened late 2007), there might still be some construction going on behind in the condo tower going up but I've never heard anything during the week-ends. The Westin that was being built next door is also now finished, which should considerably reduce early morning noise on weekdays from now on. Best bet is to ask for a St-Antoine facing suite (if available). The beds are the most comfortable I've found in Montreal. There is just no comparison. Local calls are free, and High speed internet also, if my memory serves me right. Overall, this hotel, with the prime location a mere block from the Notre-Dame basilica and Old Montreal, yet, less than a 5 minute walk from Ste-Catherine, the genuine friendliness of the front desk staff and the competitive rates make this place the only hotel you should consider for your Montreal trip. I've stayed at the Square Phillips, rated #1 in Montreal (last time I checked), but frankly, with the free full breakfast, the 2 drinks per person and much more comfortable mattresses, I'd say this won wins in the suite-hotel category. Give it a try and you'll see how it'll become your home in Montreal (after all, it is like having your own appartment!). Of course, it has some cons, like the kitchen smell that still somehow gets up to the lower floors (although significantly improved situation over last fall) and that promised pool that has been under construction for over a year! now, but the rest more than makes up for it. I rarely do this in my reviews but Embassy Suites management, if you read this, please do make sure you never loose your front desk personel and congratulate them on their hard work.

Our room's air conditioning failed, and the service repairmen came three times to try and fix it, and finally let us know that we would have to open the window. Luckily, it was a nice night. The next morning, he came when we weren't there, and fixed it. They were unfailingly pleasant and helpful. The breakfast is pure madness. I would recommend skipping the omelet station and just go for the buffets (which are quite hidden, look around) or go there as close to closing time as possible. The happy hour drinks were not good.

Just across from the Metro and only a block from Notre Dame in Old Montreal. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite which was absolutely fantastic. The suite was beautifully appointed and very clean. A really good hotel! Our only complaint would be breakfast. The whole organisation of it was a shambles. It was Sunday morning so of course breakfast is busy. But if you want a nice leisurely Sunday breakfast then this is not the place to go! The food was fine but the organisation leaves a lot to be desired!!! Upon arrival we spoke to the waitress who told us to line up for hot food and she would get us a table. We did that, got our food and stood waiting while she frantically ran around doing goodness knows what. So we just found a table for 3 for ourselves and pulled an extra chair to it for the 4 of us. By the time we then got 2 kids organised our hot breakfasts were cold. It would really be better to seat guests before telling them to go and order their hot food! There's no point in lining up guest to order food if you have nowhere to sit them - I saw a few people give up and take the food back to their rooms. Plus they ran out of clean trays and cutlery (probably because people have to leave the restaurant with their food due to the lack of tables)", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201c#1 in Montreal.

This was our second stay as we had been here for a similar event in January earlier this year. The Embassy Suites is located right accross the street from the Palais Du Congres. To give you an idea how close it is, when our tournament went on supper break for one hour, I was able to leave the 3rd level where the tournament was held, and in less than five minutes, I was in my room. It was less than one minute to walk from door to door across Saint Antoine St. You can not ask for better if you are in Montreal for an event at the Palais Du Congres. This hotel is very very modern and clearly has been recently renovated. We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had a seperate bedroom (with King Size), which had french doors that opened up to enter the room. You could access the HUGE bathroom from either the bedroom or the main area of the room. The room had a full kitchen including full size fridge and freezer, microwave, sink, dishwasher, coffee machine and cupboard space that you wouldnt believe. There was no stove in this room though. There are no plates or cutlery in the room, but if you request them, they will supply it all. The bathroom is unbelievable. A two person (side by side) jet tub. This thing is huge and is the greatest addition possible. At the end of the day (or anytime) this thing is so relaxing. It is huge and has an optional underwater light which is also cool. There is also a very nice stand up shower with excellent water pressure. A nice little corner vanity (which the wife loved!) and a very beautiful modern sink and counter area. You will not want to leave. In the main living room area, you have a pull out couch that is facing a large wall mounted LCD tv, which is located directly above a very nice electric fireplace. In front of the bedroom doors, there is a very nice desk and office chair for your business needs. I did not have a computer with me, but all the hook ups for high speed were there. In the bedroom, the most confortable king size bed was situated directly in front of yet another wall mounted LCD tv!!!!!!! Again in here, there was so much closet and dresser space, you could easily move in to this place for good. Would be an amazing apartment for sure. Another thing that we love about this place is the free breakfast buffet. I mean just up the road at the Delta Centre Ville, you pay 22.99 plus tax per person for their buffet. This one is included with the room! You can have custom omelettes made by a group of chefs that are lined up waiting for your custom order. You do not see this at other hotels. The other basic hot buffet breakfast items are all there too, but this omelette makes this buffet extra special. No bill at the end is nice too!!! Oh did I mention that you get two free drinks at the bar per person per day included with your room!!! They have to be used at a specific cocktail hour, which I believe is from 5:30 to 7:30, but if you have ever had a drink in a hotel bar, you know that this is a significant savings, which again is complimentary. Parking is underground and you always have in and out access. Elevators are very quick coming and going from the parking area. The price is 19 per day, but again, for downtown Montreal it is a fair price. At the Delta and Queen Elizabeth, you pay up to 22 per day. At least you have easy access to your vehicle here and the location is secure. I also noticed that there is a laundy centre with several washers and dryers for hotel guests with detergent and fabric softener available at the front desk. The staff here are amazing too. The dedication to customer service starts at the top. The manager, Francois went out of his way to make sure we had an amazing stay. Where else would you actually have contact with a manager?? And the front desk staff were also very friendly and helpful. It goes on and on. From the administative staff to the concierge who is always at your service, to the cleaning staff, I found no weak spots in regards to the staff of this hotel. All in all, we have found our new favorite hotel in Montreal, hands down. We will only stay here from now on.

The location can't be beat--the Place des Armes metro stop is just a block away, and Vieux Montreal is just a few minutes' walk away. An excellent base for family touring. The only weak area here was breakfast. Other reviews have pointed out that the line for the made-to-order omelets is in the way of the fruit table, and prior to the trip, that didn't seem like such a big problem. But the logistics of breakfast were quite poor. On Saturday morning, between 9-9:30, the line for omelets actually stretched out of the restaurant area and across the elevator lobby, and the seating area was quite crowded. The line was so dense that it was difficult for people to get at the fruit. The tea water wasn't really warm enough to hold temperature in the cup at the table, so my tea would be cold halfway through the meal, and the potatoes were also not really warm enough. The pastries and cereal were great (and easily accessible),but the hotel really needs to rethink how to get guests access to breakfast in a smoother manner.

The reception staff was polite, friendly and helpful. Like other Embassy Suites, there is an element of self-serve but this is to be expected. The rooms are among the best furnished and designed of the Embassy Suites that we have visited. The kitchens features a full-size fridge as well as a dishwasher, double sink, coffee maker and microwave. The bathroom features a large Jacuzzi tub and separate shower stall. There was a convenient counter overhang in the kitchen with a couple of bar stools that replaced the need for a dining table. There were two flat screen TVs and other nice touches. The location is excellent with the metro/subway station nearby and easy road access to the sights. The hotel address puts the visitor within walking distance to the sights and eateries of Old Montreal and Chinatown. But there were a few downsides at this hotel. The morning breakfast is ample but chaotic. Service is uneven at best and grumpy at worst. The organization of breakfast is clumsy with long lines for the omelettes and pancakes with shortfalls in the freshly baked foods; e.g. croissants. The lines also block access to the plates, cutlery, fruit and yogurt. Another quibble is with the othewise excellent kitchen in the suite where there is ample cupboard space but no utensils, plates or cutlery provided. This is a city hotel with expected compromises.

We were in Room 912. Lets start with the two negatives and get those out of the way. First negative was the view....interior view looking down to driveway and building under construction (basically, no view). Not a big deal, since we weren't there to look at hotel views. Secondly, one evening, despite the \"no smoking\" policy, we were waken by the STRONG smell of cigarette smoke. In fact it was so bad, I actually looked out the hallway at 2AM to see if smoke was visable, for fear there might actually be a fire. We never reported it to anyone because we see that as a rude guest problem, and not something that management can control (we did however write them an e-mail afterwards in the hopes that maybe the ventilation system could be examined). That's it for the negatives. The mediocrity was the breakfast buffet. The variety was good. Most of the quality was fairly good to average (frozen breakfast potatoes, pre-mixed egg mix for ommlettes, etc.). After about two days of the same thing, you've had enough and want something different. The rest is all quite positive. First, we would definately return to this hotel if we needed to return to Montreal. It is literally around the corner from Old Montreal, across the street from a Metro station for easy transportation, modern, immaculately clean, and staffed by some amazing people who are so very helpful! One of the front desk staff, Camilla, was just a huge stand-out for us. She made restaurant reservations/recommendations, assistance with picking tours, greeted us by name, and did everything with genuine warmth and hospitality (it was clear that she loves her job and it wasn't just something she \"is expected to do.\" Being about one year old, everything is in tip-top shape. The lobby is a little small for a hotel of this size. The business center was very nice, wih three terminals, printer access, and a private key-access room with which to use the internet. As for the rooms, they were really quite nice. It was more like having a small loft apartment in the city than a hotel room. The faeux fireplace doesn't put out much heat, but it was a nice touch on chilly evenings. Folks complained in previous reviews that the dishwasher doesn't open and that the hotel does not supply dishes/supplies. Had they read the sign in the kitchen, it indicates that, if the front desk is called, they can unlock the appliances and bring a supply of dishes and utensils. Everything in the suite was immaculately clean, in excellent repair. Other than the previously mentioned smell of smoke, we had absolutely no complaints about this hotel! On caveat... The hotel staff like to recommend Bonaparte restaurant (which is down the street and affiliated with a different hotel). We had dinner there...it was expensive, and frankly both of our dishes were a little bland (Filet of Sole, and Rack of Lamb). Even if the prices were not as high as they were, we would not return to this restaurant. In fact, we had a difficult time finding a restaurant that really stood out for us. All of the other ones were good....3-4 stars, I'd say. The best of them was down on St. Paul St. called Vieux Port.

There were lots of upsides to the hotel, and a few, relatively trivial downsides. First, the good. We found the hotel was in excellent shape, as it should have been given that it was less than 2 years old. Our accommodation, a large one-bedroom king suite, overlooked Rue St Antoine, was light, bright and very spacious, and completely insulated us from any noise in the street. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look into the rear-facing suites, but they would only have looked out onto the blank wall of a building behind, and so would not have been so light as ours was. Everything in the suite was spotless, from the kitchen (equipped with a microwave oven, a dishwasher and an enormous refrigerator, but no stove) through the bedroom and living room to the roomy bathroom. The suite was equipped with two flat-screen television sets, and there was more than adequate lighting for activities during the evenings. The king bed was simply magnificent, as were the bed linens and pillows. There was an adequate supply of high-quality towels and toiletries in the bathroom. The breakfast (included in the room rate) was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a better than average cold buffet of cereals, juices, fruits and breads, plus there was a person on hand to cook eggs to your liking, from fried through to self-defined omelette. In the hot buffet, there were pre-cooked scrambled eggs available, together with bacon, sausages and potatoes. The lobby was spacious, nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. Overall a pleasant place to sit for a while and watch the world go by. The reception staff were friendly and very helpful. Each evening, a manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception was held in the lobby/restaurant, at which a free drink was handed out and an array of dips and vegetables was made available \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice after a day of trekking the city. The location of the hotel can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be faulted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less than a 10 minute walk to old Montreal and the old port, and also less than a 10 minute walk to the main shopping area on Rue St Catherine, Chinatown, the Latin Quarter, Museum of Modern Art, the Village and so on. The Place d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Armes metro station (Orange line) is almost directly across the road and from here you can easily get to most of the central area using the Montreal souterrain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the underground network of about 30 Km of walkways connecting shopping areas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfect if its raining or snowing. For the downsides \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not too much. The main problem for us was that despite the presence of the kitchen, and its being advertised as a self-catering accommodation, there was practically zero in the kitchen by way of self-catering equipment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just 4 coffee mugs, 2 water glasses and 2 wine glasses. No cutlery, no crockery, no microwave cooking dishes, nothing. We eventually found out that everything was available from housekeeping if you asked. However, dishwasher detergent seemed not to be available, so the drill was to leave dirty things in the sink and housekeeping would take them away each morning. Big but - housekeeping wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t replace things (including the original complement of mugs and glasses). So, each day you had to ask all over again. This seemed to us to be silly waste of peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time and effort. There was a deal of building activity going on in the immediate area, and this could be noisy and dirty, though we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear anything from our suite. Finally, the concierge function seemed to us to be seldom present, and not very knowledgeable about the city when they were there. We found the front desk to be much more useful.

Found the food acceptable; nothing special, but again, the service was very friendly.

They had a special on King Suites that was equal to or less than the cost of regular rooms at other nearby hotels. Due to a hotel worker strike at the Fairmont (keep an eye out for strikes!), my boss was moved to a hotel far away from the convention center. Since the Suites were so nice and big, I ended up giving my reservation to him and sharing a suite with my coworker who also is my sister. The reception staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The room was extremely nice. Full kitchen with very nice appliances( LG fridge/freezeer, dishwasher, oven...) even some cutlery and a few pots/pans and food storage containers (more could be requested). Sitting area had a pull out couch for an extra bed, LG flatscreen TV, free wireless access. The bedroom had a great King bed and a flatsceen TV. The room could be closed off by sliding wood doors. The bathroom was huge with one entrance from the bedroom and one to the room's entrance hall. It had small glass stand alone shower, a huge two person jacuzzi tub and a vanity area in additon to the sink vanity.The robes povided were OK, but I would have liked something softer/plusher. Toiletries were nice, however we had the small problem of them not being replaced by housekeeping. Once reception was informed, after two days of this occuring, they sent up a nice bag full of extras! A couple comments on room design...The closet locations are a bit odd. The one in the bedroom is tiny with a very small chest of drawers in it. There was not a dresser anywhere. The hall closet was behind the kitchen in a narrow hallway, near thefront door. A room safe was not provided. The only mirrors were in the bathroom. The location was perfect. I only had to walk across the street to get to the convention center. China Town was a short walk one way and Old Town Montreal a short walk the other. You could also easily walk to one of the many underground mall entrances. During my time there, much of Old Town Montreal was under construction, this included the building adjacent to the hotel. I experienced serveral rude awakenings to jackhammers and such right at 7am. Even though we were on the 11th floor, it sounded like they were next door! Good thing I had meetings to get to. The complimentary breakfast was more than I expected. Buffet style, with cereals, breads, eggs, waffles, juices, made to order omlettes....It saved time and money! The evening Manager's Reception was a great touch too, with complimentary selected drinks and some veggies/dip/ pretzels/salsa/chips to snack on. You are given tickets at check-in for both. The one complaint I have about this hotel is their food selection for lunch/dinner. It was extremely limited and not very discriptive...I ordered a ceasar salad for lunch and being vegetarian, was surprised to have it arrive with bacon bits on it. This was not in the discription. Also, the service left much to be desired. Very inattentive. If you wanted anything(to order, your check, refill) you basically had to flag down any nearby waitstaff or manager or go in search of yours. Our waitress mentioned how busy they were as an excuse. It did not make sense. They had two waitresses and a manager working 5 tables (all one to two people, with one larger party). I found this type of service similiar to other Montreal restaruants, but this experience was the most extreme (this is just a brief description). I would strongly recommend against this restaurant for a sit down meal. This was at odds with the attention you receive at the buffet style breakfast or the Manager's reception, but that is probably because those are mostly self-serve and don't require a check. As a side note, I was told other king suites did not have the separate jacuzzi tub, but a tub/shower and there was not cutlery, etc, in the kitchen, so it may need to be requested.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ancaster, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "JagMan88", "ReviewID": "UR20669270", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel last moth for two nights.

It almost felt like a 1 bedroom apartment in the city. Area is a little quitet as we were here during a weekend. There is some construction going on in the area, but I'm sure that it'll look nice when the construction is completed.
