The hotel is convenient and clean but very basic, only the Reception area and the rooms. The rooms were fine, very clean, towels changed every day, smallish shower cubicle but fine for most people. If you just want somewhere to sleep, it will serve you well. The hotel staff were helpful, friendly and courteous and responded to all our requests. Some reviews criticise the street noise, but we didn't find it a problem during the night, the windows were double glazed with hinged blinds which cut out most of the sound, it did get a little louder from 07.30 onwards but wasn't excessive to say it's in the centre of Rome.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot recommend\u201d", "Author": "Ygmd", "ReviewID": "UR126339085", "Content": "Was looking for an hotel to stay for 1 night before leaving Rome. It is located close to the Termini which is good, but beside that... It is a very basic hotel with rooms located on street level!

Don't expect any luxus, however you get everything you need for resting after visiting the town: comfortable bed, toilet with shower, towels changed. The rooms are indeed quite spacious and functional for a 2 stars. Breakfast is not included, they have room service but the staff was also kind in advising us to have breakfast in the good caf\u00e9 in front of the hotel, and warned us that prices at the table are more expensive than prices at the bar counter. Rooms are at ground floor so they are quite noisy because of traffic jams. Well, it belongs to Rome, bring earplugs if you don't have strong sleep. Rooms have air conditioning, which is good also for heating in winter. Minor faults: the fan of the bathroom was quite noisy and the towels are quite thin. Location is very good, from there you get everywhere, on foot, metro or bus. The restaurants around the hotel are not the best ones in Rome, go to Trastevere or ask advice.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brno, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and value\u201d", "Author": "petr_kovar", "ReviewID": "UR118048717", "Content": "Hotel is very well situated, 10 minutes by walk from the Termini station and also all the main sights are reachable on your own (Colloseum cca 35 minutes of walk) The staff is very plesant and willing, rooms offer all the neccesary for people who want to explore the city and not to spend their holiday inside the hotel.

Not a good experience at all! It was noisy, sort of clean, but not exactly (especially the bathroom), no breakfast place etc etc... Unless you are a poor student, don't be cheap! Book a proper hotel!
