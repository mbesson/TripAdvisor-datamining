{"Reviews": [{"Content": "City Residence Firenze (Florence) great family hotel by station This new hotel is right next to the main station in Florence and although not cheap it is in fantastic location (4 mins walk to Duomo, 10 mins to Ponte Vecchio etc.,) View from the top floor family room (which sleeps 4 very comfortably and with 2 en suite bathrooms) is perfect for a family wanting some privacy between parents/kids room without the worry of kids being in completely separate room. The large interconnecting rooms both had flat screen TVS, and plenty of space, safe, and were extremely comfortable and cool. Staff were wonderful and welcoming. We parked out car up for 24 hours for \u9227?4 and overall we were most impressed by the whole hotel. The buffet breakfast (included) is served 7-10am so no need to hurry out. Modern property inside much better than the impression from the street. Entrance a little hard to notice (small blue sign on door next to attractive cake shop!) but that was only criticism we could find!. Will look forward to returning in the future. A great family friendly hotel. We stayed with our 5 year old twins and were made to feel very welcome.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR105342063", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ASCSR"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d1064304-r19354339-City_Residence_Firenze-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "1064304", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
