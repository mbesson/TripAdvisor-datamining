They also provide free internet from either your room or the computer room off the foyer. They are close to a number of restaurants and bars for either local cuisine or your standard North American chains. We two women felt quite safe walking around outside (however, I wouldn't venture down to the beach at night), with many police patrols visible. It's only a $20 taxi ride to downtown Old San Juan.

We decided we'd stay in a nice resort for the first few nights, and downsize for the last 3. Based on mostly good reviews, we chose Hampton Inn & Suites. It wasn't ALL bad, but bad enough for us to check out early, ask for a refund, and go elsewhere When we arrived, we thought it looked quite nice. The lobby is well done. Staff is friendly. We were given a \"non-smoking\" room that reaked of smoke. It was also damp, smelled moldy, had a very strong \"covering-up-bad-smell-with-low cost air-freshened\" smell. It was quite gross. The carpet is a dingy brown, and the rooms are dark. Not much light from the window. We checked diligently for bed bugs and found none (phew!). Bathroom had a bad smell, and tub was DIRTY. We opened the window, but mosquitoes swarmed in . We asked for a screen for the window to air out the room. They do not have screens. We asked to switch rooms. We were told that no other rooms were available. So we stayed the night. They told us that the next day they'd do an air purification treatment in the room. When we came back after being out for 4 hours, there was a small machine in the room , barely making noise, and seemingly not doing much. The smell was overwhelming. They said they couldn't switch our room until the next day. That night, we found an online deal to spend our last night in a luxury resort up the street. That day, a staff member had told us that people before us had complained about that room. The occupants the previous week were smoking. So, the hotel KNEW that the room had a foul odor, yet they did not remedy the issue before putting guests in the room. We checked out early, and at the desk there is a plaque that states that if the customer isnt satisfied they don't have to pay. We were comped one of the nights. I didn't push for both. Staff are friendly, and seemed to understand Side note: LOTS of families with kids. We knew that going in, but just reinforcing that it's a family hotel. I'm not one to complain, and this place wasn't a complete flop.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Charlotte, Florida", "Title": "\u201c3 star hotel in a 1 star neighborhood.\u201d", "Author": "Floridasailor_11", "ReviewID": "UR128295504", "Content": "Room is good.

This property is great --good location, great staff, and nice interiors/rooms --definitely the best Hampton Inn I've stayed at.... and generally nicer than more than 70% of Hilton Hotels I've stayed at. The lobby featured new/modern decor...as did the room. The bed/furnishings were high quality....and the materials in the bathroom (granites and beautiful tile) were too. The room was quiet and very clean --I remarked at how \"fresh\" the room smelled when I first walked in. They provided the typical Hampton Inn breakfast, which included fruits, cereals, carbs, and some hot options which included cheese omelets, bacon, and make-your-own waffles. There was plenty of self-dispensed juice to drink too in addition to coffee. You can eat at table seating, bartop seating, or outdoors by the pool. The pool was nice --large and clean, and featured a swim-up bar to a bar/grill in the rear of the property. The food at the pool bar/grill was top-notch; I was shocked I was eating in a Hampton Inn and shocked I was eating at a pool bar/grill with the type of quality I was enjoying. Bar/grill staff were very friendly. Front desk staff was cheery and helpful. There was an error on my folio at check-out that they promptly fixed. The location is good; a short 2-3 minute walk across the street brings you to the Ritz Carlton, other nearby casinos, or the beach. I felt safe in and around the hotel.

I'm not even joking when I tell you they go out of their way to assist with with anything you need. My room was spacious.

There was a small living room area with TV, couch, chair, coffee table. I had a desk where I could put my laptop and handle business. Everything was clean and tidy. I left a good tip for the chamber maid when I departed. Note: There is a cock-fighting stadium right behind this place. Too bad I didn't get to see a match. There's also a really nice local style food restaurant right next to the stadium. They've got mofongo and a big selection of Puerto Rican food that you might not find anywhere else. Funny thing, it's next to a cock-fighting stadium and they just happen to serve a lot of \"Chicken specials of the day\". How's that for exotic? Just kidding.

I went downstairs and they immediately assigned me another room, this one being on the first floor. All was well the first night but again the housekeeping showed signs of weakness. Two of the four nights we were there we did not receive any washcloths. One of the nights our clean bath towels were draped over the toilet tank instead of on the rack...disgusting. It was also obvious that our sheets were never changed for our four night stay. I find that unacceptable as well. We leave tips every day and are very tidy in our room because we do not like to be a burden on the staff but this was obviously not appreciated. Other than those issues, the hotel is still a good bet. They are under renovation right now but travelers are not inconvenienced by it at all. I believe the renovation is supposed to be completed by the end of November. The free breakfast has been moved from the lobby to a conference room down the hall. Parking is still a bargain at $5 a day. (Other hotels charge between $15 - $20.) The Wifi signal also seemed stronger than on my previous visit in June. I did not have any trouble connecting with my mobile device. This hotel is frequented by many business travelers and airline staff as well. It is not a resort but a solid hotel in the Isla Verde area. I hope they address the housekeeping issues.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muskegon, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNot exactly what it looks like on the website\u201d", "Author": "aproudlocal", "ReviewID": "UR119967556", "Content": "This is a nice hotel and is currently undergoing some renovation/improvements (as of 10/2011) so it should be even nicer, BUT that won't change the fact that this hotel is in a strange, cramped, and less than \"resort like\" neighborhood.

When I went to look at where I had my suitcase on the floor, I found a nest of ants on the corner of the wall. We were all itchy and it was disgusting, we called front desk and right away they sent someone upstairs and they said they would spray something in the room and when we get back it will be fine, I then requested a new room because we all felt uncomfortable. We left and a little while later they called and gave us our new room number. When we got back we had to make sure we cleaned off our suitcases and belongings and went to our new room. (Much Better!)

The bar cooks burgers, hot dogs and few other local items. It's a great little area just just relax and enjoy the tropics after a long flight. The rooms are fairly well kept and the bedding was clean. Even though it's located pretty close to the airport, noise was not a factor while inside. While at the pool, the planes could still be heard, but it's a momentary distraction at best. The hotel has a couple of other nice features like a business center that had 5 computers (great for emailing friends/family and gloating that you have arrived in the Caribbean) and also a self-serve breakfast in the morning. Breakfast alone probably saved the three of us $40. While the hotel is not located very close to Old San Juan (about 15 minutes away), taxi service was easily available. Also, since Hampton is close to the airport, the taxi from the airport was not overly expensive. There are plenty of restaurants and casinos nearby.

With more than a million people in Puerto Rico without electricity and some even without water, the Hampton Inn in San Juan, kept its composure and more importantly, electricity, water, food, entertainment and surprisingly enough, internet service as well. People were fed, attended to and serviced with a smile. Rooms were clean and everything in my room was in perfect order. Remember that the people who work at the hotel are residents of the island and them too, had no power or water. They showed up and displayed their best. The hotel offered a very nice breakfast, had DVD movies showing at the lobby and kept the small but adequate fitness room operating so that people would have a choice and avoid \"cabin fever\".

Check in was fairly quick even though there was a long line-up upon arrival. Parking cost less than $6 tax in for guests.The room was beautifully furnished with top notch furniture and comfortable bedding. The business center had three computers with complimentary internet access (very slow though at times). Complimentary breakfast offered waffles, eggs, sausage, all types of breads, coffee cakes, cereals, fresh fruit, orange juice, and good coffee. Everything was delicious except for the sausage which looked really dry and not too apetizing. Great location, 5 minutes walk from beach and about 15 minutes from airport. Hotel has a beautiful jacuzzi and outdoor pool with pool bar. Pool towels are provided even when we went to the beach. The pool bar also prepared barbecued food and we absolutely LOVED their baby-back ribs made by Jay. Remember that name, cause he is the guy you want behind the grill and who will make the difference in your appreciation of this meal. He is such a pro at this and trust me you won't eat any other ones like these! Chicken burger was also very tasty and juicy as well as their hamburgers. Salad side dish was not very generous, so we ommitted the chips and asked for more greens, which they happily did. Drinks are very cheap.

Both times I've had to complain to management about the lack of cleaniness. After this visit, I'm done giving them chances to redeem themselves. We're an Army family with 5 year old twins and a disable mother (wheelchair bound). We received the news that my father-in-law passed away and we had to make last minute arrangements to travel home to PR for the funeral. I relied on a hotel that we knew would be close to the house, close to the beach for our children and big enough for our entire family. I decided to return to HISSJ. Our first visit back in August of 2010 left us with an uneasy feeling as we had to report blood spatters in the bathroom of our suite. Management took care of it immediately, comped one night and gave us a gift basket with gift cards for the Chili's down the street. Looking back I can only imagine what happened in that bathroom to make them go out of their way to rectify the situation like they did. This visit I called and pleaded with the reservation line and the front desk to provide us with a wheelchair accessible room. \"There's absolutely none available\" was the response I received. I asked for them to let me know if one became available during our stay and even made a note on the online reservation form. The second day of our stay I noticed a swarm of ants in our bathroom. I found that they'd gotten into my daughter's hairbrush and immediately went to the front desk to report it. They offered me the room next door and gave me a key to check it before we moved. Lo and behold, it was a room that had a wheelchair accessible bathroom. I voiced my disgust with the manager and the Hilton customer service line that I was told there would be no availability for my entire stay only to be given a room even though the staff had no idea if I even needed a handicapped room (I now see why people who really need one have such a hard time getting them). We moved and they comped our first night. The next morning I wake up and as I'm going to put my mother into her wheelchair, I discovered an army of ants crawling all over her chair. She had to sit on the toilet for 20 minutes while they sprayed down her chair and we waited for the fumes to subside. We checked out immediately after getting dressed and packed (3 days early). This hotel is not cleaned with any sort of effort. I have stayed in 3 different rooms and all three left a lot to be desired in the area of cleanliness. There are holes where the plumbing is exposed, fingerprints on doors and walls, dust, and pests. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, even if the stay is short.

We spent 8 nights there in a King Bed Suite on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool. I have no complaints about the room. Some of the features I really enjoyed was the extra TV in the other half of the room-separated by a door. Laundry facility on the 2nd floor of the bldg. we stayed in--the hotel is two bldg's connected in the lobby. And surprisingly the bed was comfortable for that many nights with a temperamental lower back. My husband did not feel the same--but it was more a pillow size issue. Lots and lots of towels so we were able to take to the beaches with us--but they also have them by the pool area. You have to walk to get to the beach--but I don't hang out in crowded beaches so this isn't an issue for us. We'll go for long rides for a quiet beach, make sure we can get some food, bring our beverages, find a palm tree and set up camp. We had a safe, microwave, fridge under a separate sink area right outside the bathroom. The week we were there--day after Thanksgiving--was a quiet week at the hotel so the pool was never too crowded. It seemed to be like that all around San Juan though. Jacuzzi was great. The bar/food area by the pool was nice--we ate there once and loved the skirt steak. Right by the hotel are two very good restaurants: Platos and Metropol-both make great Mojitos. About the full American breakfast--that so many reviewers said was great or amazing or whatever--I pictured someone is actually standing behind a counter and preparing eggs--NOT--these are processed eggs (think McDonald's/Burger King). Amazing is how many ways they can dress them up and serve them in a week's time-that they come prepackaged like that!! And the next worse thing about the breakfast--the tea and coffee without half and half or whole milk. My first morning they had the half and half but my tea tasted so weird--maybe the water? So that and the huge TV with the news on was annoying--but there are good things about the breakfast: they have a belgium waffle machine so you can make your own, they have cereals and fruit and cold muffins and bread, toasters and such. The coffee is good. After our second morning disappointment we just went for a walk and ate at Mi Casita for breakfast everyday. The weather was just perfect for walks in the morning. About the airplanes and the airport--yes you will hear them clearly by the pool area. And I always heard them from inside the room--it's just muffled. Similar to living by some railroad--but blocks away where you hear it but it won't wake you up at night. About safety: there are plenty of police and military personnel around. Everywhere. A bit overkill--it makes tourists feel safe and it's good for the tourism business of the island. Overall-I would definitely recommend this hotel for the price, the quality of the room and the location for casinos and night life. One doesn't even have to rent a car because excursion companies pick you up and bring you back. You can take a bus to Old San Juan and return by cab if it's late.

The staff was always attentive to every need, friendly and professional. It is centrally convienient to restarants, walgreens, a supermarket, casino's and most all 2 blocks away from the beach!!!! The breakfast was not the greatest, but was ok. Consider Dennys for breakfast which is located across the street on the second day of your stay or wait until lunch time and get food at the pool bar...

I went on my own but did know people so it was a bit better but I did not want to stay outside of Isla Verde. Firstly, the people are VERY friendly as always. Secondly I worked in tourism there so I have seen the inside of every hotel and never saw the inside of a room at Hampton Inn but based on reviews decided to give it a go. Believe it or not barring the resort feel, which is no issue as you can walk to any of the resorts, it blows the rooms in other hotels, even The Ritz, Intercontinental, El San Juan and all others away. Unfortunately there is something about the accommodation there that is just not up to par in the greater San Juan area. Hampton Inn was a great buy and well worth it. You never hear a plane really, other than the fact my room faced the grotesque sport of cockfighting location, the room was ample for my needs. The beds are amazingly comfortable BUT you need to request a sheet change if you so want one. The bathrooms are OK not the best but acceptable. I am a clean freak and did not like the fact the shower was not a handheld and you had to dodge water to wash yourself, but it was clean with the exception of some mold/mildew. I just do not get why they do not teach ALL hotels all over the world to just tell the cleaning people to spray the showers with liquid bleach after each guest and then rinse. Bleach takes care of mold/mildew and is dirt cheap. I also was a bit disgusted by looking up in the bathroom to see pipes above the sink that were green and nasty looking--so I tried not to. I also think a nice touch would be a cheap dressing gown/bathrobe. I do my make-up and hair with a robe on and had to instead use a towel so it was my only complaint.

The location was perfect. It's right across the street from the El San Juan hotel (site of the wedding), a Walgreens and Lupi's, a Mexican restaurant recommended to us (it did not disappoint). Plus, the value is the best I've seen in a long time. There's the free breakfast (not gourmet or cooked to order, but there were plenty of options and everything tasted good), the lovely pool area with swim-up bar and grill with burgers so juicy they rival those at In-N-Out and Five Guys, the comfy bed, the flatscreen TV with all the channels of home as well as a plethora of Spanish-speaking ones, the business center and the efficiency of check-in and check-out that could not be beat. Obviously it's not the best choice if you want a luxurious, long-term vacation. This is because it's not on the beach (but it's a block away), and if you want a poolside cocktail, you need to get up and get it yourself rather than have a waiter bring it to you.

I bought a slice of Flan and had to order another one. haha! The rooms were very clean, AC worked perfectly, the bathrooms spacious and clean.

I had a great time at this hotel and was very pleased with my experience at the Hampton Inn. (Negative Points that should be said) If you do have a problem listening to air planes then you might want to think twice about this hotel. Because of the area, not far from the airport.

Traveling with two young children and likely exhausted from a long day of travel, I knew that we were primarily after a place to crash. So after reading some rave reviews of the Hampton Inn, we decided to give it a try. The price was still high since we were traveling during peak time, but about $100 cheaper than the Caribe Hilton overall. The hotel is well-kept, but it is definitely modest and showing its age. The pool area, about which I'd heard raves, is very small and noisy from the nearby airport. We weren't looking for a day in the sun, but just the time we spent on the patio eating dinner was enough to take us back inside for the rest of our stay. Many families seemed to be enjoying the outdoors a great deal. Happily, we really didn't hear any air traffic inside our room. We had a suite with two queen beds and a study, which was just right for the four of us, giving us a little bit of room to stretch out. The room appeared to be clean, with the nice Hilton linens. The hotel staff was very friendly, even at 3 a.m. when we had to request fresh linens and towels after one of our children was sick. The gentleman who delivered these items refused any kind of tip. The grill by the pool had been a major selling point for us, and we weren't disappointed. The sandwiches -- burgers, grilled chicken, and others -- were fresh and juicy and delicious and reasonably priced. It was nice to have a tasty, hearty meal without leaving the hotel property. We would have been tempted to try the swim-up bar if not for the airport din. The free breakfast the next day was typical Hampton fare (identical, in fact, to the breakfast we'd had two weeks previously at a Hampton in Frostburg, Md.), but did the job for us quite nicely. We did not have much of a chance to explore the neighborhood, but we were told that the El San Juan extended casino privileges to Hampton Inn guests, so that could be a selling point for those interested in more of a vacation. A pharmacy across the street proved to be convenient when we needed OTC medication. Next door, however, were cockfighting arenas. Overall, I can't see spending more than one night at the property.

The Hampton is a really nice hotel and it's a decent value but if you are unfamiliar with the territory (as we were), it probably isn't what you're looking for if you want to spend time at Isla Verde OR in Old San Juan (OSJ). The closest access to Isla Verde is several (long) blocks away. Because you aren't staying at a hotel on the beach, there is no free lounge chairs, etc., so you will need to take beach towels to stay on. And, pretty as it is, it is also crowded, urban-style beach. If that is to your taste, you might want to consider one of the hotels on the beach. When we checked, there wasn't too much difference in price. Others had reviews talking about the plane noise, but it's here too so... If you want to go to OSJ, be prepared for either a l-o-n-g bus ride (where they herd you in like cattle and you might be standing for the entire ride) or spendy taxi fees ($20 plus tip each way). If you're making a single visit, that might not be an issue. If you are planning on multiple visits (as we were), it doesn't make sense to stay here. Assuming you DO want to stay here (and let me stress, it's a VERY nice property, just not necessarily in a great location), know that there are a couple of nice restaurants in the immediate walking area but one, Platos, is very expensive. Metropol restaurant (a chain offering great PR & Cuban food) is just one building away and there is a Mexican restaurant (Lupi's, I believe) a short hop away. Don't discount the food at Hampton, though. The pool bar & grill (serving through lunch and dinner) offered a good selection at very reasonable prices. Their cheeseburger (around $6) was the biggest I've ever seen and was just delicious. Even the drinks are decent prices for the location. The free breakfast is good too, with a hot offering that changes daily. The value on this property is fair and the property itself is wonderfully maintained and very attractive. I wish I could give it a great endorsement in all areas because I think the staff do a super job and are very accommodating, but it just isn't in a very convenient location for either Isla Verde Beach or Old San Juan", "Date": "April 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan, USA", "Title": "\u201cGood Value & Very Accomodating\u201d", "Author": "A_Michigan_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR7380512", "Content": "We stayed here one night post-cruise.

The price was reasonable by Puerto Rico standards $200 per night. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready but they took our luggage and we went next door to a little Cuban restaurant called Metropol. The food was very good and I recommend eating here. The location of the hotel is really kind of industrial. There isn't anything scenic to see there. Across the street is a pharmacy that you can pick up any items that you need. We didn't find any good liquor stores nearby and the only thing that we found to purchase at a local market was beer and some rum. The beach that is within walking distance is ok. It is not the nicest beach I have ever been to and there were a lot of locals. The other big hotels Intercontinental and the Ritz are all within walking distance. The lobby always had nice tropical fruit candles burning and was very clean and inviting. The pool area was small but I will agree with other posters that it is LOUD! I would not recommend this hotel to someone who is trying to find a place with a relaxing pool scene. It sounds like the planes are about 15 feet away from you! It is a little nerve wracking at first. There is a pool bar and they have some food items available there too. We had a room on the fourth floor of the hotel and yes you could hear the planes in the room. It was not as bad as the pool area though. It sounded more like a thunderstorm than a plane. It is nothing that would keep you up at night. The room was clean and had all the amenities that you needed. Iron, storage, hair dryer, coffee maker, and safe. We didn't have much of a view(a parking lot). I would recommend this hotel just because of the price and comfort of the room. However, I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone that is going to be doing extensive sight seeing in Old San Juan. The cab fares to and from Old San Juan are very expensive. We paid $25 each way with tip to get to and from the area. We dined in OSJ one night and that is a big expense to keep adding to the price of your trip. Just something to consider when booking this hotel. There is a bus that comes by but it didn't look like it would be an enjoyable or even short ride. Old San Juan is about 15 minutes by cab without stopping the bus takes a lot longer. The hotel also has a hot breakfast available in the morning that is served in their lobby.

Like other Hampton Inns, there is a free breakfast, but this one offered food a step above some other Hamptons. The main breakfast entree one morning was a half-bagel topped with egg, cheese, and bacon - it tasted like something you would find in the supermarket freezer section, but better than fast food. The next morning was French toast and sausage, which was decent; more akin to a Shoney's buffett than a home-cooked meal, but it comes with the price of the room, and there was plenty of fruit, yogurt, cereal, and other breakfast foods. If you don't like it, you can walk to Denny's across the street or one of dozens of other high-priced restaurants in the neighborhood When I checked out, I forgot a couple of shirts I left hanging in the closet. I was still in town, so I walked up to the Hampton Inn a few hours later and asked about the clothing. In about three minutes, my shirts appeared - neatly folded and placed into a plastic bag with my account number ready for me to claim. If you are traveling on vacation, or just have some free time on business, the beach is a short walk away - but it's far enough that you won't want to pop back to the room to use the restroom or grab a drink. The pool area seemed small and enclosed, but had a nice little bar that served food. Fine for business and probably acceptable for short periods on vacation, but this isn't a 5-star beach resort. FYI - if you have a rental car, parking is $5 per night, and you have to pay if you spend more than 20 minutes in the parking lot. If you're picking up a rental car for the day and need to stop by the hotel, make sure you get in and out fast. (NOTE - I rented a car from Charlie Car Rental a short walk down the street. They're open 24 hours, great service, clean cars, and you avoid the cab fare to the airport for a rental car if you aren't picking one up for the duration of your stay.) SUMMARY - I have absolutely no complaints. If I was on vacation, I might want a place on the beach instead of a 10-minute walk away, but the price is lower than an on-beach resort. For business travelers, this is a great location.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queens, NY", "Title": "\u201cIt's lovely if you stay indoors\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4995781", "Content": "While planning our trip to Puerto Rico, I was shocked by how expensive most of the \"nice\" hotels were, even in low season (we went first week of April). This hotel lured me to book with it with its relatively lower price, nice photos, and good reviews. It turns out that the hotel IS pretty great. The front-desk staff was pleasant and helpful (we had to store our luggage with them for a day after checking out and there were no problems), the lobby was gorgeous, the breakfast was top notch (and free!), and our room was perfect, with silky smooth bedsheets, a clean bathroom, and ample space. The only problem is when you step outside to use the pool and hottub - the swim-up bar is cute and the hamburger fare offered there is good (albeit a bit too salty), but every ten minutes it sounded like an airplane was about to crash-land on your head. I could not believe how noisy it was, and I've lived near LGA airport all my life. It was literally like the planes were landing next door (and I guess they sort of were). Fortunately, the hotel itself is well insulated, so the noise doesn't affect you at all when you're inside. If it weren't for the noisy pool, the hotel would be an easy A+ (and probably cost a lot more). As it is, I give it an A-.", "Date": "April 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cThe Price is Right!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4953442", "Content": "We stayed at the Hampton Inn San Juan post cruise. We were looking for the best hotel for the money and I think we found it. Yes, the hotel is RIGHT by the airport - when you're at the pool you definitely hear the engines roar, but in the room I never heard the airport. The pool is nice - small, but clean with a swim up bar and grill. There were plenty of chairs by the pool and the towels were warm and cozy. The room itself was very well kept and clean and while the beds are on the smaller size, very comfortable. The location is very good - you're right across the street from the InterContinental and the Ritz Carlton in case you feel like you want to explore the resorts. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful. Cab rates to and from the hotel are fixed by the government, so you feel comfortable heading wherever you'd like.

The pool is on the small side- but never looked crowded. The people are friendly The not so good: The hotel has suites and standard rooms- I was in a standard room. The furniture is newer, but the rooms themselves are kind of beat up ( some mildew on the over calked bath tub, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd material coming from the piper in the tub, etc.).
