The concierge was super helpful ( all of them , not just one superstar ) and the font desk , some how knew my name when I stepped up to register .

Happily while Tsim Sha Tsui has slid downhill the Langham is as solid as ever. Lacking the high-priced views and architectural stylings of its posh neighbor the Langham concentrates on staying true to its values and providing unparallelled service. In fact, the Langham seems to have upped its game recently with a slight makeover of its decor and livery. Where this place really shines is in its ability to provide hospitality at an absurdely high level and with genuine style. The concierges and front line staff are old-school Hong Kong pros. You know... HK guys in their 50s with names like Jack or Bill, who can produce absolutely anything and everything on command. You need a weird medicinal plant at 4:00am? Solved? Directions to an underground club? A last minute outfit that includes a rare Scottish tartan not produced outside of the Hebrides? They've got it covered and take great satisfaction in doing it well. Everyone remembers your name even three years later. Impressive. It's also a nice touch that they stock the hotel with so much original art without making a big deal about it and trumpeting themselves as an \"Art Hotel\" whatever that is. The hotel's art collection is current, tastefully curated and appropriate. How many hotels would bother to properly mount and hang original oil paintings in the gym? Instead of filling the rooms with corporate reproductions and boring prints they decided to go with mosaics and photography. A smart move by a smartly run outfit. In the end that's what this hotel is all about. A place that polishes the bits of metal under the stairs that nobody will ever see. Because that's the standard. That's how it's done. A level of luxury that's impossible these days outside of Asia.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cVery customer focused & friendly service\u201d", "Author": "Leong Y", "ReviewID": "UR133158084", "Content": "My wife & I stayed 3 nights here recently in June 12.

I stay at what the travel sites say are the 5 star luxury accommodations, and often find myself trying to figure out how they came to that conclusion and frequently feel let down or disappointed and as I spend a good 3rd of my year in hotel rooms this is not a good feeling to have! The Langham Hotel have exceeded and more than that surpassed my expectations in every way ! Overall first Impressions Concierge and Porter, extremely helpful and knowledgeable, genuinely warm and friendly Reception staff were efficient, smiled, sincere and customer focussed. Entrance to the hotel is very luxurious and feels like a modern day version of the once grander hotels in London. The theme/branding throughout the hotel is consistent and effective starting at the front desk with their signature pink pens with gold accents !. Our rooms We had one bedroom suite rooms, giving access to The Langham Club ( I am already a member of the 1865 club) which serves breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canap\u00e9s in what can only be described as a decadent hideaway surrounded in stunningly luxuriant upholstery with a modern twist of colours. The suites had both a living room and bedroom. The living room was equipped with surround sound system and Dvd player with an house lending library. The furnishings were not contemporary more traditional cohesive with their \"enchanting\" branding. The bathroom had separate shower cubicle which was very large and a huge corner spa bath, with the thoughtful addition of a pillow for making you even more comfortable while lounging in the tub ! Now ladies, I know you will be happy to learn that bathroom amenities box was filled with the most charming and luxurious shampoos , and accessories including loofah, bath salts, sewing kit, razor kit, dental kit and the other normal items you would expect to find. All again with the Langham PInk & Gold branding on all the boxes ! The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were wonderful. Turn-down service was superb where they replenished any bathroom items, added complimentary water bottles and a deliciously tasty truffle treat was left in the signature pink box on your pillow! The location is right in the heart of the Kowloon shopping areas with plenty to choose from all around, easy to get to and easy to get around. We had limo service from the airport provided by the hotel and when we arrived we were already checked in, greeted by Crystal curbside and whisked to our rooms. OUTSTANDING SERVICE. All I can say is that the Langham has set the new bar for me restored faith in service and detail orientated branding. Watch out watch out watch out ! IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO STAY HERE DO IT !

I have experienced some good hotels and some not so good ones all over the world but this one would definitely take some beating. By the way, I am talking about the Langham Hong Kong in Tsim Sha Tsui down near the Star Ferry terminal in Kowloon, not the one up in Langham Place in Mong Kok. I should also declare that my stay was complimentary as part of a prize which I won but I have not allowed that to sway my opinion at all. Everything was just perfect and the staff were really on the ball. Not only were the main things well done but all of the little things were well covered too. Just a few instances to give you an idea of what I am talking about, 1. Most of the better hotels have dressing gowns supplied of course but this one also has slippers provided and they are laid out alongside your bed as part of the bed \"turn down\" service each evening, 2. Internet is free in rooms both by WiFi and Ethernet cable and the speed was 512K or better speed when I checked it, not some slow unusable overpriced rubbish. Other \"5 star\" hotels take note. 3. Free bottled water is provided in rooms, no limit as far as I could tell. 4. When we went to the pool we were given a towel as usual by pool staff but were also given more bottles of water and personally escorted to a sun lounge. 5. Bath towels in rooms are changed twice a day if required. 6. All tap handles were tight, no annoying drips during the night, the TV actually worked with a good picture, no flickering lights or blown light globes, etc. And everything was spotlessly clean, yes even down in the corners behind the doors and normally out of sight. Get the idea??? This hotel not only does the standard things expected of a 5 star hotel but is always adding that little something extra to set it apart. Of course it is mainly down to good staff supported by good management. Just one further example which shows that the staff are really on the ball and cant do enough to ensure that you have a pleasant stay. On our second day we went down to breakfast and there was a family with really loud and obnoxious children disrupting the restaurant. On the next day the staff had set up a table for this family just out of the main area of the restaurant so that they were not annoying other guests but not so isolated as to make this family feel uncomfortable. A good clever compromise. As I said in the title, this hotel is just brilliant.

This probably would not have woken me, except that I was jetlagged so 6am was actually when I was trying to fall asleep. None of these are major issues, and I only mention them because this is a very high end 5* hotel.

And the driver handed me a welcome note which explained the route we would take to the hotel. Check-in - I requested for a room with a shower so that my dad would not have difficulty climbing in and out of bathtubs to bathe. Peggy offered to put a non-slip mat in the shower for his safety. When we re-checked in 2 days later after a weekend in Macau, she remembered me and asked how was our 1st night stay. We had no reservation for Tang Court so we were told to wait 15min. They suggested we wait in our rooms till there was a vacant table or wait at the lobby downstairs. We waited downstairs and a waitress personally came down to escort us up when the table was available. I asked for recommendations for dinner. Allen at concierge suggested Nobu nearby and managed to get us a table. THAT was an excellent choice and definitely the highlight of our holiday. He also got us a table the next night at Yung Kee in Central where we had very good roast goose. Rooms: Comfortable, cozy, not a home away from home BUT better. There was sufficient lighting for reading, packing. But we could also lessen the brightness with bedside lamps etc. I liked the warmth of the bathroom after stepping out of the shower. No cold breeze. The bed was wide enough for probably 3. So for the 2 of us, it was very spacious. Good reading armchair. Would have been good if there was an ottoman for me to sit on so that I would not have to bend each time I re-packed my luggage at the luggage \"shelf cupboard\". Food: Tang Court served excellent suckling pig. Main St Deli has very good burgers, milkshakes, buffalo wings (you can ask for spicy sauce to be served separate), excellent cheese curly fries, good brioche french toast. Location: Great. 5 minutes walk from Harbour City mall. 10-15 min walk from Tsui Wah Restaurant (good pork chop bun) - use Haiphong Road. 10 min slow walk to Sweet Dynasty for soya bean curd in a tub. 15 min walk to China Ferry Terminal to take the CotaiJet to Macau. Business Centre: Free internet but if you need to print, that'll cost you. Coffee and tea are available free. The bad: Not much. The water doesn't drain quickly in the shower area so it can get slippery for older folks. The room doors slam fast and hard. That's about it! In short: I look forward to staying here again. And eating here too. Next time, I'll factor in time just for afternoon high tea in the lounge. Looks good. Note: If you find that my review has been informative, DO vote for me. Thanks in advance.

But because we were getting a little bored with Causeway Bay a few years in a row, we decided to try something on the Kowloon Side. The Langham Hong Kong is situated in Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station. It's about a block away from Canton Road where all the designer stores are. The closest exit for the hotel is on the TST L5 exit. This is great for us, although it's quite a walk from when you get off the MTR, but on wet evenings it's great. As soon as you enter the hotel you are greeted with this gorgeous aroma which makes you feel so welcome. The Check in was smooth and quick. We had arranged the hotel back in Sept 2011 so we obtained a good rate for 2 adults and 1 child, deluxe room with breakfast, daily paper and Wifi internet. The Child bed and child breakfast came free of charge with the offer. We stayed for 8 nights. The deluxe room is actually bigger in size compared to the Park Lane even after the child bed was put in which was lovely and roomy. There was a two seater sofa and desk, TV all the iPod speakers etc which meant you could charge your ipod or iphone. Housekeeping were excellent, they recharged all your bathroom amenities and towels twice a day, in the morning and once again at turndown which meant you were never low on anything. The toiletries you get were amazingly good quality and did not have a strong odour which was good for men or ladies. There is plenty of bottled water and teabag, coffee top ups. Plenty of storage space for clothing with big double wardrobe and lots of drawers. Also you could fit two suitcases on the suitcase stand which is always helpful. Turndown was lovely and chocolates by your bed every evening, they even tucked my daughter's cuddlies every evening which was so lovely. Inclusive Buffet Breakfast was always plentiful with International selection. Don't bother with their Breakfast tea, that was the only downside, it was weak and not worth the bother. We British like it strong. I am sure The Langham in London would have better tea!!! We would have loved to try the restaurants, but because we were always invited out to dinner over the Hong Kong island we didnt get a chance. We will definitely want to try it next time. Because we have many family members in Hong Kong that we needed to contact, we would of preferred to have local calls included in our room rate, but we were told that it would be charged, but still not many hotels offer Free Wifi access and to get that included in our room rate it was a bonus. Ask for a higher floor, we stayed on the 14th floor and the swimming pool and leisure centre were on the 15th which was great as my daughter visited the swimming pool several times and loved it, right in the centre of TST what more could you ask for!!! We requested a King Size and it was like a Super King!! Lovely... To really make the stay even more memorable was that they had a lovely cake delivered to the room for my husband's birthday on a lovely silver tray with a candle and matches ready. Oh and also they had fresh fruit in the room daily..... I could go on all day about the benefits of the hotel as it is never ending.....

I spent the first 2 nights in a classic room and was given a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe room when I returned for the 4 night stay which was very much appreciated. Rooms: This is Hong Kong so obviously the rooms won't be huge. The classic room was fairly small but didn't feel cramped at all and there was more then enough space for 2 people. The bathroom was a little strange as the shower was quite large but the rest of the bathroom was small and any smaller would have been a problem. The Deluxe room which was also on the club level was on the larger size compared to other large city hotels. Again, the bathroom was still small. Rooms were decorated beautifully and were quite luxurious. Beds were firm but still comfortable. The rooms is packed full of fantasic small amenties which really show the attention to detail by the Langham e.g. a box full of a lot of toiletries, pads and pens, magazines and even a small stationery kit. Rooms were also kept spotlessly clean. Housekeeping were very good. Public spaces: Lobby was really beautiful. The smell was great and it was a real pleasure returning to the hotel at the end of a busy day shopping and exploring. Service: Amazing. All staff members went out of their way to help in any way they could. All doormen greeted us warmly every time, reception were professional but also friendly and concierge was very helpful in giving directions and explaing how to get around on the MTR. Turn down service was done every night including a chocolate on the bed, slippers set out as well as a card stating the next days weather together with a nice quote from previous famous Langham guests. Location: Perfect. Even if I wasn't 100% satisfied with the hotel itself, I would return simply because of the location. 1 minute walk to Canton Street (luxury shopping), 2 minute walk to Nathan Road, 2 minute walk to TST MTR Station which takes you any where easily and 5 minute walk to the Star Ferry Terminal. Food: We had room service a couple times. It was very good but not amazing. We also ate at the buffet. It wasn't cheap by Hong Kong standards but it was good value. There were many types of food and really good quality. It is a very good option if you are tired after a long flight or after a long day out in the city. A good tip is to try Din Tai Fung at the top of the Silvercord building on Canton Strett. It has amazingly good food and is really cheap. I think it has a Michelin star. Overall: Firstly, I would also advise anyone to stay on the Kowloon side as it has a much more \"real Hong Kong\" feel. If you do decide to stay in Kowloon, I highly recommend the Langham. Beautiful hotel, luxurious feel, perfect location and great staff. ONE MORE TIP: While the MTR is the best option to travel around, if you do get a taxi make sure that you print off the \"take me here card\" (available on the hotel website although I am sure they would also give them out at the hotel) as we got in a taxi and told him Langham hotel and he almost took us to Langham Place Hotel before I realised were were in the Mongkok area and showed him the card to ensure he took us to the right hotel.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat location , food and service\u201d", "Author": "momscookintravel", "ReviewID": "UR127465442", "Content": "This a great hotel ... so close to everything .The Star Ferry , metro and great shopping are all very close .

Also upon availability free room upgrade and late checkout. We arrived to a full hotel late that night and was told that the standard rooms were ready but the 1 upgrade rooms were all booked. With a little bit of dissapointment we showed, they must've felt bad for us, so what did they do? They offered us a Double Upgrade! We had a big room with a huge bath (soak in tub and sep shower). The room was beautiful, immaculate and tasteful. The housekeeping service was top notch...they turned down our rooms nightly and left 4 water bottles and chocolates for us daily. At the LEclipse Restaurant, the breakfast buffet was unbelievable. The selection went from Western omelet station to Chinese noodle station, even some dim sum selections, huge selection of fruits, cereals, breads, even a small salad bar, hummus and pitas...etc. Unreal! After the first 2 days, the super awesome service-oriented staff greeted us by name, and even knew our coffee and cappicionos orders in before we even sat down. They were so on top of it ! The hotel's location is the BEST. It's right in the HEART of everything - turn right and you are heading toward the largest shopping center ever Habour City. Turn left and you are headed toward Nathan Road and all it's small shops and restaurants and foot massages and ChungKing Mansions where you can get a better currency exchange rate than anywhere else. If you cross the street, you are right across the MTR station and can go anywhere you want from there. We purchased the Octopus card which we used at the convenience stores and little shops that accepted them all over the city. We rarely caught a cab (which is cheap to do by the way) because our train station was right across the hotel. We only used Star Ferry once as transportation to HK island since the MTR being right across from us made it so convenient. Our hotel connected also to DFS (Duty Free Shopping Mall) which was very awesome! Our stay revolved around sightseeing and shopping as this was our 1st time there....we visited the Big Buddah, Victoria Peak, Kowloon Park, Kowloon Walled City , All the markets....Flower- Bird- Fish-Ladies- Temple St. Markets....Mid-levels and Time Square on Hong Kong Island, more shopping ctrs. than I can remember, Disneyland , Ocean Park, Stanley Park, etc....people asked us what is there to do in Hong Kong that we stayed so many days...there's so much to do and see ....bring comfortable shoes because you will be doing an extensive amount of walking if you are not on a tour bus.

Small as they may be, they pose real inconveniences and problems, which you shouldn't have to face at a 5-star hotel. First is that there are only two electrical plugs in each room, located at the far ends. This makes charging your devices really inconvenient, and you'll have to call for an extension cord, and even then it means you can't sit on your bed and use your laptop. There's also no outlet in the bathroom so you walk around with wet hair looking for a place to plug in the hairdryer. It's incredibly short-sighted and very clear that this hotel is not planned for business travellers or anyone who uses electrical devices. I stayed at the Crowne Plaza at Causeway Bay and that hotel, although costing much less than the Langham, was a joy, not least because it had electrical plugs around the room and at eye level, making for easy use.

We got a very good deal, paying half the price of other 5 star hotels like the Peninsula and the Mandarin Oriental. Included was room and breakfast plus free wifi throughout the hotel. The Wifi was a huge bonus for us as we really needed to stay in touch with home for work and personal reasons. We checked in roughly an hour and a half before the official check in time. Our superior room was on the 11th floor and had a lovely view of a tower block around 20 feet away! We knew that we weren't going to get a room with a view in this hotel and so we weren't disappointed. The room, which had a very comfortable king size bed plus two seater sofa and armchair was, in our opinion, more than ample size although maybe that is because we are used to European hotels. Plenty of drawers and wardrobe space too. Maid service was very efficient, we didn't once come back to find them in our room. Upon turn down, we were given chocolates on the bed which were fabulous and a little card with a quote from a different famous 'former resident' of the Langham hotels and the weather forecast too. We were also given a newspaper of our choice every morning. Breakfast in the morning was very good, with a selection of continental, English and Chinese options. Eggs were cooked to order and a couple of days my partner ordered Eggs Benedict which he really enjoyed. Only shame was that it ended at 10.30am and with the jet lag we really struggled to be down before 10, therefore every day we got to breakfast we were warned it finished in half an hour. A small point to worry about and we were never actually rushed out the restaurant. The common areas are lovely. The hotel is scented as most seem to be these days. Not offensive at all and a welcome change from the smog and pollution of HK. We didn't eat in the hotel for lunch or dinner but had a few drinks in the Lobby Bar where service was good and efficient. Location wise, I don't think you could pick a better spot in Kowloon. Right on Canton Road and about a 10 minute walk from Victoria Harbour. 5 minutes in the other direction is the nearest MTR station which, when you are returning to the hotel, has signs for which exit to take for the Langham. All in all I'd thoroughly recommend the Langham for a short stay in Hong Kong. We felt it offered excellent value for money and was a welcome oasis from the hustle and bustle and general madness of Hong Kong!", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely go back...\u201d", "Author": "Withyourightfoot", "ReviewID": "UR125955963", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Langham Hotel for 4 nights in January.

Just as many have said before us everyone you meet in hotel is extremely welcoming and helpful. We had booked a Grand Double Room but on arrival were told that we were to be given a twin room. I said we had booked double and was a bit suspicious when there wasn't even the suggesting of pushing the beds together. It made me wonder if we had been 'downgraded' to a pokey little room. I was a bit concerned about that as previous Tripadvisor comments include mention of the rooms being small. However, when I showed the guy my confirmed booking form he popped away for a few minutes (presumably to get confirmation he could change our room) and when he came back he said that we would be 'upgraded'. I'm not sure what the upgrade was as it was a king size bed which is what I thought we had booked anyway. However, the room was gorgeous and luxurious and (thankfully) we will never know if the twin room would have been 'pokey'. This was our first visit to HK and not only do we intend to return but we would definitely stay again at the Langham. It was just such a treat to return (exhausted) at night to a cocktail in the lobby bar where we enjoyed listening to the pianist and beautiful singer. And then returning to our room when the bed had been turned down and a chocolate placed on our pillow. The Langham is glamorous and does have an air of European elegance. The smell of the lillies is everywhere and just wonderful (although I appreciate it might not be to everyone's liking). I, however, loved it and have returned home with the fragrance oil and room spray. We booked on room only basis but I think if we were going back we would make sure to eat in one of the 4 (I think) restaurants. The front desk at check-in told us the hotel was full two days of our stay but I can honestly say that we never had a sense of that - either in the public areas or from noise in the corridors or rooms. The concierge desk were extremely helpful when we needed to see a doctor / hospital (long story which i won't bother with here) and even asked if we wished the personal assistance of the Duty Manager. One odd thing however which I don't think was the fault of the hotel but could have found us in a pickle, was that both the front desk and the concierge desk had told us on several occasions that the cost of the taxi to the airport would be approx 250 Hong Kong dollars and no more than 260. When we got to the airport (after a near death experience of being driven at breakneck spead) the taxi meter showed 180 dollars. Then the driver pushed a button and the screen jumped to 365 and he said that was the fare. I queried that and said the hotel had said 260 and he opened the door and pointed to the 'additional charges' which he said were for using the airport expressway and the luggage ! Now, either he was just at it and we were ripped off or the Langham don't quite understand the pricing policy. Either way, we were lucky to have had that bit extra cash on us. We did think, however, that the Langham offer a limousine service at about 700 dollars I think, and had we realised the cost of the taxi at 360 then we may well just have opted to end the stay in the same luxury as the hotel and taken the limousine. It's worth thinking about if, like us, your early morning flight means the airport shuttle/MTR/bus is not an option.

It was at Hong Kong Airport that I found out there was a vacancy at The Langham, so I had an unexpected extra day at Hong Kong, and stayed this extra night at The Langham. I thought that the rate was quite reasonable, and I had a room that was of reasonable size, that was very nicely decorated (The Langham is more \"classic\" style, while Langham Place Hotel is more \"modern\"). I found the wifi signal a little more steady at The Langham than it was at it's sister, as I found myself constantly having to re-login with my password if I went out of range at LPH. The breakfast was of a reasonable price, not exactly bargain price, but not ridiculous either. It was very nice, with croissants and scrambled egg + toast. I was leaving in the evening, and had dinner out, so I didn't get a chance to look at the lunch/dinner menu. The porters were very helpful with my luggage, and very swift in arranging a taxi for me. I would certainly pick The Langham if you want to stay central to both HK island or Kowloon, but you want a quieter district. Her sister, LPH, is located around the hectic Mong Kok MTR district, whereas Tsim Sha Tsui seems just a little quieter. Right across the road from the hotel is a station that takes you to either Tsim Sha Tsui or East Tsim Sha Tsui MTR stations (they are interconnected underground), so it's very easy to get around HK from this location. I think it took me about 20 minutes from leaving the hotel to get to Statue Park/Cenotaph. It's also quite easy if you are going to Lantau Island, either for the airport/cable car/Disneyland, although it should be pointed out that you need to switch trains to get onto the orange line.

Harbour City is just 1 street away! my HK friend warned me that this is an old hotel but seriously folks, I couldn't tell its age, for it was well-maintained from the lobby to the rooms. The small lobby's deco was tastefully done in the Old European Style without being overtly pompous. I had booked 2 Grand Rooms but upon check-in, we were upgraded to their Grand Langham Rooms! The cosy and spacious rooms simply blew us away.

When we arrived at 7am we expected to have to wait till around 2pm or a bit earlier before checking into our room.

This obviously was a fantastic start to our holiday, especially after a long tiring flight. Our room was ready within minutes but we had a leisurely breakfast and then were taken to our room where our luggage was waiting. The room and ensuite were absolutely gorgeous, we had a spa bath and lovely shower and could open louvre windows into the bedroom. The beautiful pink stationary is just exquisite. The bed was so inviting and comfortable, just like sleeping on a cloud. Our windows just looked out over a street, but that didn't matter, we didn't have time to notice, and we had got an extremely good price for this gorgeous hotel. The club lounge offer drinks and a large variety of very tasty snacks every evening, which we enjoyed. One of the hotel restaurants has a buffet dinner each night. The variety of food is absolutely astounding, and the huge variety of seafood is all freshly prepared just before you select it. The staff throughout the hotel are very professional, friendly and very lovely. The space in the entrance/reception area is huge, the decor is very luxurious and the huge flower display on the table was just breathtaking, it all feels very opulent. The hotel is in the perfect location, minutes from the Star Ferry Terminal, and minutes in the other direction from the train station. The train station is an experience in itself. Its very easy to get around, not the usual crowding etc and extremely fast. The train arrives behind a clear screen, and the doors don't open till the train has actually stopped and the train doors open. So no chance of accidently being pushed or falling on to the rail tracks etc . We took the ferry over to HongKong Island most days, and did different trips. The queues for some attractions are extremely LONG, expect to be in a queue for an hour maybe longer. We also took a couple of bus trips on the local buses, to the other side of the island. This was a really fantastic and cheap way to have a look around. Especially upstairs at the front, on the double decker buses. We also took local ferrys to different islands to have a look around. Local brochures show the ferrys and buses to take to the different attractions, which cost barely a fraction of the tour price, and you can enjoy the things you like, and leave when you want. We found this a fantastic way to have a good look around. We had a week in Hongkong, and really loved it.

There is a lovely smell wafting through the air and lots of attention to detail everywhere. Staff are friendly and helpful. However, I do not rate the bedrooms very highly for a 5 star. I have stayed here twice, the first time (Oct 2010) was in the old rooms - they felt like a 4 star at best, so in 2011 I stayed in the new re-furbished rooms (the most basic ones). Although a lot nicer than the old ones, they still weren't as luxurious as some other 5 stars competitors, such as the Shangri-La (but maybe I am being harsh comparing it to them) On the plus side: - The bed is very big - Bathroom has a bathtub - although there is a window (with an optional blind!), so you can lie in the bath watching the tv, BUT they should have put the taps on the other side as you can't really lie back because of the taps! - On arrival I had a large pink chocolate shoe, filled with more chocolates! A very nice touch. Although this might have been because I was managing an event there and sometimes hotels leave little extras to say thanks for the business. - There is a really large selection of food for room service, and it comes pretty quick, food was tasty too - Nice big tv, with decent enough channels - Love the pens! (I took loads) However: - The overall decor wasn't luxurious like the rest of the hotel and other 5 stars - For a 5 star, I always hope for top quality toileteries like L'Occitane (which they give in Shangri-La and Four Seasons), Molton Brown etc, but it was some generic brand which wasn't the best quality. - I thought the bed was quite hard but that is probably because I like soft mattresses Overall I do think the Langham has great attention to detail but sometimes misses the big picture.

The service from all the staff in all parts of the hotel at all times is utterly wonderful, they can not do enough for you. But, extras are grossly expensive, two sandwiches (magnificent) and two small drinks in the bar cost 680 HKD (about 62 pounds or 100 USD). Great luxury place to stay but unless you are a millionaire - eat and drink out. Lots of good and reasonably priced restaurants & bars within a few minutes walk. The guest information book provided in the room is poor, basically only covers room service. Anything else you want to know about you must contact the concierge - very very helpful but a nuisance to have to do it. For example the Wi-Fi Internet service (free once you work it out, you must select 'first time user' each time!) is not mentioned in the guide - the concierge will provide the password when asked. The breakfast room is too small for the number of guests and gets VERY crowded (and noisy) at peak times. The wide range of European and Asian food is all very good - even the scrambled eggs (my test of a good breakfast kitchen) are perfect. Very good location, Star Ferry to the Island and the MTR are each about 5 min walk - in opposite directions). 30 min in taxi from the airport (price about 250 HKD) or 45 min in the Airport-Hotel shuttle bus (cost 140 HKD each). Very busy shopping area with lots of expensive fashion type shops in the area. Go north about 1 mile to Jordan for cheaper shopping and eating.

The hotel is perfectly placed in Kowloon - it is walking distance to the MTR station and Star Ferry so you can travel about really easily. Also, it is close to the Kowloon station for the Airport Express, with a complimentary bus, so just a hop, skip and a jump to get there and away. We didn't use the other restaurants in the hotel, as there are so many other places just on your doorstep.

We were able to take advantage of their \"Linger Longer for Less\" rate for a Grand Langham room that included free Internet access and breakfast. We did not pre-book their limo/taxi service from the airport to the hotel but that was not a problem. Our flight was late arriving in Hong Kong around midnight. I was not feeling well so we headed for the hotel's booth at the airport for a limo or taxi to the hotel. The two men at the booth were very friendly and assisted with getting a taxi to the hotel. They welcomed us with a wet wash cloth and cold drinks. We had to wait about 30 minutes for our ride so they assisted my husband with purchasing Octopus cards. They made a very good impression on us and the hotel. The front desk service was also excellent upon our early morning arrival. They quickly booked us into our room. I forgot to ask for a room on a higher level so our room was on the 6th floor. This meant that we could hear the traffic all night. We fixed that problem by turning on our sound machine to drown out the noise. The room was large enough for two people with two large pieces of luggage. The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean throughout our stay. The bathroom was nicely decorated but we did not like the inconsistant water pressure in the shower and had to be very careful with the water going from cold to very hot. We enjoyed the spa bathrobes and slippers provided with the room. We had a view of the street in front of the hotel. Room service was great and they returned to the room during the early evening to see if we needed additional services. We found the breakfast buffet to be tasty and have a variety of foods available. My husband enjoyed having eggs fixed in any style he wished. It was often crowded at breakfast but service was fairly good. I learned to take a sweater with me to breakfast because the room was so cold with cold air blowing on all the tables. Many people complained about the cold air but it was never changed. We were late by 2-3 minutes arriving at breakfast on Saturday but they seated us. The manager came by our table as we were finishing and made a comment about our late arrival. We assumed they would have later hours on the weekend mornings but they had the same hours all week. We ate at the New York Deli restaurant on the property. The service was good but you needed to make a reservation to get a table before 9:30 pm. The manager was very nice and really tries to provide service to patrons. We ate here twice during our stay. The desserts are very good as an added plus! The location of the hotel is excellent for tourists! You are across the street from the metro station, bus stops are nearby, taxis are always out front waiting for customers, and the star ferry is about three blocks away. The only caution is that tour buses drop off passengers just down the side street by the hotel. Getting down the sidewalk at night is a challenge with the people getting on and off the tour buses with their shopping bags. There are many restaurants near the hotel but you need to make reservations or you will be in for a long wait for a table. This really came as a surprise to us. The real treasure of this hotel is the friendly, courteous staff. They answered all our questions and offered better suggestions to us. They were always ready to meet our needs and make our stay pleasant. I told the manager as we left that his hotel has one of the best hotel staffs that we have found in Southeast Asia.

The room had a lovely feel and warmth. Again while the decor is not what we normally go for (we tend to go for something more modern), we actually really like it as it was still tastefully done.

We choose The Langham Hong Kong for it's conveniency and location, but never expecting flawless service with amazing room. We were direct to take the bus (HKD130 per person) from Hong Kong International Airport to the hotel. The bus ride was okay, comfy seats. I guess my only complain for my entire stay is the driver who droves us (probably not hired by The Langham). When we arrive to hotel, he (the driver) did not direct us to hotel where as he was actually on the phone with somebody else using a bluetooth headset. Also he shouted at us saying that the hotel is at the other side, which is kinda rude as i understand their language (cantonese). But then, from what i experienced in Hong Kong, most of the Hong Kong born are rude in conversation. (I'm sorry) We were welcome with a small but grand lobby at The Langham. Check in was okay. Compliments to (Bo Bo) for her good english and able to check us in at 12pm. As we step into our room, i was glad this is one of those hotel which welcome you with no foul smell of an old room. What you see in the photos from website are exactly the same as what you will book for, probably better :) We book \"Grand Langham Room\" for 3 nights stay there. From luxurious leather finish furniture, to spacious marble bathroom complete with SPA like amenities, to great full in-room amenities, \"Grand Langham Room\" no doubt is what i didn't expect to stay in. I've stay in many luxury 5 star hotels and this is one of the best room i've ever encounter. As told by many friends, Hong Kong hotels room are usually small in size, this one consider it's the highest categories in terms of rooms (Grand Langham Room) it's consider small, but comfy. Love the bed, love the feeling being inside the room all the time. Also to mentioned they do have free wi-fi which is great. Kudos to housekeeping who keep our room tidy and clean always whenever we were out. Not to mentioned their great turndown service which is really the best turndown service i've experienced (attached photo). Also to compliment is their tasty birthday cake complimentary by hotel. If i'm not filled with my birthday dinner at \"The Bostonian Steakhouse & Seafood\" (which is also in the hotel) i think i would finish the whole cake myself. Yummy :) I am yet to try their room service from the hotel but we have tried the chinese restaurant at level 1 (T'ang Court) for their famous dim sum. A must try dim sum when you stay in this hotel or if you're in Hong Kong. The Bostonian was okay... great service, but \"so so\" food. Conclusion, we really enjoy our stay over here in The Langham Hong Kong. Service were impeccable, rooms were amazing, and experience are unforgettable. We were check into The Venetian (Macau) after we check out and honestly, The Langham Hong Kong were far more better than The Venetian (as many has mentioned about the great Venetian Macau). I will definitely coming back here to The Langham Hong Kong, thank you The Langham. xxx Mr.Sin stay for 10th Nov - 13th Nov", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201cQuality Stay\u201d", "Author": "Rajendra k", "ReviewID": "UR120563353", "Content": "very nice hotel, hotel staff are very good.

The Head Concierge Edward is very welcoming and knowledgeable and service is slick and friendly. There is a very good loyalty scheme which is worth joining. If I had a minor criticism it would be that it could do with a pub or brasseries type bar where you could have a more informal drink but apart from that its great.

I have stayed in this hotel 4-6 times over the past 2 years if only for the location. I am always baffled that this hotel seems to have 2 personalities. One updated and one outdated. Some floors have been redone and many floors not. Yet after some of the floors were redone they still call them the newly renovated rooms. After 3 years how can they still be referred to as newly. And what are they waiting for to redo the balance of the hotel. I also cannot understand how a hotel that has 5 stars can have an airconditioner system so loud in every room that is can awake the dead it is so loud. The 3 years since the renovation has started to take a toll on the rooms. They look worn down and mold is gathering in the shower. the tv in the rooms cannot be watched normally. The signal seems very poor, the screen has lines on the screen unless it was just the room I was in, I cannot hold this against them. The tech I called advised it was as good as it gets. The food in the Palm Court is sub par at best. After I mentioned the food I ordered was cold and over cooked the managers response was \"sorry\" I have to admit even I was surprised. Not even a can I replace it can I make it right can I warm it can I offer you a drink to make it right .... Nothing but a sorry. As for the gym it is not the most practial for anyone other than a runner. They have tried to go out of their way to make this a decent gym but it seems to be missing some basic work out equipment. There is no question the staff of this hotel are very accomadating and willing to go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. The issues I have go beyond this. They claim to be a 5 star hotel but I fail to see the criteria this hotel meets for this. if this hotel was another block or two in a different location I would pass but for the location I seem to keep going back.

One of the staff members said \"can i take you to the lift and show you where they are\" which we thought was a lovely gesture, then the man pointed and said \"go there\" - pointing to the lift from behind the desk. We got to the room and it was a twin room. We went to reception to complain and they said \"2 people can fit on one bed\". Dont forget, they are single beds. When we booked with the agent we booked a queen room. I called reception to be changed to a queen room and they said they were all sold out and didn't offer to change us after others had checked out in the morning. They blamed our booking agent for the mistake, even though on our bookings it stated queen room. The langham really seemed to enjoy blaming the agents for many things that weren't right during our stay. They did not take responsibility for there being no appointment for high tea, and blamed the agent even though I actually booked that through the langham myself and had nothing to do with an agent. We went to the reception in the morning and they agreed to move our room to the 16th floor (The lift only goes to the 15th floor so you have to walk up stairs to get to the 16th floor). The room was much older, the toiletries were not as nice as the previous room and the blind in the bathroom was completely transparent when the bathroom light was on. I did not care to see my partner on the toilet so we went down to reception again. They were EXTREMELY difficult to deal with. The staff were very friendly to me when I complimented them, but as soon as I had a problem they were hostile. The staff all conversed in english to us, then spoke another language to converse with each other about our booking, which made me feel like i was not even there. I noticed someone from management looking angry and speaking in a harsh tone, then our room was changed AGAIN to the 5th floor. This room was exactly what we wanted in the first place. It was beautiful. The company used for transfers was excellent and friendly. The pool and gym were excellent. Turndown service was daily, but on 2 occasions only one side of the bed was turned down. We were missing newspapers 3 of the 6 days we were there. We went to the business centre to use the internet (As the in room charges are ridiculous) at 11:45pm and all computers were being used. We asked for the reception to call our room when a computer was free so we could urgently use the computer. The man hesitated and after asking twice more he agreed.

The hotel sent a car for us (it turned out to be a Bemz with a very talkative driver. He tried to play tour guide after our 18hr flight and it was just too much). We arrived to a beautiful lobby, got checked in, were escorted to our room and shortly, our bags arrived. The room had a king size bed, a desk, a flat screen TV and to our surprise, a bureau (chest of drawers) and another short bureau (a whole other set of drawers), plus closet space that actually allowed my husband room to hang his clothes for a change. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath and nice amenities that were restocked everyday. We also had a nice table for two in the room (where local fruit was offered daily) and above our mini bar, was an electric teapot where three different types of tea were available all day (replenished with turndown service). We would have liked more fridge room as the hotel's restaurants were very pricey (like a good hotel in NY!), but we soon learned to buy at Starbucks and squeeze in the few items that needed refrigeration.\u00a0 Housekeeping was relentless in getting into the room, so since it was a pleasure trip for me, I simply adjusted my schedule to save frustration on either of our parts. I felt safe, welcomed and accommodated at this hotel as I had an eye infection my second day there. The hotel sent a doctor to my room (which was later covered by my health insurance) and then the manager called to see how the visit went and if I needed anything else. He directed my husband to a pharmacy for some feminine hygiene stuff for me and told him how to make the request (see the pharmacist, no one else will know what you mean!).\u00a0 The various people at the concierge were either brusque or hurried. I took this as a cultural thing and when I stood my ground and insisted on better directions (I was a woman traveling alone 90% of the time), they calmed down and gave me extra assurances. Many tours were booked through the hotel and after three days of this, I was to book them myself. We also ate at every restaurant in the hotel and then ventured out, with help of my husband's business connections or the aforementioned Fodor's book. The Langham Hotel made my first impression of Hong Kong memorable, with ideal location to ferry and MTR; dining options (too tired to walk, room service was excellent); shopping everywhere you looked and Nathan Road right down the block. The only time we took taxis was to find a restaurant I had read about or a colleague recommended. I felt like I received five-star service even though it took them two days to get the DVD in the room to work. Our room had no view, but it was quiet at night and let in the sunlight when I was there alone in the late afternoons. I would say that if you are from a big city, you will \"get\" the vibe at this Langham. If you are looking for more space, pay to get upgraded, but ask to be shown the room first; or stay elsewhere where they can do more hand holding for you.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous hotel with superb service.\u201d", "Author": "mikemtl", "ReviewID": "UR117991087", "Content": "We stayed at the langham because it was one of the few that could confirm connecting rooms for us and our kids.

I recommend the boat trip around the Harbour and the day trip to the big Buddha on the hill. Ocean Park not recommended, it's tiny and old and a waste of money!

It is my birthday and as a birthday present, my sister got me a room at the Langham hotel to stay the night. I actually wanted to go for a weekend getaway (I live in HK, by that I mean heading to Macau), so I called Langham's reservation and see if I could reschedule the stay for another day. \"Sorry sir, as written in the fine print in your email confirmation, there are no refund nor rescheduling allowed.\" ... so be it. Since the email confirmation said we can park overnight for a nominal fee, my fiancee and I drove and arrived at exactly 5:51pm (stamped by valet), as we get off, I told the attendant that the car will be parked overnight. He looked at me and said it will be charged by the hour. I told him its in the agreement, he said I would have to talk to reservations. There was hardly a line and as I was checking in, I mentioned the parking situation, after the Langham staff saw the confirmation letter, she showed it to her colleague, whom started serving us... by telling us its not possible and the hotel will not honor it... I explained to her that its in the agreement and its something the hotel has to deal with the agency, not the guest... She told me to wait while she calls her manager, after putting down the phone she told me that I can wait in my room while she resolves the issue, meanwhile the car will have a 2 hour free of parking. I said \"NO! I am not going to wait in the room for 2 hours while you go check\" (what if they come back declining it again?!?!\"). She calls the manager again... this time, I told her to get the manager to come out and talk to me directly. She finally comes out, told us to show her the confirmation (it was on our mobile), then told us to send her a copy to her email, she then had her staff go back to back office, check her mail, printed it out and handed it to her, she told me that this is an error with the agency and thus it is not their responsibility to honor it.... I was like... excuses me?!?! I wanted to change the date of my stay, you said no because it states so in the terms and conditions while you have a right to refuse when you don't like it?!?! She then said that I have to go deal with the agency, its not the hotel's problem.... I asked her \"is the agency not authorized by the hotel to make reservations and the terms and conditions were pre-agreed between the hotel and the agency?\" She said yes. So I demanded that she honors the agreement or let me refund my sister's money or allow me to change the date on my reservations! She said she'll have to go inside to check. I said fine, stood (at the reservations desk) and waited, my fiancee got bored, she left and sat down at the lobby, (in the meantime, their staffs were busy serving other people and simply ignored me, the least they can do is to sit me down, give me a glass of water or something, but nothing!). 20 minutes later (it's 6:27pm, we've been at this for more than 30 minutes), my fiancee came back and said we should just leave and forget it. I asked a staff to let the manager knows that we are no longer waiting and will leave. The manager came back out and she said she had yet been able to resolve the problem. I immediately explained to her that this is no longer my issue. She is either to refund the money to my sister or allow us to change our reservations. She said no because it is stated in the confirmation letter. I went furious! I said \"so is the parking!\", and LOUD! \"The problem is not me, why am I suffering from this, I am the Guest!\". The floor manager quickly comes over and offers his help (he obviously knows what was going on), He explains that this is an error made by the agency, thus it is not the responsibility of the hotel to honor it. I told him that since the hotel authorized the agency to take room reservations on their behalf. The hotel must honor whatever is said on the terms and conditions. The floor manager finally gave in and agreed to offer the parking under the said terms. But I told him its too late, I don't want to stay at the hotel anymore, I didn't spend the last 45 minutes standing here to go over something that is not my fault. I am leaving and I'll let someone else stay here at another date. The floor manager disagrees and again brought up the terms and conditions... The conversations got heat up and by this time. I got so loud that the manager asked me to quiet down. I told him its not my fault that I am loud, if he has a problem with it, he should've moved me to a private room for discussion. I kept on telling him (and let people hear) how they're denying the terms and conditions they've set in the agreement and how I am standing there suffering from it. My only guess is that the floor manager finally decided that he no longer wants to deal with me he finally agrees to let me reschedule. I said \"that's fine, simply give me your business card and I'll leave!\" THIS IS A SCAM! For a very simple reason, when a guest tries to alter any terms and conditions set forth, the hotel will always uses the agency as an excuse to deny the alteration. But when the hotel does not want to honor the terms and conditions, they simply says they will not honor it and the guest should deal with the agency! COMPLETE LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM! First of all, Langham hotel should immediately acknowledge the agreement (and deal with the agency aside), having me stood at the reservation desk for 45 minutes is simply unprofessional. They could have at the very least sat me at a corner and deal with me. But no, the manager went back inside and had me stood there waiting for another 20 minutes. And the floor manager comes out and continues to tell me it is not their fault. This was merely a parking issue and yet I had to go through 4 staff, their entire chain of command just to acknowledge something they've written in fine print. Worst of all, not a single apology, not one! from any of the staff. For creating the hassle that should've never existed. For a mere parking issue, I had to wait in the lobby for 45 minutes, explained my situation that is set by their terms and conditions. Explained it to 4 different people, didn't even get to sit down or offered a glass of water, ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, amazing service\u201d", "Author": "jensSydney", "ReviewID": "UR114999189", "Content": "Beautiful hotel ideally situated near Star ferry,MTR station and Harbour City shopping centre.Gorgeous foyer and the rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious,we had a Grand room .Chose to take extra package to include the Langham club,if you can stretch your budget it is definitely worthwhile.Breakfast,traditional afternoon tea,drinks and canapes are included and served in an exclusive area on the 11th floor,there is also a business centre there as well.I have never stayed in a hotel where the staff are so helpful!

In fact the smallest bathroom in any 4+ star hotel I've ever stayed in, which seemed a little 'mean' given they knew we were three of us... Breakfast for two was provided in the share triple room rate but we had to pay $300HKD for the extra breakfast each day.

Couldn't comment on the quality of the spa as we didn't use it. The hotel is not too far from the airport - about 45 mins altogether. It is easy to get to, simply get on the airport express train to Mongkok (it's around \u00a315 return each) and get a taxi from the station. Taxis are so cheap in HK and are metered, so price isn't really a problem. It cost around \u00a33-4 to get from the train station to the hotel. The hotel itself is attached to a big shopping mall where there is shopping and lots of restaurants at much cheaper prices than the hotel. It's well worth a look if you don't want to pay hotel prices. That said the food in the hotel isn't bad - we ordered room service and although my food was ok, my husband's was cold and well below standard for the price tag of \u00a315 they were attaching to it. That said, breakfast was fantastic - lots of choice and very fresh - couldn't fault it at all. If you want to see more of the city, I would suggest the Big Bus Tour - you can get tickets from the hotel reception (around \u00a320 each), but it includes the tour (there are 2/3 different lines that will take you all around the city), it also includes entrance to the Tram that goes up the mountain, a boat ride out to the floating restaurant and access to the ferry - when you take into a/c the added extras, it's a bargain. However HK is a very congested city and the buses are often late and get held up in traffic, so beware! There are some great night markets and shops around the hotel, which means that you are not stuck inside the hotel and there is always something to do.

I especially enjoyed the quiet of the roof top pool. The food at breakfast is excellent and well worth the price - one of the best buffet selections anywhere. The TST location means that there are excellent hotels nearby but the hotel also has a great restaurants on site - in particular we loved the T'ang Court a 2 michelin star cantonese restaurant: we had the set monthly set menu which was well balanced with 6 well sized portions, all excellently presented. The wine list is sensational. One small negative - there are no views - the bedrooms have blinds so that you dont look out at the buildings opposite, as to the window bays near the lifts. There is a glimpse of the outside from the breakfast room and the T'ang Court, but the Palm Court is internal and other two restaurants are in the basement. And what to do in HK - we took organised trips. All could have been done much cheaper by using the efficient public transport but when time is tight and you don't know a city its sometimes easier. The trip to Lantau island to the giant buddah/monestary and TaiO fishing village is worth it as you avoid the massive queues for the cable car up to the monestary. The HK oreintation tour is less worth it - Stanley market is not really worth a vist, you only drive past the beach and are taken to Aberdeen for a sanpan tour (extra cost) and to a jewellery factory to try and sell you gifts. The trip up to the peak is worth it but you only get 20 minutes there so just time to have a look and take a photo but no time to walk around the park and area. I would recommend trying to do HK island yourself as the trains/buses are very easy to use - get an octopus card (HK$150 plus HK$50 deposit) which means you dont need change - for this money you will be able to travel on all public transport over several days. We also did a trip to see the famous \"pink river dolphins\" - they are really white and look pink when they blush - they are endadered and live in the very polluted waters near the airport and power plant, so whilst it was a nice trip and we saw three dolphins, the views aren't great and, together with the smog that hand over HK, it reminds you how badly the locals treat the environment.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cJust Perfect-book now!\u201d", "Author": "SAL71_11", "ReviewID": "UR105145767", "Content": "I have stayed here twice before on business and its always been great- this time i took my family for a 5 night stay.

Shortlisted the 2 Langham hotels (Mongkok and Tsim Sha Tsui) and chose the TST as we're more familiar with it (from previous visits ages ago) and also the special deal if you booked more than 45 days. As we landed, we took the airport shuttle which went directly to the hotel. It was pretty good, though from the arrival hall to the bus pick up was a long walk (esp. for my mum), which we should realise would be the first lesson in a lot of walking when you visit HK. The hotel was simple from outside but the inside was magnificent. The staff were also excellent. Every requests and questions were met excellently, from the Front staff, Concierges to the Housekeeping. Do not hesitate to ask for directories from the Concierges, we did and it made the trips easier!! We were staying on the Club level for 5 nights (joint rooms) and did not regret it. The rooms were spacious, very clean. Mum and kids gave the thumbs up.Bathroom was the same. The only thing I noticed was the fittings like the taps were a bit worn down (from its original glory of gold), but they were maintained and we did not find it a bother/problem. All in all, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Its location is very handy, Harbourcity is just behind it, and Nathan Road is not far away either. Food is not a problem, there's plenty to choose from. The MTR station exit is conveniently located across the road from the hotel. BUT, be aware that though one station has many exits, usually the main location of the trains will usually be quite a walk, don't expect to reach it once you enter one of the exits. It's quite a hassle, especially for my mother who has a bad knee. The distance to walk to and from, and also lack of escalators and limited elevators in some. Taxi is usually our mode of transport after a long day. When we visited Mongkok, we saw the other Langham hotel (Langham Place), it was also a magnificent hotel, but the surrounding is less impressive and the number people on the streets, unbelievable! If you really like a crowded place, this one for you but I don't regret my choice, TST surrounding is better.

Only glitch was the smoking room that we were put in on our first night.

We were given a new room first thing in the morning. Service was quite good at the hotel and we found everyone to be quite friendly and accomodating. Our room was about as small of a room as I would want to stay in, but it was fine. My husband and I did not bump into each other or anything like that. I think rooms in Hong Kong are generally smaller than ones you find in the states. The bed was quite comfortable as were the pillows and the room was soundproof. We loved the location for convenience to the Starr Ferry - only a few blocks away. My advice when booking is to make sure you specify smoking or non-smoking. And if you need a ride to the airport and do NOT want limo service, make sure the concierge understands that you would like to take their shuttle or a taxi. I think they automatically assume you want a private car. The hotel is also close to the Harbour City shopping center. On Level 3 of the Gateway Arcade is a great Chinese restaurant called Crystsal Jade. We ate there several times because it was very good, convenient to our hotel, and the prices were quite reasonable. I highly recommend it. It can be crowded, but turnover seems to be quick.

I first booked the The Disney's Hollywood hotel as it would be convenient for our visit to Disney Land. But as I read the Tripadvisor's reviews again, I found out that the 4* hotel and the 5* hotel nearby didn't have any room service. As we were travelling with a toddler also, we had a real need for a kettle in the room or somebody to serve us hot water for making bottle milk for my daughter. But the to my surprise the hotel did not have any tea and coffee making facilities also in the room. We definitely could not be in a hotel which neither had room service, nor any tea and coffee making facilities inside the room. The hotel was also far away from the city. As we are vegetarians, we also got worried about the availability of food. So we had to cancel that booking. Then I found this hotel in the heart of the city, with all the facilities and access to lots of Indian restaurants nearby, which served Indian vegetarian food. It also had tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms and a room service on the cards. What I loved the most, was the hotels website has menus of all the restaurants in the hotel. By checking them out I found out that the restaurants had a number of vegetarian choices on their lists. By just a few dollars more than the previous booked hotel, we could book this 5* hotel online. We booked a deluxe room. When we reached the hotel the warm and friendly staff welcomed us. We were also given an upgrade to a Grand Room. The room was very neat and tidy. Luxurious bed and clean toilet. My elder daughter was excited to find a bathrobe and slippers of her size. The smell of the toiletries was lovely. Best part of the stay was that all the three nights, after coming to the room tired, we didn't have to go out and search for a hotel outside. We ordered room service every night and children enjoyed the food. Also to our pleasant surprise, we found that there was an Indian vegetarian dish also on the room service list, which we found out was quite tasty. The b'fast too had a wide selection of dishes we could taste. Though the price was a bit on the upside, as we had to pay 160 HKD for our elder daughter who only had a croissant for b'fast. We had planned to visit the Disney Land on the first full day of our stay, as it was our daughter's b'day too. But the weather prediction card kept in our room ( I haven't seen such things in any other hotel I have stayed) said it will be rainy. We were about to drop our plan to visit Disney Land that day, but with the encouragement from the hotel staff we went there on that day itself. And luckily it didn't rain and we had good time. Overall I can say, the hotel is excellent and we had a nice stay. Only downside is that though the hotel is very near to the harbor, there is no view from most of the rooms. But as we were in the hotel only to take rest, we didn't bother much about the view. The hotel staff booked the Big Bus tour for us the next day and guided us to the ferry terminal, which was only 5 mins walk from the hotel. The hotel is situated in midst of shops with best brands in the world. It could be a brand shopper's paradise.

Location just off Canton Road is ideal both for shopping and for access to Tsim Sha Tsui promendade and Avenue of the Stars which was 5 mins walk away. MTR station a few mins walk away too, cabs plentiful and good value for money. Star Ferry terminal to HK island also 5 mins away and ridiculously cheap and a great way to travel across the harbour. Get yourself an Octopus Travel Card (HK equivalent of an Oyster Card) at the airport and travelling around on MTR, buses & ferry and access to attractions like the Peak Tram etc cheaper, easier and quicker. Travelled in on the Airport Express Fast Rail Link (15mins, \u00a38) and then got a cab (a fiver and 5 mins) from Kowloon Station straight into the undercroft of the hotel to be met by the doormen. The fantastic service started there and continued uninterrupted until we left 4 days later. I highly recommend the Club package which gets you access to the private lounge, private check-in/ check-out, breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails & canapes. The staff in there were every bit as wonderful as those in the rest of the hotel - I even had a birthday cake sent to my room unprompted by myself or my girlfriend. Food in the restaurants was excellent and varied, if a little pricey but to be fair that's to be expected in a 5-star Hong Kong hotel. We stayed in Deluxe room which was well equiped, spacious and kept spotlessly clean and was perfect as a sight seeing base. It might have lacked a harbour view but that was no real downside in our opinion, and the price you pay elsewhere for that view is hefty.

The room cost (which included breakfast, not sure what that was worth) was pretty good $255USD for when I stayed and it was a good size room, but the bathroom was a bit tight. Internet was extra ($20USD a day) and the dinner buffet was in the neighbohood of $85USD per person, but I did have a Sprite in there too and I cant' say it was necessarily \"worth it\" but the food selection was outstanding and even with small portions and being a huge guy, I didn't come close to hitting everything available on their Saturday night buffet. Hotels in Hong Kong keep getting ridiculusly high priced and you keep gettng less and less everytime you travel there.

But even those guys are getting less and less pushy for whatever reason, I wonder why? If I can get a decent rate, I'd stay again at the Langham. Attentive service, very clean, and OK location.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWow, what a fantastic hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "Monkey56", "ReviewID": "UR85229916", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Langham for 4 nights in October 2010. We had stayed at the Langham Place last year which we loved, but wanted to try something different this time. We generally like very modern hotels and we were a little skeptical of the more traditional Langham in Tsimshatsui, but boy were we not disappointed, the Langham in Tsimshatsui was AMAZING, just beautiful. The service was flawless in every part of the hotel. Location: the location of the hotel was fantastic. This trip we choose to explore Hong Kong Island more and the hotel was very convenient to the Star Ferry, plus it did not hurt having the Ocean Terminal across the road. Meals: Breakfast was not included in our package, but we did have the buffet on the last day, which was great. Fantastic selection and great service \u2013 I loved the pancake machine! We had drinks, snacks and dessert at the lobby bar, which was all delicious and the service was good. We had Dinner at the Tang Court one night and the service was wonderful and the food was excellent. We also had lunch at the New York Deli and that was good as well. Overall there was a large selection of restaurants to choose from in the hotel. Room: We stayed in the Grand Langham Room, which was just beautiful. I loved the shutter windows between the bathroom and the bedroom. The bath was a perfect size for two also. Staff: Housekeeping was just wonderful. We stayed in room 908 and our housekeeper took great care of us making sure our beds were turned down every night, that we had fresh towels and plenty of ice \u2013 fantastic attention to detail. The reception and concierge staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. We will definitely be returning to the Langham in Tsimshatsui we had such an amazing experience.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiltshire, England", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel - Don't hesitate - book now!\u201d", "Author": "WB1", "ReviewID": "UR84332370", "Content": "Have just returned from a wonderful 12 night stay with our family at The Langham in Hong Kong.

The room was spacious for two people, the tv was flatscreen and of a reasonable size and there was heaps of cupboard space for clothes. The bathroom had a huge mirror and the shower is controlled by a thermostat. Housekeeping actually folded up our clothes on the bed and put things back in order. The bathroom was clean and you get a telephone next to the toilet just in case you need to make a call whilst on the loo. There are three phones in the room! In terms of its location it is in the ritzy area of TST near the luxury brand shops and Harbor City. It is also close to the ferry terminal to HK Island and also Macau. The airport express bus dropped us off near the driveway entry to the hotel so you don't have to walk back down the hill to Peking Rd, you can just walk up their driveway to enter the hotel. Our room was located on the inner side not facing the street so we had a good night's sleep and if you turn the air con up really high it creates white noise to block out the noise from the corridor.

We caught the airport express into Kowloon, which takes about 20mins followed by a short bus transfer to your hotel. The train is safe, clean and easy to negotiate. Would recommend this to everyone as it's a good way to see the HK scenery before you get into the hustle and bustle of Kowloon and HK central. The return leg via the train station is also handy because you can check your bags in without having to go to the airport. You'll appreciate this when you see the long queues. It also frees your time up and allows you do other things before leaving HK without having to rush to the airport. The Langham itself is in the heart of Kowloon. Everything is within walking distance. Nathan Rd, the ferry terminal and the large shopping malls are only a 5min walk away, the MTR is across the road and the street markets are easily within walking distance if you want to take in some of the HK street life. Recommend this if this is your thing. My wife and I felt safe throughout. We were greeted by kind, friendly and helpful hotel staff. The entrance was clean and very elegant in appearance. The legendary and renowned Langham scent was ever present and very welcoming. Valerie at the front counter checked us in. She was friendly and helpful and provided us with an upgrade, without asking, from a deluxe room to a grand langham room. We were very appreciative of this kind gesture. The room was beautiful, spacious and clean. We had a large king size bed, 40inch TV, work desk and excellent lighting. Room service was twice daily, which came with complementary water and fresh fruit. There's a fridge with various food and drink in it - it's also large enough to put you own things in it .

Stayed in various hotels when we were in Hong Kong but had so far stayed twice at The Langham's sister hotel, Langham Place. Being a Hotel snob, I would always want to make each trip special by staying at different hotels but both The Langham and Langham Place are exceptions to this rule. We arrived via the Airport Express train into Kowloon station. Made the mistake by taking the free K2 bus (up a level and look for the B2 exit) to The Langham as it is on the 7th stop of a total of 8 hotels. The journey was 20-25 minutes, but a short cab ride of say 5-8 minutes could have brought you to the Hotel straight away (HK$25-28). Never again! However, after our stay here in February 2010 (2nd to 5th), we are almost certain that we would be back to this Hotel for the second time! Being members of the Leading Hotels, we were upgraded to a Langham suite upon booking - a good gesture, but no surprises. Still, we are moved by a gift of a shopping bag, fruit platter, at least 6 bottles of mineral water waiting in our suite! I had asked for a higher floor, non-smoking room and all requests were fully met with. We were given room 1238, on the non-smoking 12th floor. Though the suite was not huge in size, it was certainly comfy enough for a 3 nights stay. Situated at the end of the corridor, bordering a busy expressway, the suite was blissfully quiet during the night for a good nights sleep (though during the day, slight traffic could be heard at times). There was a door separating the bedroom from the sitting hall, which has a three seater sofa, and a single armchair. These chairs are very hard to sit on, probably cos they are new (well, they certainly looked new!). A huge sized flat screen TV in the hall, and a smaller TV in the bedroom. No coffee makers nor microwave ovens here (unlike Langham Place), but there is a kettle for making coffee and tea (tea & coffee bags provided). Bathroom wise, surprisingly, it was small and rather cramp, with a corner jacuzzi tub, shower cubicle, WC and double vanity sinks. Though the bathroom is not as new as the rest of the suite, but it is still compact and very functional. Anyway, I would prefer it this way, who spends most of their time in hotel bathrooms, agree? There were lots and lots of closet space, iron and ironing board, and we brought along a PC so we serve the internet free of charge in the suite - bliss for my husband! Ah oh yes, that very very heavenly huge bed - soooo comfy that we slept till almost 8am when we normally gets up at 6.30 or 7am! Total bliss again! What really touches us and impresses us was - our fruit platter was replenished daily, so are the various types of mineral waters! I am not too sure if all rooms get this special touch or this only applies to suites, but for frequent travellers like us, we are indeed impressed! Newspapers are placed along the corridors for all to help themselves, good gesture, too. We had two breakfasts at its Club Lounge on the 11th floor, surprisingly, good range and high quality! All pastries, hams, sausages, fruits were yummy, but the two Chinese dim-sum dishes were not up to HK's high standard. Lunch at its Michelin starred Tang Court was also really good, try its signature Lobster dish (HK$600), you won't regret it. Location wise, couldn't be better! Its close to my favourite HK shopping centre, The Harbour City - huge and gigantic with lots of mid to high range clothings and accessories. Spent a fortune here, much to my husband's annoyance! Its great to walk merely minutes with your shopping bags and back into the comfort of your suite, heavenly! All staffs, including those at the Reception, at the Club Lounge and the Concierges, all speak fluent English and are very friendly and helpful with whatever questions and requests we had. The hotel also provide turn-down services, but we decline them (felt like its a waste of time and resources!). Weather cards are also placed discreetly at your doors daily. Lastly, we were really impressed by the Hotel's European decor in the lobby, with decorated ceilings and chandeliers abound. A rarity in HK, where we could enjoy some Italian charm and splendour in downtown HK. We will be back and perhaps try their larger Vogue suite the next time?

We weren't to sure if we had missed the sales but on arrival found that half the shops were still in full swing with their sales. I looked on Tripadvisor for a reasonably priced hotel in the main drag for quick access to the shops because we were only staying four days and we were visiting a couple of friends as well on Hong Kong Island and Macau. It was such a pleasant surprise to find this hotel was much more than it looked like on the internet. We were treated so very special from the time we entered the hotel, taking us up to our room and at any time day or night the service on the reception was excellent. They did so much for us and answered all our questions and gave us the best service you could ask for. The rooms were bigger than what we thought they would be. The beds were really comfortable and the rooms were really clean. The bathroom had heaps of room and the towels were thick and large. The linen on the beds was always so white and crispy and felt refreshing after being outside in the heat shopping all day. We had the buffet breakfast one morning in the Cafe and found it alright, we have had better buffets before and the price was a little on the dear side but overall it was not bad. We also had an evening meal in the upstairs Chinese Restaurant. This was superb cuisine. The service was unbelievable the whole evening. It was their expensive restaurant and we did not mind paying as we had one of our best meals. The pool area was a little small but this was to be expected in Hong Kong as there is not much space but it was really nice to go for a swim in the afternoon and relax before hitting the shopping again in the evening. We went to Macau and Hong Kong Island and this hotel is only around the corner from the China Ferry and Star Ferry and was really easy to travel to our destinations. The only down side to our experience was the roadworks outside the hotel. You could not cross the street to get to Nathan Road you had to go underground via steps go along the corridoors and then up the steps again to street level. After a few times a day and also in the evening it started to get to you a bit. Once these roadworks are finished there would be no problems.

They also added a location map (which was already in their website), as well as links to Weather and Things to do in Hong KOng. At the airport, since we also bought a round-trip Airport Express pass, we were entitled a free shuttle bus ride from the Kowloon Station to the hotel! Talk about convenience! When we entered the lobby, we were met with a very soothing aroma of something really relaxing. Less than 10 minutes with Valerie at the front desk, we were already led to the elevator, and to a room which they upgraded to de luxe! The de luxe room had just the right size - furnishings were not cramped in the room - and the features were a delight... There was a 37 inch flatscreen TV, and I was really happy to find an ipod dock on the bedside table. The bath tub was indeed deep; they have an iron, ironing board, umbrella (which really came in useful during the rainy days ahead), an adaptor, hair dryer and a safe. They also have thick bath robes as well as slippers. The toiletries included toothbrush and Colgate toothpaste, shampoo, a separate conditioner, body wash and body lotion. Also, they have cotton swabs and ear buds, and combs. They supplied us with fruits and water everyday, even twice a day. When we arrived, we just dropped our things and ate the fruits while we rested. We decided to walk towards the harbour; when we came back, the bed was made up, the water and fruits replenished! On the same day! I was impressed! The bed had four pillows, all soft and clean. There is an extra blanket and pillow in the cabinet. There was a sort-of a stationery box, which was just charming and generous. There were reading materials in the room - national geographic, newsweek and a Hong Kong Travel guide. There were two piles of daily newspaper near the Lift. And below hotel is the DFS Galleria and the Lippo Sun Arcade (there's a Starbucks Cafe there). About 3 minutes walk from the hotel is the Harbour City shopping mall, which is interconnected with the Gateway malls and City Super shopping mall. Lots of shops in one roof. In the same building is the ocean terminal. The TST MTR Station (Tsim Sha Tsui) is about 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel. Bringing the hotel umbrella would really help if it rains, as there are a few meters of walk that are not on covered grounds. The hotel also offer to exchange your dollar to the Hong Kong currency. At that time, US$1 = HKD$7.24 was the rate in the hotel (vs. US$1 = HKD$7.02 in Travelex). If you really need to maximize your dollar, you can look at some money exchanger nearby (I saw one offering US$1 = HDK$7.8 on the subway exit going to the TST station. On three occasions i got to call the concierge to ask about directions; he was just always ready with an answer. And accurate ones too. The service staff were very courteous and friendly. The only time we ordered for inroom dining was after a tiring day at the Disneyland and on the following morning. Food was okay; they came with after dinner mints. The bread basket contained toasts, one small danish pastry and one croissant. Had three marmalades and butter too. The coffee came in a two metallic thermos. We were able to have three cups each, and it was not empty! Then, checking out was no trouble at all. it took less than 10 minutes.

We were practically pulled from the taxi by the bellman who whisked us to check-in. The lobby and common areas were beautiful, spotless and relaxed. Check-in was perfect and highlighted by an upgrade to a better room. In fact, the check-in clerk even escorted us to our room where she showed the features, the thermostat, internet, etc. After the long haul from New York, the room itself was such a treat I almost cried.

They suggested a new booking with daily Brunch at about the same price- which saved my grace with my in-laws' particular needs, for them being the second time out of the U.S. and quite a bit on the older side, so they prefer Western diet and relative convenience even on the road.

We were impressed the first time and had to come back! From the moment you check in you are treated like royalty. We pre-arranged a Limo to pick us up at the airport and that service was fantastic. $150AUD each way is a bit expensive but it was a new mercedes s class! Everyone greeted us every time we walked around the hotel, many times remembering names. We had a large 2 room suite on the 13th floor for 3 adults. the main bedroom was a king bed, but unfortunately the other bed was a roll out that was placed in the living room. Still good enough considering the comfortable spacious room. I had been in a friends 'basic' room last time and it was very ordinary and not very large, so i think you should go for the suites unless you are travelling alone. Our room also had complimentary laundry up to $400HK per day which is plenty. The laundry all comes back neatly folded and wrapped up like its brand new. We also had access to the Club Floor Lounge on the 11th. Which means you can have complimentary drinks & alcohol, cakes and yummy snacks day or night. Perfect for recoving for half an hour between shopping trips. Location is second to none. you are right in the heart of the best shopping area in all of HK. Harbour City is a huge shopping centre you can get lost in thats open till 11pm every night. Otherwise is a quick 5 minute walk to the ferry to go accross to the island. Or taxi around to areas like Mong Kok, Elements shopping centre etc. The only complaint I have about the area is that Tsim Tsa Tsui is home to a lot of tailors and replica watch street dealers. So everytime you walk over towards Nathan Road you end up getting bombarded with people trying to sell you things... I guess we looked like tourists... There is also a wonderful gym/pool area on the rooftop that is a relaxing escape from the busy city downstairs. Next time for a change of scene i would love to stay at the Peninsula Hotel which is not far from the langham which is as glamorous as it is expensive.

We stayed in a renovated grand room with a spa bathroom which included the club facilities. Nice rooms - all modern with great facilities - ipod charger, plasma tv etc. We noticed that when we checked in as leading hotel members they couldn't do enough for us - room tours, free gifts including a nice bottle of rose champagne - plus we had a couple of issues with construction noise and they were very helpful and then offered us free airport transfers as compensation. Regarding the construction - if you want to sleep after 8.00am (which we didn't for the 1st stay as we were working - but did on the 2nd stay) book a room facing the courtyard - you won't get a view (but then there really isn't much of a view anyway as there is a very large building blocking what once was a lovely harbor view) - if you have a \"city\" view then you may get disturbed. We ate breakfast each day in the downstairs breakfast restaurant as this has a much better selection that in the club lounge - it really was a lovely spread with everything american, continental and asian to choose from. We had a massage at the spa which was great and then went for a jacuzzi and swim in the rooftop pool (the pools heated and a very nice temp.) - we were the only ones there so it was a relaxing experience. The hotel is well located for shopping - you can get everything you could possibly want at the attached shopping malls and on peking road / canton road. Its also close to the subway (very clean, safe and fast) and the star ferry which will take you across to hong kong island - do this at sunset its amazing to see the buildings light up.

I arrived in the afternoon and was taken to the club lounge to check in, the staff were polite enough and told me that I had free internet access in the hotel, when I logged onto the computer all I had to do was enter my room number and surname. I thought great. I had just got off a 12 hour flight and needed some sleep, when I got into the room I was a little horrified. How was this a 5 star hotel? the room was tiny and cramped and looked like a Motel 6 or a Premier Travelodge rather then a 5 star hotel, the room was tiny, they had just added afew items to make it look good like a glass sink in the bathroon and non branded plasma screen television on the wall. I am not saying this hotel wasn't smart, but in a place like Hong Kong, this is no where near as good as the Conrad, in the Conrad the rooms are maybe 3 or 4 times as large as this with even the toilets having aquavision televisions. 5 minutes after getting into the room I could hear the people next foor talking, then I heard their tv, it wasn't like they had it playing very loud, but it was the fact that whoever designed this place went for small shoddy rooms with cheap sound insulation in the walls. I called the club lounge and told them I couldn't sleep, they didn't seem phased. I was really frustrated. So I whipped out my laptop and went online, saw charges, but was reassured it was free, so went online (only to be told it was chargeable when I checked out). Eventually I got to sleep that night only to be awoken by intimate noises from the next room, again this is something you expect at a motel 6 or a premier travelodge but not a 5 star hotel. I felt bad for them because I could literally hear everything, and it made me feel awkard. After they were finished, (all of 2 minutes later, lol) I managed to get some shut eye. But for some reason the house keeping staff just don't care about do not disturb signs, I kept getting knocks on the door and was shouting out come back later. Eventually one of the house keepers came in. I told her to come back later so she left. I was so tired, managed to nod off again only to have house keeping call me about 10 minutes later and ask why I didnt want my room cleaned. I was so tired at this stage, and just couldn't get back to sleep. Was tossing and turning in my bed for about 15 minutes and then the tv from next door went back on. Great! The next morning I went to the club lounge for breakfast, which by the way is no where near 5 star standard, its variety is very limited. The staff attending this breakfast were a joke, laughing, flirting and joking with each other rather then serving the guests, I got given tea with no milk and didnt get the milk for ages cos no one paid me any attention, so my tea went cold. They also never cleared plates off my table even when I had finished. The next day I spoke with the concierge about how to get to the office I needed to go to, he showed me the way and I told him of my plans to go to China. I have been to China afew times and because I work out of Shenzhen there I don't bother with a visa as you get a 5 days stay automatically on a British Passport. But this concierge told me there was no way I could do that and insisted I need a full on visa, so being the fool I am I gave him my passport and parted with around 1000HKD to get my visa done. I thought maybe the rules had changed, but they hadn't. When I got to China I just realised he propbably didn't understand English. Now this is a 5 star hotel run by the English and is frequented by English and American guests, why is there a concierge who doesnt spreak English properly? In terms of location, its pretty good I guess if you are there for shopping, because it is near ladies market. In terms of the rooms, its nothing special, if you want an amazing hotel in Hong Kong pay the extra and stay at the Conrad. In terms of the service, again its not great. In terms of amenities in the hotel, its not great, the bar is very small no atmosphere, the restaurants are not very good either. Just to give you an example, the \"chunky chips\" are in fact french fries.

But essentially what the hotel lacks in Hong Kong views it makes up for in service and comfort.", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel in good location!\u201d", "Author": "Ulrike73", "ReviewID": "UR5598191", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and I was very satisfied.

As the hotel is located within some other big buildings you don\u00b4t have a view from the room window, but we didn\u00b4t mind. Stuff is very helpful and friendly. The location is very good too - just very close to shopping malls, restaurants (the famous Peninsula Hotel with its Felix bar is only 5 Min. walk away) and also close to the ferry to Hongkong Island. We dind\u00b4t have breakfast there...but Starbucks etc. are nearby... They also have a small pool and recreation area in Italian style on top of the building, which is very nice for relaxing after a day of sightseeing.

I checked in with my gay partner. Despite confirming with the airport desk that a double bed was booked, including diagrams of what double beds and single beds looked like, when we arrived at the hotel about 30 mins later, 2 single rooms were allocated to each of us. Then a twin room. Then eventually a room with a double bed, with the rest of the guests checking in entertained by it all. I didn't take umbridge or offence but found it funny. It is rather quaint to be thrown back to the dark old days once in a while. However, other \"Leading Hotels of the World\" hotels are completely au fait with gay couples, and only ask \"you have a room with a double room, is that correct?\". All cleared up in one question. 2 We were woried about the noise as the hotel is right bang in the middle of TST. The room, on the top floor and the furthest away from anything right in the corner (because we were gay?) was very clean, quiet, roomy and great. Couldn't fault it. And the turn-down service was good and fruit provided as well as decent toiletries. 3 The concierge service was very very impressive. Gave our flight details to the concierge for reconfirmation of our flights and headed off to the shops. He said leave it to him. That evening, a letter was placed in our room confirming everything and giving names of the relevant staff etc. Also, there is always staff in reception foyer dedicated to just answering questions from guests rather than checking in staff only. Like it. 4 Very close to Harbour City shopping plaza, Gucci, Prada etc. and only a 5 min walk from the Star Ferry. 5 Swimming pool was more like an oversized bath tub surround by big walls so not much room for sunbathing. 6 A local we got talking to said the Langham Place hotel was actually better then the Langham Hotel. However, if you like shopping, we would recommend this hotel as the Langham Place is a little further out.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cbit bland\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5393634", "Content": "Ok, stayed here for 3 nights.

The message from the server kept saying that my reservation doesn't exist. I read again the policy stated in the e-mail of reservation sent and I discovered a statement saying that the guest should pre-registered before 72 hours or the reservation is cancelled. On the booking it was guaranteed with my credit card but reading that statement assured me that my reservation could have been cancelled automatically since the system couldn't find out my reservation. I was told that Langham Palace is a newer sister hotel of the same group and so I made another reservation with Langham Palace. Guess what? A day after the stay there was an e-mail from the sales manager from Langham Hotel (not the Langham Palace) saying they charged me for one night penalty. It's a complete scam and I can't believe after talking to her that she was still convinced that I should have cancelled my reservation firt, but how to cancel since the web site said it didn't exist. I would ask my Amex investigation department for not paying the charge since it is completely the problem of the hotel reservation system. So for you out there, before making the internet reservation, beware! Internet transaction in Asia and especially from the local group companies are not that stable like in global hotel chains such as Marriott, Starwood or Hyatt. I learnt my hard lesson and I definitely won't stay in Langham again.
