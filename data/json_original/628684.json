The stench of cheap air freshener throughout the hotel is sickening. The only thing that distracts you from this and the state-of-the-art 7\u201d TV is the rapid sequence of airplanes during final approach right above the hotel\u2019s roof. This is due to the advantageous position of the hotel right at the end of a runway at Berlin-Tegel airport. Unfortunately, the airport shuts down at midnight, so the sound of airplane turbines will no longer drown out the sound of ambulance and police sirens racing by. Once one closes the window to (slightly) muffle the cacophony, one becomes painfully aware of the odor emitted by the room, which can only be described as sweaty old man walks wet dog. As soon as the windows are shut the room temperature quickly increases from unpleasant to roasting.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Baerlin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d628684-Reviews-Hotel_Baerlin-Berlin.html", "Price": "$41 - $84*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Scharnweberstrasse 17-20</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">13405</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "628684", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/64/31/6431cec41bcfd2cdae4ffa08bf8d08a16large.jpg"}}
