{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Undersized and Overpriced When entering the room, we were shocked by its small size, the stain in the linen and the hair (!!) between the towels. Failing to cancel our booking with the travel agent, we had to stay at the hotel for 6 consecutive nights. Upon request, we were given promptly another room, which was clean and slightly bigger (estimated 10 sq m including bathroom for HKD 550).More cons:- our room was as wide as the length of the bed. If you are as tall as my husband (1.9m), you are not able to stretch your legs fully while sleeping. The room was so small for our two suitcases that we finally had to leave one suitcase elsewhere.- no in-room wireless LAN as advertised. We borrowed an ethernet cable from the reception - free of charge.- I was disturbed and made sleepless every night by different noisy guests. They talked loudly and lively with each other in the corridor early in the morning and late at night. While the noise from the street was insulated very well, the noise from inside the hotel was not.The pros:+ great location: the hotel is just 3 mins walk away from the underground station Prince Edward, and bustling Mong Kok is easily reached on foot+ friendly staff at receptionSummary:Ok for only one or two nights and only if you are well-prepared for the tininess of the room. We had a very stressful time.", "Date": "Dec 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR644397782", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hkyk"}, {"Content": "Good location and value       Bathroom with glass walls", "Date": "Nov 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR718682998", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "anitak21"}, {"Content": "Overpriced and too small...
