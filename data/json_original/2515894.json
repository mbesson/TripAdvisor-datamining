We got this hotel through package deal with SeaWorld which included 4 tickets to seaworld. It seemed like a great deal. Upon check in we were leery as the hotel parking lot is very dimly lit. It does not lend to a safe feeling at all. After check-in, we proceeded to our King suite on the first floor. We were not pleased with the smell in the hallway as we approached our room. It smelled of dirty carpet and various ethnic foods. The room was unsatisfactory, stained carpet and a musty odor. There were no pillows or linens for the sofa bed. A call to the front office to ask for linens was met with a response of \"we are booked solid for the night and there are no additional pillows, however I will try to find linens\". At this point I tried reaching the company we reserved the hotel through to ask for a refund, however they were closed. Instead of calling again I went to the front desk to speak with management. This time my room was immediately changed to the 5th floor and I was given a complimentary bottle of wine. The 5th floor looked like a totally different hotel. It was nice and clean and smelled fresh. This room met my expectations for cleanliness and was stocked appropriately with pillows and linens. The breakfast was fine for what it is (free), there is something for everyone to choose from if they so choose. The hotel is located in busy I-drive, very convenient to SeaWorld. I honestly would not stay at this hotel again because there is such a disparity among rooms/floors, it would be a gamble as to what you end up with.

The position of the hotel is excellent, the aircon blasts out cold air the fridges are big and cold, everything works fine. The pool is clean and well looked after.

There again, at 3am you will have no choice but at least you can get things urgently. The other minor niggle was the plastic cutlery and Styrofoam plates.

Not sure if Kwan cancelled the room and they gave the room to me or not. Though the hotel was not full, the internet connection was extremely slow. I can only wonder how it would be when the hotel is full. The king bed was well made with fresh clothes. Location was ideal from a proximity to the highways. However, International Drive can be a nightmare to drive through due to the traffic. A drive to pick up food from a restaurant a few blocks away can take about 45 mts to an hour in the evening due to traffic on both sides- so plan for this when you take your kids to eat out for dinner.

Myself and my family and my twin sister and her family flew over to America for first time and we loved it. My sister stayed in Hampton Inn Suites which again was good but mine was better. The great thing was transport was free to the parks and we saved a fortune with the free homewood tea which was served Mon to Thurs. Breakfast got a bit repetitive but to be honest if you was at home you would not eat the same thing every day. Eggs could have been sunny side up and not scrambled all time. Loads of cereal porridge etc so choice enough. Brocolli was raw which I found bizarre ha ha but what can I say. Even free wine and beer with our meals. Trust me this saves you a fortune this does especially if you have kids, and you are so knackered from being at theme all day you dont want to dress up and go out. It is not like going to spain. So its great you can get this tea free and just chill in your room from about 9 onwards. Spain is for staying out late as you dont do much in day but America is so jam packed with fun you are bushed by 5pm. There was a place called the ALE House just near our hotel. We loved it. Great Food, Great drinks. Big Screens. Pool Tables. Full of atmosphere american style loved it so so much. Put it this way my husband was dubious about going to America but it charmed him over. We loved orlando it was fantastic. You expect International Drive to be like Blackpool but it isn't everything is so far apart. It's very easy to drive in America so get your self a car. Fantastic Holiday we are counting down the days to go back. GO on the HULK even if you do not like roller costers. I'm a softy but absolutely loved it. Harry Potter Spider Man etc was fan tastic. The theme parks were great in our first week as it was in school time but beware a much longer waiting time in peak times like school holidays. Q Bot is a must.

Went to sleep in my car for an hour, in my business clothes. Hilton did arrange to get me into their Hampton Inn on the same property as the Homewood for wednesday night.

They seconded what I was telling the front desk clerk about my experience. Hilton told me that if they knew I was a Diamond member, they would not have moved me.

The Homewood Suites on International Drive, is an attractive, modern major branded hotel in the heart of tourist Orlando. That's also the problem! It's in the heart of tourist Orlando. Within three miles of this location, there are 90 other hotels/motels, along with over 200 food options (Microsoft Streets & Trips). Can you say congestion? Depending on time of day, there can be near-gridlock conditions at the first traffic light, on the way to Interstate 4 intersection. Unless you're walking, do yourself a favor, don't use International Drive at all, Instead go one block east to Universal Blvd., and enjoy the wide open spaces! Now maybe you enjoy your neighbors and don't mind the crowds. That's cool, you are in Orlando after all right? On to the hotel. This was our second stay at a Homewood Suites in six months, and it's a excellent property for your vacation. High on the list of positives is the two-room suite with a kitchen area. This can be very helpful for a family, or for an extended stay like ours (Five nights). The fridge and extra sink are great to have. While on the topic of sinks though, my pet peeve with Homewood is their insistence of placing the bathroom sink, not in the bathroom, but next to the bed! Just try brushing your teeth, three feet away from a sleeping partner, and not disturb them. This is such an annoyance to me, that we probably won't use this brand again in the future -Sorry. The living room of this hotel was a bit small, the couch old and very low to the floor, and the bathroom light buzzed loudly. We also asked for an extra suitcase rack upon our arrival. A week later, we're still waiting. If you decide to stay here, ask for a room on the outside of the building, not the inside facing the surrounded pool area. Insert screaming kid noises here. The parking lot can fill up at night, because of the surrounding restaurants. They have a security person to help keep non-guests away. Help. There is a Universal Studios/Seaworld desk in the lobby where you can get info, purchase discounted tickets, and even arrange transportation to those parks. The free breakfast is very nice. On our last night, while in the business office printing my departing flight's boarding passes, It was discovered the printer was out of paper. After calling the front desk, they said, I could come to them and get some paper. I Can? that's nice. Because of this hotel's horseshoe shape, and multiple exits, navigating the hallways can be a tiring exercise. Note to management: Install \"This way to Lobby\" and \"This way to elevator\" signs. You really need them! In short, this is a fine hotel in the center of the action. But if don't like crowds look elsewhere. Because of the multiple area highways, ten miles way, is only ten minutes away. And a note about Orlando's highways. They are a mix of confusing criss-crossing toll and no-toll roads, some without toll takers! I'm from New Jersey, and I have never seen so many toll booths in my life!

The shuttle to Disney was very easy but keep in mind, it brings you to Epcot Center and then you must get on a monorail to Magic Kingdom; this is quite simple to navigate. The shuttle to Universal Studios brought us right to the park. Pace yourselves at the parks so you are sure you can get your shuttle back to the hotel.

Line-ups and seating is the only real issue at meal time. You can't beat waking up, grabbing breakfast and heading to WDW or Seaworld. Saves time and money. My son is a picky eater to boot so grabbing tiny bits of food at the breakfast bar for him to try is priceless really. We made it back for complimentary \"snack\" one afternoon - it was chicken stir fry. It was salty but probably a good thing since we were sweating all day.

You are within walking distance of so many good places to eat (Bahamas Breeze, Millers etc.), there are bus stops almost directly outside, you can rent a car across the road, cheap helicopter tours nearby and free shuttles to Orlando and Disney. There is also a Walgreens less than 5 minutes away. When we arrived we were given such a warm reception by the staff at the front desk (Nancy & Luis I think). It was that greeting (and the bottle of complimentary wine) that set the tone for the rest of our stay. The room was large, clean and comfortable. You get plenty of living area, two HDTVs, a large fridge, 2 hobs and a microwave. One thing that isn't mentioned is the \"Manager's Reception\" which is essentially free Dinner most nights. It is perfect if you're feeling a bit peckish and it consists of good and honest food. The complimentary breakfast was great too. There were laundry facilities on our floor too, handy for getting your clothes clean before the next part of your adventure.

We stayed here as a family while my husband was in Orlando for business. We chose a suite so we would have room to move and a Kitchen so I could fix food for my boys that have food allergies Upon arrival, they told us to park at a certain door which was very far from the room and we eventually found the back side door the next day to be closer (but that is where the employees sit and smoke so you had to walk by smoke with kids every time we went in and out of the hotel- they also kept this door unlocked for anyone to walk in) Con: We walked into our \"non-smoking\" room to be greeted with an overwhelming smell of smoke, with asthma and a kid who gets sick from smoke (we stayed out of the room as much as possible which is not what we planned because of the smoke smell). So, I walked in further to see a tiny fridge with no freezer and the bottom piece missing which my curious one year old quickly found was missing. The trim on the kitchen floor was all chewed up, so obviously a dog was previously in our room and my one year old once again found it and almost got cut on it. Con: The beds were very hard to me and I didn't sleep well but my husband slept fine, he thought they were a little hard but not bad. Con: The rooms and beds were sorta clean, we found a purple sock and magazines shoved down in the couch cushions so obviously they didn't clean there and there were crumbs in the drawers so we just lived out of our suitcase for the week. Con: They offer Free High Speed Internet which is basically a joke because we could only get service in about 2 spots in the entire suite and it ran S L O W. Hoping it would be faster at the business center...LOL that is a joke of a business center. I can't remember the last time I saw computers that old and that useless, i finally got it to load and get to the page i needed to print only to get an error that it couldn't print so I had to find a local library and pay $5 to use their computers and print one piece of paper. As we were packing up, I put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher to get cleaned and it was soo loud and making noises that when I looked at it when it was done, the dishwasher actually came/shook itself out of the wall. Con: No full size fridge as advertised and pictured on their website. Con: High Speed Internet is a joke. Con: Room smelled horrible of smoke Con: The breakfast buffet- eggs were ugghh and the sausage was fake meat and I am not even that picky on food. It was also extremely packed, as in you couldn't find a place to sit down and eat so be prepared to take it back to your room. Pro: Waffles at Breakfast were super yummy!

THE GOOD STUFF: We stayed in a King Suite which offered a kitchenette, two t.v.s in separate rooms and a VERY comfortable bed. There is an in-room safe, and the bathroom offers a lot of space (sink is separate from toilet/bathtub). I was very happy with the full-sized fridge because we were freezing water bottles to take with us to the parks. There was no \"stove\" - it was more of a hot plate, but we purchased a lot of 'easy' frozen meals that just needed to be heated up so it did the job. There is a manager's reception from Monday to Friday (Fridays are the best days) that offers an evening snack and 'free' alcohol (a few select beers and wine), as well as breakfast with a LOT to choose from. On certain floors there's a small laundry room that only takes quarters. You can purchase everything you need in the gift shop next to reception, and get quarters as well. We slept very well in this room and never heard noise from the neighbouring rooms or the hallway. Parking was NEVER an issue. THE BAD STUFF: When we checked in, \"something happened\" with our reservation (booked 4 months in advance) and we were put into a smoking room because there were no more King Suites available for our stay. If we insisted on non-smoking (which we are), we would end up with something smaller and wouldn't be able to get a refund because we didn't pay through the hotel itself. A few days it seemed like the room wasn't even made-up, the towels were refreshed but they didn't make the bed or give us fresh toilet paper/bags when we changed our own garbage. We never complained to the front desk, but the next day everything would be done. I guess it depends on who's cleaning your room? ***P.S.*** International Drive is one hot mess of a tourist trap, full of restaurants and gas stations.

The next day the room was not cleaned at all when we got back at 5 pm.

The next day I left a tip and we had a room that was actually cleaned and we had extra towels. Lesson learned - tip if you want your room cleaned. The second annoyance was the Hilton's preferred car service. The black sedans are always out front and the staff even had the nerve to say we should wait inside for their cab because other companies will rip you off. Their company is the one doing the ripping off. All numbers are before tip - i) Airport to hotel with 3rd party cab $36 - hotel to airport with Hilton's service $42, ii) SeaWorld $14 with Hilton's recommended service - return with a regular cab was $7.70 one time and $9.35 on our visit from Discovery Cove, iii) Universal $14, return with a regular cab $10.05. We also went to Animal Kingdom and we had a driver named George - he was terrible. In addition to not paying attention while driving, he overcharged us ($45 there, $36 back with a regular cab) while he ironically told us what a rip off Disney was - don't bite the hand that feeds you - especially when you have two young customers in the back making their first trip to Disney.

OK - maybe not mom's but then again who really is other than mom? For the price (did I mention free??) we got turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, green beans, stuffing, gravy, rolls, tossed salad, beer, wine, soft drinks, coffee, hot cocoa - anyone who would complain deserves to starve. Again - staff so gracious and welcoming while working on a holiday instead of being with their own families. 2) room - 2 bedroom (1king and 2 doubles) with two bathrooms. Living area kind of small but adequate for us. Very clean, nicely appointed with microwave, 2 burner electric stove, toaster, coffee pot, (no oven) and plenty of dishes for 6. Now you would not be making your own thanksgiving dinner in the room - but why would you when they offered it downstairs for free?

The waffles were very popular with the children staying at the hotel! There is fruit juice, tea, coffee and hot chocolate at breakfast and there is also free tea and coffee available 24 hours a day. The hotel suites are cleaned daily and every evening we would come back to our room to find our kids' teddies all neatly lined up on the bed, the kids loved this, we thought it was pretty cool too! We had a one bedroom suite with a sofa bed in the living room which was perfectly adequate for our boys (they never complained that they were uncomfortable), they were so tired from the parks that they just got into the bed and went straight to sleep (they very rarely do this at home)! The suites are fully equipped with a toaster, hairdryer, coffee maker, microwave, dishwasher and large fridge freezer, you may need to take a kettle if you think you would need one (we took a kettle but didnt use it as there was always tea, coffee and hot water available). We didnt get a chance to sample any of the manager's free evening meals which are served Monday to Thursday 5pm-7pm as we never returned to the hotel early enough. The location of this hotel is perfect, in a very nice spot just off International Drive, at the Seaworld end. It is in a very quiet position which is nice after all the mayhem of the parks etc! There are various shops and restaurants within walking distance, there is also a Walgreens store approximately a five minute walk away from the hotel. We only used the pool and spa a few times but it was very good, the hotel supplies towels to dry off with and although the pool doesn't get much sun at all, this was not a problem for us, as it was still warm. There is a laundry on the 5th floor which we used twice, you can purchase soap powder from the hotel shop for $1.60 or just take some with you. It is 2 dollars (8 x 1 quarter coins) to use the washers and the same for the dryers. These machines cleaned our clothes perfectly well. To sum up, this hotel was perfect for my family's needs and excellent value for money with superb staff. When we checked out, our 8 year old son was in tears as we were leaving. Angelica, one of the lovely receptionists, gave him a gift (the Homewood Suites Rubber Duck Family) which was a lovely gesture.

The lobby has a very nice dining area where they serve a hot breakfast each morning and offer a happy hour each evening with drinks and a few light snacks. There is a Univeral Studios counter where you can get all the park information, tickets, and catch the bus to the park. There is only 1 elevator that goes up the right side of the building.

I chose to take the stairs any time I wasn't carrying luggage. The pool looked nice. However, I did not get the time to actually use it. Parking was free.

The location is great, near the more up market North end of Idrive, its 2 minutes from a 24 hour Walgreens and wonderworks and only a further 5 minutes to the Pointe Orlando complex. Bahama Breeze is lovely! But there is also lots of other places to eat out within walking distance, as well as Dave and Busters opposite. Helicopter tours are next to Dave and Busters, it\u2019s a must do! The staff are all really friendly and can't do enough for you. The hotel and rooms are a little dated, but compared to other hotels the rooms are so spacious, and it is such a bonus to have a kitchen and lounge area. The only thing we can criticise is the lack of an oven which we would have found extremely useful. The maids were in every day without fail, we felt the hotel in general was very clean. The food wasn't to our taste and there wasn't much choice. That said, the 'welcome home' meals on Mon-Fri were free, so you can\u2019t complain! There was also no resort fee to pay as I have heard with some other hotels on the Idrive which was another bonus. The only thing that really disappointed us about the hotel was the times for the Disney shuttle bus to the parks. The main reason we booked this hotel was because it offered shuttles to both universal and Disney - which was great as most hotels only offer either. The Disney bus left at either 8am or 10.30am (which was good) but didn\u2019t pick up from Epcot until 9.45pm or 10.30pm which we thought was just too long a day (unless you want to see the fireworks one night). So we got the shuttle bus there and made our way back using the Lynx buses. We ended up buying the unlimited 14day tickets and used the buses a lot. DO NOT use the Iride trolley, it takes forever and you are packed in like sardines!! Lynx bus drivers are really helpful, and you are not restricted to just the Idrive - we used Lynx to go to outlets, Publix, Downtown Disney, Disney parks, Sea World, Wet and wild etc. We had a fab time at the Homewood, you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood for its price\u201d", "Author": "mvhmz", "ReviewID": "UR119587853", "Content": "I have just recently returned from a holiday in Orlando and stayed at this hotel. what can i say from the minute we arrived the staff were extremely helpful. we were given a room close to the lift as my father is disabled and they helped us out with directions and everything we needed.

The bedroom had a very comfy large bed with tv and a second room with fold out double bed/settee, tv and a small kitchen area which had everything we needed, also an ensuite bathroom. Everything was very comfortable and clean. We had the complimentary breakfast every morning, a lot of the food was the same each day, but as there was a choice of cereal, waffle, bagels, muffins cakes, fruit and cooked breakfast (and more i havent mentioned) there was no need to eat the same things two days running, so found it was more than enough choice for us, This also saved time and the expense of paying for a breakfast, which we have done when we previously stayed in a different hotel, so by saving you time, it gives you more time for the parks etc. The hotel location is excellent, within walking distance to lots of restaurants and shops, but not on the part of international drive where it is very busy. The hotel lays back from the road and was very quiet and also we found that although the hotel seemed to have quite a lot of people staying, we never heard a lot of noise in our room. The complimentary light meal mon - thurs from 5 - 7pm was useful, we didnt use it every day, but did on the days that we had eaten a lot during the day and wasnt very hungry. They also served cold beer and wine and the beer went down very well, when we came in on a hot day. The WiFi was free and easy to use, also we had a free safe in the room.

The suite we were given was comfortable, rather than spacious, but it contained all the facilities one could expect, including a free in room safe facility which is not often the case at other hotels. The staff were very efficient and the room was kept clean throughout our stay. Reception staff were friendly and efficient and any problems that we raised (we had a malfunctioning toilet on one occasion) were dealt with promptly, which is all you can ask for. The complimentary (?) breakfast was fine, and I do not think that anyone could really complain about the choice, although the coffee we made from the in room coffee maker was better than that in the restaurant.They also have an afternoon complimentary \"reception\" four times a week but we did not partake of that. Needless to say there are many restaurants within a short distance of the hotel, either walking or driving. All in all therefore we had a really nice stay. Oh! the heading. One thing whch did occur to us was that the decor and furniture of the suite we were staying in did appear tired and could do with a bit of modernisation. The lifts were also rather on the slow side.

Although there to attend a conference, I took a couple of extra days to visit Disney parks. I rented a car but really didn't need to. Parking at the hotel is complimentary and ample while parking at Disney is $14.00 a day. The shuttle to Epcot left promptly at 8:00 am each morning and only stopped at the Residence Inn across I-Drive before heading directly to Disney. A later shuttle to Epcot left at 10:00 am daily. Return shuttles left from Epcot at 9:45 pm and 10:30 pm so there is plenty of time to take in the fireworks at Epcot or Fantasmic at Hollywood Studios. For those who want to get back earlier, Lynx buses leave from Downtown Disney and the Disney transportation center. A Lynx schedule is available at www.golynx.com. I found the hotel to be very clean and welcoming. My room was on the fifth floor facing the pool. Noise was not an issue; however, at one point, one of the two elevators was out of order, so the wait on the fifth floor was a little long. As an alternative, I took the stairs down to breakfast and rode the elevator back up to my room thus eliminating the wait. Stairwells were clean and well lit. The bed was very comfortable; but, the hide-a-bed in the living room did not appear to be a comfortable place to sleep. The air conditioning worked well and there was a ceiling fan in my bedroom. The complimentary WiFi was easy to log onto and worked great. I went to breakfast each morning at 7:00 am and at that time I never found it to be crowded. There were eggs and sausage available every morning; however, on a couple of days waffles were not available. There were bagels, cold cereal, fruit, and a choice between oatmeal or grits every day. On a couple of days, bisquits and gravy were available and on the other days potatoes were offered. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and the night life on I-Drive is great. I found this to be a distinct advantage to staying at a Disney property. There is a Subway close by which I appreciated after returning late from the parks. There is also a Walgreen's within a couple of blocks which is open late and sells very reasonably priced beer and wine. So not to worry if you miss the evening reception at the hotel and don't feel like going out for a beer after a long day at the parks. You can have pizza delivered to your room. I also used the automatic icemaker in the refrigerator in my room.

The location itself is perfect, located quite close to universal studios, and wet n'wild water park (which was my kids favourite water park, they weren't gone on the other water park (aquatica) at all for some reason. This hotel had free transport each day to all the universal studios parks, (they had an actual seperate universal desk opposite reception!) which was very well run, I had bought my theme park tickets before I went, after extensive research I went for the flex ticket, as this gave 14 days unlimited access to five different theme parks, Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios, sea world, wet n' wild, Aquatica, and it worked out at $ 1029.81 (www.undercovertourist.com) Approx \u20ac750 (approx 188 per person, \u20ac13.50 each per day!) and I got actual proper tickets, not vouchers, which I wouldn't have trusted at all, anyway having the tickets prepaid and with me when I arrived was brilliant, and it was one less expense whilst there too, the hotel also provided free transport to Disney, which you booked a day ahead through reception itself, the only downside I found was that whilst the free transfers to the various parks was brilliant, their return times were way too early, something like 5 p.m., there was no way my guys were ready to leave the parks at that time, so I came around that by buying a ihop pass for the two weeks, which I purchased at the walgreen store alongside the hotel, and it was very cheap, I think about 15 dollars or something like that, and that covered us in the evenings to get back and the ihop stops everywhere on international drive, so it was handy the days we went shopping as well, and you only pay for adults, not children. Back to the hotel, I booked through an internet site rather than directly with the hotel itself, as their rates were ridiculously expensive I thought, compared to the internet site I used, and I booked a one bedroom suite, and asked that two double beds be in the room, instead of the king size, and there was a double couch bed in the sitting room, which my 14 year old son slept on and he had no problems with it, said it was fine and comfortable. The kitchen/living area was spotlessly clean and well organised, I felt it was a bit small on space, but thats probably because I am used to a 3 bedroom house usually on holidays, and suddenly finding us all in the one hotel room was a bit of a squash, but the room itself was lovely, there was a full size fridge, a cooker, a kettle/coffee maker, the bathroom was lovely and spacious, with the shower inside the bath, plenty of towels and lovely neutrogena shampoo/conditioners/soaps etc., and the bedroom had lots of storage space, there was a chest of drawers both in the living room and the bedroom, and the wardrobe was a normal hotel size, we were able to comfortably unpack all our belongings without a problem. The hotel provided breakfast, which was a self-service effort, and there was always loads of food, it got a bit crowded the later in the day you came down, but hey the hotel was busy, we never had a problem getting a table and there was always loads of fresh food on offer, various cereals, every morning they had scrambled egg, which to be honest gets a bit monotonous after 17 days! they also had some kind of cubed potato thing, which maybe the americans favour, but we weren't gone on it, and they had burger type sausages, again I think an american thing, they had fabulous bagels and sourdough bread things, which were gorgeous toasted, and my kids absolutely loved the idea of making your own waffles for breakfast, they became dab hands at it by the end of the first week! the toppings for same were mad though, syrup and chocolate, and various sprinkles etc., really unhealthy, but what can you say when the kids are on holidays! also the drinks machine was open at half eight in the morning, which I thought was crazy, as I noticed my 14 year old with a strofoam cup and cover on it, and I thought it a bit strange, as he doesn't drink tea or coffee, and when I investigated further it turned out it was full of coca cola at half eight in the morning, and the idea of the lid on it was to fool me into thinking he had taken up tea! anyway I banned my lads from any fizzy stuff in the morning, and they were quietly loaded towards the fruit juice machine every other morning, again it was on tap, orange or apple juice, some kind of pink lemonade juice, which was full of sugar (which the kids of course loved), there were yogurts, fresh fruits, various jams, maple syrups, you name it and I think it was in that breakfast room. Strangely enough the hotel use only styrofoam cups and plates and plastic knifes and forks which you just throw away afterwards, I suppose it spares them on the washing up, and it wasn't a problem. All in all I found this hotel to be lovely, the staff were always pleasant and extremely helpful, and never minded being asked various questions, and we had one night where the air conditioning stopped working in our room, which turned out was caused by me, as I pushed the leather armchair back up against the unit, which in turn caused it to freeze up and stop working, anyway when I reported it to reception, the night manager came up straight away and checked the room and agreed it was way too hot to be able to sleep in, and moved us next door immediately, which was brilliant, as that room was lovely and cool, and we were left the use of the two rooms for the following day in order to move our stuff, as there was a problem in fixing in the air-conditioning unit. There is also a laundry in the hotel, which I used twice, and found brilliant, very cheap, a couple of dollars, and you can wash and dry all your clothes, I just put mine on (and because the machines are american, they are of course huge machines, and fit twice what we would consider a load here in Ireland!) and went back up to my room, and came down an hour later and just transfered the clothes into the drier, and called back an hour later, and my clothes were still there, so no worries there. All in all I would definately stay here again, oh yes I nearly forgot the best bit, infront of the hotel is the bahama breeze restaurant, oh my god, make sure you go there, the food is fantastic, the coctails are out of this world, I ordered one starter of onion rings between the four of us the first night i was there, and 14 huge onion rings (I kid you not!) came out on huge rectangular plate on a bed of lettuce with two seperate dips, and they were delicious, and were very reasonable, plus I discovered the first night in the bar that when you buy the kids a drink, you only pay for the first one, after that they get free refills for the rest of the night! I thought that was brilliant value, as you could be robbed blind in Ireland when out for a night! anyway if you're thinking of booking this hotel, go ahead, you will not be sorry, its a lovely safe, clean, friendly hotel, and excellent value for money, I think it worked out at 65 euro per night for the one bedroom suite I booked, which was good value, plus they also provide a free supper on Mondays through to Thursdays I think from 5 to 7 p.m., we only made it twice, as we were always out at the theme parks, and it was nice enough, pasta and meatballs and salad one evening, and some kind of ravioli I think on the other evening, and free drinks for the kids, and free glass of wine, and a top up, which was very good value.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta, canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "rudy897", "ReviewID": "UR117767703", "Content": "My family and I love this hotel.It is very clean.The free breakfast was a bonus with ample varieties.The 2 bed room suite that we stayed in was very nice and spacious.The staff were very nice and helpful.Will definitely stay here again.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brazil", "Title": "\u201cSecond time at Homewook Suites Orlando I'Drive\u201d", "Author": "Klettenberg", "ReviewID": "UR117718554", "Content": "It was the second time at this hotel, and we've decided to stay there again because we enjoyed our first stay a lot.

Hotel staff were all very polite and helpful and the breakfast is a great start to the day and if you are back from the parks for 5pm until 7pm Monday to Thursday the welcome back beer and food is a great bonus. One big bonus is that they provide free transportation to all parks including disney and that saves hastle and they run a really good schedule. Will be back to Orlando and Homewood suites is the only place to stay. Thanks for a great stay and holiday. Only down side although we didnt use it is the pool as it is quite small but i would image that most people are at the parks so space would not be an issue.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and accommodations!\u201d", "Author": "pangee", "ReviewID": "UR116993651", "Content": "Our family of 9 (4 kids ages 6 thru 14) spent a week in Orlando and found this hotel to be outstanding.

First thing first, when I book a Hotel, it is because of the reviews posted on this trip advisor website; certainly I rely that the reviews are on the spot and truthful when it is time for me and my family to plan for a vacation. All I want is to enjoy the best Hotel experience equal to other trip advisor members; in this case it wasn\u2019t satisfied like I saw in the latest reviews. Let\u2019s start when I first booked my room with a king and sofa bed layout I was told when making my reservation that the sofa bed was confortable, what a lie! My 15 year daughter couldn\u2019t sleep because the spring mattress. I approached the Hotel front desk to express my concerns and they didn\u2019t seem to care about it, the supervisor with last name Roche only suggested that we could change to a two double room only if paying 80 dollars more putting the room total for 170 when in Orlando you can find a two queen layout for 110 tops (original price 90per night w/o tax and charges). I would have normally changed hotels but my daughter forgot a dress she needed to wear for a cruise night and my sister send me the package FedEx from Puerto Rico. To my surprise the Hotel charged me 10 dollars for receiving of the package and holding it for a couple of hours, wow! Let\u2019s start with the room conditions, my room was in the 4 floor in the 440s-460s, there were stains on the carpet, stains the sheets, pubic hair in the tube and for my surprise I don\u2019t know why, there were a bunch of pubic hair in a small towel with a sea shell design, I just took it and threw it on the floor. Personally I didn\u2019t like the rooms design because the bathrooms sink is separated from the toilet and tub. For a sleeper like me and having a wife waking up early using the sink doesn\u2019t go well. In addition there were no ice makers in my floor I needed to go two floors down for ice or use the icemaker in the room\u2019s fridge, I tried it but it was too noisy and it was 5 feet away of my daughter\u2019s sofa bed. The staff of this Hotel gives a bunch of lame excuses; I stayed in this Hotel from August 2 to August 6 and for no apparent reason in August 4 both electronic keys didn\u2019t work at the same time, for some people this isn\u2019t a big issue but when you have a lot of kids playing around in the elevators and you got to use the bathroom and go back to an crowded front desk you\u2019ll remember me!! What the staff told me was that the electronics keys fail when there are close to electronics( but why two at the same time in different pockets), next day all rooms kept receiving newspapers except mine, in addition I stopped getting soap bars, I may add one small soap bar for 3 guest isn\u2019t enough. What to expect from this hotel is a good location well its dead smack on International drive, free grub if your into that and a lot of unattended kids playing through the hotel .

I have a thing about cleanliness and this hotel met my expectations. It was very quiet and the staff always spoke when passing you in the hallways. My only problem when staying here was the front desk clerks didn't seem to have any idea about a promotion in which I booked this hotel. It was through a SeaWorld package. Included in the package was a \"Benefits Card\" in which you are to receive when checking in. They claimed they never seen or heard of a Benefits Card (this allows you to receive the perks at the parks in which was included in the package deal). I called SeaWorld and the Customer Service Rep spoke to the desk clerk and Viola!!!! magically a Benefits Card appears (go figure). I was a little ticked off because I asked for it when I checked in and asked the next morning and they both assured me that was something they didn't participate in. Aside from that, it was an excellent stay. I think they had a beauty convention going on and the hotel seemed to be full. Breakfast was chaos, they couldn't seem to keep up with the demand of the number of guest by replacing the food once the buffet was empty. It was ok if u wanted to grab some toast or a bagel, but if you are not there from the start you will miss out. There is a Denny's next door, I'd suggest that or Ihop. The guy who worked the desk at night was extremely nice and friendly. Once again, if you are looking for a nice clean hotel this is it. They clean the rooms and restock whatever you use (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, coffee, cups, tea etc). I liked the kitchenette in the room too. The tv's were a nice size too. This hotel is in an ideal spot. You don't have to drive to find a place to eat. Boston Lobster Feast is next door. Other places include, Bahama Breeze, Olive Garden, Joe's Crab Shack, Subways, Domino's Pizza, liquor store, camera shop and a 24hr Walgreen's. My husband was happy with this hotel and he is hard to please...he actually made a comment about how comfortable the beds and pillows were.

We had a one bedroom suite at the front of the hotel. We arrived late in the evening to check-in and the staff greeted us warmly. They also allowed us to checkout late. Location: I like the location of this hotel. It is on I-Drive, not far from the action of the Drive. The hotel is off of the street so that it is not affected by the large volume of traffic on I-Drive. There are a variety of restaurants and some shops nearby to pass the time. We used Universal Drive to access the hotel most of the time since there is less traffic and it was easier to get around. You just have to remember to use the Hyatt Place sign as a guide as to when to turn. Room: The room was clean and well appointed. It was nice to have the sink outside the bathroom so that one of us could shower and the other get ready. We found the ceiling fan to be a little much in the bedroom and you couldn't turn the speed up because it would rattle around in the ceiling mount. The full size fridge and two burner cook top were nice. We liked the fact that the freezer would make ice for you as well. The furniture didn't show too much wear and tear. Our one critique would be that none of the lights would go one via the light switch, you always had to go to the lamp to turn them on. Generally: The breakfast was quite good and included in the cost. It wasn't too busy during our visit and it had everything that you needed to get started in the morning. My sister-in-law, who was staying elsewhere, thought it would be a great money saver for any family and it definitely got us past the lunch hour for food. The afternoon snacks with beverages was nice as well. If we had kids, we probably would have topped them off with some food at that time. The pool was small and not really in the sun given it is in the courtyard of the hotel but it was nice. It definitely wasn't as warm as some other hotels but when the temp is 95 degrees, you like a cool pool, not a warm pot. Would definitely stay here again in the future.

Rooms are spacious and include kitchenette with full size fridge(check your freezer before you go looking for the ice machine as it probably has its own ice maker), microwave/rings + utensils. If you are travelling south down international drive the hotel will be on the left(your opposite side of the road) and is not visible from the road. The hotel is behind Denny's, Cattlemans steakhouse and Howl at the Moon, you can turn down any of these and it will take you to the hotels carpark. Breakfast is served between 7 - 10am and the choice is plentiful - cereal, fruit, youghurt, scrambled egg/sausages, toast, bagels etc. With tea/coffee, fruit juices and even coke to drink. If you have kids you will probably spend all your time making their 5'' diameter waffles.

Universal have a desk at reception open till approx 11am each morning, here you can buy tickets or book places on the shuttle for both Universals, Seaworld, Aquatica and Wet n Wild. You must book 24 hours in advance. At the time of writing this shuttle only goes to four hotels so you are not on the bus for long, and Universal and Seaworld have seperate buses. For Disney book with reception, again in advance. We bought I ride 14 day passes from the visitor centre around the corner for $17 each and this allowed unlimited travel for 14 days. We used this for Wet n wild(stop 9), Sea World(stop 33), Aquatica(stop 34) and both Orlando Premium outlet malls(stops 1 and 42), the stops are all outside these locations.

Walgreens supermarket(5 minute walk from the hotel, come out of front entrance and turn left, up through carpark and left past Howl at moon, Tgi Fridays etc ) has good deals on packs of 24 bottles of water, which are ideal for the parks, cosmetics, camera and reasonable selection of food/drink.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cYet again another fantastic stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "moneyaware", "ReviewID": "UR111960599", "Content": "Just back from a week long stay in the Homewood, this being our seventh year staying here.

Welcome home free dinner was a bufett soup and salad and other simple things but again it was free. The shuttle service was excellent and always on time. The front desk help was amazing at answering all our questions. Was about a 15 mins drive to disney, and about 5 to sea world the water parks universal and so forth. The I trolly at 1.25 person ,free for children under 12 was excellent and easy to use, and if we weren't sure where we were going the driver was sure to point us in the right direction.The stops were plentiful and there was a map on every post to check to see where you are going. A tip, there is a outlet shopping mall with a character warehouse on each end of international drive , just get on the bus and tell them you want to go to the outlet mall. We found Disney bargains in both. There are plenty of restaurants to walk to from your hotel, we enjoyed the olive garden very much, just left on international from the hotel ,across the street and maybe a block or so, its a bit hidden. Denny is right outside, and again to the left on international is a subway which we went to a lot in our 10 day stay , and a Walgreen so buy some grocery's to put in our room, mostly we got drinks and ice cream. There are a few stores to your right on international, bargain world is one, that carry disney t shirts at a fraction of the cost ,and pretty much every souvenir you need , a few blocks further to the right is a McDonald and a chicken place sort of like KFC. If your going to use the trolley i recommend just getting a one week pass for like 10 bucks, then you just jump on and off all day long with your card, as you need exact change all the time it gets annoying . The room itself was nice, dated, but clean,the bed was large and comfortable, it had a fridge ,toaster ,stove . microwave ( we brought microwave popcorn to enjoy nightly with a show). Laundry machines on a couple of the floors, you buy the soap. They had a few items for sale , soups ,ravioli, beverages, ice cream bars, that sort of thing but more pricey than just walking to Walgreen. IF we ever go back to Florida, i was for sure stay at this hotel. The only thing I missed was a patio,oh well. The views from the 6th floor were excellent. WE had no complaints at all, and even enjoyed the free daily paper stuffed under are door. OH and we never heard anyone through the walls or in the halls.

The price I paid was a tremendous value and extremely reasonable. The room was always cleaned spotlessly, the much-needed A/C worked flawlessly, and my wife and I commented on how really comfort6able the bed was. Although we didn't get a chance to have the light dinners, the complimentary breakfast buffet was far more than adequate. The outdoor pool was kept very nicely, and there were always families there to keep my kids company. Added bonus: some inflatables in the pool, provided by the hotel. It's amazing how simple stuff like this can go a long way keeping good graces with guests. The hotel was convenient also: about 15 minutes from Orlando International Airport, about 10 minutes from Universal Theme Park (just take Universal Blvd. right behind the hotel parking lot), about 5 minutes from Wet 'n' Wild Water Park (ditto), and about 20 - 22 minutes to Walt Disney World, mostly on highway 4. One good piece of advice: the hotel has a special desk for booking and information for Universal-based parks, such as the Theme Park, Busch Gardens in Tampa, Wet 'n' Wild, etc. It's open from 7:30 - 11:15 am every morning. Don't forget to say hello to Tosey if she's working there -- extremely helpful and friendly. She can also help get Blue Man Group tickets at Universal as well.

This was my second stay in Homewood Suites since August 2005. Stayed there again in June/July 2010. Situated perfectly on IDrive (a short walk from Wonderworks so its far enough from the seedy part of IDrive) its off the road and very quiet. They have a selection of two bedroomed suites and or one - we stayed in the one. If you have young kids the one bedroom is perfect as two big double beds easily fit into the room. Bathroom was very dated and needs an upgrade. Every room has a separate sitting room along with a massive fridge, cooker, table and chairs. Each room has a good size flat screen tv with lots of kids channels. There's also free internet access via wifi or from a computer on the ground floor that you can also print from free of charge. I heard when we were there they were in the process of redecorating the hotel which is probably required as it was a bit jaded but will be fine when its finished. There's a swimming pool and hot tub outside by the eating area but anybody staying in the hotel gets a free breakfast and a welcome back managers meal Monday to Thursday with free beer or wine - took advanage of that - it can save you quite a bit of money in terms of saving your dollars for a meal out at the weekend. I would suggest they consider changing the breakfast menu a bit more but its still decent although some people were a little surprised at the polystyrene plates - the solution is to bring the plates down from your room if it bothers you. Free shuttles take you to Disney or Universal Studio's including return - make sure you are there on time though or you will miss it. Room was cleaned and beds made everyday and were spotlessly clean. My only criticism of Homewood Suites is that there isn't a central location to meet - i.e. a bar (a wee cozy Irish bar would be perfect!!). Top notch hotel for price and when I am in Florida again I will definitely be staying there.

The location was ideal, right in the middle of International Drive so walking distance to lots of restaurants and ideally placed to get the local bus up and down International Drive to Universal Studios and Sea World. When we arrived we received a warm greeting from Louis and as it was a Monday, we arrived just in time for the happy hour - free food and drink (including wine and beer) from 5-7pm Mon - Thurs! Perfect after a long journey! The rooms were kept very clean and stocked with plenty of towels. The facilities in the room were also good. The pool was nice but the only downside was that there weren't many beds and the ones next to the pool tended to get splashed! We did go in the Easter holidays though so its possibly not always this busy. The only thing it was missing was a hotel bar so you couldn't buy alcohol outside happy hour, although we had a big fridge and freezer in the room so could buy own own beer and food. The rooms didn't have balconies but this seemed to be the case for most hotels in the area and it would probably have been too hot! The free high speed wi-fi was amazing and meant we could connect via our mobiles and keep in contact with people. The free breakfast was great, lots of cooked food, waffles and cereal but it was a bit repetative after 10 days. It was a great place to crash after a long, fun day - the bed was really comfortable and the room was quiet and because it has a seperate living area and bedroom, you don't feel cramped in a small space for 10 days.

The Hotel is within walking distance to a Mexican restaurant, Seafood restaurant, Steakhouse, TGI Fridays, Dennys, several pizza shops, 2 walgreeens, 2 minature golf courses, gift shops, and several other specialty shops.

The lobby was a bit small and over-crowded at check-in, but not a major problem. Parking is free and there are ample spaces to accomodate everyone. One negative is that the hotel has only ONE elevator and there is often a fairly long wait ... I would hate to be there if it broke down. The room was very nice and well maintained. There was full sized refrigerator, stove, Microwave (with nite lite) and a full-size pull-out couch. The room had 2 TV's and the master Bedroom had a large king bed. The shower was fine--nothing fancy, but cleaned well. They give you shampoo and body wash and are very accomodating if you need x-tra sheets or towels.

More than enough room if you had a family staying there for a week or so. Internet No problems with the internet at all. And i figured with so many families there it would be slow but I never noticed. Bed Can say the bes was average for a hotel. I've had better and worse. Shower No problems again and I was up during peak times. Hot water and good pressure. Breakfast They have a huge room so there were no problems getting tables at anytime. The selection was the best I have ever seen for a free continental. Evening Reception I was surprised to see the even reception also. Again a great spread plus beer and wine. They had a main dish that would be good for dinner. Taking a family out can be expensive but here you can eat 2 meals that are included. Location Like I said I was fine with the location.

I was impressed with the location off from the main stretch of International Drive. It seemed quiet and was within walking distance of a quite a few restaurants and a couple of stores. The Lobby is nice and the people at the desk are personable. There was only one woman that I recall appearing a little frazzled. I actually asked her to call me a cab to go and workout at the Gold's Gym (1.9mi away) and she directed me to a black car outside the hotel. I truly thought nothing of it until I got in and the driver had no clue where the club was! Thank goodness for my iPhone! Oh, plus the cost for that short trip was $14, even after I asked him if it was extra for the added time it took to find it. So, back to the hotel. I liked my room as it had an open concept 1 bedroom with the kitchenette and the livingroom as you walk in. It leads to a nice king sized bed and the sink over to my left. Then the bathroom which was rather large! The service was superb! They did the few dishes that I had in the sink the whole week. There was never an issue finding your way around the hotel if you just asked. There was a gentleman that I saw at the front desk area (looked like a manager) who was extremely helpful each time I needed something. The breakfast buffet and the welcome dinner in the evening were great! It was nice not to have to worry about going elsewhere to eat when you are there by yourself. Room service is also from TGIF's and another restaurant called the Ale House. I ordered a salad from Friday's for lunch one day. It did take a little bit to get there, so plan accordingly.

I have stayed at both of the area Homewood properties, and if you put the two of them together you would have a perfect \"10\". The beds at both are very comfortable. All the appliances worked well, although aged and the positioning of the dishwasher made the door scrub the wall each time it was opened (not good design planning). The breakfast was the usual fare, extended somewhat with powdered eggs mixed with cheese or tomatoes, sausage links or patties, and the ever popular make-you-own waffles. The only disappointment was that the yogurt was heaped into a large bowl instead of individual sealed chilled cups. Bananas were not available everyday either, and why I point this out is that a yogurt and a banana are usually my \"grab and go\" breakfast. Another minor point is that they use smaller coffee cups and only regular non-flavored creamers. These are very small things but I miss having these items that were at the Homewood down the street. I tried this location this time instead since they have flat screen TVs in the rooms here; although I had to ask for a copy to be made for me of the channel directory, it was nice to have the flat screens for morning news. The workout room was small for the size of the property, but very well maintained with towels and water available, both very nice features. The business center was for the most part, useless. There are two very old and very slow terminals, usually occupied by children playing games while I am waiting to print out my boarding pass. The business center is at the very back of the hotel, and no remote printing is available; both frustrating omissions. I had only requested room cleaning every other day, but still had to ask for dishwasher detergent, or shampoo, as items were not regularly replenished. I don't know if this was due to varying housekeepers, or simply poor training of the staff. I do know this is a minimum expected service that was missing. Also it was frustrating that for an extended stay type of hotel that the laundry facilities were on the top two floors, again at the very back of the hotel. Okay, now for all of its minor issues, the best part is the location. It is set back from I-drive directly behind Howl-at the-Moon and next to the Hyatt Place. You can walk to more than a dozen different restaurants, Pointe Orlando, or the Convention Center from here. This is the best thing about this place, as you don't want to have to drive and park in the I-drive tourist area in the evening unless you have to!!!

We mainly chose the hotel because we needed 2 beds plus a sleeper sofa, and the location was convenient. Unfortunately, the main reason we needed the suite was for the sleeper sofa -- and it was completely unfit to sleep on! The \"mattress\" was approximately 1 1/2 inches thick, and not even one of the kids could sleep on it without feeling the metal bars and springs digging into their backs! Also, the blanket was probably 20 years old and threadbare -- an embarrassment for a Hilton family hotel. Seriously... I'm not being picky... it was literally \"un-sleepable.\" In addition to this, we had problems with the hot water in the shower. Maintenance came up quickly to fix it, but the \"fix\" only lasted for about 10 minutes and since it was late, we ended up dealing with cold showers in lieu of packing up and switching rooms. To be fair, I lodged my complaints in the morning with the front desk and asked for a rate reduction. The regular rate was about $125, and they removed $69. While this was fair, I really regret the choice of this hotel and would have been better off elsewhere. (We had previously stayed at the Sheraton Doubletree Suites and that was great.)

All staff are polite and courteous at all times. Got the impression nothing would have been too much trouble,(although we never had any reason to require help as everything was perfect). Breakfast is good quality and has cereals, fruit, yoghurts, breads, eggs every morning, hot alternatives, some days sausages, some days bacon etc. Fruit juices, teas coffee, something for everyone. Mon to Thurs is mangers reception, this has drinks, including beer, wine, juices etc. and a light meal. If you have had a big lunch at any of the numerous nearby restaurants, this is enough to cover your evening meal. If not, it is good to keep you going for a later meal. Rooms have cooking facilities if a night of self catering is required. Good size fridge with small freezer in kitchen. There is an ice maker in the hotel, discovered this after buying a bag at nearby liquor store! The living area is comfortable and has a nice plasma with loads of channels. This cannot be heard in the bedroom if door is closed and likewise the tv in the bedroom cannot be heard in the living area. Great if kids want to watch Disney Channel and adults want to catch upon on news/weather. Bedrooms are comfortable and lead onto good sized bathroom / shower area. Good pool, shaded if it is too hot that is welcome. Good whirl poot tub for aching muscles after a theme park day. Small fitness centre ok for a light workout, which is all that is needed if trudging around parks. The trip started out badly in Orlando as our travel agent mixed up hotels, so special mention to Homewood near universal as they arranged a taxi foc for us down to Int Drive. We bought magic your way Disney tickets from Toucan Travel that worked out cheaper than the UK Disney option tickets and 2 park Universal, didn't think we would have enough time for Seaworld, water parks, etc when visiting 4 Disney and 2 Universal parks. We were right! The hotel has a free shuttle to Disney. The shuttle goes to Epcot and you can use Disney transport from Epcot to Magic kingdom, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom. It is really easy (honest, not as stressful as it may sound) and a real money saver. There is also a shuttle to Universal, though this picks up at other hotels and is really busy. This needs to be booked though the Universal desk in reception. It is $15 to $20 in a taxi, less stressful and allows you to visit later in the day. Lynx buses 8 and 42 transfer to no 37 which goes right into Universal for $6 all in tansfer return ticket. Good deal and again not as awkward as it sounds, the drivers announce where to go for the transfer. Itrolley is very busy and does not go too near to Universal, though if you get off at stop 7, it is about 1 mile walk, which is really long if a hot, humid day. Itrolley is good for visiting malls and other attractions on I drive, though Lynx may have better options, I did not fully investigate this option. IOA is currently very busy due to the boy wizard, Magic Kingdom pretty busy, but other parks reasonably quiet due to Harry Potter. Forbidden journey ride is a really good simulator. Fly on a broomstick! Roller coaster fans have to do the rip ride rock it, smoothest coatser I have ever been on. Ron and Roller coatser at Hollywood studios is surprisingly fast and caught us bt surprise, made for a funny photograph though! Nearby the hotel are numerous restaurants, such as Olive Garden, Tony Romas, TGI's, and Miller Alehouse, Don Pablo's Lobster Feats etc etc. also family American diners like Denny's and Friendly's. Also, late night revellers can frequent the Icebar and Howl at the Moon. A late night shop is nearby and a Walgreens that sell virtually everything you will need. Wonderworks is very close as is Point Orlando with more upmarket restaurants and shops and a cinema complex..", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cWe will be back\u201d", "Author": "lananvor", "ReviewID": "UR70081168", "Content": "Love everything about hotel.Convenient,not expensive.Ideal for family with kids.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cExcellent accomodation in a good location.\u201d", "Author": "EasyGoingTraveler77", "ReviewID": "UR69695333", "Content": "Homewood Suites continues to impress.

The weather should have been approximately 22 degrees (75F) on average, but we were having quite cool weather around 60F - this didn't stop us going to the parks etc but it would have been nicer to have had warmer weather for the whole trip, we had about 5 days of warm sunny weather - which was nice. The hotel is in a good location in the middle of I-Drive. I-Trolley stop 21 and 22 are the nearest to the hotel. Point Orlando is 1 block away (approx 3-5 minute walk). There are great restaurants within a short walk - Bahama Breeze, Dennys, Friendlys, Tony Romas, Olive Garden, Houlahans, Sizzlers, Burger King, Subway. TGI Fridays. The hotel rooms were clean and spacious, 2 plasma TVs and a large King Size bed which was very comfortable. We didn't use the pool but it seemed nice, but was shaded for the most of the day. The breakfast each morning was nice but a bit monotonous every day - scrambled egg, cereals, pastries, doughnuts, juice, tea, coffee, toast and bread. It did save us a bit of money though so we did make the most of it. They also did a welcome home buffet Mon-Thurs with free beer and wine, which was also a nice touch and we made the most of this offer too. The staff were really helpful, when we arrived our room wasn't ready but we did arrive a bit early so the hotel took our cases and gave us vouchers to eat in some of the restaurants in the area while we waited. We asked for a late checkout on our last day because our flight was not until 6.30pm and the staff were really good and let us stay until 3pm. There is a universal desk in reception, if you want to go on the shuttle to Universal book on it of a morning at breakfast. I think the pick up times from the hotel are 8.10a.m. and 9.50a.m. and then the pick up from universal is 4.20pm and 7.00pm. The hotel also do a shuttle to Seaworld and Aquatica but we just used the I-Trolley because it gave us more flexibility on the times, and it stops right inside both parks. We bought a 7 day pass for the I-Trolley for $10 each which was worth it because a single journey costs $1.25 - we bought the tickets at the Information Centre which is 1 block away also.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite which included all amenities such as full size fridge/freezer, stove, microwave, dishwasher, etc. There was also a small dining area next to the kitchen. The bedroom is separate from the rest of the suite which is nice if one person wants to watch tv and the other wants to go to sleep. The beds were very comfortable, the most comfortable bed I've ever stayed in besides my own. I could not find any faults whatsoever with the room. The staff were also very nice and friendly throughout our stay. Every morning a complimentary breakfast was held in the lounge with a great selection of food and juices, we took advantage of this every morning as it was a great way to start the busy day at the parks! There is also a meal available from 5-7 Monday through Thursday which is also served buffet style. This is all included in your stay at the hotel at no extra charge. We also enjoyed being able to go for a swim outside in a secluded area at the hotel, while we were there it was cold for that time of year usually but this did not effect us being able to go for a swim as the pool was heated, so we were delighted! The hotel is 20 minutes from the airport, we decided to get a taxi as we were too tired from our long journey to wait around for a shuttle to the hotel. The taxi cost us $47 so we gave $50 including tip. We thought this was very expensive but after speaking to a family who took a bus to the hotel we were relieved with our decision. They told us that they paid $90 to get the bus to the hotel which also included their journey back to the airport but they said that it took them 2 hours to get to the hotel with all the stops and that the bus driver got lost. The taxi back to the airport cost us $45 including tip so we would definitely recommend getting a taxi as it is only $5 cheaper to get the bus which is a lot more hassle! The hotel itself was in a lovely area and was very central on international drive. There are many attractions and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. I would recommend going into wonder works as we found it very fun and interesting. Also I would recommend the Ice Bar. You pay $20 each to get into the ice bar, your first drink is $10 and then the pinnacle brand vodkas are only $5 dollars after that! It is definitely worth the money, inside the walls, bar, glasses and seating are all made out of ice and the room is kept at 27 Degrees F. You get gloves and a big jacket to wear when inside. We were a bit disappointed that one of the girls was very rude to us when we were going outside for a cigarette (to warm up!) and told us that we were only supposed to be in there for 45 minutes, this is something we were unaware of as no one told us previously before we went in, just something to watch out for, but otherwise it was definitely worth the money to see this! There are free shuttles to all the parks that we wanted to go to but you need to book your times the day before as there are only a limited number of seats. This included Disney which you get dropped off outside Epcot. If you are looking to go to other Disney parks there is complimentary transportation from this location. There were also shuttles available for the other parks we went to, Sea World and Universal Studios. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is travelling to Orlando, it is worth every penny and is in a great location.

I could go on and on, but I don't see the point . . what nice accomodations. My only observation was that the carpet appeared to have a couple of cigarette burns in a no-smoking room. A small thing that really had no bearing on my stay. After all can you really expect a hotel to replace an entire carpet just because one jerk decides to be inconsiderate? I certainly don't think so, and since the room had NO smoking odor this was a non-issue with me. The beds were really comfortable and the room exceptionally quiet. Being a light sleeper this was a great benefit. Both mornings we woke up the breakfast bar was packed, and for good reason. Without a doubt this is the best breakfast bar I have ever had. Please keep in mind that I am VERY mindful of cost, and the facilities I stay at reflect this. But never the less - wow.

On our return trip we had a 2 bedroom suite which was ideal for all three family members who each had favorite TV shows to watch. Everything functioned perfectly in this suite. The suites were quiet which helped after a long day in the car. The breakfast buffet was well maintained on both visits and we were impressed that they had 3 waffle makers for guest use and when the bowl of bananas began to approach depletion, an attendant refilled the bowl with fresh bananas.

Rooms cleaned and towels changed every day, Sitting room/kitchen and separate bedroom. Large Plasma TV in each room with about 30 channels. Leather Suite, excellent quality furniture, carpets and drapes. The kitchen had everything Microwave, 2-Ring Cooker, Dishwasher, Large family size Fridge/freezer with Ice making machine inside, Iron and Ironing Board. Bedroom had the most comfortable Queen sized bed and pillows I have ever found in a hotel. Air Con - Ceiling Fan \u2013 Hairdryer. There was a small fee for use of the safe, about $1 a day. Hotel had Computer room for guests with free Internet and printing. A Laundry room and Gym. The pool was very nice but not good for Sun bathing as it was in the shade most of the day. But guests could use pool in sister hotel just next door (Hampton Inn) that had a very sunny pool. Free buffet breakfast, selection of cereals, nice breads, fruit, toast, yoghurts, muffins, and a waffle machine. Some hot food Scrambled Eggs, Fried potatoes, Corn bread, Tea, Coffee, a selection of juices and soft drinks. If you didn\u2019t fancy that, there\u2019s an abundance of restaurants in the area to buy breakfast. There\u2019s also the Managers Welcome Buffet on Monday to Thursday 5 \u2013 7 p.m. with a selection of FREE foods, e.g. Pasta, Salads, Meatballs, Potatoes, Barbecue stuff, Beer, Wine or Soft Drinks. We only went to this once, but it was nice to relax after a long day in the Parks or Shopping, this would be ideal for hungry kids. Large selection of restaurants, a supermarket and 24 hour store called Wallgreens less than 5 min walk. Some restaurants (Ponderosa Steakhouse) had eat all you want buffets, we found the food in the TGI Friday\u2019s excellent, and it seemed to be very popular with families. We had planned to hire a car but it wasn\u2019t necessary. We spent the first couple of days visiting the Theme Parks; the hotel provided free transport to and from Universal Studios \u2013 Seaworld - Aquatic and Wet n\u2019Wild. The I-Ride Trolley bus runs the length of International Drive. This will take you to the 2 main Shopping areas, Prime Outlets and Premium Outlets. All journeys cost $1.25, or you can buy a 1, 3 or 7 day passes, you can hop on and off for $4 a day. We found this hassle free \u2013 no getting lost, looking for parking, parking fees etc. There were only two places we had to get a taxi to - Walmarts and Florida Mall. You might have to hire car to visit Disney. I\u2019m sure you will find cheaper Hotels, but the money you save on Breakfast- Evening snacks and Free Shuttle is fantastic. Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely visit again. Shopping Tips. If your looking for bargains then you can\u2019t go wrong with Walmarts, they carry all the official Disney merchandise and Orlando gifts, open 24 hours. Check out Ross Stores and T.J. Max (I Ride stop No. 4) before you go to the outlets, great value for marked down designer handbags, shoes and clothes. I picked up a Jessica Sinpson bag for $59. Google the shopping malls before you go, most of them will allow you to register online or print voucher for VIP Coupon books. Then you can print or pick up Coupon Book from customer service, this will give you an extra discount on top of whatever discount the shops are already offering. Sorry to ramble on, but we had a Super time.

The room was spacious and clean, the kitchen had everything you need if you planned on cooking and a big fridge/ freezer. The bedroom was also big and the beds were really comfy to sleep in. The hotel was very quiet at night and never had a problem with noise from another rooms etc. The shuttles to the park are really handy and are a great addition, also the shuttle in the evening to Universal is great on the way out - but beware on the way back it can often take up to an hour with all the drop offs so you might be better off paying the $10 for a cab! The area around the hotel has some good restaurants to eat in - would recommend the Olive Garden and Millers Ale House for drinks! Pointe Orlando also had some good places but didn't try many of them. Its very handy for the I ride trolley too just beside stop 21 on the north bound route and stop 22 on the south bound route. The breakfast in the morning has a great choice and sets you up for the day. We used the pool a few times after we got back to the parks and it was quite warm most of the evenings.

The hotel is clean and well run and the staff are helpful and friendly. If you are after a holiday around a pool look elsewhere - the pool is small, generally in shade and in a central courtyard. The suites provide space and flexibility not afforded with normal hotel rooms. The one bedroom suite has a very comfortable kingsize bed and whb/vanity unit within the bedroom and an en-suite (bath, shower and wc). The lounge has a well fitted out kitchen with a full size fridge/freezer, dining table and chairs, sofa bed and single leather chair. The lounge and bedroom have large flat screen TV's. Towels are changed every day - although there was some problems this year with the laundry but a quick call to reception and fresh towels arrived within minutes. The complementary breakfast sets you up for the day. It can become a bit repetative by the end of 2 weeks but a least you can still have a bowl of ceral and a coffee. The most annoying thing this year was the introduction of a theatrical singer who went around the tables asking the diners if they would 'like a song'. A nice chap but the booming voice was a bit too much at that time of the morning - I think the hotel should have a re-think!!! The hotel is well located between I Drive and Universal Bollavard close to several good restaurants. Within a short walking distance are Bahamma Breeze, Olive Garden, TGI Fridays and several others in the Point complex. Also relatively close by are the usual establishments like, Subway, Sizzler, Ponderossa, Pizza hut, etc. The crazy golf course 'Pirates Cove' complete with water falls etc is within a few hundred metres and is well worth a visit. Wonderworks is also just around the corner. The hotel is located between Sea World & Aquatica in one direction and Universal and Wet and Wild in the other (a couple of miles both ways). Ideal for those purchasing the Flexi Tickets. However Disney is around 10 miles away and you may find this distance a bit of a drag (like we did) if you intend going on a regular basis.

Check in was a breeze we asked to be placed in a non smoking room and overlooking the pool, we received this without any hassle an nice room on the 3rd floor.The staff were all very attentive and friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble. The room was clean, the bed very comfy and the cleaning staff were very good with the room being tidied everyday and clean towels delivered everyday. The room is very equipt with large fridge/freezer, microwave, hob, dishwasher and all the utensils, though we didnt use them as we ate out so much and breakfast is included! Breakfast was served every morning 7-10am and had a good variety of food, enough to fill anyones belly. The Managers special is a treat, Mon-Thurs from 5.30-7.30 there is wine/beer and a different menu everynight so you have a bite to eat. It was great if you had just come back from a park and didnt fancy heading out for dinner after a big lunch and again the staff were fantastic. Some people have complained about the pool, I found the pool was good, its not huge and there is not alot of lounger space, but we never had a problem getting a bed as it was always very quiet. Lots of little geikos running around, really cute and meant no insects !!! The pool was closed one day during our stay from morning til 5.30 whilst the repainted the whole area, it did not bother us as we were out to a park, but they had arranged use of another hotels pool for those who may have wanted some pool time. There is a gym which i didnt venture to as i did enough walking round the parks, the laundary facilities are based on the 5 & 6th floors and were adequate, i didnt have to worry about bringing home aload of washing which was great. There is a business centre which is good for checking flights etc, we found this useful as we didnt bring a laptop. This hotel is only rated as a 3 star compared to a 3 star here in Ireland it should be at least a 4/5 star.

We wanted to buy a laptop whilst here in Orlando and asked Mario's advise on where to go. He had no idea but within a minute he was on his phone to his nephew for advise.

This includes as an example Monday - shredded pork accompanied with salads,soup, crisps, pretzels etc..... Wine , Lager, soft drinks and coffee. Tuesday - Hot dogs and as above. Wednesday - fajita chicken etc, Thursday - rotisserie chicken etc. This can be a big saving for families. Breakfast - every morning (Between 7-10 am) and consists of scrambled egg, Sausage , fried mini potatoes, cereal, toast, muffins and waffles. Coffee, tea and fresh fruit juice.

We visited Orlando for the Disney and Universal parks, and a work-related conference. After researching many Orlando hotels online, Homewood Suites on International was our choice for several reasons- the reviews from other guests; the proximity to our destinations; our preference over a suite vs.a plain room; free and good breakfast; walking distance to several restaurants and Pointe Orlando. During our stay, I saw the manager (Mr. Rodriguez) at the breakfast area several times. He usually had a cup of coffee in his hand and a smile on his face. It was nice to see that the manager took a personal interest in something as mundane as breakfast for his guests. As a totally subjective comparison -- we moved to the Grand Cypress Resort for a conference after staying at Homewood Suites. Totally different vibe at GC - beautiful hotel, different level of accommodations, amenities and prices. Grand Cypress has a lot to offer.

I had rang up the week before my trip to arrange the particular room that I required and they met my requests so it was perfect. The first thing you notice when you enter th hotel is the lovely clean smell and the friendly faces. When we entered our room it was spotless!!!! The only down side is that the room was not as big as last time we stayed and there was three of us living in the room but that didn't matter because in the day we put the sofabed away so there was plenty of space for us. The breakfast in the morning was fantastic, just what you needed to start the day with all that walking. My son particularly loved the waffle machine. Evey morning one of the hotel managers would great us and ask how we were. The only down side is that the swimming pool does not get a lot of sun so you have to pick the best spec at the right time to catch the sun, but to be honest this time when we went it was hotter then ever so we spent most of the time in the pool cooling off!!!! The room maid was lovely and cleaned our room everyday and put the dish washer on with our dirty glasswear. The best part of the room though was the MASSIVE COMFY bed. It was the best bed ever and I bet you could get four adults in it. The location was fantastic. It took five minutes in the evening to walk to the restaurants so you did not have to drive anywhere. The day before we left the manager of the hotel personally rang us to see how our stay was which is a nice touch. The only tip I will give is that you get a lot of take away leaflets posted under your door and DO NOT ORDER from any of them as they are a con only order from the take away menus which the hotel provides in your room. Flippers is the greatest!!! overall I would recommend it to anyone it was amazing.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "preston, Lancashire, England", "Title": "\u201cIncredible service, location and standard\u201d", "Author": "gkbrownie", "ReviewID": "UR45426380", "Content": "We stayed at the Homewood Suites in early Sept.

The check in was quick and polite and the room was very clean with everything you could need, iron, freezer, cooker etc. The day we arrived the management rang to see if everything was ok, we needed a few more Hangars and they brought them immediately, how many places ring to check if you are happy. Everyone morning there is a FREE breakfast, yes Free, and around 5pm there is another special meal with Salad etc. and Wine and Beer, this is also free. Brilliant if you have been at the Parks all day and need something to put you on for the evening meal.

After a quick check in we heading to the rooms (Suite). First impression was excellent, spacious and well equipt, ideal I thought. The next morning we heading for an early breakfast, this was good also, not the continental I was expecting but no complaint from me, plenty of choice so most tastes should be happy and plenty of it also. Headed out for the day to come back to a cleaned room with coffee re-stocked. Now had a chance to explore the hotel a little, from one or two of the reviews expected the pool to be a little smaller but I thought it was pretty generous especially when considering the number of rooms. Gym was ok (3 running machines, 1 bike, 1 cross trainer and an selection of dum bells) but for me could have done with a 'multi gym' style weights machine but not real a problem just a prefference. During Monday - Thursday Evenings the complimentry food and beverages is a nice touch, a refreshing start prior to heading out for a bit of evening entertainment. Location was ideal, set back from the main roads ment it was quiet from both traffic and public which I liked. Its not within walking distance of the theme parks but they have a shuttle (I hired a car so did not use). Plenty of resteraunts near by and Ripley's / World of Wonder / Mini golf / Point Orlando Shopping & Cinema are within 10 / 15 mins walk for a bit of evening eintertainments.

Even though I had emailed prior to arrival requesting a non-smoking room, we were given a room on the 6th Floor (which is all smoking). On realising this, my husband approached the front desk and requested a room change - we got offered an alternative room on 6th Floor. Fortunately, the second room didn't reek of nicotine so we accepted it. The room was big enough for the four of us (just about) with two double beds in bedroom and separate small lounge/kitchen area.

The buffet breakfast and homecoming dinner were both totally acceptable and it was good to return from a hard day at one of the park's to something to eat and drink (Mon-Thurs). A couple of disappointing incidents caused by other guests is our only gripe. Firstly, a family who would not have looked out of place on Jerry Springer in the room below us - shouting and swearing at their children etc which we could hear clearly in our room; secondly, the couple in the neighbouring room who firstly kept us awake with their shouting then when we finally got to sleep, woke the whole family up at 3am fighting which again we could hear quite clearly. My 8 year old thought repeating some of the swearing was really funny!!! Fortunately, Security came straight up when we rang and in the morning we spoke to the General Manager who was extremely apologetic and said he would talk to them as a report had been received by the night staff.

The rooms are spacious and the huge kingsize bed is so comfy. The sofa bed is just that a sofa bed and my 17 year old did complain a bit. Flatscreen TVs in both the living area and the bedroom. There is a small kitchen area which I never used, was not there to cook etc but the fridge was invaluable used it to keep drinks and snacks cool, even kept the aftersun cream in the fridge. The rooms were exceptionally clean and there was maid service every day. Breakfast is provided every day: cereal, porridge, sausages, potato cubes, scrambled eggs, bread, bagels, french toast, english muffins, danish pastries, fresh fruit, tea, coffee and breakfast juices, there is also waffle machines so you can make your own waffles. If you can't make a breakfast out of all that that something is wrong. One word of warning a guy comes in most morning dressed as a chef and sings, the first time you see this it is quite amusing but after a few days it does get on your nerves and by the end of the holiday you are near nuts listening to him. He seems to be doing this for money, people were tipping him. Maybe this is something new they are trying but going by the expressions on people's faces it is a bad move. There was a welcome home reception from Monday to Thursday and the best bit of this is the free beer and wine. Food was also on offer it was nearly always some sort of pasta dish, some salad stuff, soup and crisps and dips. Not bad for a snack if you are about but I wouldn't rush home for it. I myself enjoyed a few beers by the pool with a bowl of crisps or nachos and a dip, now how relaxing does that sound. The breakfast room can be used all day every day . People gather there in the evening, bring their own drink, order a pizza, bring snacks and sit and have a chat it is quite relaxing after a hectic day. The pool closes at 10.00pm because it is in the centre of the hotel and there are bedrooms all around it so quiet has to be restored at some point. The location is excellent, just off International Drive behind Bahama Breeze. You can walk to International Drive in about 2 minutes and because the hotel is set back of the road a bit it is nice and quiet. There are plenty of restaurants within 5 minutes walk. Wonderworks, Ripley's Believe It Or Not and Pirates Cove Crazy Golf are all within walking distance. Olive Garden Italian Restaurant is just across the road from the Bahama Breeze and is a must, meals are fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised at the price, 5 adult meals, a good bottle of red wine and several vodkas came in at $148 a lot cheaper than I expected and the surroundings are lovely. Would avoid the Ponderosa, always thought the Ponderosa was cheap and cheerful especially for families, well it is certainly not cheerful and in my opinion it has gone down hill badly. The hotel also has a gym, a computer room, free WIFI, several games machines for the kids and laundry facilities. They will even do some grocery shopping for you if you leave them a list. There is no restaurant in the hotel but you can order food in from TGI Fridays and a few other food places. Only order food from the places recommended by the hotel and these you will find at the back of the welcome folder in your room. Leaflets are pushed under your door every day from various other food outlets but do not use these the food is rubbish, we found this out to our cost.

The room we were given was on the 6th floor which is the smoking floor. I hate the smell of smoke at the best of times ( ex smoker!! ) and I asked for a non smoking room. There were no rooms available. To cut a long story short the reception did not seem to care that I wanted a non smoking room and talking to other people they put all the British people on the 6th floor in the smoking rooms. I did not meet one American on the 6th floor!! I suspect this is because they would complain bitterly about the smell of smoke. I spent 14 nights at the hotel - the least they could of offered was to move us to a non smoking room when one became available. There never was a room on offer. I also asked for a kettle for our room. The reception said could I wait a couple of days. I said I could. Again - no kettle ever arrived. when I asked the reception she just shrugged her shoulders. I didnt care too much because I boiled water in a pan. But I do think a kettle is a fairly basic requirement in any hotel room let alone one with a kitchen! Maybe I am being a bit picky! But generally the rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable - really comfortable actually. The fridge was a great size and very cold which was great for cold water. Having 2 tvs was great for my two teenagers! The bathroom was very clean and the shower very powerful which more than made up for the lack of a kettle!! the complimentary soap and shampoos are good quality. the kitchen equipment more than adequate and the complimentary tea and coffee sachets gratefully received. Breakfast - Well again I have to say I am going to moan. The food was good. BUT it was difficult to find a table. It was very overcrowded and felt more like a school canteen at times. I saw on a couple of occasions people fighting over tables. The quality of the food was good but there is a lack of variation. The coffee though was great. Pool - all said before. Small and in the shade. Orlando is not a holiday where you will be doing much sitting by the pool anyway. The complimentary shuttles were very good. We used them a lot. Never a problem getting on them, Eating out - we went to Dennys on the first night - it is so close to the hotel - I found out the next night that if you show your room key you get 15% off your total bill. Food was adequate. TGI Friday - Good Sirloin steaks and good service although you pay a little more. Friendlys over the road from the hotel - same as Dennys really - good fast food. Not for the healthy types!! Ponderossa - I did not like this place at all. It reminded me of school dinners!! The price is good but the surroundings are poor and the poor staff look knackered! Domino pizza is 5 mins walk - Great!! Good value deals and great taste if you like pizza. Ci Ci pizza is a few stops on the I trolley. Great deal if you are really hungry. $5.99 all you can eat buffett with salad ( limited choice ). The pizza choice is good although do not expect too much topping. At the end of the day its cheap and tastes good. The buffet also includes 2 puddings!! Cant be bad. I bought my flexiticket plus from Charter Travel for \u00a3154. This was good value. Disney is expensive and very very crowded. go if you can out of the school holidays. There are two shopping centres at either end of the I Drive. Premium outlets and Prime outlets. Both offer designer clothing at discounted prices. Great if you like that kind of shopping. Florida mall was a more normal shopping experience with more normal shops - its where the Americans shop. Look out for discount vouchers for almost everything - all the attractions and restaurants. Well thats it really. Over all the Homewood Suites were good value at \u00a362.00 -per night for all 3 of us so I suppose I should not be complaining at all. Its just that my expectation before I went was higher than the reality.

The reason we stayed here was because it suited our needs and had such great reviews. Our essential requirements were; an I-Drive location, a heated pool (it was February!), free transport to the parks, an inclusive breakfast and clean rooms. The location was excellent. Just off I-Drive, no traffic noise, good local shops and restaurants and 1 minute to both the Red and Green Line trolleys. The hotel itself was very clean, the staff was very helpful (not that we really had any problems anyway), the concession staff was also great. The breakfast was more than enough for us and never crowded. The pool was heated and great for splashing around or a few laps, but not for sunbathing as it's mostly all in shade for most of the day, but you can use other local hilton hotel pools anyway. We preferred the shaded pool to be honest. The free internet access was good too. We used \"the business centre\" which is basically a smallish room with two PCs and a printer - good enough for checking email and surfing the web. Our room was a suite (a lounge with a small kitchen with a table and chairs and the couch pulled out into a double bed and a separate bedroom with an en suite bathroom). We loved the extra space that the lounge seating gave us in between being asleep and being out all day. The room safe was great too, large enough for the essentials but not big enough for a laptop (I'd guess about 10x8 inches and 8-10 inches deep) and we weren't charged for it, although we used it daily. The free transport ran twice every morning to all the parks; one shuttle to Disney and another to all the Universal parks, SeaWorld and Aquatica. And coming back, there were also early (6pm ish) and late (9.30pm ish) shuttles. We found all the drivers very helpful, knowledgeable and courteous. Well worth a few dollars tip. Disney transport was booked at reception, other transport was booked by the concession staff. Only once was the disney shuttle (the early one) full when we tried to book it, necessitating a quick change of plan - no problem. We were very happy with our stay here. We actually extended our Disney tickets while there so we'll be back and we'll definately be staying at Homewood Suites again.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Centreville, NL, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay at the Homewood suites\u201d", "Author": "zoeyhunt", "ReviewID": "UR28044957", "Content": "The suites were clean and very comfortable.

We loved this hotel, probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The hotel had a slight old fashioned interior, but was to be expected as we were not staying in a modern European hotel. Our stay was for 10 nights and we really loved it. There is a pool, small gymnasium, and the hotel offer free breakfast every morning of the week which consists of really continental style, there is also some hot food sausages, fried potatoes and egg. The breakfast is really nice and free so there is no need to go out and spend money on a breakfast. The hotel also offers light food from Monday to Thursday, the food is really nice and the hotel also offers free beer and wine with this meal, the meal is really nice and there is a menu in each room to tell you what is on each night. The meal is nice as a snack after the parks but often we went out after to eat. Our only bad experience with the hotel is the TGI Fridays room service. After a long flight we were quite hungry and desperately tired, we decided to get the room service it was a rip off and disgusting. Dont get it, however a quick talk with the manager resolved the whole thing. Homewood offers free shuttles to all of the major parks: - Disney (ALL) - Universal Studios - Islands of Adventure - Sea World - Aquatica - Wet n Wild (only minutes from hotel) - Busch Gardens The hotel is right on the I RIDE trolley red line and this service is very good and very quick. This goes right up international drive. There is a Dennys a minute away from the hotel as well as other lovely restaurants. Dont miss Tony Romas it is class. The pool is nice but it is a bit small. The area is nice and the shops. Overall, fantastic hotel, the rooms are very clean and the maids are excellent, there is a self service laundry service on each floor which is so handy.

Those staying at the convention center hotels had to walk or take taxis to us and the restaurants.

ARRIVAL After booking with Travel City Direct, we made the walk through Sanford to the transfers exit. Our 2 reps were there to meet us, and directed us to the exchange booth, where we should exchange our transfer vouchers for coach tickets. Once on board the coach, another rep came on and explained to us how long it would be before we got to our hotel. She briefed us on our resort, giving us plenty of maps, guides and voucher booklets (discounts on theme park tickets, restaurants etc) . She then left the coach, explaining that we would have a long wait until the coach set off, due to a family stuck in immigration. Finally, we set off and our hotel was one of the first to be dropped off as it was at the end of International Drive. The rep was not on the coach at this point and the coach driver snapped at us when we asked him which of four hotels in the grounds was ours. On arrival, the porter was waiting at the door of the hotel to help us with our luggage. Here is where the good stuff begins! CHECK-IN / ARRIVAL AT ROOM Don, the porter, carried our bags to the reception desk, and the polite, friendly staff checked us in. We were given a key to a room on the 2nd floor and our bags were carried up. On arrival at the room, we were given a full tour of the room and we were asked if there was anything we would need straight away. There was nothing, no queries about our wonderful room, so the porter left. ROOM In our room, we had an open-plan kitchen/living area with a sofa-bed (double) which our children slept in. In the kitchen area, there was a fully equipped kitchen and seating. The living room contained a plasma tv with all the channels we could ever want. We also had a master bedroom with an en-suite bathroom. This contained a plasma screen, a kingsize bed and chairs and 2 large wardrobes. Safes were available at an extra charge. The bathroom was in good condition and was kept well cleaned and equipped throughout our stay. REST OF HOTEL The rest of our hotel was outstanding as well. There was a jacuzzi, a large swimming pool, a games room, a large dining area, a mini-market and a baggage storage area. There were always plenty of sunbeds available as most guests were out at the park all day. Breakfast was a good choice - serving continental and cooked. Monday-Friday 5pm-7pm, the hotel ran a welcome home reception where soft drinks, beer and wine were free, as were snacks. A shuttle service was also complimentary - although you do have to book in advance. To go to the parks in the morning the shuttles were as follows: 1) 7am 2) 8:30am 3) 11:30am And coming back from the parks was 1)4pm 2)6pm 3)8pm 4)10pm The hotel overall was great and the staff could not do anything more. PARK TICKETS Just a word of warning - unless you want to be ripped off at the Park Entrance - book your Disney tickets back in the UK! The hotel sell tickets for Wet 'N' Wild and Universal but no Disney tickets are available. They are sold at discount prices and you can pick many discount books up from restaurants/bars that can get you an extra discount if you know where to use them. DISNEY PARKS One word - AMAZING! Bring the magic of Disney alive as you visit: Epcot - The \"World of Tomorrow\" park Magic Kingdom - The \"Little Kids/Big Kids\" Park Hollywood Studios - For all you thrill seekers out there! Animal Kingdom - Animal Lovers- you can travel to Asia, Africa and much more! Blizzard Beach - The best Disney water park there is Typhoon Lagoon - Good, but not as good as BB! My ride recommendations are Epcot - \"Test Track\" and \"Mission: Space\" Magic Kingdom - All of them! Hollywood Studios - Tower of Terror and Rock'N'Rollercoaster Animal Kingdom - Expedition Everest and Kilimanjaro Safaris Blizzard Beach - Summit Plummit and Water Wavers Typhoon Lagoon - Wave pool and the big water slide Enjoy your stay at Homewood!", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cbrilliant\u201d", "Author": "floridastar", "ReviewID": "UR24119466", "Content": "This was our second visit to this hotel and it is better than ever.. going back feb 09", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aintree,Liverpool,UK", "Title": "\u201cLoved Homewood Suites\u201d", "Author": "Robrud&family", "ReviewID": "UR23884273", "Content": "Stayed here Feb 2008 for two weeks, great hotel, great staff, the free breakfast is a excellent and so is the free beers ,wine and food during the week!!.

I got an amazing rate of $39/night through Priceline which was more than we ever could have bargained for. It also gave me very low expectations. We have stayed at Homewood Suites in the past and have been pleased with them overall and were anxious to see how this compared to the other locations we stayed at. I had read TripAdvisor reviews of the property and it sounded perfectly fine so we gave it a go. Keep in mind we were in Orlando in the off-season; this may have affected our experiences with crowds, etc. We arrived on a Tuesday night. The hotel was marked by a sign on the street and could be missed if you weren't really paying attention as it is set back from the street. But I had done my research and found it without problem. There was plenty of parking right near the front entrance. Parking did fill up in the evening but I never had trouble getting a good spot. I walked right up to the front desk where I was greeting warmly by the desk clerk and checked right in. The type of room we wanted was available and I made sure to ask for one of the already renovated rooms. The only thing it didn't have was the new TVs. The room was similar in size and layout to the other HS we've stayed in. The room was clean and well taken care of with the usual HS amenities. The only downside was the new remodel removed the towel rack/shelves from the vanity area. Consequently there is no place to hang a hand towel for drying your hands. Not a big deal. The daily breakfast was adequate and welcome. The BEST part of their food service was a soda machine! I am one of those people who wants Diet Coke with every meal and I was able to have it! The dinners were also adequate but not spectacular. (We were spoiled at the Homewood Suites in Alexandria and compare all others to it!) But it was included and we ate there a couple of the evenings. It was sometimes busy but never crowded and gave us a good opportunity to chat with our fellow travelers. Didn't use the fitness center. The pool was big enough and not at all crowded (again, it was November). The business center was hot and stuffy, but free internet access is always welcome. There were occasional issues with the printers, but nothing major. I would recommend the Homewood Suites for a clean, comfortable stay. The staff was nice, the room was clean, the food was adequate, and we couldn't beat the price! And it was really nice to have a separate room to go to when it was kiddie bedtime!

We were not at all happy with this situation as we would be using the room to rest in the afternoons and the noise from the work would make this impossible. We immediately talked to the manager to try and change to a quieter room but unfortunately he said that no other room would be any quieter so we then decided to ask to change hotels. The next day the manager made some phone calls and got us a room at the Homewood Suites on American Way which is off the northern end of International Drive nearer to Universal Studios.(I will write a separate review of this hotel) We were pleased with the way this situation was resolved but were unhappy that we had lost a morning of our holiday changing hotels and more importantly had not been told in advance that building works were starting in the middle of our stay.

We had the best time ever in Orlando thanks to this fabulous hotel. We have stayed in many others on International Drive and were not expecting the elegance and poshness that we got here! The Check In: When we arrived at the hotel we were shocked that for what we had paid, this hotel was so much more. We had called the Hilton helpline 2 days prior to check in to request a ground floor room (for medical reasons) and when we arrived to check in was reassured this would be fine and our we had a choice of room views. We decided to overlook the pool. The staff were so friendly and nice we felt at home straight away. We were directed to our rooms and offered assistance from the bellhop. The Room: The room was outstanding, it looks as good in the pictures as it does in reality, which is often not the same. The kitchen area was very nice and clean, the dishwasher was free of charge and the maid put it on each day for us. There was nice clean cutlery and pots, pans and crockery provided for us in the drawers and cupboards. The microwave was huge and could cook almost anything. The fridge was very big too. There was a dining table in the kitchen area also with 4 chairs. In the living room was an arm chair and a sofa (which was a pull out bed too). As a party of 3, finding a hotel with decent bed space is tricky. But this hotel once again exceeded expectations. In the bedroom we had a king size bed, which 2 people slept in. The 3rd person slept in the double sofa bed that was in the living room. All sheets were changed every other day (and was offered to be changed each day). The bathroom was lovely, nice bath, shower and toilet. Fresh towels provided everyday. Storage space was decent, the wardrobe had its own hangers and shelf at the top, and the safe inside that (this is a daily charge $1.50, thats automatically added provided you use it). There were 2 bedside drawers and a chest of drawers where the tv was. There were 2 tv's in the room and had so many channels including HBO, HBO 2, HBO Signature and ABC. We were able to watch pay per view films that were relatively new at the cinema for $12.99. Air conditioning was very good and easy to use and adjust, quick working and kept our room very cool. No sound could be heard from the other rooms or noises out in the hallway. The Pool: When I read the reviews about the pool I was lead to believe there was no sun and it was covered in shade all day long. This is completely untrue. If you decide to have a lazy day by the pool, then there is sun in the pool area from around 10am until 5pm. The pool does shade over during the day but only on one side and sun is still on the other side, I tended to get out by 11am and sit on the side where the sun ended up in the afternoon so that I had sun all day. This was not a problem as the pool area was so quiet, day and night. Only 3/4 people would be outside when I was. The pool is a good size and the sun heats it nice and warm. Deep end is not too deep, which is good. There is a nice jacuzzi, very hot, not good for those with sunburn! (Be warned). Breakfast and Welcome Home Snack: Each morning there is a cooked breakfast buffet from 7am until 10am. It consists of: scrambled eggs, spiced eggs, sausages, waffles or pancakes, english muffins, bread, doughnuts, cereals, coffees, teas, orange juice and other fruits. On Monday - Thursday there is a welcome home snack between 5pm-7pm. It is scheduled a month in advanced and the schedule is up on your fridge. It consists of either, mac & cheese, chilli & mac, baked potato bar, oriental chicken, chicken and rice, hot dogs, burgers and more. There is always salads, crisps and dips available. The washing laundry room only cost $1.75 a load (far cheaper than any other place we have used). The gym is fab, small but convienient and easy to use! The hotel provides a free shuttle to the universal and seaworld resorts and wet 'n' wild and aquatica. The times for universal were: 8.15am, 9am, 10am and 11.15am. Returning at: 5pm, 6.50pm, 7.50pm, 10pm, 10.45pm. The shuttle for Seaworld leaves at 9.15am. Wet 'n' Wild and Aqautica leave at 9.15am which is not always good if you need a sun shade as the sun shades are normally gone straight away when the park opens at 8am. We got a taxi to the parks on these days, if you go to reception the bellhop will put you directly into the taxi that sits out the front door and the price is about $14 to Aquatica or $9 to Wet 'n' Wild, the drivers do expect a tip (as does about everywhere!). Restaurants we enjoyed were TGI Fridays (just up from our hotel - TGI also does room service to your hotel room), Sizzlers (good for the big eaters), Ponderosa (for a huge buffet breakfast), Tony Romas (next to Ponderosa, lovely Ribs), Friendlys (good priced food and quick service, also does take out). Make sure if your not renting a car you make use of the I-Ride Trolley its a dollar a ride per person, or $5 each for 3 days unlimited or $13 dollars each for 2 weeks unlimited. It comes around every 20 minutes or sooner and is air conditioned inside. It goes all the way along international drive and stop 21 is just outside the hotel. All in all this was a fantastic hotel and we are already looking into booking again for next time. We just loved our stay and did not want to leave. I cannot give you one negative about the hotel! If you want more info then just ask! I'm sorry if you are now straining after reading this long winded review, but I find it frustrating when people give very short reviews and never explain their reasons for being negative.

After the first day when we discovered a single glass in the dishwasher (that had only been used for drinking water!!!) we asked our maid not to wash any dishes at all until we left! What a horrendous waste of energy! Why don't they do what Travelodge in the UK do and just swap in clean glasses and mugs and do all the dirties in one or two dishwashers? Still, this one criticism isn't enough to outweigh all the good points - we'd definitely be back like a shot if we ever had to go to Orlando again.

If the hotel ever did a remodel, they should consider adding another door to access it. The hotel did have a hotel and jacuzzi in the courtyard which was great for swimming, but if you intend to get a great deal of sun, think twice.

The hotel advertises complimentary shuttle to Disney (Epcot taxi area). As requested by the hotel, we booked the shuttle 24 hours prior. When we were ready to get on the shuttle, it was already full. The driver said not to worry, someone else would bring us over to Disney shortly thereafter. Sure enough, a driver showed up in a mini-van a few minutes afterwards. Once onboard, he asked where we were going. Being the only family onboard, we asked to be dropped off to Riverside (our hotel lobby). When we arrived, the driver asked for $47 saying the complimentary ride was only to Epcot taxi area and not to Riverside. OK, we asked to be dropped off 3-4 miles further than the complimentary ride but that wasn't worth 47 dollars!!! When I called the hotel to rectify the situation, all I got was excuses.

During our week, we had several instances in which we needed some extra help, including needing some extra sheets at 1:00am because of an \u201caccident\u201d in bed by one of our kids (new sheets arrived in less than 5 minutes). I asked to use one of the grills (they have 2) one evening, and it was already started for me when I arrived at the pool/grill area and I also noticed it was squeaky clean (not grungy and full of grease as I\u2019ve seen with other \u201ccommunal\u201d grills elsewhere). The staff at the breakfast area does a tremendous job keeping things stocked and clean in a very heavy-use situation that could quickly turn into chaos. Our housekeeper was happily flexible in working around our erratic schedule (one parent at a conference, another spending time with the kids). The front desk staff was always available and have answered my questions and provided me with good information. The gripes about the pool-sun issue are generally accurate, but the pool itself is nicely heated, the hot tub is generously hot, and the the pool area is very a pleasant gathering place. A tip for the true sun worshipers that won't be satisfied with the enclosed situation of the Homewood pool - just a short walk across the parking lot (less than 50m) is a very open pool at the Hampton Inn, that is free to use for all Homewood guests (both hotels are owned by Hilton) - viola, problem solved. In summary, my wife and I both agree that this hotel has really been a dream. My congratulations go out to this hotel.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mclaren1Ireland", "ReviewID": "UR14830615", "Content": "Great rooms with seperate live area (rare in Orlando).

While we were there is was my daughters birthday, I asked if something to be arranged, on the day of her birthday when we came back from the parks in the room they left her a birthday cake, balloons and a card signed by all the staff it was a lovely gesture.

I will tell you this - watch your timing when you get here as both restaurants get VERY busy and the parking lot tends to get a bit congested. Your best time is to get here between 2pm and 4pm.

Free internet usage in their business center and although there is only 2 computers, I never had a problem finding one available.

On the odd occasion we decided to stay after the last bus in pleasure island and city walks so we had to get a taxi back to the hotel which cost $25 from pleasure island and only $10 from city walks,both are well worth staying later for and you can get into the clubs for free by using your disney and universal flex tickets which we bought over the internet before we went we paid \u00a3155 for disney pass and \u00a395 for universal but they didnt include bush gardens.

Here's what happened to us. I fully agree with the other review re express pass, elevators, etc. When we did the math we also were frustrated and felt duped. Universal is a busy place. It's actually a very, very busy place. There are no fast passes for anything. There is an express pass which you can buy. The day we wanted to go we couldn't even buy one because they were sold out. If we had stayed at a Universal hotel, we would have one included automatically. As a result of not having one of these passes, every single ride that we tried to go on had a wait of at least one hour minimum. The express pass ride wait was about 10-15 minutes if that. We spoke to a family who had a pass. They went on so many rides they couldn't count them. We paid all this money to go and ended up on three rides because we were tired of waiting in the heat and humidity. You need an express pass for Universal during busy season or don't go. Now, with that being said, on to the hotel. Here's the positives: two rooms, location of hotel to restaurants (24hr Denny's right next to the parking lot for food), washer/dryer, kitchen, Universal concierge in lobby (but with limited hours). Now here's the negatives: breakfast buffet an absolute zoo, never got into the jacuzzi because absolutely packed with people and was too small, luggage carts hard to come by, the slowest elevators in history which actually broke down twice and we were on the 6th floor, hot stuffy hallway, swimming pool located between two buildings so limited sunlight, rotten set up for bathroom - bathroom with very bright flourescent light. The toilet and tub are in one room with a door. Outside of that is the sink. About three very small steps away is your king bed. (No door separating sink from bed.)I had to go to bed when my husband did because of the proximity of the sink to the bed. There is a sink in the kitchen area, but no toilet. The sink, toilet, all of that is just simply way too close to the bed. Before booking this hotel think seriously of your situation. If you come in late at night, you will be hauling a lot of luggage if no cart is available - not exactly the right way to start a \"vacation.\" We live in Los Angeles and when we come to Orlando it's usually for ten days to two weeks. There is no valet parking and no bell man. This hotel would be okay if you were just staying for one night and had very limited luggage. Other than that, I wouldn't do it again even with the incredibly low price I paid. As I said earlier, the express pass for Universal is a necessity. Add that to the price of the hotel and I would have been at the price for a Universal hotel with a bell man, valet, larger pool, etc. Too many negatives.", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Russell Springs", "Title": "\u201c1 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "lwade", "ReviewID": "UR7352131", "Content": "I have stayed in many different types of hotels, my experience with this one was bad, i stayed one night on 4-11-07 had booked a 1 bedroom suite with two doubles and non smoking.

Had 15 and 17 year old niece & nephew visiting from abroad. Went for 2 bedroom [king plus 2 doubles] suite. Thanks to all prior reviewers. We weren't initially sorry - but except for a few small 'down' sides, we'll make different plans next time: Temperature control for whole place was in kids room [the one with 2 double/full size beds]. Kids like warm bedroom - we like cool. Compromise necessary, but somehow a bummer as we'd paid the same [$300] as 2 smaller rooms in a much nicer hotel [which would have had their own controls]. Kitchen area has table with 2 chairs - although there's room for 4 chairs [and for that matter: 4 people in the suite]. What were they thinking? Ice machine on ONE floor only [2nd: and by the way - do NOT book rooms 220 to 240 (approx > do some research) as I recollect they were across hallway from EXTREMELY noisy massive ice cube dump that happens when you take the sonically amplifeid tray from your fridge (no other vessels are provided in the rooms) place it inside the maw of the ice monster and push the button. Spring breakup in the arctic is quieter. Sinks are inside bedroom, while toilet & bath have their own room. Wonderful concept, badly executed. Would have been fine except for loud [and blinding] fluorescent fixture that lights up room. Advice: go to bed and wake up at same time as spouse [or sibling]. Good luck with that! Hallways may be an experiment in sensory deprivation: hot, stuffy and airless. And the 2 elevators [yes TWO for a 6 story hotel with about 48 rooms on each floor] were much worse than the hallways: if you're mildly claustrophic, don't use them. There's no air movement of any kind. I've heard that some top hotels and condos artfully employ positive and negative air pressure zones in hallways & rooms to keep cooking and other smells from travelling between rooms via the corridors. This may have been a failed attempt to do the same. Tsk-tsk. Free shuttles to theme parks are for organized people who have their kids on leashes - not for an uncle and aunt with 2 rent-a-teens. We tried the Star-something company van to Universal for 12 dollars for the 4 of us and that was fine. Came home for 8 dollars plus tip in a regular taxi. Go figger. Next day missed free shuttle and bellman called taxi which never came. We decided to drive and parked for 11 dollars in a wonderful secure multistory lot right on the Universal property. Would do that again: more flexibility after leaving park [ie. wanna go to the skydiving tower or wetnwild or somewhere non-Universal for dinner instead of the hotel? yes, please]. Some basic mathematical heads-up reminders: A. There are 2 elevators B. There are 4 luggage carts C. There are 6 floors with 48 rooms on each floor [?] Do the math. Here's our experience: On checkout day we want to spend day at the theme park so must get the heck outta hotel efficiently and either leave stuff in car in hotel lot or park at theme park [see remarks above]. We're in the southwest corner of the building, with an elevator nearby. The other elevator is in the northeast corner. Staff closes our elevator [with an \"out of order\" handmade sign on each floor]. I get a confession from desk clerk later that there is a conference on the main or 2nd floor and the attendees got tired of the \"noise\" from the guests. Hotel closes HALF the elevators [yeah, ONE of them], favoring the conventioneers over the hotel guests. Nice. What are our other options? Haul it yourself, piece by piece over about half a kilometer. Think of it this way: no one travels like Marlena Dietrich anymore, except families who stay in suite hotels. We weren't unique. Family size guests are encouraged by the suite hotels to \"move in\" - given the suggested amenities [tables, chairs, stoves, microwaves and friges] - but the available infrastructure [yes: elevators and luggage carts] is woefully lacking. Having cruised at suite level on major ships we've seen what it takes to move three thousand and more bodies and their stuff efficiently, and Homewood [Hilton, et al] haven't got a running start at covering the essentials. Take a lesson from Carnival [the most affordable of the mass market room and food providers]: get your elevators and baggage handling happening. As it was, I had to plead for an EXTRA HALF HOUR leeway to official checkout time. Give me the 4 and 5 star childless pomp and circumstance hotels [that we normally stay at] anyday over this. Next time the two nearest and dearest show up we're heading for Universal Portofino or something resembling a proper hotel, and we'll get 2 rooms and eat out [just like we did this time] Here's some more basic math [more for my own benefit right now, just typing it out]: Express Plus passes for a Thursday for 4 'adults': $80 Express Plus passes for a Friday for 4 'adults': $120 Express Plus passes for a Saturday for 4 'adults': $160 Parking at Universal: $11 Tip: Stay at one of the 3 Universal hotels and get the Express Plus [front of the line at ALL rides, etc] with the room, and no parking issues [you can take a boat from your hotel to the park]. More specifically, for the Friday of our stay, the Homewood & Express Plus passes and Parking was worth [300 room + 120 express plus + 11 universal parking] $431. Measure that against 2 rooms at one of the Universal properties. You may come out ahead. We'll definitely be back at Universal, but will never return to the Homewood Suites Orlando - International Drive.

The shittles are always on time and we did not even need to book in advance due to the fact that we went in November when the parks are not too busy. 3. Free breakfast - My husband and I love our food and we loved that fact that we got a proper breakfast for free. Eating out everyday for two weeks can be really expensive. The breakfast menu changed slightly everyday but it always included sausage, eggs, hash, waffles, cakes, toast , bagels, juices, yogurt, cereals - more than enough choice for everyone. he staff were fantatsic, so friendly. Always on hand in the mornings to help. I really loved every minute of it. the suite was spacious and cosy and the free nternet access was a real bonus.

It transpired that the error was actually of my wife's making and she didn't book the return coach travel - never-the-less the hotel didn't argue they just wantred us back safely. After our trip we took an internal transfer to New York to spend some time with relatives. We would then come back to Orlando for 5 nights before coming back to England. I decided to save a bit of money and book a different hotel. I booked La Quinta. When we arrived back to Orlando, the taxi took us to the hotel. What an absolute disapointment. All I can say is that I checking in at 2pm and checked out at 3pm. The rooms were horrible, they were clean but not of the \"Homewood\" standard We phoned Homewood Suites and they sorted us out a room that day. I can honestly say that for the sake of a few pounds I nearly spoit the whole holiday. Plus points - onsite laundry - fantastic bed - good kitchen for storing milk/water/left overs - staff were very friendly - they even stored our luggae whiole we were at New York!! Minus points - only two PCs in the internet cafe room, usually taken most of the time - area around the pool is a little limited Book this you will not be disapointed if you want a good location, and a very clean room for a comfortable nights sleep.", "Date": "October 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201cfirst class once again\u201d", "Author": "postboy", "ReviewID": "UR5904199", "Content": "just come back from this great hotel after a second stay there.i have never slept in a more comfortable bed than the one we had this year. staff excellent and will do any thing for u .special mention to joe the maintenance man who fixed our a/c unit.sadly cant make it next year but we will booking for 2008.cant wait for new water park to be built at seaworld and to have the baby back ribs at bahama breeze. tip on entering the parks when they take your photo ask them to take one with your camera you will get the same photo and u wont have to pay for it .", "Date": "October 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value / Great Service\u201d", "Author": "rm2006", "ReviewID": "UR5882136", "Content": "We booked this hotel based on it's excellent location and the reviews it had already received on Trip Advisor. We made the perfect choice. The hotel isn't glamorous, it doesn't have a bar or a flashy reception area nor does it have a restaurant located on site. What it does have however is fantastically efficient and friendly staff, a very convenient location, oversized rooms which are kept spotlessly clean (akin to the rest of the hotel) and useful room amenities such as a full sized fridge freezer, microwave oven and dishwasher. Now I certainly don't go on holiday to cook meals in my room but the fridge was great for keeping our water, wine and beer cold and it was great to be able to heat up a mug of milk if I wanted in the evening and then put the mug in the dishwasher rather than have to wash it up! The bed is the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in and I am still struggling to re-adjust to my own bed 5 days after returning, a bed I once considered to be pretty comfortable! My husband and I are 32 and 27 respectively and don't have any children however we both felt that this would be the perfect hotel to come back to when we do have children partly due to the amount of space you have but also because of the free breakfast buffet which saved us a fortune compared to the previous year's Orlando hotel! Okay so there isn't as much choice as you'd get if you went out for your breakfast which we did a couple of times for variety but there are cereals and toast, muffins, pancakes, danish pastries waffles, sausages, eggs, tea, coffee, orange juice etc and it is FREE! On occasion we also took advantage of the free wine and beer served Monday to Thursday at the Managers reception and although we didn't eat it, the food looked pretty good and there were certainly more than a few people (most families and conferencers) who were using this as the source of their main evening meal - another great money saver for families. The only reason we didn't eat there is because our evening meal out is one of the main events of the day for us as we like a few drinks but if you had children this would be ideal after a long and tiring day at the parks! Talking of nights out! The hotel is set far enough back to be quiet and traffic noise is minimal. However it is only a two minute walk onto International Drive and within a ten minute walk from the hotel you would find Bahama Breeze, TGI Fridays, Race Rock, Charleys Steak House, The Mercado, Ponderosa and many more so there is something for every taste and budget! Howl at the Moon (great dueling piano club!) is less than five minutes from the hotel so if you want a good night out this is a great place to go! We used the hotel taxi once and paid $14 for a taxi to Universal City Walk for a night out. Coming back cost us $8 including tip so we rang Diamond Cabs or Checker Cabs for all future transport needs as they were around half the price of the Hotel Taxi! It costs around $25 - $30 to get to Downtown Disney for a night out which we didn't mind as we were on holiday with another couple but only went once as we preferred City Walk anyway! Back to the hotel, the pool was in the shade but this didn't bother us at all, (the pool was never busy often empty) - it was a welcome retreat from the sun after a day at the parks and we took full advantage of it most evenings! Would definitely stay at this hotel again and can not recommend it enough. Incidentally we booked and flew with Travel City Direct as we have done for most of our trips to Orlando. Don't hesitate to use them, we have never had a problem and they are considerably cheaper than Virgin who I didn't feel were any better in the service / comfort. Also you can upgrade to First Class or Sunshine Upper and still pay less than Virgin Economy! We flew on sunshine upper this time and it was great! No queues to check in, you get on and off first, you get a pre take off drink (bar is also free all the way too but this is standard with all flights to Orlando with Travel City) , upgraded meal service and best of all no young children screaming all the way!

The suite was great with a huge kingside bed. The pool was shaded for most of the day but we didnt go to Florida to sit round a pool. But we were told we could use the pool next door if we wanted. What made it for us was the staff. They all had badges on with WIT we asked what it meant and was told \"Whatever it takes\" and that is what they did NOTHING was too much trouble and every query was answered with a smile. All the staff spoke to us every time they passed us their manners were impeccable. Being on our own we felt really safe and comfortable in this hotel. On our return I discovered to my horror that I had left my daughters favourite teddy bear \"Stanley\" in the hotel (anyone with kids will know this sinking feeling). After lots of tears I rang the hotel and explained what had happened sure enough Stanley was still there. I asked how much it would cost to have him posted back via DHL we were quoted approx $100 I asked how much it would cost by ordinary post and left my home address.

The breakfast buffet was excellent and even the Manager's special evening meals were acceptable (nothing too special but hey, they are free, and great when returning really tired after a day at the parks). The free wine and beer went down very well too! The suite was split into two rooms, the bedroom area with a huge King size bed and the other room with a sofa bed. There is a large TV in each room, so when we were occassionally in the room there was no arguing with the kids over what to watch. There is a huge fridge in the room, perfect for stocking up on a variety of drinks from the Walgreen's around the corner. The only real negative is the pool which has restricted sun during the day as overshadowed by the property, but some days even this was a blessing due to the exceptional heat! The previous review to mine has mentioned the decor being a bit drab and I suppose this is also a reasonable criticism, but I certainly didn't go to Orlando to look at the interior of the hotel! Anyway, whilst we were there, they had started the process of replacing the carpets in rooms on the ground floor, never saw the results though. Summing up, an excellent location, clean property/rooms, good value with friendly/helpful staff.

We used Universal Way a lot to avoid the busy I-Drive section around Sandlake Road. Checking in and out took no time at all and the suite we had was adequate for our needs. All staff we encountered were polite and helpful. Our suite was on floor 3 and looked out on to the central courtyard containing the pool. This did make the room a bit dark and dingy at times, but nothing to complain about. We couldnt detect any noise from the pool when it was busy. We had a few minor problems with the room upon our arrival, but these were fixed promptly by maintenance and the general standard of decor and cleanliness were fine throughout. The main bed was a king-size and was very comfortable. The sofa bed which our daughter slept on had seen better days, but did the job. Like others, we found the breakfast offered to be excellent, with plenty of choice. With the exception of the pasta night, we did not enjoy the evening snacks and tended to eat out a fair bit - they aren't advertised as main meals and they are complimentary, so who's complaining! The free beer was great! The swimming pool and hot tub were good - we used them everyday, although it is only completely open to the sun during the middle part of the day. We quite liked the shade as the temp was up in the 90s. However on the less humid days when the wind was up a bit, it was noticeably chilly. There were plenty of towels. The few negatives I would note were: the noise from the combined air-con units. Even with our unit switched off overnight, the constant hum rebounding in the courtyard from other rooms and the big fan units, which I assume cool the corridors, was initially disturbing, but we got used to it after a few nights. the counter-tops in the kitchen and bathroom were being upgraded whilst we were there and we had a note passed under our door saying that the work would be done whilst we were out. As we were within 2 nights of leaving and would be spending more time in the room, we opted to decline this (as offered on the note). However, we came back during the afternoon to find the work was being done anyway - during the last couple of days, the sink started to leak, resulting in maintenance men coming in and out to fix it.

The location is close enough for a 10-min. walk to the Convention Center, and is surrounded by similar hotels and the I-Drive collection of restaurants and \"ways to burn family dollars\" (ie, retail and amusements). Our staff loved that Bahama Breeze with its large veranda bar is directly behind the hotel. (By the way, the best nearby business restaurant is Vito's Chop House, a premium-level steak house.) Ice cream fiends would love that Friendly's is also adjacent. At a $135 rate, the hotel is a very good value, since it includes a \"suite\" type room, full breakfast buffet of acceptable quality (don't expect fine food), and evening reception with enough food to make a supper. The room quality is quite good; furnishings and bedding were in good condition, and of average quality for the price range. Cleanliness and building condition overall were very good. The staff is all young and generally helpful, though the \"cream of the crop\" of Orlando's hospitality employees obviously gravitate toward the larger, better paying properties. As long as you understand this, you won't be unsatisfied. Amenties include free wireless internet in both the lobby and rooms, and although the speed can be quite slow, the service was reliable and useful for email and light surfing. Just don't try to download huge files. Tip: Get to breakfast well before the 9 to 10 hour, when it is hard to find seating. I can recommend the hotel to any business traveler, and certainly to families who can benefit from the kitchenette, sleeper sofa, two TVs, pool, big breakfast, and free shuttle to attractions.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salem, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNumber One In Customer Service!!\u201d", "Author": "1northstar26", "ReviewID": "UR5026638", "Content": "An Amazing Customer Service Suite Hotel!

We paid $119 a night.We had spent the previous week at the Homewood Suites in Lake Beuna which were excellent and only $79 a night. We had only chosen two different locations to cut down on travelling and the fact the most hotels in LBV didn't offer shuttle services to Universal. Firstly, the appearence of the hotel and the rooms were excellent. The breakfast was great if not a little crowded. However you could take food back to your room and keep going back for more. The Managers reception from Monday to Thursday was also very good and again you were able to take beer, wine, soft drinks and food back to your room if you wanted. We used the shuttle service to the parks every day and they were always there on time. It would have been great if there had been a late afternoon shuttle to the parks so you could have just gone for the night parades and fireworks. The pool was nice but no childrens pool which means you really have to be in there with young children. It was nice that you were in the shade as you don't have to worry about sun block all the time. The only downside of the hotel (and the reason I haven't given it 5 stars) is that it had the noisiest air conditioning I have ever heard. The first night we were there we turned our air conditioning off because it was so loud. However, it didn't seem to make any difference so we thought there was a problem. We called maintenance who arrived very promptly. They said the noise was from other peoples air conditioning because there was one channel that went from the top of the building to the bottom. Also the air condition units were mounted on the outside by the windows. Our room was literally vibrating. The maintenance man said it was a common complaint, so I was very surprised never to have read anyone else mention it on the reviews. He found us a room on the ground floor on the corner next to a store cupboard. He said it would be the quietest room he had and it was fine. We were moved that night and allowed to leave our stuff in our old room overnight and collect in the morning. There is no way I would have been able to spend a week in the old room. The noise would have driven me crazy. I guess if you are use to air conditioning then you probably wouldn't notice it so much. We hadn't had this problem the previous week. When you turned the aircon off there, it was completely silent. The location of the hotel is good. Lots of restaurants in walking distance. There is an I Ride Trolly stop five minutes from the hotel.

How wrong I was. I have been to Florida twice and can honestly say this is the worst hotel I have stayed in. We arrived on a Saturday and drove to the hotel. We got at front desk and was greeted by an ignorant women. When my husband politely said \"hello\" we just got a grunted reply of \"name\". When we booked, we requested a non smoking room. She told us that the room was a smoking room, and when we told her that we booked a non smoking room, she replied \"not my problem, ask your rep\"!! We thought this was very rude. So without an argument, we trudged up to our suite through a damp smelling corridor which was filled with bins full of rubbish. We discovered that the room 2 doors down were playing loud music. This was at 11:15!! We entered our suite to be greeted with damp smells, dirty carpets, unmade beds, unemptied bins, thread bare curtains hanging of the rail and when closed they had huge holes in them. The bathroom wasn\u2019t much better. Mould on the tiles, broken shower head that was no more than a drizzle, leaking toilet, and the mirror was missing. We turned on the air conditioning to find it didn\u2019t work. But because it was so late we decided to wait till the morning till we informed the front desk. We went to be at about 12am. It had been 20 minutes and the loud music was still playing. In the end my husband called front desk to tell them. It was the same woman as before and she just said the hotel policy was that music can be played until 01:30 hours at the weekends!! We told her we couldn\u2019t sleep and she said there was nothing she could do about it and hung up on us!! We were kept awake till 1:45am and called front desk again and told her that the time limit was up and asked for someone to come up and tell them to turn the music down. She said she couldn\u2019t as the hotel security was on vacation and that she or other members of staff couldn\u2019t because it was \u201chotel policy\u201d. It seemed she liked saying that. We eventually got to sleep but were woken by someone banging on our door at 6:30am. It was a maid wanting to clean our room!! I said we are still in bed and she practically ordered us to be out the room by 7:30!!! We couldn\u2019t believe the attitude. We decided to go to Magic Kingdom and take advantage of the free Disney transport. We went to front desk and, yes you guessed it, greeted by the same receptionist as before. We asked for the free coach and she informed us that the free shuttle was only available on certain days and that today we would have to pay!! We were disgusted. It is what I would call false advertisement. So off we went to the theme park and before we left we asked for maintenance to fix the leaky toilet and the air conditioner. We got back and found the toilet NOT fixed and neither had the air conditioner!! Again called front desk who told us maintenance only worked nine till six!! We also discovered the room HADN\u2019T been cleaned by the maid who had made us exit our room to clean it. So at this point we were getting annoyed. We have: Ignorant staff, dirty rooms, loud music, woken up by the maids, poor service and basically being ripped off. The next incident took place 5 days later. We got back from the theme park to discover a watch of my husband\u2019s had gone missing. We reported it to front desk who said in so many words nothing could be done and blamed us by saying we had mislaid it!! We decided to move hotels but were told we couldn\u2019t by our rep. We put up with this dire place for the rest of the holiday. During this time rooms were not cleaned well or simply not cleaned at all, the broken electrical things were never fixed or replaced, loud music and noise went on till all hours with nothing being done. And to add insult to injury on the last day, we went to get our deposit back and were told we couldn\u2019t have it because of the maintenance work that had been done on our room!!!! Not only had NO work been done but should WE pay for that anyway??!!?! We were disgusted with this hotel and would advise people to avoid. Pick the Embassey Suites or The Quality Inn Plaza Suites. These are so much better and better price as well.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MIDDLESBROUGH ENGLAND", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Brilliant\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3836185", "Content": "From start to finish our hoilday was beyond our wildest dreams.

The hotel is very clean and comfortable and relatively new (maybe 3 years old). The rooms have separate living areas. Check in was great, and the staff was very helpful. The only reason I am not giving this hotel an excellent, it that when i asked for a metered cab.. they gave me a limo/towncare company with set rates...no meter! And when I took the same ride with a metered cab it was almost half the difference. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to the Convention Center Area.

There is a safe in the wardrobe and there are decent hairdryers which I had wondered about myself beforehand. Proper iron and board also.

We did not use the pool, but as others said it is in the shady courtyard, it looked nice though (also the jacuzzi), our room overlooked pool area. We did not go to the evening buffet either as we were never there around that time.
