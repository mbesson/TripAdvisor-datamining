I always checked 10 times the details and verify with all the blogs that exist before choosing a place. So we reserved this hotel as a birthday trip for my husband's 50th birthday for 7 nights. The first 2 nights were alright the hotel is very clean, the room was nice with a view to the garden - but for the fact that on the second day they inform us we had to move to another room (we had 2 reservation one from mid September and one from mid November and they had a problem with their planning - the 2 reservation were made 3 1/2 months before!!!!).They could have inform us sometime before so I could choose if to keep the booking or choose another hotel. And then the choc and we understand why all the problems: the hotel was booked completely by groups of high-school teenagers from Italy on a study trip, 50+ teenagers alltogether in the breakfast room, on the stairs... We were move to a room the size of \"Harry Potter cupboard\", so that they could maximize the occupation of the other rooms. The breakfast in the morning was dreadful. I think even the staff was shocked.This hotel is presented as a boutique hotel, not an youth hostel. In three words: don't stay there.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cTriple room top marks\u201d", "Author": "Candodis", "ReviewID": "UR122432930", "Content": "The much maligned stairs were not an issue for us as we were given a room around the corner from reception. Though you do have the steps at the entrance to contend with. To be fair, most of the places we have stayed in have had at least 5 stairs. But a ramp may be helpful alternative. The hotel itself is elegant and spotlessly clean. The triple room we booked had an adjoining room, which was a big plus. This was great as it allowed privacy for our 17 year old. We thought the breakfast was more than adequate, by European standards. There was a coffee machine in our room, but could not figure out how to use it. A down side of all European hotels as opposed to S.E Asia is that no tea or coffee making facilities are provided. So if you want a \"cuppa\" out of hours, you pay for it! I booked through booking.com and emailed the hotel to get directions as we were arriving from Tegel, at night. I have to say their response was precise right down to timing of trains and buses. The Wifi was patchy,but we did get two passwords so we could use more than 1 device. Overall, we were happy and would definitely stay again.

Be sure to get EVERYTHING in writing, so you receive all you expected and paid for - even if that means being insistent with the staff (who are brusque at best and downright rude at worst). Location is great; excellent neighborhood near fashionable shops, restaurants, and transportation. Non-smoking rooms really were non-smoking, which was perfect (and unexpected in Europe). Now the catches we experienced... We are seasoned travelers. We reserved two months in advance directly with hotel via email for our two-person, nine-night stay. Requested and were confirmed with a particular number \"Superior\" room, quiet, non-smoking, with in-room w-lan. After a 12-hour travel day, we arrived to check-in and were inexplicably assigned to a lesser room with a small bed. When we informed the staff of their mistake and explained we could not both sleep in the small bed (although we are both average sized), we were told there was \"nothing else available,\" despite the written confirmation we presented to the very person who corresponded with us. When absolutely pressed (she herself did not offer a single option or apology), she reluctantly said we could switch to the promised \"Superior\" room after the first two nights. With a large convention in town, we had no choice. These non-German speakers were simply too exhausted to argue. Incredibly, the staff tried to force us to pay the Superior room price for these first two nights and only relented after we disputed with our credit card. When we finally were able to move to a Superior room, the staff tried to shoehorn us into one without a shower (tried to sell us on the \"beautiful jacuzzi tub\" which is not all that appealing to these business travelers, especially given it is about the size of a thimble). We were willing to believe that this bait and switch was simply the result of a one-time misommunication with us, until we saw the very same thing happen to at least three other parties at check-in over the course of our nine-day stay. Coincidence? I think not. Finally, after two nights and two moves, we were allowed to take the actual room that we actually reserved. First morning, shower drain was VERY slow. Second morning, it was clogged completely; we could not shower without water overflowing onto floor (no tub - just shower). We reported to staff that shower was totally unusable and plumber (or at least Drain-O?) was needed. Staff never attended to this, despite repeated requests, and never acknowledged the issue unless I raised it. Finally, in desperation, I myself disassembled the drain and cleaned out a four-inch hairball (not ours). No, my friends, this definitely was NOT my most positive hotel experience. Shower worked just fine after that! Other issues: We were careful to request a quiet room and were confirmed with same; but neither the initial smaller room (facing courtyard) nor the promised Superior room (facing Fasenanstrasse) was quiet by any stretch of the imagination. Hotel touted the \"new\" fourth floor featuring in-room w-lan, but in-room w-lan was non-existent in either room; not sure whether the other few rooms on \"new\" fourth floor really do have it, as advertised. Hotel site claims that \"all rooms have...Internet\" (which I suppose is intended to mean a landline?) but neither of our rooms had any kind of land-line Internet access. Hotel site also claims there is a \"large breakfast buffet,\" but we found a hot chocolate machine and a table of meat that was picked over by 9am. Site also says there is a \"small safe in every room,\" but our lesser room did not have one. We found no in-room temperature controls, other than small bathroom heater.
