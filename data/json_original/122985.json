The rate was all right (around $80) for a large room with two queen beds. Called on a long weekend and with 10 minutes notice had a room. The fellow on the desk was very nice. Room had a fridge and microwave and with some instructions the TV worked fine. The beds were clean and so was the bathroom. Also offered a continental breakfast which we didn't use at all. Was also very quiet and the place is well built. Had free wi fi which worked fine. But there are holes in the wall from paintings, peeled wallpaper and paint, one headboard off the wall and it's a place you wouldn't want to walk without socks or shoes! The furniture was vintage 70s or 80s and well worn. Also noticed that there is no smoke detector and it has been taken off the ceiling. There is work being done with rolled up carpet in the parking lot. So in a pinch for one night it was all right and the beds and bathroon were clean.

The room had everything a person would expect in motel: air conditioning and heat, hot water, cable, a comfortable bed, comfortable furniture and closet space.
