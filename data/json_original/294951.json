The terrace at the top gave a raptuous view of the busy Bosphorous River and it was a 7 minute walk up our cobblestone street to the square where you have the Blue Mosque,the Hagia Sophia,the Hippodrome, and a large park area for great people watching! It was a fair price: $170 euros a night. We stayed 3 nights and it included a buffet breakfast in a lovely setting. There was free internet in the lobby which was no problem. Comfortable couch areas with sprays of flowers around you while you type! The staff was delightful. Some one was always at the desk to help you as you came through the lovely front entrance.

We stayed at this hotel for five nights and spent four full days touring Istanbul. If you hate hotels overrun with tour groups, this hotel is for you -- it caters to independent travellers, businessmen, and small upscale tours (a small medical conference [with some touring thrown in] was there when we were, which made for some interesting conversations and didn't make the hotel feel crowded). Hotels in the Sultanahmet district of Istanbul are older, boutique hotels, and even if renovated, tend to have small rooms -- we booked a room one level up from standard, figuring that that would give us a slightly larger room. Even so, it was small. But you don't book a hotel in Sultanahmet to get luxury, spas or swimming pools -- you choose one because it is a three minute walk to the Blue Mosque and then only a few minutes more to the Hagia Sophia and many other sights. And despite the cost (location in Istanbul is everything, and you pay for it), it was a great hotel for us and I recommend it unreservedly. The hotel actually has some museum quality Roman pieces recovered from the property on display in the elegantly furnished public rooms -- a nice touch. Their buffet breakfast, served on the fifth floor terrace in nice weather (great views), is excellent. The staff are helpful and gracious. We ate most nights in their restaurant -- most others seem to go out to nearby local places, get picked up by their hosts (businessmen) or are bused off to some evening activity (hamam experience, belly dancing show or Bosphorus tour) with included dinner. The food was good (though the restaurant can feel empty at times), especially if you selected Turkish dishes -- they do a better job on these than on \"international cuisine\". On nice evenings the terrace is open for drinks and dinner -- a great way to relax after a busy day or touring.

We booked via booking.com. An exclusive room etc. On arrival, our room wasnt ready. After waiting 30 minutes we were given a normal double room. After much complaining and arguing, we were given a new room, which was only slightly bigger than the other room... total mess. Very small, hardly any room for 2 suitcases, so we felt like we were living in a factory after doing 2 days of shopping... bath is NOT a jacuzzi bath, but simply a bath that streams some water in it, so dont be fooled by that. The bed was TINY, and very uncomfortable, at least for us. The electricity. Oh dont get me started. All the plugs and lights are wired off one main switch in the rooms. So if you turn off all your lights, you cannot watch TV or charge your phones or laptop etc. while you are in bed. unreal. So be warned if you are a business traveler, or if like us, you like to watch a movie in bed after a long day shopping and wandering. As for the shower... well, it goes hot and cold all the time, either freezing you or burning you... its just not acceptable really. We travel away from home for some comforts that we dont have at home. By day 2 we were longing for our home! As for service, it sucks. Depending on who you ask, you will get a different answer, right down to directions around the city. Luckily we double checked each time before trusting anyones thoughts on a query! What else? well to be honest, I could go on... but I dont really want to waste too much of your time, as you can see, simply this hotel is sub standard and will never be a luxury, 4 or 5 star hotel in our books.

Breakfast included poached and scrambled eggs, hot and cold meats,and if you asked you could also have an omelette (with cheese, onion, tomatoes, turkey ham), and fried eggs. All this was included in the bed and breakfast deal. One of the most important things was that the juices were carton fresh, and not the usual TANG that you would normally get. Additional tips: There is a computer that is connected to the internet and has a printer, and we found this very useful as we could check in on-line for our return flights, and also print our boarding cards, and this did not incur any charge.

FIrst night we were in a lovely room on the 4th floor, but it was way too hot overnight to sleep even though outside it was only 4degrees - it is the structure of that floor of the hotel. Sadly the french doors couldnt open up quite enough to let the air in properly due to being in the eaves/arches of the building, but the wonderful staff moved us to a room on the first floor where we were much more comfortable and the rooms are slightly bigger. So my top tip is stay away from the top floor unless the air con is working - which I presume is there in summer time. Aside from this small blip this hotel is wonderful, great staff, very useful helpful advice, very friendly and I would definitely stay there again and recommend my friends and family stay with the Eresin Crown. The location is perfect a few min walk on cobbled streets to the blue mosque and 10 mins to the very easy to use trams. Lots of restaurants and bars nearby the tram stop, plenty of choice. The Grand Bazaar is only a couple of stops away too - or probably a 20 min-half hour walk -so the location is great. I hope to go back to the Eresin Crown one day as a family.

On 16 March 2008 I received a confirmation from the Erisin Hotel website stating \" We look forward to serving you during your upcoming stay at the Eresin Crown Hotel. If we can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to reply to this e-mail or contact us\". I read the email and then closed the email, everything appeared normal. My wife and I arrived at the hotel on Good Friday 21 March at 18.00pm and showed the gentleman at reception our booking confimation. The gentleman called the Hotel Division Manager and she said \"Sorry you have cancelled your reservation in our reservation system and we are now fully booked\". After fifteen minutes she offered us only one night stay in a Suite and the hotel would pay for a taxi to transfer us to their sister hotel \"The Taxsim Premier Hotel\" and they offered us a suite for three nights. I checked the web and all the other hotels in Sultanahmet were full so we had no choice but to accept the offer to be transferred to Taxsim. The hotel manager could not produce an email sent from me to prove I had cancelled the reservation. She did, however produced a copy of the cancellation sent to my email, dated 21 March at 17.35pm. i.e. 25 mins before we arrived at the hotel! Why on earth would I cancel my booking and then fly to Istanbul to check-in to the hotel. My advise to other travellers is to contact hotels in advance and confirm your bookings, even if you have a web confirmation. I did not cancel my booking and I was deeply appalled that the hotel sent a letter to our Suite which said \"In reference to the cancellation situation discussed with you earlier - we regret to advise that the reservation was in fact cancelled at your end. I have attached a copy of the email sent from our system to you in response to the cancellation.....Kind Regards, Hotel Division Manager\". The Suite at the Eresin was located at the front of the hotel and we could hear everything, including traffic, loud music and people talking in other rooms. Overall this is not the service I expect from a hotel with a five star rating. The sister hotel was only rated four stars and was located 20 minutes from the historic old town where we had looked forward to staying. I can only assume that when the hotel reservation system indicated to the hotel management that the hotel was fully booked they started sending out automatic cancellations to customers due to check-in later in the day.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "_kbb_Cork", "ReviewID": "UR14473621", "Content": "The lobby of the hotelwas welcoming and had a lovely feel to it.The hotel has some ruins from the Byzantine period in its atrium.The staff were very pleasant and helpful.We stayed for one night in March.The location was great.
