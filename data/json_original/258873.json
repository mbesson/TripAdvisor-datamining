The villa feels more like a private home than an hotel. Rooms are individually furnished and decorated, while art works throughout the hotel add to its charm. The welcoming proprietor lives in a flat above the hotel and is on hand for assistance, if required. We found service to be discreet and efficient. Our room was a good size with a spare single bed, wardrobe, desk and chairs. The room was fully air-conditioned and also had a ceiling fan, opening windows and adjustable shutters, so it was comfortable in all climatic conditions. The spacious private bathroom was well-equipped and had its own opening window. We initially chose the hotel for its location on the Lido as we were travelling by car and preferred to park the car at the hotel rather than in a remote car park. However, we soon found the location's chief benefit to be the ability to enjoy a beach holiday and a city break simultaneously. There are both a managed beach (deck chairs, restaurant etc) and undeveloped beaches within easy walking distance of the hotel and, even closer, a pizzaria and a direct (privately operated) ferry to Zattare in Venice. At the hotel, we enjoyed continental bufffet breakfast in the private, enclosed, garden, which was also perfect for relaxing and sun-bathing. We took advantage of the hotel's bicycles to visit other parts of the Lido and purchased three-day passes, giving unlimited use of Venice's public transport, for trips further afield. These included travel on buses from the hotel to the Lido's main boat station and waterborne transport to all parts of Venice. Night services on both the boats and the buses enabled us to enjoy Venice's night life before returning to the tranquillity of our hotel.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cHotel Villa Beatrice is the best value in all of Venice, complete with romance and practicality and a caring staff\u201d", "Author": "SShiflet", "ReviewID": "UR71250425", "Content": "We arrived weary, early in the day.

Breakfast was consistently fresh, delicious, and shared with a smile. Don't miss the home-made jams and jellies--the fruit comes right out of the courtyard. And that courtyard--terrific place to gather for a drink, to take a nap, or to play with the ancient little Tutle, Mpouffi, who summers on the Lido with Beatrice and company. We enjoyed everything about our stay there--from great sheets, towels, provisions to free bicycles and guidance to relax around the Lido. The pictures on the web page for the hotel don't come close to doing this place justice. It is a quite oasis amid a lovely section of the Lido...it is at once remote and amid all the ammentities and activities you need--beach is just a half km away and is open to the public--rare in Lido. The hotel is pleasantly appointed with family heirlooms, family art (quite good, by the way), and modern conveniences. All the graciousness of Italy is alive at Villa Beatrice.

No restrictions on what time you have to be back to the hotel at the end of the day, you have your own gate key and pick up the door key from reception yourself.

By the time we reached the Villa we were both very tired. We had a short walk around the area but could not locate anywhere to get a meal or even a shop that was open. We returned to our room, I was really glad that I had brought a travel kettle, after reading a review. The room was basic, there was a tv (only English channels were CNN and MTV) but that didn't matter. There was a shower room and pleanty of wardrobe space. I was pleased that we had been given a first floor room with a balcony which overlooked the very pleasant garden. Next morning we met Beatrice who is a very nice lady. Breakfast consisted of toast, rolls, buttter, cheese and jams. Also coffee and juice. There were only a couple of other guests there that weekend so it was very quiet. As it is quite a trek to get to the centre of Venice, once again having to use the bus, then the water bus (15 mins to St Marks Square from the Lido jetty), when you have gone out for the day, you really have to stay out. So for people who like to return to their hotel during the day they would find it not very suitable. However, if you like to be in amongst the local people then you would enjoy staying here as I don't think there are many tourists who find their way to this area and I only saw one other small hotel. We did actually like travelling on the bus and waterbus everyday. We met quite a few 'characters' and the locals were mostly very friendly. Beatrice's husband has done some 'interesting' artwork which is displayed around the hotel. It certainly gave us something to talk about over breakfast. All in all, the villa is basic, quiet and I am sure in a lovely area. We would loved to have had more time to explore the Lido but as it was quite a chilly and rainy week-end we did not get to see much of the area at all, going across to the centre and Murano instead. Be aware that there is a little building work going on quite close to the Villa but you cannot see or hear anything. Also, if you are looking for a small supermarket the only one we found on the Lido is straight ahead, along the main street, around 200-250 metres from the Jetty. There are also lots of smaller shops around this area.

The garden attached to the hotel is secluded with chairs and reclining seats, and boasts a number of trees providing shade on a hot summer's day.

The Alberoni bus actually consists of 2 different routes, one of which makes a figure 8 loop and never goes near the hotel. The bus stop and the drivers never seem to be able to tell you which one is which. We were also forced to get off the bus part way home late at night because the driver did not feel like finishing the route.

Taking the water taxi is not a viable option unless you have an extra 70$ for a one way trip. Taxis also seemed over price on the island, wanting 20$ for the ride from the Lido dock to this hotel.

Stayed here for 5 nights at the end of september. The first problem is that it is at the other end of Lido island and takes at least 15 mins by bus to get there from the ferry terminal. More importatly though, on booking directly with the owners, I specifically asked for a 2nd floor room with a terrace which they confirmed was available and we agreed on the price. However, after the gruelling journey to get there, on arrival we were told that there was none available and also that there was no reduction on the price which we were not happy about at all. We felt that this was done deliberately as she must have known this beforehand and it was just to make up numbers. After all, when you get there, it's so secluded that you really have no choice but to stay. How hard can it be to manage a 10 room guest house! She tried to avoid us for the rest of our stay, was very insincere whenever we spoke to her, and we could sense her guilt. It was a very unfair thing to do as we were looking forward to sitting out and reading in the sunshine, and saving ourselves some money by not having to spend every day going to the city. It's a great option to have if you want to just stay there and chill out. Without a terrace, you simply had to leave your room after breakfast. There was nothing else to do, nor is there anything much to do in the area. Beach is about 10 mins walk though. Towels were also not changed on more than one occasion, and the only english speaking channel is CNN. The bed were extremely comfortable though, and we liked the decor. It was very \"riviera\" style. Breakfast was nice and plentiful. The lady who serves breakfast is so rude that it's nearly comical. She seemed to make a point about only talking in Italian to us despite the fact that it was clear we had no idea what she was saying. She only gave us the option for a normal coffee, and we noticed that it said that you could have cappucino on our confirmation email. If you want to annoy her, ask her to make a cappucino at about 5 mins to 10. The highlight of our stay really, if a little childish. Overall, this place is ok.
