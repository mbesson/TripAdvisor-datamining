The layout of the hotel is interesting in that it is a series of buildings. The rooms were large and comfortable. The bathroom sink was in a small dressing area separate from the shower and toilet. If you have a car this is an ideal location for getting to the Old Town section of the city, north to LaJolla, downtown or Seaport Village. Without a car it's about a $20 cab ride. The hotel is close to the airport but because of its location there's no jet noise, unless there's occasional military traffic into the North Island facility. The meeting staff was great and very attentive to our group. The food for our meeting was in the room on time. Coffeee and sodas were replenished regularly. The quality of the food was excellent. If there's one knock on this property it's that their restaurant closes at 9 PM (10 on Friday and Saturday).

The location of this hotel was ideal for us as we had a car, without one perhaps it would be a problem, also of course parking is free not $20+ that other nearby hotels charge. On arrival we checked in very efficiently and were presented with 6 complimentary drinks vouchers and 6 breakfast vouchers, we used 2 of the drinks vouchers when we had a meal in the onsite Point Loma cafe, the food was fine but not exceptional, on the other 2 nights we had dinner in the downtown area, Anthonys being one of them of course. Having read the reviews about the breakfast we did not use the vouchers and organised our own continental type fare for which the fridge in the room came in handy. We were in the rear block looking at the houses and hotels behind the HI, not as good as looking at the marina but fine all the same, we sat on the small balconey on Friday evening and watched the world go by with a drink. The onsite small store sold the basics and we found it handy, also for members of the IHG reward scheme, Priority Club there is a room which has been made into a lounge for Gold and Platinum members(1326) it has a TV, computer with printer, bowl of fruit and snack bars, some visitors may find it handy.

The hotel itself is quite nice with a restaurant, bar and convenience store on premises. The staff is friendly and professional, and the rooms completely in standard with the Holiday Inn brand.

This is in spite of the following flaws. The room (I was upgraded to a deluxe whatever that means) and the bathroom were smallish, but there was a view of the marina. The bed was clean and comfortable and the wifi was reasonably fast except in the night when all hotel wifis slow down to a crawl. There is no extra charge for wifi, parking and breakfast even though breakfast as with all Holiday Inns in the USA is inedible since they only buy and provide industrially produced items of dubious quality consisting primarily of the flesh of dead animals. The most unnerving thing was the layout of the hotel with multiple entrances and lobbies, numerous parking areas, confusing set of elevators etc. as a result of all this, security was a concern since none of the doors were security enabled and were always open 24/7.

I was without a car for a couple days, so I really got to check this place out. First off, it is very close to the airport and other San Diego attractions which is nice, but because it is in Point Loma, you get the added flavor of a long-time boating community of Portuguese tuna fishermen and America's Cup sailors. It is close to Ocean Beach and Cabrillo Lighthouse. Favorite things about this hotel: Location, free bicycle rentals, well-maintained heated outdoor pool/hottub with plenty of towels, and great employees. You will see families, business clients, and older military clientele and sailors because of San Diego's military heritage. We were honored to be there during a reunion of WW2 bomber veterans. Be sure to take advantage of the free bicycle rentals!!! Free for 2 hours. They don't have gears but you wont need them. Best route- Out of the hotel take a right on Harbor Drive, then left on Scott, left on Shelter Island Drive. Go all the way to the end of Shelter Island (you will love it) then turn around and come back past the hotel and take a left on Laning Rd to Liberty Station (Google it!). You can take a side road before that if you want. Once off the main road, go to the right and you will find an awesome bike path! It is safe, beautiful and peaceful. Ride it to the end ....you can this whole trip well within the 2 hours... probably less than 1 hour if you don't get tempted to stop anywhere. Liberty Station has a Von's grocery store, Trader Joes, and tons of well priced eating places! Driving tip regarding the area: Point Loma is a well-established area of the city with older streets that aren't laid out that great. Even a fancy model GPS might fail you here! Get a map and go with the map, not your GPS. You will get to Ocean Beach, Sunset Cliffs, and Cabrillo Monument much quicker and with less traffic if you use a map. Caveats/reason for 4 stars: There a several building types (highrise, 2-story), so I can't speak for them all. Our room was in the 2-story and close to the pool but in a marginally good location-- too close to parking lot (see room tips). The mattress seemed a little older and not the type of bed that makes you go, \"Ahhhh\" when you lay down, but I have had worse and the bedding (sheets/pillows/etc) were nice and comfy.

The room had an odd floor plan with the bathroom sink just inside the door and the toilet and tub in a separate room.

When the complimenatry hotel's van picked me up at San Diego International airport, about 3 miles away, my skepticism kicked-in because this particular property is an older design, circa 1950's. But, this mangement company has maintained this beautiful property and it was a trip down nostagia-way with a few updated, modern conveniences such as: Complimenatry WiFi, USA Today newspaper, Free Lunch, Dinner and Drink coupons everyday of my stay. Note: I did not have to spend any additional monies for food or beverage my entire stay. My room was located on the second floor overlooking the pool. The pool area was beautiful. Full of flowers, palm trees, grass so soft you wanted to walk bare foot! In fact, all the flowers, plants and trees, property wide (not just the pool area) had signage on them educating you on all the foilage. It was a great touch because as my wife was admiring a plant you never see back-home, the first question she had was: \"What is the name of the plant?\" The pool area, pool and hot-tub were professionally maintained; clean, towels in a self-serve cabana, waterfalls, flowers and most important, the hot-tub actually worked (water-jets) and it was HOT! As I entered my room, I was very impressed with the accommodations. Two queen-size beds with the most comfortable mattress and pillows I have ever slept on in years. In fact, I bought 4-pillows (only $10 each;couldn't believe the price!) from the hotel and they are shipping them to me at no charge. Plenty of big, soft towels, 46\" flat screen HD-TV with complimentary HBO, refrigerator, Free WiFi, and the biggest standard hotel room I've stayed in years. This hotel is conveient to everything. Harbor Island is only 3 miles(great restaurants here), and downtown San Diego is about 6 miles. In fact, the hotel's van took us there at no charge and saved us money on a cab fare! My business meeting was held in the Catering Department of the hotel. The Catering staff did a great job in taking care of our group. From a clean meeting room, to A/V equipment that was set-up and worked without a hitch, to fresh, hot coffee and cookies. I (we) really appreciated the Catering staff. The restaurant was not large, but it was fast, efficient and I was impressed on how many \"locals\" used this dining facility...when \"locals\" visit on a regular basis, you know that it's great...and it was! Great breakfast, large portions and a staff that was very friendly and helpful. The entire staff seemed to come from the same mold, everyone was helpful, friendly and always went out-of-the-way to assit you. Lola, the overnight desk clerk was as good as it gets. By the way, the property also has a wonderful bar that opens up into the pool area. They had live music and the complimentary drink coupons were very helpful although we did spend money on snacks! The Gift Shop had everything we needed and more. So, if you forgot something, chances are they have it! Wow, we really enjoyed our stay and appreciated the trip down memory lane. This Holiday Inn reminded me of a 1957 Chevy that had been restored and when we saw the green-colored spot-lights that illuminated the hotel's property, it stuck a deep memory of what Holiday Inn's looked in the 50's and 60's. The only negatives were two items: 1) If you stayed on the traditional two-story building as we did, there isn't an elevator for handicapped or if you had many pieces of luggage, as we did, it was a little work getting up-the-stairs. 2) The rooms did not have microwaves; we like microwaves to heat up leftovers and we love our popcorn!

If you are a higher level member you get free breakfast. That, along with Happy Hour Monday to Friday munchies were pleasant surprises. The grounds are well kept and nicer than the hotel pictures show. It felt like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mini resort on a budget\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Nice pool, hot tub, ping pong, shuffleboard, bicycles, internet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all free. This area (Point Loma) is quiet and relaxing. We walked along the shore all the way to Shelter Island, then along the sandy beach with great view of the San Diego skyline. We dined at Pizza Nova, Point Loma Seafood, and Point Loma Caf\u00c3\u00a9 - all very close. We also walked (about 20 minutes) to Liberty Station, enjoyed dinner at Sammy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wood-fired Pizza and bought some groceries at Trader Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Vons. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a short walk to the #28 bus on Rosecrans, buy a $5 day pass, and roam the entire transit system (buses and 3 trolley lines). The Entertainment Book included a number of coupons for restaurants in the area not to mention a $13 coupon for Point Loma Caf\u00c3\u00a9 associated with the hotel. All the dishes were tried were very good and the service prompt. After sundown the area is very quiet, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for active nightlife, stay in Gaslight, which we did post-cruise for two nights. On the morning of our cruise we took the 1:00pm free shuttle to the port. Much was said about the friendly staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all true and a real pleasure to experience in person", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cDecent with great views\u201d", "Author": "Seajax", "ReviewID": "UR56702460", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights with a colleague. We both were given king sized rooms on the 5th floor with balconys. The views were spectacular. She had a view of the homes on the hillsides and I had a view of downtown San Diego in the distance. It was an average room with a small desk and a refrigerator under the TV. We didn't realize there was a fridge until the morning we were leaving, otherwise I would have brought some water to keep chilled. The room comes with a coffee maker, sub-standard coffee, hair dryer and an iron & ironing board in the small closet. There wasn't anything spectacular about the room, but nothing terrible either. I only have two minor complaints. 1: the air vent was constantly rattling and I couldn't sleep the first night. I didn't even have the fan or air on so I don't know what that was about. 2: the TV never had a clear picture regardless of the channel. My colleague's TV was fuzzy also (like reception with the old rabbit ears), so it must have just been the way the whole hotel gets their TV. There was a shuttle to the nearby airport, but I never took it as we drove from LA. Parking at the Holiday Inn is free, so that was nice compared to other hotels in the city. Even though the hotel is near the airport, I never heard any planes, so I don't believe they fly over the hotel. The convention center is 4.5 miles away and costs $10 to park there. Beware, you can't exit and return to the convention center without paying again. You pay every time you enter, so you can't eave for the day and return without paying another $10.

There is also a KFC - but I would not recommend it (it was dirty and they seemed to not know what they were doing). There is also a nice restaurant at the hotel, Point Loma Cafe. The hotel offers complimentary airport transportation and wi-fi as well as a pool and hot tub. The room itself was comfortable and the pillows were great.

I was checking in at the front desk and was told I'd been allocated a non-smoking room as my preference hadn't been passed on by my travel agent at which point I thought karma was biting back. The man on the desk was extremely helpful and switched me to a smoking room with no trouble at all and when I explained that my suitcase would possibly be delivered to the hotel that night again there was no problem and he said they would call if this happened. I got to my room which was good sized, very clean, and the bed was heavenly, fantastic memory foam mattress and they do indeed give you a range of pillows to choose from - for the sleep deprived this was a gift from the gods. Fell into such a deep sleep that when I woke in the morning I realised I had missed a call - woohoo my suitcase was here. Went to the front desk to collect the case and to put my passport and what not in the safe, couldn't have asked for more friendly and helpful assistance. The Point Loma Cafe was my next stop for breakfast - All the people there are fantastic, everyone is quick with a smile and extremely efficient. The French Toast is to die for and ended up being my only brekkie choice, portions are large and things are extremely well priced. Used it a couple of times for dinner both for sitting in and room service - for a picky eater like me this is indeed high praise. A huge thank you to everyone in the Point Loma Cafe for their contribution to my fantastic mornings. I used the free internet access regularly and didn't experience any problems accessing or lagging when I was online and I was using it from my room, the cafe, car park, etc. There were several sections of the car park, all of which were spacious and well lit so although female and travelling alone I wasn't wary of parking and walking to my room, I even got a call one night from security to let me know I had left on my interior light, I can only imagine my face if they hadn't contacted me and I had a flat battery the next morning. I booked this hotel due to its proximity to the Zoo and Sea World and I wasn't disappointed, it took less than ten minutes to drive to either from the hotel. I was delighted that I could opt into the good housekeeping scheme and leave a card on the bed to say that I didn't need my bedding or towels changed every night, this is a great scheme but I was happy that it was optional and there was no pressure to participate. If you are staying here and have the chance I would also recommend Seaport Village which is just along the beautiful harbor drive, less than a ten minute drive, and the Seal Tour on their Amphibious Bus is great fun. Would I go back here? In a heartbeat. I think people sometimes underestimate the value of fantastic staff and here I didn't meet anyone who wouldn't merit the full 5 stars. I have to say though that Carlos in the Cafe gets an extra special star because he was so pleasant and remembered what I had the day before which amazed me.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular View\u201d", "Author": "RobbieL", "ReviewID": "UR50009419", "Content": "I was on a one-night business trip and fell in love with this hotel.

We were given what I assumed to be a premium room on the fourth floor of the tower building although being on the other side of the hallway and having a bay view instead of seeing the parking lot would have been nice. We only ate breadfast in the hotel as our days were busy and found it to be better than most Holiday Inn Restaurants. Overall we had a pleasant experience with the hotel. The housekeeping staff seemed to be very limited in their ability to converse in English, about equal to my command of Spanish but we managed to make ourselves understood. The only concern and aggrevation I had was our neighbors across the hall. There were people in and out of the room continuously all night long each of the three nights we stayed there and they did not seem to care how many times the door slammed. Daytimes a Do Not Disturb sign hung on the door. (Yes I was tempted) Nocturnal activity of this type in a hotel normally leads me to believe that there may be some sort of illegal activities occuring.

The hotel is located in Point Loma which is on the other side of the airport but is a quiet area with no charges for parking (a HUGE bonus for this area).

They have fish, clams, shrimp, crab, calamari, etc., of which you can have in a sandwich, on a platter, in a salad, or in a taco, with sides of fried, onion rings, cole slaw, etc. Had the Boston chowder in a breadbowl for lunch, then walked back for a calamari plate dinner. Fresh, tender calamari strips were delicious! And, for less than $9.00, a great deal! Had I known this was so close, I would have come the previous day and tried more on the menu.
