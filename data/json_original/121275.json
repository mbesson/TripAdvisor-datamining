I should have known that the pictures were way more deceiving at the price we got our two queen bed room ($89 +tax). We did get a standard room, but based on the pictures provided I guess I was just expecting a bit more especially because WE got a room with a \"jetted whirlpool tub!\" -- woo. First of all the TV is probably the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel room (not that EVERYONE looks at that) but the pics of ALL the rooms on the website that you see the TV have nice sized flat screens. Then in the bathroom the soaps were dirty, like they were left over and not even wiped off. Gross!! The drapes in our room were broken, so you couldn't close them all the way. The pool was closed for a portion of the night but did reopen. (And is WAY smaller in person) The restaurants food is NOT that great, but is cheap. (now we know why, esp since both my husband and I ended up in the bathroom later afterward, if you know what I mean) and to top it off, the ice machine didn't work on the 4th floor, so walked down to the 3rd only to discover there isn't one down there, so just skipped 2nd pretty much expecting there to at least be one on the 1st (because if there wasn't I was going to start to complain!). All in all I guess it could have been worse since this WAS a last minute reservation. Now I know why they had vacancies as opposed to the competition. It is in a decent area, but there are others (Radisson, Clarion...) that are in better areas, and those are more expensive (I think, otherwise I might cry) so in this case just know you get what you pay for.

It has now been several years due to my mom's health. She wanted to visit Branson one more time. Reading all of the reviews, I almost picked out another hotel because we needed a nice place with no issues. I'm not sure where most of these negative reviews are from, but I'm guessing they don't travel much. If they do, I'm guessing they have negative reviews about everything. Here is an honest review (because we don't have a dog in this race, nor any conspiracy theory about who really writes reviews). I used booking.com to reserve a room with 2 queens and a jetted tub, at a great price. When we arrived at 4:00, the front desk was very pleasant and helpful, and we were given the exact room we booked and the price we booked it for. It was in the main lodge on the 4th floor. The lodge was warm and welcoming, with a delightful decor. We took our bags up on the luggage cart, and I was prepared for issues (based on the prior reviews). Our room was fine. No, it did not look like the photo of the suite, but we did not pay for a suite. A large clean bathroom with a huge jetted tub, two queen sized beds with clean white linens on each. Moderate sized room with a window overlooking the courtyard. Everything worked fine. Yes, the TV was old and small. We did not go to Branson to watch TV, so this was fine. During our trip, we had daily housekeeping service. In fact, Lodge of the Ozarks hires some folks with special needs to assist with housekeeping duties. We love this!!! No, our room did not get vacuumed and mopped daily. Does your house? It was not necessary, we had the beds made and fresh towels and bathroom items. I guess we could have stayed at Lodge of the Four Seasons for 4x the price and had better service, but we were delighted with the level of service at this lodge. The pool was closed one day because a child threw up in it, and several families were making a big scene. My suggestion is to yell at the parents who let a sick child in the pool instead of the folks who were working hard to clean and sanitize the pool. It was opened again by 8:00pm and the kids had a blast. Be sure to stop in the gift shop with any questions on where to go and how to get there. The lady who works there knows all of the backroads and got me to the best outlet mall in 4 minutes avoiding 76 highway. I plan to come back and do all of my Christmas shopping at that mall (Coach Outlet, woo hoo), and will certainly stay here again. So convenient, clean and helpful. Oh, some folks even complained about the free breakfast buffet. Really? Feel free to go pay $10 at IHOP right down the street. We enjoyed the buffet daily, and there were different items each day. 4 choices of entrees. Did I mention it was free? The Club where it is served is beautiful and seats many people. Yep, it is true that they don't change the tablecloth after each group eats breakfast. Not sure why this is a deal breaker for some...but breakfast was really good. Did I mention free? Location was fantastic. We walked to White Water, Jim Stafford, go carts, mini golf, Mickey Gilley and ice cream. Easy trip out to get to Silver Dollar City. Best Branson Show ever was Eagles Tribute at God and Country Theatre. Great show for a fabulous price. We did not eat at the hotel (Mel's Hard Luck Diner is our favorite) but did have a couple of drinks at the bar. $2 large Bud Light and nice company. This hotel was great, I would rank it 4 stars (remember, you are in Branson, not Las Vegas) at a great bargain price.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ingleside, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cClean and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "depositless", "ReviewID": "UR136429849", "Content": "My room was clean and comfortable.

Our families were treated very nice and we got great reviews of the hotel on our conference reviews. One thing people kept noting was that the hotel was more family oriented. With bigger conferences, sometimes the hotel is so pristine and cold that you don't feel comfortable with families.

The Lobby is nice and spacious, but that is where it stopped. The pool water was cloudy and had some sort of white film on top of it. There seemed to be plenty of chlorine, based on the smell. Our room was on the 3rd floor, overlooking the indoor pool. The pool stays open till midnight, and every night there were a host of children playing and squeeling past the midnight cutoff time. There were also noises of other people walking up and down the hallways and slamming their doors until the wee hours of the morning. The maid staff had to be asked to service our room after the third day, (ignoring the \"service please\" sign) and the staff told us they usually don't service rooms that are staying over. She did service the room, make up the bed and bring fresh towels after being asked to do so. The room was comfortable and seemed to be clean enough. Our room was a king size bed and had an iron, hair dryer, microwave, coffee pot, and refrigerator. It also had a jacuzzi bath tub/shower. The interesting thing is there was an envelope asking for a tip for the maid staff when we arrived in the room. Check in time is 3pm, and they adhere to this pretty strictly. Find something else to do until 3pm if you arrive into town earlier. Check out time is 11am, which is early since you have been kept up by screaming kids in the pool till after midnight. The breakfast we ate at the attached diner was adequate and filling, but the one supper meal we ate there left a good deal to desired.

The room was furnished with a microwave, small fridge and bar sink. The room always felt dark regardless of how many lights you turned on or how far you opened the curtains. The room was a little dated and they tried to give it the 'Lodge' feeling. There was a whirlpool tub in the bath however I never use them when I travel.

The only reason I am writing this review is to save my fellow travelers the pain and frustration of a ruined vacation. I will try my best to be objective and state some of the concerns I have: We went to the Lodge of the Ozarks because we had purchased a Groupon. When we went there it seemed like we were treated like second grade citizens because we did not pay the full price, They did not honor the groupon cash they gave us (we lost about $50 worth as they did not ho nor the Groupons). Their toilets would leak creating moist floors in the bath. It was smelly. They did not change the towels or vacuum the floors. We had to ask twice in our five night stay for them to come back and redo (the janitors were very nice). The breakfast was also very low quality. The eggs were made of something with preservatives. They tasted very bad. Their restaurants did not have any set times. They closed at random hours. When we asked about the closing times, three different waiters gave us three different times. We were told the restaurant closes at 4 on Sunday, we went to eat at 2 and were told that they were closed.The groupon cash that we used was not honored by the hotel staff. All in all, it was such a frustrating experience. We vacation once a year and were really looking forward to some time off. But, the callousness and unprofessionallism of the hotel staff along with unclean rooms really ruined it for us. I hope that you will be saved of the trouble. I do not wish any one ill, but I truly hope they understand that we spend our hard earned money on our vacations and we deserve a good hotel.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leawood, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cDo they own a vacuum?\u201d", "Author": "traveler8658", "ReviewID": "UR135821578", "Content": "Booked a last minute trip on Expedia and as earlier comments have said, you are shunned for using travel websites to book a room here. We were put in one of the older rooms that has not been updated. Apparently there are some newer rooms and some older rooms. We asked about being moved to a newer room and were told to check back later. Checked back later and were then told to check back in the morning. Basically it seemed like we were being pushed off as a problem from one shift to the next because they didn't want to deal with the issue. I saw plenty of people checking out the next morning, yet none of the newer rooms were available. I feel like they could have accomodated us and let someone who checked in late take the older room, however we had booked through Expedia so I think they save the nicer rooms for people who book direct through the hotel website. The hallways have not seen a vacuum in weeks. In the photos, there is a toothpick and other debris on the floor that was there from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning. It wasn't an isolated problem either because we parked at a few different entrances and walked many sections of hallway. I could have attached dozens of photos of debris in the hallways. The elevator was even worse. For goodness sake people, run a vacuum down the hall! Have you ever heard of steam cleaning carpets? Also, the bannister on the stairs was covered in dust from top to bottom, even at the ground floor. I could understand the very top landing, but failing to clean down at the lobby is awful. The toiletries they provide and very low quality, low end products. Be aware, your room is not cleaned on a daily basis, only when you check out is it cleaned for the next guest (you hope). I saw the housekeeping manager in the hallway one morning staring into a dirty room trying to figure out how it did not get cleaned the day before. Breakfast buffet was nice except there is one lady to service 100's of guests for 3 hours. As a result, on our first morning they ran out of plates and knives. There was one pitcher of water and that didn't last very long with a few hundred people. They also ran out of clean tables due to a large group, but also because there was only one attendant servicing the whole thing. On day 2 they still did not have any knives plus they ran out of orange juice and pastries. When someone from the kitchen brought out more orange juice, they poured it from a large bucket into the serving unit. It was apparently from a concentrated mix because as he poured, a giant solid clump came out of the bottom. So it wasn't mixed correctly and tasted watered down for me. Whoever got the clumpy part got some surprise. We returned to the hotel late on Saturday night and had to park in back. All doors were locked and there is no card access system. I had to drive back to the front, go inside, and ask to have a door unlocked. Then drove back around to a parking space and came into the building. Had I not done this, I would have to walk from around the back of the building to the front door which might be as much as 1/4 mile. No big deal for me (although I was tired), however I could see some having a big problem with this. In our dated room, the shower handle have several pieces of plastic broken off of it. The furniture was beat up and the beds not very comfortable. I attached a picture of the ice machine, however you can't see it because it is blocked by a door so there was not way to get ice. There are fire doors at the end of the hallway and they are locked open and can only be released and closed by employees. Thus, when the door is open, which is most of the time, you can't reach the ice machine because it is strategically placed directly behing the open door. I attached a picture. This is clearly a hotel on the decline and not worth the cost of $100+ per night. Its more like a $60-70 room. Either they can't find people to work here which is possible, or they are pulling every penny out of the property in profits. They need far more housekeeping help, far more restaurant/buffet help, and a working vacuum. The employees we spoke with were nice, its just not a well run operation. I agree with earlier reviews which suspect employees of writing the favorable reviews. I saw nothing favorable here. I would replace the head of housekeeping immediately if I had any say in it. Its a shame because it could really be a nice place. I will definitely not return and will try someplace else next time.

The beds were old, really old and the room smelled so musty! I honestly couldn't believe it! I had my husband call down immediatly because I truly thought there had been a mistake! They asked him to come to the front desk so he did. He was told that the reason we rented an older room was because we had booked through a booking site! We told him that the site did not state there were \"old\" rooms. He told us that half the hotel has not been remodeled and that if you book through a site like travelocity you WILL be booked in the older part! We were going to leave...that is how bad the room was. He agreed to give us a newer room...after about 20 min. We moved rooms only to find the next one had it's own set of problems! Room 2...Walked in and it looked better. Not great and still out dated a bit even though it was supposed to be a newer room. Started to settle in and saw a horriable spot on the carpet beside the bed. It looked like someone had puked on it. The spot was all over the carpet and up the wall...still wet! Upon better inspection by my husband he noticed it looked like a water leak and he also saw black mold!!!! Sure enough the jacuzzi had been leaking through the wall. We called the front desk again and they said we couldn't stay in that room because of the mold...thank God!!! They said they couldn't find another room liked the one we had booked...double queen with jacuzzi tub. We told them we would take a normal double queen or anything they had because at this point we had been trying to get settled in for an hour!! Finally we got our 3rd room! This room was nicer but still very plain! For a room that is usually over $100 I would have expected alot more and had I paid that price I would have been really upset! This hotel is in major need of something...better management, better housekeeping, better maintence, better breakfast! They need a complete overhaul! I would not recommend this hotel at all! After all that trouble the staff were nice but they were not overly sorry. Really I would have thought if someone had that much trouble they would have said sorry and at least acted like they cared.

We travel to the Branson area often and typically stay in a condo but have thought several times about staying at Lodge of the Ozarks. What a huge mistake! At first the only thing going for them was the friendly staff which I have since changed my opinion. The room did not look like any of the pictures that we saw on line. The air conditioning was turned off in the room and the curtains were open with the sun beaming into the room. Why would you do that in June on a very hot day! It took a long time for the room to finally cool down. The beds are extra hard, do not move at all when you sit down. Shower head in bathroom is very low, we had to bend down to wash hair. There was a chair at what I guess is like a vanity, the chair looked like it was from a restaurant, a very old restaurant. No towels at the pool. No safety latch on the doors, so anyone could walk in or a child could open the door and walk out. We ordered food from the restaurant and it took them over an hour and a half (no room service). They said they only had 2 people working. Who does that on a Saturday night in June in Branson that does not make sense to me! The person that checked us in was very pleasant. Although she said she needed our car tag number sometime before we left. When I checked out they were confused as to why she had needed it and did not take it. I told the lady at check out we were not happy, she said sorry here is a comment card. I filled out the card and gave it to her. Now our card has been charged 30 dollars too much! They said, oh it is an incidental fee it should come off. They never told us anything about an incidental fee and the bank said it came through as a charge not a hold or authorization. I ask that they get the card I filled out and add some tongs to it. The girl on the phone came back after 10 minutes and said that the person who had them was in a meeting. I have ask that he calls me back with the card. We will see! Would not stay again! Oh and breakfast, it was included but not the food was not good. All the tables were dirty and we ask About a clean table. The waitress said oh we do not change the linens until after breakfast.

My kids usually end up freezing and doing the lip quiver but not here. We had quite a few kids in our group and the staff was very patient and helpful. They even gave them a special treat that the kids appreciated. The manager Robin was genuinely kind and helpful. I can tell that she is passionate about hospitality and worked endlessly to make our stay feel like a true vacation from the regular worries of life. I had a light bulb go out during my 4 day stay and maintenance was there to replace it within 5 minutes of my call.

Upon arriving at the 3pm ckin time, our party of 3 with 2 rooms, found that our reservation had been cancelled. The front desk was manned with 1 young woman, who could not find our reservation by name. Several min later, once we provided her with our confirmation numbers, she was able to pull it up by those numbers, and found that our reservation had been cancelled at 3:40AM that very morning. We had made the reservation six weeks prior, and had confirmed again 2 days prior. Once she realized that we were not taking \"no reservation!\" for an answer and that we intended to get our rooms, she proceeded to request a manager to help us. All the managers were in a mtg, 1 person at the front, and she had 2 large groups cking into the hotel, too. After waiting at least half an hour for a mgr to appear, and explaining our story no less than 3x, we received attention from a couple of mgrs. We were asked to go have lunch in the hotel restaurant, and was shown to the \"manager's table\" for lunch (that was funny since it was just a table in the corner in an almost empty restaurant in the middle of the afternoon). One hour and 45 min after arriving, we were able to ck in. The mgr brought us our room numbers while we were dining (at OUR expense), and assured us all was taken care of. As we returned to the front desk, again, another young woman could not locate the reservation, and had to call a mgr for clarification and to release those rooms to us. As requested in the original reservation, and again, upon cking in the first time, our rooms were supposed to be adjoining. They were not. We remained in them and didn't say anything, as it was not worth it. The entire stay was riddled with bad service, including bartenders who could not mix simple drinks without a recipe, not being able to make any coffee drinks or ice cream drinks on the bar menu (practically half the menu), because the restaurant was closed late at night. The third morning we even gave up trying to eat the free breakfast at the hotel, because the VERY large groups staying there as well, were dominating the breakfast room for over 2 hrs. Long lines, constantly running out of coffee, difficulty getting around people and getting a table, and the staff coming through twice with large tables to set up a room, made it impossible for anyone BUT those groups to enjoy breakfast. WHY in the world didn't they put those folks somewhere else for breakfast, so regular non-group guests could manuever thru the area??? While the rooms were clean and comfortable, one of our rooms had a toilet leak we advised them of twice, and the other room had a non-brand TV and remote, that required standing in front of the tv to use (you could NOT use it from the bed). I am sure that we paid at least $20 per night more than the groups that stayed there and received TERRIBLE service because this hotel does not have the intelligence working for them to know what good customer service is and is clearly not equipped to handle large groups. We were VERY unhappy with our stay! On a good note, the sales mgr, a pleasant, smiling, energetic young woman, spoke to us and served us at the Dixie Stampede, and was so nice and offered SUPERB service there...too bad she works for a hotel that she needs to bring up to the same level of service. The gentleman manager that helped us at the hotel, could have offered to pay for our lunch, after our long wait at checkin.

A complimentary continental breakfast is included in the price of your stay. The breakfast lacked a lot in imagination. Apples and oranges were available on the breakfast. What is it about bananas at Branson? A banana on my cereal would have been nice. There is a wide variety of entertainment within easy walking distance of the hotel. The Hughes Brothers and Mickey Gilley's Theater were on either side of the Lodge. The Jim Stafford Theater and the Dutton's Theater are both directly across the street. The hotel is undergoing extensive renovation, so be prepared to be slightly inconvenienced during your stay. But the workmen are very polite and try to minimize disruption. I still haven't figured out if this hotel is pet friendly or not.
