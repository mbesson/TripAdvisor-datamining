It was centrally located in the Old City, and less than a 5 minute walk to the Hagia Sophia and a lot of other sites, 10 minutes to the Bazaar, and easily accessible by tram to anywhere else including Taksim. If you take a taxi, be sure to say Biz Cevahir in Sultanahmet (Old City) next to the Four Seasons Hotel. We were taken to another hotel called Grand Cevahir once and it cost us! Our room was very clean with modern decor, and nice sheets on the bed. Although the mattress itself was a little hard. Overall, it was a great value for a very nice hotel!", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201ceast meets west at this charming hotel\u201d", "Author": "monsita1910", "ReviewID": "UR109511991", "Content": "if you want to stay in an architectural gem, then biz cevahir is it. it is sheer pleasure just to be in this boutique hotel where modern architecture is met by ottoman details. it is comfortable, best location, walking distance to everything, professional attention, impeccable service, and did i mention gorgeous place and a great value for the money. i certainly recommend it and will stay there any time i am back in istanbul, which by the way, is an amazing city. monsita1910", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glendale Heights, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBiz Cevahir - A great experience\u201d", "Author": "Rizza36", "ReviewID": "UR105090637", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from Istanbul and a week long stay at the Biz Cevahir. I must say we were very please with the hotel, the staff and the amenities. I will give a quick breakdown of what we loved about the hotel. Location - The drive in from the airport (which was also arranged by the Biz) was excellent, great service, spacious car and comfortable ride. Driving through the neighborhood on our initial trip in was probably one of the best experiences. The sun was setting over the blue mosque and the neighborhood was just so charming with the little shops and restaurants. Upon check in Serkan was very polite and welcomed us and our baggage was taken to our room (room 134 with terrace and great view of blue mosque) The hotel is located very nicely, walking distance to Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, Topkapi Palace and the tram. There is no shortage of restaurants and cafes as well as the arasta bazaar (buy your souveneirs here not Grand Bazaar!) . The room itself was quit comfortable, good closet space, mini bar, nice safe to lock valuables, bathroom and shower were nice and clean. Loved the waterfall showerhead. The Biz Cevahir is very modern and it is a beautiful boutique hotel. Wifi was always great, breakfast was always good as well, plenty of food and great orange juice! Elevator was never a problem. Overall I must say we are very pleased with this hotel and if we ever return to Turkey we will be sure to stay here again as well as send our friends and family. Lastly, I know there is no shortage of hotels in Istanbul that offer the same amenities. Trust me when I stay the staff here makes a huge difference. Serkan and Yesar and the other young lady (sorry I forgot her name!) went out of there way to help us plan trips and tours. They told us what to see and how to get there and most importantly they were very welcoming and we were able to joke around with them and have a good time. My wife and I we're very sad leaving this morning as we had grown to love this place in only a week. Luckily we were able to snap a picture with Serkan for our photo album. Don't hesitate with the shortage of reviews, trust me this hotel will make your trip!", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cAmazed by this hotel.
