I booked it for my boyfriend as a surprise for his 30th birthday. Like a lot of the reviews we thought the location of this hotel was excellent but thats about it. On arrival we checked in and was told our room was not in the main hotel but in a building on the opposite side of the road, this particular building was awful, you entered through a little banged up side door, the bottom half on the building was boarded up, the stairs are dangerous- not good first impressions!! The room itself was basic and dirty, we had a double room with private bathroom, the double bed is actually two singles pushed together, the only half decent thing about the room was the space. I have to say when walking out of this building and onto the street we actually felt embarrassed that we were staying there. In the end we complained and the staff agreed to move us into a room in the main hotel building, this room was much nicer with a view of the canal but still very basic and a little dirty. I paid 180euros for our 2 night stay, I went with low expectations of this hotel and thought it would be adequate for our needs however, I was surprised that it was even worse than I was expecting. My advise to anyone thinking of booking this hotel is -Dont do it! pay the extra 100euros and get youself booked into the Ibis, however if you do decide to stay here make sure you ask for a room in the main hotel and dont expect much!!", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBed Bug Russian Roulette!\u201d", "Author": "John9991", "ReviewID": "UR125815960", "Content": "Myself and friends stayed here.

It's a bar that lets out the rooms on the floors above or, in our case, provided a room above a closed down bar directly opposite - the formerly named Hotel Harbour (graded as one star, although the rooms above number 22 are graded as two). Located at the North end of Warmoestraat, about five minutes walk from Amsterdam Central Railway station. It's smack in the Bohemian quarter of old Amsterdam and amongst a vast array of dope cafes, bars, sex shops, eateries and other retail outlets - an epicentre for young, hedonistic visitors to the city. Our room? Basic but generally clean. The ensuite was fully functional with plenty of hot water and had been cleaned prior to our arrival - the exception was the floor which was minging and hadn't seen a scrubbing brush in many months. What was a pleasant surpise was that we could receive BBC worldwide on the 14\" CRT TV in our room. We didn't suffer any of the bed-bug problems that many other contributors report. The included breakfast? The Old Quarter offers a full English at EURO 7.00, and this is offered to guests at a EURO 5.00 per person supplement. If, as we did, you decide to stick with the \"basic\" it's two eggs, bacon, toast and coffee/tea. It filled the early morning gap, but a little more TLC in the kitchen wouldn't go astray (and that's not just our's but other full English's we saw being served a well). In a similar vein, there was also the attitude of one particular young lady who covered the morning shift behind the bar there - watching how she dealt with a minor complaint from a guest when we were having breakfast was priceless entertainment to start the day with. So, EURO 80.00 a night for a twin - value for money? The Netherlands is an expensive place to visit, and Amsterdam probably tops the league table of Dutch cities (my wife and I visited four during our time there). You won't find too much at lower cost in the city centre, and if you want to stay in amongst all of the action, I suspect this place is probably as good as anywhere else - if you don't expect too much beyond a clean bed for the night and hot and cold running water you won't be disappointed. If you want to stay in a hotel then you need to look elsewhere, but you will pay for it - at the time of writing, the three star hotel two minutes walk away in Warmoestraat was charging EURO 229.00 per night for a twin.

It was one room with about 8-10 twin size cots. It looked like somewhere you'd stay in sleep over camp minus the sounds of crackling fires and crickets... instead we were serenaded by the sounds of loud drunks and a noisy bar across the street. The shower in the room overflowed and flooded entire bathroom every time. We were told by the staff that this happens everywhere in Amsterdam which was not the case as we asked several locals for confirmation. The bathroom also had a window that was directly across from a large balcony (I think it may have been part of a restaurant or bar) that looked directly into our bathroom. No big deal... except our bathroom did not have any shades or curtains. We ended up rigging up makeshift curtains using towels. The only good thing about this hotel was the location. It was located basically in the red light district and was close to everything. Granted it was probably not the safest location but we were traveling in a group of 4 and felt relatively safe. Oh and the free breakfast consisted of an egg/toast/tea/coffee every morning.

It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a difference. We could have slept on the pavement and the noise level would have been the same. The free breakfast consisted of eggs with bacon, toast, butter, jam and coffee or tea. A full English breakfast with beans etc. was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 5, and a tiny glass of orange juice was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 3 extra. What a rip-off! The organisation was really poor, I had the impression that the waitresses didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what they were doing. As we are both vegetarians we ordered the egg without the bacon. There was no problem on the first day, but on the second day we had to wait a very long time. When my boyfriend politely asked a waitress she just ignored him, and when I asked her a few minutes later she replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It takes longer without the bacon!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duh. Worst excuse I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever heard. After 30 minutes and a few more inquiries we finally got our toast, jam and eggs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with bacon!! I had to complain again and after a total 35 minutes (my coffee was cold by then), I finally got an egg without bacon. Afterwards we complained to the hotel manager who was very friendly and apologised for the inconvenience and promised us some extras. The next day we got cheese, milk and orange juice for free. At least something. Still, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this sorry excuse of a hotel to anybody.

Breakfast was 'included' but only if you wanted the 'bacon and eggs' (I don't touch eggs), which turned out to be an omelette. The 'full English' was 4.50 euros and orange juice another 2.25.

Other than that Its a grand place.", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Studley", "Title": "\u201cIdeal cheap accommodation in the heart of tourist Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "Thackeray", "ReviewID": "UR3368853", "Content": "Ideal cheap accommodation if you want a hotel rather than hostel for one or two nights in the heart of tourist Amsterdam.

After reading other reviews on this website, it strikes me that a few other travellers expected a bit more than what was offered at this budget hotel. The location is great and very close to the red light district (but not so close it's dodgy) and it's well within the tourist hub of the city while close to the shopping and more upscale neighborhoods. Both times I stayed at this hotel I requested a canal view over the Damrak and was quite pleased with it (both times). The only downside is the price - the place feels like a hostel with a REALLY good view but is priced more like a hotel. Still, get an open window view over the canal and Damrak and you will never complain.", "Date": "March 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cSleepless in the Old Quarter\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3261019", "Content": "Make sure that you are away from the front of the building, the noise from the bar and the street is horrendous if you like to sleep.
