From this station you can reach easily every corner of the city and especially the city centre (10-15 min) with buses and subways. It is also true that from this Hotel you can walk to the Spanish steps in 25-30min. The owners are really friendly and always helpful in suggesting what to see, where to eat and shop in Rome. Our room was comfortable and recently renewed. It was clean, had air condition and free internet. In addition, this Hotel offers a big buffet breakfast, with a lot of choices of bread, egg, ham and cheese among others food type. We booked through internet and we got a fair price for our stay during the Easter week-end.

Arriving after midnight, I was given a small back bedroom on the second floor, a floor which has obviously been subdivided with dropped ceilings, etc, to create a small number of large rooms, and a large number of small ones... Decor in the hotel is neutral/bland ('recently decorated', it says somewhere). The outside is a hymn to light brown paint, already peeling in the sun; the ground floor is okay, but there were mildew patches appearing on my bedroom wallpaper from the internal bathroom (positively the smallest bathroom I've ever been in). Bedroom contents: two single beds pushed together as a double (at 6'0\", I tend to need something longer or end up sleeping at an angle); wardrobe of the undersized modern rickety school of design, but with hangers provided and a room safe that was replaced when the previous one failed to work. TV (Italian stations only) on a small desk (so therefore no room to use to desk), side chair, a bedside table nearing the end of its life, bedside lamp, phone. Plugs worked (helpful when you need to recharge a laptop). The air conditioning, left on all day, kept the temperature down and was quieter than in some 5 star hotels I've stayed in. Noisy floorboards in the room sounded ominous, but I didn't hear anything from the rooms on either side or upstairs, and street noise (apart from the occasional siren) was limited. The bathroom: shower (lots of hot water at good pressure), sink and WC. The WC's the most inconvenient part of the set-up, crammed between the sink and the shower. Another foot or so both ways would have helped. There are other and larger WCs on the ground floor. Overall: it just about worked for one person, but you wouldn't want to have two people in that room for any sustained period of time (then again, this is a hotel for people to sleep in, not to live in). Linen rather than terry towels: weird to begin with, but probably better given the humidity and replaced daily. The lift is tiny (but works fine), so you might as well take the stairs up and down unless you're carrying luggage. Receptionist English varies with the receptionist, but was adequate: an incoming message was passed on promptly and outgoing phone calls went through okay. Breakfast (perfectly adequate for setting you up for the day) is in a basement area with a slight smell of damp even in summer: suggest you ask for a tray to take into the garden instead. I didn't use the evening bar facilities. Location: Termini's not an area you're going to stroll through for a romantic evening, though I had a good quality, inexpensive meal in the trattoria just up the street and there are several of them around (Forget staying in a cheap hotel and eating in posh restaurants: the food I had locally was as good as anything I had elsewhere). But Termini is Termini: like most major rail stations, it attracts the good and bad, but it's definitely the best place to start visiting the city from (convenient for the Leonardo Express to and from Fiumicino, for the 110 city bus tour, for all the other buses, taxis and both Metro lines). And the new shopping centre at the station has great bookshops (there's also a string of secondhand bookstalls in the neighbouring piazza). Generally, the Delle Rose is a hotel that feels like it needs a good shake-up and some TLC to turn it into something better, with fewer small rooms. It \"has been\" a good hotel, according to friends in the Italian hotel industry, and it's probably not bad compared to others in the area, but the trick is obviously to ask for one of the larger rooms (there are a couple with a balcony), though I don't think the bathrooms get much bigger!
