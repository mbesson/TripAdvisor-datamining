Fantastic location in the beautiful Hackescher Markt (loads of shops, boutiques, restaurants and cafes) as well as being really close to the S Bahn station and bus stops. 5-10 minute walk to museum island, 20-30 minute walk to the Brandenburg gate. The rooms are spacious and stylish, as well as extremely clean (the maid came every day whilst we were there.) The cocktail bar is also worth a visit - with happy hour between 5 and 7pm (cocktails are around 5 euro at this time) the cocktails are delicious!!

Easy walking or transit distance from the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie. Highly practical kitchen allowed us to have many meals in with foods bought within a few blocks of the hotel. Nice view of the tower. Only problems were the glacially slow wifi (free in the lobby only) and the shower, which seemed to pour more water out of the shower (which had no door, in keeping with many European hotels) than remained inside of it. It took all of our towels every day to sop up the spillage.

I am in the 55+ category. I arrived at the hotel after a 16-plus hour journey. I had purchased the business package prior to my arrival. It was morning when I arrived at the hotel, and I was starved. I was able to use one of my breakfast vouchers for my arrival day. Breakfast quickly became the high point of my day. Stephanie, one of the wait staff was superlative! She was always smiling, and by the end of my stay, she had my eggs on the table by the time I made my first pass through the buffet. The staff even offered to put together a bag breakfast for an impossibly early airport departure. Front desk staff was always helpful and very attentive. They helped with my sightseeing plans, giving me maps, making suggestions(which were spot on), and offering tips on the best forms of transportation to certain attractions. When I was able to secure an appointment for the Reichstag Builing, they were more than happy to print off my confirmation letter. I loved the fact that public transportation was a half-block away, and yet the room was soundproof, and I slept like I was in the countryside. There was a supermarket within walking distance for times when I wanted a little snack .English TV channels were adequate. I was concerned that the three hours daily internet access included in the business plan would not be enough, but I did what I needed to do, Skyped family, and still had time left over. I did use the hot tub. After a long day of walking, and climbing stairs, it was like heaven. My use of a bathing suit instantly branded me as a North American, but it turned out that I wasn't the only one. As far as the other services available, I returned to my room after the massage hours were over. I was too tired to use the exercise equipment. If/when i have the opportunity to return to Berlin, there is no other place that I would even consider staying at. For anyone planning a trip, I do suggest adding the Business Plan. Having the wireless internet in the room was well worth it, especially when you are deaing with significant time differences at home.

The Hotel itself does all the basic things well except that there is no concierge service (the front desk staff and a bartender named Andrew have occasionally provided me with concierge service during my week long stay but only if they were not otherwise occupied with their real jobs. It is hard to consider this hotel as a four star hotel as it has been rated without a proper concierge service. The service that I find the most disappointing, however, is the poor internet access. I was obligated to use the hotel internet in either their lobby or their bar in order to avoid additional charges which add approximately $15 to the daily room charge. I must admit that I am spoiled by the ubiquitous and inexpensive nature of internet in Canada. Most hotels provide internet service at no additional charge and few would expect their guests to use only the lobby or bar in order to receive free internet.

While we loved everything about the hotel concept, we were intrigued at the time to learn that a site near Hackescher Markt was in the works. When I returned to Berlin in December, 2011, we stayed at the Adina Hackescher Markt. As a result, I am bringing a group to stay later this week. The location is perfect. Most East Berlin tourist attractions are within walking distance. Because the hotel is a few steps from a S Bahn station, West Berlin tourist locations are easy to reach. Several walking tours start steps away from the hotel. The hotel is nearly perfect. The apartments have a spacious bathroom with washer and dryer, a compact but extremely well equipped kitchen, a living room space and bedroom. There is ample closet space. While the many restaurants in the area are exciting, it was also fun to have the options of the onsite restaurant, room service, and the facilities to cook! As noted by other reviewers, the fee based wifi was disappointing. Free wifi is available in the lobby via a coupon per device. When we ran into problems printing a confirmation for the Reichstag, the staff immediately assisted by letting us use the front desk printer. The hotel also provides a broader range of English language TV channels than many European hotels. In addition to the convenient transportation links, there is also a taxi rank near the hotel. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the Adina locations in Berlin but the Hackescher Markt location is my favorite. Strongly recommended.

It is hard to beat the location, the service was excellent and the room/apartment defintely exceeded expectations. It is hard to beat the location of this hotel. It is located literally 2 minutes walk for the Hackescher Markt S-bahn stations and is walking distance to many of the main sights: Alexanderplatz, the museum island (Bode Pergammon, etc), Unter Den Linden and much more. It was also a short train or bus ride to to many of the other main sights and places of interest in the city. We decided to take a day trip to Potsdam and were very pleased to discover that there are 6 direct trains an hour between Hackescher Markt and Potsdam! We booked a one bedroom apartment for a 4 night stay and chose the hotel based on the location, price and reviews on TripAdvisor. The bedroon and bathroom were large by many hotel standards and the lounge/kitchen/dinner was also spactious, well equiped and very modern. Everything still looked brand new! There was even a small balcony where we could enjoy the first rays of the morning sun with a view of the TV tower at Alexander platz. The apartment was equiped with a dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer, as well as the expected cooker, microwave oven, fridge and kettle. This made it ideal for a longer stay and we are considering coming back for exactly that. The bedroom had twin beds, but it was no problem to push them together for a it more comfort. There was also lots of hanging and storage space. The bathroom had a full bath, which was very much appreciated after a long day walking round the Sanssouci park at Potsdam! The staff were very friendly and helpfull, without overdoing it.The only (and admitedly small) gripe we had was that there was no free internet in the rooms. This was a little surprising, but did not detract from the quality of ths stay. Our only regret was that we did not have time to try out the pool and fitness centre in the basement!

TV with several English channels - BBC1, BBC3, Channel 4, Film4, E4, More4, Nickleodeon, CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg, BBC World News. Good sound-proofing, but even with the windows open at night, the noise from outside was okay because we were up high. Seemed smaller than the advertised 45m, but this was probably due to the extra balcony space, and we still had plenty of room. Pleasant lobby with comfortable seating and free wi-fi. Forgot to bring a swimsuit so can't comment on the jacuzzi in the wellness centre downstairs. Staff helpful and friendly. My husband has a bad back and found the living-area seating too low, so they accommodated him by bringing up one of the outdoor armchairs from the courtyard. They also went to some trouble to map out a public transport route for us to the Brucke Museum. Had a partial power-out one evening and the young man at reception came up, discovered a tripped switch in the fuse box and restored power straight away. The hotel's restaurant isn't half-bad either - comfortable, laid-back, slightly funky atmosphere. They do an appetizing Aussie burger for around \u20ac10. Location unbeatable. Cafes, restaurants, boutiques, speciality shops everywhere. Well-stocked supermarket (closed Sundays) a 2-minute walk away, and a very nice bakery/coffee shop (open 7 days) on the corner. Hackescher Hof Cinema (200m away) shows original version films only, and there are always one or two English-language ones on the programme if, like me, you don't speak German. Public transport links on the doorstep. S-bahn and tram lines are 100m away, and the No. 100 bus, which is a great route that runs along the east-west axis of the city and stops at a lot of the major sights, is 100m in the other direction.

The hotel is brand new, so everything is sparkling clean. Facilities are excellent, rooms are spacious and cozy ( we had an one apartment room), furnishings are nice and comfortable. The Apartment-hotel is very convenient for a family since the small kitchen with all appliances enabling us to prepare some fast meals, satisfying the kids\u2019 requirements. It is also convenient to have a washer/dryer in the room. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is superb, as Hackescher Markt S-Bahn station was across the street, and tram and bus stops were located a few steps further, making it very easy to get around town, although we did a fair share of walking along with the kids as main sights were nearby ( museum island, Fernsehturm, the red townhall, even Unter den Linten was within walking limits). Although we did our shopping at Ku\u2019damm, we realized afterwards, that Friedrichstrasse ( again not far from the Hotel), as well as shopping malls at Alexanderplatz would be another great options for shopping lovers. Gym and spa area were also very clean and relaxing after a long day sighseeing/ walking. As we didn\u2019t use the restaurant, we can\u2019t comment on that ( breakfast was rather pricey, so we opted for a non-inclusive breakfast stay). There were so many restaurants in the area, within walking distance, so finding a place for breakfast/ dinner was not an issue during our 5 nights stay. Wi-fi connection in the rooms was at a cost ( EUR 14 per 24 hours, quite pricey I could say). The time for the cleaning of the rooms was a thing that bothered us, since this took place on two at least two occasions, during our siesta, and we had to tell them that we didn't need the room cleaned.

We had two neighboring rooms. The hotel is very good in probably all aspects: The rooms are nice and spacious, with regular size table, small additional sofa, cooking facilities, regular fridge and micro wave. There are no connecting rooms, but this is probably because the hotel offers also regular flats (with 2-3 bedrooms I think). The bathroom also spacious. The service is responsive and attending. The decor is modern and simple, with australian references. For those who prefer hotels with the shine of marble and gold, it may be a disappointment, but we found it nice. The overall atmosphere is informal and casual. Pets allowed (I am unsure on what conditions, but saw several dogs). I also saw people taking their bikes to the rooms, which I found abit surprising at the first glance, but I guess this is fine. The hotel is very clean and well kept. I would recommend the hotel to the lightsleepers - I probably never before had a hotel room that was so silent. The aircon device working almost soundless, the door almost soundproof, the windows - although big and openable (good choice for the fresh air) - virtually allowing no sound from the outside. For those who prefer silence to the street view, I suggest you book the room facing the backyard (with the view of the office building there). The hotel has about 40% of such rooms, so there should be no problem with this choice if you tell them in advance. The room price is very reasonable, although breakfast not included. Breakfast in the hotel is costly (and served in rather limited restaurant/bar area, which makes the thing a bit disorganized when crowded), but there are at least four places within 150m from the hotel offering very good breakfasts for less than half of the hotel breakfast price. The uderground garage charge is also a bit expensive, but this is the only option to park your car in this part of the city. The location is excellent and I will not repeat the other reviews.

The we saw the sister hotel \"Adina Apartment Hotel Berlin Hackescher Markt\" that was recently open, had even more convenient prices and had also very good comments on Trip Advisor, so we changed our reservation. All the reasons why we didn't like it: - At arrival we saw that the black furniture of the kitchen as full of greasy fingerprints. - The second evening of our stay we came back just to know that there was no hot water on the hotel because of public works (subway, I understood) on the zone. The service should be restored on the \"evening\". By 9:00 P.M., the second time I called the reception to ask when would we be getting hot water (we don't know, was the answer) I suggested that we should get a discount for we were paying for a service that was not being fully provided. If they had a slight idea of what customer satisfaction is, they could have offered us a free dinner or free breakfast and we would not have felt so aggravated. But the answer was \"It's not the hotels problem, it's fault of the government of Berlin\". - Once we cambe back and found the dishwasher working. When it finished, I opened it to find that the dishes were dirty because they didn't out the soap tablet on the dishwasher. - The waste baskets were not emptied every day. - Internet service (wired) is EXPENSIVE (\u20ac14.50 for 24 hours) and it is terrible. We connected our laptop one evening and signed up for a 24 hour period. The next morning, we found that we had to sign up AGAIN for 24 hours! We must say that we spoke with the receptionist and cancelled one of the charges from our account. This happened three or four times during our stay. One evening we had to sign up three times because the service kept on being interrupted. It was another service that we paid for and that was correctly provided. - Bed covers: for some reason beyond my comprehension, on a double bed they use two single bed covers. Very uncomfortable. - Cleaning: the day we arrived we saw a moth of dust besides the bed. It stayed there during our stay and probably it's still there. Three evenings during our one week stay we came back to the hotel to find that the room hasn't been cleaned yet. One day we had to ask to the reception and they simply told us that the person in charge had too much work and that she FORGOT to clean our room. - While moving the cushions of the sofa I found bread crumbs, candy wraps and lots of hair below. Yuck! In all, after reading other comments on Trip Advisor we expected much more from the \"Adina Apartment Hotel Berlin Hackescher Markt\" and we feel terribily dissapointed.

It is only a 5 minute walk from Alexanderplatz train station and 5 minute walk from Museum Island were many of Berlins top musuems such as the Pergamon and the Neues. There are also lots of cafes and restaurants in the Hackescher Markt area. I stayed in a studio room and this was ideal for my needs. The room was bright and spacious, with big windows which let in a lot of sunlight. The kitchenette was to the left of the room door, and consisted of a fridge, microwave, dishwasher, kettle and cupboards containing glasses and crockery. Although I ate out most nights, I did find the fridge very useful for storing drinks and small snacks. The bed was big and comfortable with 2 single sized feather down duvets which were nice and warm. There were 2 pillows provided, however these were not quite to my personal preference as 1 was too firm and the other too soft. In the welcome book it does say that they have a pillow menu, so I could have asked for a different type if I had so wished. The bed linen was not changed during my 5 night stay, and while this did not bother me or my boyfriend as we don't change hte bed at home everynight, it could bother other people. However, it is stated that a daily linen change can be arranged if guests ask for it. The dining/sitting area was quite a reasonable size and consisted of a dining table with 2 chairs, coffee table, foot stool, TV area with ipod docking station and a small but comfortable couch. One of the reason why I decided to stay at this particular hotel, apart from price and location, was the fact that there was a seperate sitting area where I could relax after a day exploring rather than having to sit on the bed. The bathroom was very nice and spacious with good lighting. It had nice granite coloured tiles which gave it a very modern look. The shower itself was quite big compared to other hotels I have stayed in, with a big shower head. The glass door only covered half the shower, I never had any issues though with water splashing on the bathroom floor. I am very pleased that I stayed here. The hotel was in a great location, it was an ideal base for exploring Berlin but it was also in quite a quiet area - although this could change come summertime! The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was very comfortable. I would definately consider staying here again if I return to Berlin. The only real issue I had was that the rooms seemed to get cleaned quite late, there was one occassion when a cleaner came to clean our room at about 3.45pm and we told them we didn't need it cleaned as we had just got in after hours of walking and sightseeing and didn't want to go back out again!
