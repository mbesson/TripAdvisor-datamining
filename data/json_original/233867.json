Situated just 5 minutes stroll from Zoologischer Garten train station which gives you access to anywhere in Berlin and has a direct train link to the airport. The hotel itself is small and clean and the staff were superb on our visit and spoke excellent English. Breakfast included scrambled eggs, bacon, cold meats, cheeses as well as cereals and fruits etc. The rooms are comfortable and were cleaned daily. The room also has a free a safe and having free Wi-Fi in the hotel is another bonus. The hotel is located close to Savignyplatz which has a number of bars/cafes and restaurants and would recommend the Dicke Wirtin bar for the selection of beers and local pub food. Travel around Berlin is another bonus and would recommend purchasing the welcome card ticket which gives you access to trains, trams and buses and also gives you up to 25% discount at a number of attractions and restaurants. The hotel itself doesn't have its own restaurant but you can use the sister hotel's restaurant, Knese, where as a resident of Astoria you get 10% discount or 25% with the welcome card. We felt completely safe walking in this area at all times and that included coming in at 1am from a night out. We booked direct with the hotel via its website as they did a number of offers ie stay for 4 nights and pay for 3 so it only cost us 240 euros for the 4 nights including breakfast instead of 320 (approx \u00a3200). We will definitely come back here on a return visit to Berlin.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch\u201d", "Author": "sasquatch27", "ReviewID": "UR120825757", "Content": "The hotel Astoria is located just off of Kurfurstendam close to shopping and transit.

I'm pretty soft when it comes to rating hotels compared to most people, but the unusually persistent high review of this hotel seem way out of line to me. The facility is indeed reasonably well located near the central part of West Berlin, but the overally quality of the facility and the very obvious need for it to be remodeled and redecorated, seems to have escaped the notice of the average reviewer, and that just doesn't feel right to me. I've never, not once, made this claim before but it seems to me that the reviews of this facility may very well have been cooked. Obviously one should always view ratings (this one included) with a grain of salt because, with a little on-going effort, one could rather easily generate numerous good review to bury negative ones. I'm not a cynical person, but after giving the matter careful thought I decided to write this review a few minutes ago after reading in the New York Times that the going rate for writing a five star review is $5. In spite of its good location this hotel was in my opinion more of a two star facility badly in need of redecoration and updating. The elevator only stopped on half floors meaning that one always has to lug their luggage either up or down one flight of stairs. Our room was the European standard (a bit on the small side) and the bath room was especially small with a shower control overly intruding into the limited space within the shower stall. Most significantly, there is no air conditioning and the hotel location does not allow for good natural air flow. We were fortunately at the hotel during very mild weather but this could be a real problem when the weather is hot. The carpeting on the floors both in the hall and in our room was badly worn and somewhat stained and not particularly clean. Wood or stone or ceramic flooring rather than carpet are more standard flooring materials in European hotels. The breakfast buffet offered generous hours but the food was average at best. I've stayed in about ten other Berlin hotels and other than location would rate this hotel in the bottom 10% rather than the top 20% which seems to be to be the collective rating of this hotel on Trip Advisor, Expedia, and one other rating site I checked. In summary, call me nasty or just plain wrong, but if you book this hotel don't be surprised when you find that it simply does not live up to its reviews.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland, Espoo", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and value for money\u201d", "Author": "Founders81", "ReviewID": "UR114158050", "Content": "We stayed here with 3 of my friends and we had 4 person room.

I'd come straight from Bruges where I stayed in a much posher hotel, so maybe my expectations may have been set high, but found the Astoria to be, well, not so posh. Actually there's not much wrong with it, but it just doesn't shine. Mainly it's the room - a slightly odd shape (long and thin) due to its location at the end of a corridor, without much floor space to put a suitcase and - for me the worst bit - a thin cabin-style bed with only a single, thin duvet not much bigger than the proverbial postage stamp. Also no tea/coffee in the room, which I just sort of expect nowadays, unless you're in a real budget place (which I don't think this falls into). But there's a nice LCD TV in the room with BBC World and CNBC for English language, plus some clever internet facilities which I didn't use because I bought in-room wifi access (at 12 Euro for 24 hours - you can buy 2 hours for 10 Euro, but that's clearly not worth it, or I think it's cheaper for lobby access - but really there's not much space to sit down there!). Staff were friendly and helpful though, particularly the chap who checked me in on the evening I arrived, who was happy to chat over my free beer at the bar (which I got as I'd booked via their website). Location I'm not so sure about as I really didn't have much chance to explore Berlin while at the conference unfortunately - though I got the impression the tourist sights were a bus / underground ride away (e.g., Brandenburg Gate, East Berlin). There were good shopping centres around the hotel, and we also went to a really nice Vietnamese restaurant within walking distance. Also the Zoological Gardens underground station is within 5 mins walk - a major interchange for most of the underground lines. But the station area itself seems to be a bit of a dodgy place to hang around, particularly at night. Didn't see any trouble, but it felt a bit uncomfortable. Breakfast was nice enough - a few choices of cereal, fruits, yogurts, cold meats / cheeses, breads, and a hot platter with bacon, scrambled and boiled eggs. Certainly enough to fill up on. Like I said, it's been a good enough place to stay and I can't really complain, but if I were to come back I would like to try a different place - hence my \"no\" to the question about recommending to a friend.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Appleton, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "BuckyFriend", "ReviewID": "UR82959268", "Content": "Hotel Astoria had very comfortableroom accomodations and the breakfast room was well appointed and the breakfast served was delightful A great way to stay in the western part of Berlin and yet convenient to get to sight seeing and move about the city", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heidelberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cNot the best hotel I ever stayed at...\u201d", "Author": "RoamingAround", "ReviewID": "UR65961404", "Content": "The good: - The hotel is a pretty decent location next to Zoo Station.

It is literally only four minutes walk from Zoologischer Garten Train Station and about 8 minutes from Kurf\u00fcrstendamm or Uhlandstrasse Underground stations. Staff is very nice and helpful and we felt very welcome during our three-night stay. As a party of four we had two double rooms. Ours was on top floor (fifth) and the room was spacious and very clean, from the crisp bed linen to the shiny bathroom. There was plenty of room for suitcases and a well stocked mini-bar made it possible to chill our own wine. There was a large flat screen TV, a desk, a table and two chairs and still plenty of room to move around. The only minuses were: a) The right bed (there were two separate beds put together) creaked enormously and every time my husband turned there was a terrible noise. b) The window could only be opened very little. This was a bit disappointing since we enjoyed very high summer temperatures during our stay, and - being on the top floor - the room was very warm at bedtime. Air conditioning is available but costs 10 Euro/day. The other couples double room was slightly smaller than ours but instead had a larger bathroom with a bathtub. It also had a balcony which gave them a better chance to let in fresh air in a warm room. Breakfast was good and buffet style with coffee/tea, yoghurt, orange juice, boiled and scambled eggs, bacon, bread rolls, toast, cereals and fresh fruit. Very nice. In all a very nice and well located hotel. We had three lovely days in this wonderful city and will certainly return again.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely a hidden gem!\u201d", "Author": "FamilyWhoLoveTravel", "ReviewID": "UR27808076", "Content": "After reading reviews of the hotel on Tripadvisor, we decided to book the hotel for a 5 night stay for our family (2 adults and to children aged 11 and 14) through Expedia.

All our requirements were fulfilled by choosing the hotel - location was very central for both shopping and a central point for train, tram and busses. If you ask us, there's no need to pay for a \"hop on and off\" sightseeing tour as you will easily go by bus 100 and 200 as well. The room was big, nice furniture, lovely bathroom and best of all, everything was clean. We had some difficulties with regard to the safe box but this was handled smoothly. The breakfast was good and provided both healthy and unhealthly food! Eventhough, the hotel seemed to be fully booked some of the days we did'nt have to wait in line for a table. Also, it should be mentioned that the receptionists were very helpful and serviceminded. Only negative is that you have to pay 12,50 euro per day if you would like to have internet access at your room, however, you can ask to borrow a laptop in the reception and do the search you need for free.

Located 2 blocks from Zoo Station, the hotel was actually in a quiet area. The hotel is small with only 32 rooms and I think that contributes to the family atmosphere at this hotel. Everyone who worked at the hotel were extremely friendly and polite. The front desk reception was outstanding with suggestions and helpful hints. I had a double room and I was glad because it gave me a little more room to spread out. The breakfast was good with both hot and cold items. I especially liked the coffee because it was nice and strong. Breakfast is from 6:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. I liked the early start to the breakfast buffet so I could get an early start sightseeing. I took either the 100 or the 200 bus to get everywhere I needed to go. I preferred riding the bus because it was more scenic than taking the U-Bahn. You can take the bus from the airport for 2.10 Euro. The bus will leave you off at Zoo Station and it is just a short walk to the Hotel Astoria. It is very doable with wheeled luggage - no hills or steps involved. I took a taxi ordered by the hotel for my return trip to the airport and it was 14.20 Euro - reasonable cost and the taxi driver was early and very professional. If you want to go to the top of the Reichstag, get there at 8 a.m. before the crowds. You have to go through security and that slows the line down. I found Berliners very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
