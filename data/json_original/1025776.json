The free breakfast is also quite good as far as free hotel breakfasts go--most importantly there is a large selection.

Staff - Extremely friendly and helpful. I spoke to them a few times asking for local restaurants that deliver, area attractions, etc. Every single staff member I interacted with (I did not get any specifc names unfortunately) went above and beyond to ensure that everything was perfect for my stay. Room - I stayed at a studio/suite type room, which was more than large enough to accomodate myself or a couple. The room had a kitchenette, desk, dresser, couch, coffee table, dining table, and a bed with nightstands. The usual amenities were in place (hangers, ironing board/iron, paper pads/pens, etc). The bed and pillows were clean and comfortable. The only issue I had with the bedding was that on the 2nd night, it seems as if they tried to use the wrong size sheet (looked like a queen trying to be a king) but it didn't really make a large difference. The other nights I was here they were appropriately sized. I stayed in the 3rd floor, back side, facing an industrial park area which was an awful view, but there weren't really any rooms with good views. This hotel is definitely better suited for business travelers, airport pilots/flight attendants, or people coming to Miami to party and just need a place to crash. While the flight path from MIA is directly over the hotel, within the room you barely even notice. One of the nicer features of the room that sounds simple is all of their lamps in the room had 2 outlets on the base that were extremely accessible saving you the hunt of finding the ones in the wall. The bathroom was decent sized, and had a seperate room for the shower and toilet from the sink area, which was nice. Be advised: the shower is a glass door shower and not a shower/tub combo, so if you're looking for a bath too bad! Kitchen - it consisted of a small kitchenette to the left. While I never utilized it during my stay, it was extremely well stocked and clean. It consisted of a full size refrigerator/freezer combo, including an ice maker, a 2 burner glass top stove, oven, dishwasher, large microwave, and a small table with chairs to eat at. The kitchen included real plates/silverware, assorted sized pots and pans, cooking utensils, salt and pepper packets, microwave popcorn, coffee and condiments, and even an empty pitcher in the fridge to fill up with water. Hotel Amenities - There was a decent sized pool, as well as a half basketball court in the back area. There is also a typical hotel sized gym (though it was nice that each machine had an individual TV to watch). The business center was 24 hour access, and had 2 computers to utilize, as well as printer/fax machine/copier. They even had supplies to mail out packages through UPS, FedEx, and USPS. If a a business center isn't your thing - be advised that there is also free WiFi you can access. There was a 24 hour mini mart area as well, which sold: snacks, soda, water, beer, wine, liquor, toiletries, beach accessories, etc. The prices were reasonable for a hotel (I think I paid $3 for a toothbrush and toothpaste). The hotel also offers a free shuttle service (meant for airport transport) but they were more than willing to take you anywhere within a few miles. When I had arrived at the airport and called the hotel for the shuttle, it arrived promptly within 10 minutes. The only downside, which I believe is a gripe against the Miami Airport and not the hotel, was the system they use for the shuttles. As opposed to having an area with a spot marked for each hotels shuttle, they were just driving by in the middle lane and you had to flag it down. Hotel Dining - The hotel has no restaurant on site, nor does it offer any type of room service. The hotel does offer a complimentary breakfast, which houses a large variety of hot and cold items. Some of the items were: Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, Hash Browns, Croissants, Donuts, Bagels, Fresh Fruit, Oatmeal, Coffee, Juice, etc. The food wasn't phenomal blow your mind awesome, but how often is any hotels complimentary breakfast? I will say that the hot food was hot, and the cold food was cold, and everything tasted fresh. One of the things that sets this hotel apart from many others was the evening meal service offered. They hosted what is called a \"Manager's Reception\" M-TH, offering a complimentary \"light\" evening snack. I would say that is slightly misleading, and that they are essentially offering you a full complete dinner. Some of the items were: Baked Cod, Fried Chicken, Rice Pilaf, Mashed Potatoes, Salad Bar, Soup, Steamed Vegetables, etc. What was even more surprising is that they also offer complimentary beverages, but not just tea/coffee, but also beer and wine. They had a beer tap set up with Bud Light and Michelob Amber Bock, as well as carafes of Red and White Wine which was all complimentary! Location - I have already touched upon the magnificent view from my room. That pretty much sets the tone for the location of the hotel. The area itself was not the greatest, as there isn't a whole lot of places within walking distance. Across the street there is a gas station, Subway, McDonalds, Wendys, Dennys, and a liquor store. The hotel parking lot seemed very safe and secure, especially with security patrolling around 24/7. Long story short: If you are looking for a place that offers clean comfortable rooms, while simutaneously offering excellent customer service, this is the place. If you are looking for a resort or vacation destination, you might be better off going towards the South Beach area. This is definitely aimed towards people who just want an extremely comfortable place to stay!", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff!\u201d", "Author": "jbdivechik", "ReviewID": "UR121718139", "Content": "My girlfriends and I were in town for the Latin Music Half Marathon.

The rooms were large and clean and well maintained. King sizes bed was very comfortable but the shower felt cramped. I guess those bent shower curtain rods really do give you more room. The shower in our room had glass doors so there was not the shoulder room you get with a curtain. The included breakfasts were edible, but nothing was really hot. Most of the so called hot food was only warm, but the temperature was a whole lot lower than, i think, safe food handling recommendations would permit, but isn't that what an immune system us for? I never actually tested temps other than with my tongue. Taste was good for the most part. Coffee was strong and hot. They have their welcome home dinner available weeknight. Again, nothing spectacular and nothing really hot. But there was wine and beer included. The hotel is right underneath an approach to Miami International. It is interesting sitting by the pool and looking up to see the underbelly of a 747 or several other planes passing by. Our room was facing the pool and the pool area seems to catch and amplify the sounds of the jets passing over. It was noticeable for the first several days, and nights, but soon faded into the background noise after a while. If you are not used to noise or are sensitive to it, I would suggest you get a room on the south or west sides of the hotel. Overall quite a nice place. Seems safe and secure with security patrols of the grounds and attentive staff. all the staff I had dealings with were polite and helpful.

I checked into a room on the 7th floor with a great view of the airport, the noise of the jets was acceptable and did not disturb me. The hotel seems to be a little worn down, but it is acceptable. The amenities of the suite were excellent as I was able to buy my own groceries and cook throughout the week to save money (I own my small business). I recommend that you bring some dish soap with you, if not you can run the dishwasher each day. There is a Publix supermarket for easy shopping just a little south on NM 57th Ave (Red Road) and a Wal-Mart is very close (right on NW 87th Ave) as well as the Dolphin Mall, you can easily access them from the airport perimeter road NW 12th St if the 836 is heavy with traffic. I never ate the breakfast in the lobby area, or in the evening but the area looked very clean. The room was pretty clean with enough space for my family of four to live in for a few days. The bed was comfortable, but the air conditioning system was very loud. The hotel has great laundry facilities, bring your own packets of laundry detergent, as they are much cheaper at Target or Wal-Mart. You can run a nice circuit on Blue Lagoon Dr. The exercise facility is ok; you can get a light workout with the equipment. The table in the living room area was great for business work and had enough room for my computer and paperwork. The speed of the wireless Internet was a little slow (but faster than many of the hotels I have stayed at) as were the computers in the business center. I was able to print out material that I needed during my stay. The staff was pretty good and responsive to questions that I had. I would recommend this hotel to any business traveler or family who is looking to stay at a reasonably priced hotel close to the airport.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat all the way around\u201d", "Author": "bebloyer", "ReviewID": "UR58821475", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel-suite for 2 nights (pre-cruise).

Arrived at the airport, called the hotel (make sure you have their # handy) and the shuttle was there less than 10 minutes later. Suite is real nice. Had two cribs ready within a half hour for the babies. Rooms were really comfy and clean. Full size kitchen - maybe too little for a week stay. There is a grocery store a few block away and fast food places. I really believe the value of this hotel is high. Comes with free shuttle from/to the airport, buffet breakfast (very nice choice of breakfast items) and what they call a light dinner but to us was a full dinner (one night was chicken parmesan with mashed potatoes, salad bar and soup), the second night was raviolis, salad bar and soup. Even beer, wine and beverage. Pool and hot tub were nice too. Nice laundry room with quarters washers and dryers. Business center to check e-mails and print boarding passes. Did not use the gym, looked adequate to me. We were able to arrange a shuttle to the cruise with Rodolfo (got name and # from the hotel), $10/person. We were so happy with the accomodations that we came back and check in the hotel for a half day on the way back from the cruise and got a special rate for that since we were leaving before the night. Much better than staying in the airport for hours, waiting for our flight. I called Rodolpho and he came to pick us up for the same fee (with a $15 add to get into the port). Before booking this hotel, we had looked at the Hyatt Summerfield. Happens to be across the street so we went there and checked the rooms out. Nice, more contemporary but not sure the difference of price makes it worth it and no dinner included. I am keeping this hotel # for next cruise...

Colleagues recommended this hotel, because it is conveniently located to our work place. I have many food allergies, so I don't normally eat at restaurants often - so having a kitchenette was very important to me. I was very impressed with the kitchen and amenities here. Real silverware, other kitchen utensils, a full sized fridge, dishwasher, even some plastic containers for storage, etc. The TV is large (36\" maybe?), HD, with many cable channels you have at home - and tons in HD! NFL Network! ESPNHD, DiscoveryHD, all the local channels in HD, etc. The bed was large and comfy, you could watch TV easily from anywhere in the large open-concept suite. The windows were large, and let plenty of natural light into the room during the day. Even though we are right near the airport, you *rarely* hear a plane fly overhead! The check in staff are some of the most pleasant people I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. The cleaning staff is wonderfully accommodating. The little things make this place outstanding to stay at - the well-appointed kitchens, the lamps with two electrical outlets at their base - so you don't have to hunt around for wall sockets, the giant HDTV that you can watch from anywhere, the spacious bathroom (no bathtub, but I thought it was better having a large shower!) and closet, etc. The pool area is just a little small, but the hotel staff didn't mind you moving the lounge chairs to take advantage of the sun. There is even a small basketball court that I wished I had taken advantage of, but didn't. There are a couple gas stations, a couple fast food joints (Wendy's, Denny's), and a small strip mall within walking distance. A few grocery stores, Starbucks, etc, are also pretty close by - a couple minute drive west and/or southwest. I run a lot (3-9 mile distances during my stay), and had no problem running in this area on the sidewalks, or on the back roads behind the hotel without significant hassle from cars - and without having to cross too many large intersections. South Beach is about a 30 minute drive (to parking) away, which was nice. There's a big mall within about 4ish miles west, and 2 Whole Foods within a pleasant drive - south or northeast. They have free high speed wireless here, but then again it could be included in my room price, I don't know.

Ugly view for 3 days. This room - on the 5th floor overlooking the pool (room 514) was almost perfect! The only drawback was in its design - the a/c ducts blow cold air right onto the bed. Too chilly/drafty for me! I blocked the air with 3 pillows from the sofa wedged on top of the window valance. The front desk people are friendly and quite helpful. Any staff member who just passes you in the hall, or approaches a door, will smile, speak and even open the door for you. And Raymond in food services, is wonderful. Tell him what kind of food you want to try in Miami and he'll research it and get right back to you with directions to the restaurant. He remembered us from previous visit(s) too. Security is always visible in the spacious parking lot. Denny's, McDonald's, and a gas station snack shop are within walking distance. Crossing the 74th Ave. traffic during the day when leaving the hotel grounds is a bit anxiety raising. Perhaps one day the intersection will get a stop light.

Lots of fast food nearby.Also a Publix grocery store in which I visited and stocked up on sodas,juices etc..It really helps to have a fridge,microwave and the bathrooms were huge.Nice big showers,hair dryers awesome!
