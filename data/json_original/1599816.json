Both stays are very pleasant. Accommodation is always expensive in HK. So the rate of this hostel was reasonable, in my opinion. The room was mostly clean but it had a bit of bad smell from the toilet. It was small, but that\u2019s common in HK. The owner was very friendly. I lost my key and he didn\u2019t charge me for that. Chungking Mansions is very interesting. It looks shabby but it\u2019s indeed quite ok. There are a lot of people on the ground floor asking you to go to their hostels. Just don\u2019t ignore them and they don\u2019t give you any problems. There are surveillance camera in the common area and security guards, so it\u2019s definitely safe. And more importantly it\u2019s at the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui so it\u2019s pretty much close to all the touristy places in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. I would recommend this hostel if you are on a budget trip to HK.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ubud, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cRecommend the hotel\u201d", "Author": "lunamaya72", "ReviewID": "UR90774172", "Content": "Staying at the hotel for five days.

It is located in Chungking Mansion 12th floor, Nathan Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, which is very good location for travel Hong Kong. Around the building, there are many guesthouse, hostel, and luxury hotel, including with shopping arcade, department stores, brand name shops, good restaurants and fast food chain stores. MTR Tsim Sha Tsui is nearby for connecting to everywhere in Kowloon, Hong Kong, Lantau, and New Territories. Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier is not only 15 minutes walk. Also China Ferry Terminal to Macau is near on Canton Road. The location is closed to the ultimate highlight of Hong Kong, such the Symphony of Lights and Avenue of Stars. I checked in about 8 am after checking out from USA Hostel, Mirador Mansion (It is good, but no room is available). There is a security guard in front of the elevator at Chungking Mansion to be of service for all residents. The housekeeper at New Peking Guest House was friendly, and in good cooperation. After paid the room, it was no room vacant, so I left my baggage with them, and go travel. I came again on 8 pm., and found my baggage was already in my room in good condition. Room is very small and incommodious. From the room\u2019s door, I can only walk one step to my bed, and bathroom. However, it is no problem as my main purpose in Hong Kong is for travel, not for sleep. I went out in early morning, and back in late midnight during the time I stayed here. Bed, bed sheet, pillow, blanket is clean with a small shelf, which TV and telephone on it, at the end of my bed. The hanger for cloth is on the wall. My room has a small window, but no good view. A small shelf is attached at the edge of window with a small refrigerator under. The tiny bathroom is old, but clean. There is a tiny wash bowl with the mirror and little shelf over. Bath cream disposal is affixed on wall nearby. Shower is over the toilet bowl. There is also a window in bathroom. Computer and internet are available for free of charge, but I did not use them. The old man (I think he is an owner) advised me about this. He was very polite, and looked very kind.
