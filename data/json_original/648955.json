The bathroom had hair all over the floor, and the carpet had mystery stains all over it. Breakfast was a joke. They ran out of bowls by 8 am, and cups by 8:30.

Cindy and Rudy our front desk staff were awesome! They catered to our every need, and we had many as it was our first time in Miami. The website (h) I purchased from didn't advertise shuttle service but they do have free shuttle service to/from the airport and a $10-15 shuttle service company that takes you to the Port-of-Miami, they even picked us up from the port when we returned from the cruise (just have to call when you get to baggage/customs). There are several restaurants in the shopping plaza all within walking distance of the hotel. There is a subway, a Starbucks, Checkers, and several local restaurants that serve great spanish/cuban food. There is an Urgent Care, a hair and nail salon which my sisters and I used the morning of our cruise. Across the street there is another shopping plaza I explored also within walking distance. They have several shops and even an awesome bakery that delivers out-of-state. Located on 87th ave. is Walmart, Hooters and several banks. On 107th ave barely a drive at all is the Dolphin Mall with many more shops. Hotel is in a great location! This hotel is rated 2.5 stars but gave us 5 star treatment!

The Extended Stay Deluxe in Doral (Miami International Airport) is a perfect example of such a site. A number of reviewers have panned this site for any number of reasons but though it is easy to agree with one recent writer that the Extended Stay may not be \"deluxe,\" it is easily one of the best in its chain (and we have stayed in more than dozen across the United States) and a great place to stay when stopping in the Miami International Airport area. My wife and I just returned after spending eight days at the Extended Stay Deluxe while visiting Miami. We chose that specific hotel because of its central location, its relatively easy on and off relation to nearby freeways and toll roads, its reasonable rates (no one who has ever booked a room in south Florida in January and can possibly believe that they can find a full-sized, king-bedded suite with a full kitchen for less than $80 a night, which we did here, is living in another universe), and, not insignificantly, the motel's complimentary breakfast which, if in no way unique, not only saves one from worrying about either making one's own breakfast or going out to look for something off-site. The Extended Stay offers a comfortable place to stay and, ultimately, that's what a motel room is all about. But let's be clear: The Extended Stay is also in no way a resort hotel. The lobby, the breakfast room, and, indeed, the suites themselves are, at best, utilitarian. Rooms are cleaned only once a week and parking can be, on some evenings anyway, \"tight.\" There are, as others have noted, a few places to eat and/or shop in the immediate area but, realistically, a car is necessary to access even something is simple as a Walmart store which is located about two miles away from the motel. Traffic both in the morning and afternoon can be overwhelming and it makes getting to and from motel, which is \"hidden\" somewhat behind a small strip mall, a real challenge at times. Are there larger (and certainly far more expensive) hotels in the area? Absolutely. Most offer far more amenities than does the ESD. If anyone wants elegant in-house \"pluses\" such as chocolates on the pillow at night, then one should never consider any Extended Stay motel. If, on the other hand, a nice stay for the money in a clean and well-kept-up establishment in the Miami-Doral area is desirable, one ought look no further than here. Ratings are always subjective. Though given Trip Advisor's scale, a \"4\" is the most realistic one available, the Extended Stay Deluxe is probably closer to a 3.75. That, of course, is in no way bad. As long as a person is interested in a good night's stay, and apparently any number of pilots who we saw every day that we were at the hotel wanted just that, a 3.75 or even a 4 is more than good enough. My wife and I were in no way unhappy that we decided on the ESD and, were we ever to come back in the area, we'd make new reservations without a second thought.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cNot bad...totally doable\u201d", "Author": "yenger", "ReviewID": "UR36617778", "Content": "The hotel is on border line crappy part of Miami.

Extended Stay hotels are a mid range chain of hotels that cater to business travelers. The Miami-Doral hotel is just what I expected. Clean, but nondescript bathroom, good solid furniture with just a little flair and a kitchenette that works well for one to two people. Think \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean, serviceable, utilitarian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and you get the picture. I chose this hotel after a lot of research because I found that the majority of hotels at this price range in Miami are nasty, bed bug infested dumps with unscrupulous people running them (I originally planned to stay in South Beach or closer to downtown). If you \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcve done much research on Trip Advisor so far, you will have discovered this as well. I asked a friend who lived in Miami for many years about the hotel situation and she confirmed that what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve discovered is true. She said that a lot of people pass through Miami and the attitude of many hotel owners is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get the money and the customer/service be damned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I guess the waves of people just keep coming and coming no matter how bad it is. Good for the hotel owners, bad for us travelers. In the end, I selected the Extended Stay and was delighted that I had. It was very clean, the people at the front desk were pleasant, it was very close to the airport (sound proof - no noise from the planes), and had a coffee/cereal/muffin breakfast selection in the lobby. If I am ever in Miami again I will stay here again. Two notes: 1) The hotel is in a weird spot. It is not directly on the street. Instead, it is pushed back behind and next to a strip mall. I drove by a few times (at night) looking at the address over and over before I finally drove into the strip mall and found the hotel parking lot and entrance. 2) if you have a rental car to return to the airport give yourself extra time.

I'm assuming (and hoping) that it's just the cleaning ladies hairs falling onto the towels, because everything else about the room seemed clean. But this hotel is very nice for the price. The decor (couch, curtains, paint, etc.) was all very nice and updated just as the website described. The bathroom had a nice big closet and vanity area that I loved (not enough hangers though). And it was great to have a full kitchen (stove, oven, microwave, fridge, sink, and dishes) And the laundry room was great too, did laundry 3 times (told you I was a clean freak lol). The fitness center only had a couple treadmills and bikes... nothing but cardio... The pool looked nice and clean from afar, but I didn't go close to it... I would definitely stay here again as long as I bring my own towels or the cleaning staff starts wearing hair nets, but I will probably just bring a couple of my own towels since there are good laundry facilities. Another pleasant surprise was that the wireless internet service was only $5 for the whole week! I thought I had read somewhere that it was $5 per day, so that was nice! It was also nice that there was a Subway and a place called Chicken Grill within walking distance... other than that you'd need a car or a cab to get to a grocery or drug store... but we had a car so it was ok.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, great price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3614924", "Content": "My family stayed at Studio Plus during the Christmas holidays. We were there for about 8 days. The rooms are comfortable, one king size bed with a sofa couch. Modern and clean. The kitchen area is great, With a 4-burner stove, microwave, full-size fridge and plenty of cabinet space. I was actually able to put together a full dinner on Christmas day. There is a pool, although it is rather small and not designed for play with children. On-site laundry facility and a little workout room with a couple treadmills and a bike. Perfect for business trips or vacation. I was very happy with our stay there and would stay again. We are a military family, and with a discount only paid about $57 a night, during Miami's peak season. The staff was helpful. There isn't a restaurant in the complex, but the surrounding area is full of fast food and restaurant eateries. Right off the Palmetto Expressway so it is convienent to everything. Overall, great location, we loved it. The only drawback for us was the small pool. We would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Extended Stay Deluxe Miami - Airport - Doral", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d648955-Reviews-Extended_Stay_Deluxe_Miami_Airport_Doral-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "$105 - $148*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7750 NW 25th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33122</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "648955", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f0/77/f077f6ad50700a030b6afe3e8f6adb315large.jpg"}}
