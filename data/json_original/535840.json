The hotels two shining glories were it's proximity to Termini (one of Rome's best shopping arcades) and the staff, who were friendly and spoke good english. The only other issue I would raise is that while most of our party were allocated rooms on the ground floor, myself and my two room mates were alone on the floor above.

The hotel is really close to a bus station/metro/ shopping centre (termini) which it great for getting about and also the cafe at the entrance is very good for meals. The rooms... The rooms are clean some are larger than others, some of the light fittings are dodgy and check the bed slats before you leave so that you get your deposit back! NO bed bugs. Although there are very thin sheets, so if you get cold easily you might want to pack a blanket. The bathrooms clean, the showers hot and powerful, so really you can't complain. The breakfast is uninspiring! no fruit or youghurt, some cereal i'd never see before, nutella, ham and cheese for breadrolls (which are very hard...so if you have braces you might want to consider taking cereal bars or buying bread in the supermarket in the ((termin)) instead) and if you don't like long life milk i suggest you buy your own. all in all a great hotel if your only there to \"sleep\" and is a perfect place for school trips", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cBasic\u201d", "Author": "Chelsey92", "ReviewID": "UR24459708", "Content": "Stayed here on a school trip for the weekend.

They have a little roofed courtyard out front, where you can sit and chill in the evenings, and there are little tobacconist's / newsagent's nearby. However, the hotel itself... well, I know it's cheap, but it was really not a great experience. The rooms are extremely cramped - don't even THINK about sharing a room with a friend, they will cram in 3 single beds into a room big enough for one bed, to the point where the 3 beds are actually TOUCHING. The rooms smelled a bit funky as well, damp and just 'off'. The worst thing was waking up the next morning and finding big red bites all over me - yes, they have BED BUGS! Gross! The hotel didn't seem to care though - they just told me to contact my tour operator... and what were they supposed to do?? The other MAJOR problem was that large groups kids going on school trips to Rome seem to be ALL staying at the Lazio... and by kids, I mean teenagers. Of course, being teenagers, they all decided to get hammered and ran around the hotel screaming and shouting, knocking on each other's doors, puking and carrying on pretty much all night. I was so annoyed. And again, the staff by the front desk did not seem to care at all. I'm so annoyed that my friends and I didn't go elsewhere - and that we didn't check this site out before booking the hotel. The breakfast did surprise me though, it was quite ok. Nothing spectacular, but really expected it to be as bad as the rest of the hotel. They had the regular continental breakfast, which is fine - cereals, bread rolls, coffee etc. in a fairly average, cleanish dining room. So to sum up - unless you're 16 and looking for a fabulously loud drunken adventure on alco pops, I'd strongly advise you to go elsewhere.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands", "Title": "\u201cI am glad I ignored the reviews on this site!\u201d", "Author": "Justjayne", "ReviewID": "UR19483734", "Content": "I booked a package which included 4 nights at this hotel, which I chose because of the close proximity to the railway station. Imagine my absolute horror when after booking I found the reviews for this Hotel Lazio on this site! We decided not to cancel and went along with a sense of humour and expecting the worst. We were pleasantly surprised - the staff were subdued, but extremely helpful when we needed them to be. The breakfast was not brilliant, but on a par with \"continental breakfasts\" I have experienced at supposedly better hotels. We also initially thought that the walls in our room looked a little \"tired\" and in need of a quick end-of-season paint, however in broad daylight we discovered that the paintwork was not in need of a refresh, but had been given an almost too subtle rag-roll pattern! Our mistake. The room we stayed in was actually spotless, with all towels changed daily and bedlinen every second day. It was well-equipped, with the exception of the mini-bar, which was really an empty fridge. However, this suited us very well, as we had plenty of space to chill our bottles of water. We found the hotel to be peaceful at night - perhaps we missed maurauding school children and bed bugs season- who knows? And yes, as promised the hotel really was a 2 minute walk (if that) from Termini - which meant that travel throughout our stay was easy. I fully believe you get what you pay for; this hotel is inexpensive and is perfect if you intend to be out-and-about site-seeing. If you are looking for a different type of break, relaxing in luxurious spacious surroundings, you should probably look at a different type of hotel.

We started off by entering the understaffed hotel, to meet a grumpy receptionest looking annoyed to see us.it took us one hour to finally get all of us in the rooms thanks to the incompetence of the receptionest. I then procceded to my room with my friends expecting a clean bed to lie on after making our long trip to Rome. But we were greeted with a smelly, dirty, termite ridden room. The sheets hadn't been changed in any of the beds, or changed for our whole 4 day trip! The air conditioning/fridge/t.v didnt work, And most importantly the safe where our valuables were supposed to go had about 5 combos that all could open and close the safe. we asked the hotel manager to see if the safe was broken or not and were not helped at all, If it wasn't for our teacher we would have probably never got assistance at all. turned out the safe had no battery and when i asked if we could replace we were given a piece of paper that explaned hoe to use the safe properly due to the ingnorance of the staff. None of them could speak recognisable english. We then decided to have a look around the room, the room was freezing so we decided to put on the air conditioning. A smell of burning pertruded from the vents so obviously it wasnt working. At close examination the scirting boards were all eatin' by termites. Next door to us there were lice all over the sheets and they had to be moved to a third floor room with all the same problems, less lice of course. Every morning we were woken at six A.M by the clicking of high heels of the staff moving up and down the corridors getting the breakfast ready. It was a collection of cheaply proccesed ham and plastic tasting cheese. The juice just wasnt juice and the coffee was cheap and dull. Overall i wouldnt recomend this hotel to anybody looking to have a gud time in rome. Even for a school trip. It is just awfull. The only thing about this haotel i can say is gud is how it looks from the outside. But indide im sure it is in violation of some serious health and safety laws.

No shower curtains in baths, but baths were clean and had good water pressure - good thing there was a floor drain. Extra beds requested for rooms with multiple kids \"felt like cardboard\" according to some of the kids. Breakfast starts at 6am, and if you're on the first floor, you'll hear it being prepared. Decent fare of bread, meat, cheese, tarts with juice and coffee, but great little restaurant with good pastries a block down. Also a great little pizzeria just around the corner with the nicest staff and they spoke great English. This is definitely a student trip kind of hotel; I would NEVER stay here traveling with friends or as a couple. It is an okay location. Previous review said it is \"walking distance\" to most sites, but all of Rome is walking distance to everything if you're willing to walk; it's a very compact city.
