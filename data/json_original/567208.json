The better business bureau needs to know about this place and shut them down!! And way overcharged-- we paid close to $150 dollars for one night during the film festival because we couldn't find a hotel at the last minute that was reasonably priced and close to where we needed to be. Had we known how awful this dump would be, we would have stayed elsewhere and paid more. Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy! STAY AWAY! And furthermore, the t.v. was broken, the paint was peeling, the carpet was old and smelly, a big hole on the wall under the sink by the pipe, the towels were soiled, and we found dirty hair still in the bathtub from the previous customer. We did not want to eat breakfast there! Couldn't imagine the health hazard and unsanitary conditions in their kitchen. We left first thing in the morning thoroughly disgusted!! This was the worst place ever hands down. The staff does not care at all!!! If they did they would have done something already! Wish we had read the reviews before we booked. Be smart and STAY AWAY!!! And save your money and your health. Big big disappointment. Shame on them for doing business this way. This place should shut down before they face any legal issues!!

This is not one of those cases. It is one of those hostels/hotels that are so dirty and depressing that they actually make you smile, or perhaps even laugh (depending on your own personal reaction). Anyway having originally booked a dorm room, we were upgraded to a private with cable tv included due to reception not having the right keys for the door. It was at this point where the overall filth wasn't such an issue as i had a reasonable trade off, however that was until the bed bugs came out. In all my years of travelling this was the first time that i had been bitten (eaten), which does heighten some naivety as to how incredibly itchy the bites really are. However if you are short on cash then there's still a chance that you might book a night here anyway, but despite it being cheap be mindful that there is no added value.

So if you have a car be prepared to still pay for a 'parking' spot.

If you are travelling on a real budget, backpackers, students and simply want a place to crash and really dont care about making your own bed, a slight rip in a bed sheet or flaky pain work then the Downtowner will be fine and you will probably meet some great people there as well.

I had made reservations online via their website, which stated I would receive a room with a double bed, a refrigerator, microwave, phone, and TV. I also requested a parking space, which would cost an additional $10 per day. As it so happened, this was the same day that Toronto was hit with a large snowstorm, which I had to drive approximately 4 hours through to get there. I arrived at the hotel and checked in at approximately 9:00 p.m. They had no record of me needing a parking space, but said they did have one available, and charged me the additional $10.00. I asked why I could not pay for both days I would be there and was told that it is assessed each day and I would have to stop in the office in the morning to pay for the next day. I then asked where I was to park and was told it was around back, behind the inn. As I made my way to park, my car was stuck several times in the snow. Another car was parked at an angle in back, which made it impossible for me to park my car without putting it in jeopardy of being hit when the other car left. I went inside to inquire about a shovel to have the parking area cleared and was met with questions as to what a shovel was. After explaining to the gentleman, he told me he would contact the maintenance man, to see if either he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d come shovel the drive or tell the manager on duty where the shovel was. At no point in time did the manager on duty appear to call the maintenance man nor locate a shovel. By pure luck, I found a shovel in back of the inn and proceeded to shovel off the parking area myself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it was late, I needed to park, and I wanted to rest. Upon turning in for the night, I realized there was no phone in my room, my TV did not work, and I could easily hear the people in the next-door room talking. Throughout the night loud noises, people talking, and TVs awakened me. The check-in papers I received said no loud noises after 10:00 p.m., which was not upheld. At approximately 7:00 a.m., many people were walking through the halls, talking, laughing, and making a lot of noise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which I found to be quite disturbing to trying to get my rest. A continental breakfast was included with the room rental. However, when I went to the area it was supposed to be in, all I found were empty bread wrappers and jelly jars. Even though my reservations were for two evenings, I felt that unless something was drastically done to uphold what I felt were the reservations I had made, I no longer wished to stay in this inn. I went to the front desk and attempted to speak with the current manager on duty, to explain to him that my room was not as described in the online booking information, that my TV did not work, there was no phone, I had to shovel my own parking area, and there was no breakfast available. He proceeded to tell me that if I was dissatisfied with my room, I should have come to the front desk immediately before falling asleep and found a different place to stay. He also informed me that a budget hotel does not have to offer amenities such as TVs and phones, that a continental breakfast was provided upstairs and I must have been too slow to get to it, that it was not his fault nobody called about the shovel or to speak with the maintenance man, and that I should have found a different place to park. I informed him that I would like my money refunded, as I did not receive what I was supposed to. He began to get upset with me and I told him that the customer service I was receiving was horrid, to which he replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153customer service does not exist in Toronto\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take myself back to Yankeeland where they eat oil and wage war on innocent people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Any subsequent pleas on my part to get the situation rectified was met with more disdain against US citizens, accusations that I was responsible for people being at war, and that I expected too much from a budget inn, that anything that price would be exactly the same. When my husband came to see what was going on, the manager on duty physically threatened him by cocking back his hand to hit him. I attempted to explain that we visit Toronto on a yearly basis and have stayed at many other establishments in the area, for a similar price, but had never had a problem with any of them. He told me that there was no way I could have stayed at those places for those prices and told me that I got what I paid for. He then had another man come in who also told me that I was expecting too much and did not know what I was talking about, since \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel prices never change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and there was no way I could have ever stayed at any of the other places for a similar rate. Eventually, the manager on duty said he would reverse the charges and that I would have to call to speak with the hotel manager. He would not tell me his name nor put anything into writing, saying his word was good. I have called every day since then, at least twice, and the hotel manager has always \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just left.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Regardless of what time he is supposed to be there the next day, if I call, he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just left\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I do not feel my money will be refunded and will be taking the proper steps to dispute the charges on my credit card. I feel that the Downtowner Inn is a disgrace to the city of Toronto. I have never been more offended by someone than I was there and have never received such poor customer service in all my travels. I do not feel that the hotel manager, Mike Dluhy (not sure of spelling, only pronunciation), runs his establishment in a good way nor does he care about how his customers are treated. Since I have returned to my home, I have been looking up information online and have yet to read a single good review of the Downtowner Inn.

You have to keep in mind that they charge less than half the rate of other hostels, so it's a compromise. -female, 23", "Date": "February 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Fransisco", "Title": "\u201cBeware This place is A scam\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4496506", "Content": "I had the unfortunate misfortune to stay at this horrible excuse of a hotel. The street the hotel is located in is full of druggies and prostitutes. The hotel does not even have a secure main door and the fence in front of the hotel is non existent. At the time of checking in, i had to deal with the front desk agent who could barely speak 1 word of english coherently and when i wnated to pay by creit card I was notified they have no credit card machine...Thank God I did'nt use my cc as there was a very high possibility I would have been a victim of identity theft. I was directed up the stairs to my room, I was afraid the stairs were gonna fall down and seriously hurt myself as the stairs were dangerously un safe & rickety. upon enetring my room, i was in for the best shock of my life, the room had not even been cleaned since the last guest and there was a huge rodent sitting on my bed. I marched down & demanded to speak to the owner, An arogant man of Indian origin introduced himself as the owner Mr. Mike Dewji, when i told him about the state of the room he said i was lying and if i wanted to check out & needed a refund, he basically told me to get lost I also saw many other unhappy guests checking out as apparently they had no hot water for over 24hrs...this in -9 temperaature. I intend to report this matter to the Dept. Of fair Trading and Consumer affairs. My advise stay clear of this hotel if you value your money security and dignity.

We arrived and it was not in the greatest part of Toronto. They didn't even have the air conditioner in the room yet, but they put it in when we arrived. The 13\" tv received one local public station. There was no mirror in our bathroom either and the bathroom and \"kitchenette\" were disgusting. There wasn't even any shampoo, toilet paper,or soap in the bathroom. The manager lied and said the maid was late. It was 9pm and he said the maid would be there soon. We had somewhere to be so after a few minutes I went to the front desk and caught him coming back from the store with those items. There were bugs in the bathroom and spiders in the bedroom. Underneath the beds was a lot of dust and other crap. They were remodeling at 6 in the morning hammering and banging away after we got home from the club at 5:30am so we really didn't sleep. On top of this, we had a whole big deal with Expedia. The room did not have their credit card machine set up so i was unable to pay at the time and I am not going to.
