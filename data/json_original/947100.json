However sadly the food at their \"fine dining\" restaurant for dinner was simply terrible. I ordered an Entecotte steak, medium rare, the small thin piece of meat came out well done with a side of instant mash and cold from the tin mushrooms. They quickly brought out a new steak but it was still far below what I'd expect at a star hotel let alone a 5 star. My partner didn't fare much better with the chicken schnitzel. The \"baked\" rice desert would normally in Turkey be served hot, but it came straight from the fridge with ice cream. Food aside the service was good and very friendly. The room also included a \"regular\" shuttle service to and from the airport but at 9:10pm we would have had to wait 35 minutes for the next one, and at 4am for our departure there was no shuttle.

I couldnt stand it no longer and decided to sit at the lobby , even waiting for the lifts i could hear them clearly. Thats not what you need after a long flight. The hotel wasnt that crowded so i have no idea why we were put so close to other people. Breakfast was disgusting. I have had much better breakfast at 3 star places. The food looked tired and not fresh. there were flies on the food which turned me off eating. The staff at the breakfast area were more concerned about gossipping about their night rather then looking after the 2 guests that were at the buffet breakfast. Lucky for me i can understand Turkish. We ordered coffee which took 20 minutes to arrive and when it did it was undrinkable. It was everything but coffee.

Far from it. It is a convenient, and reasonably priced full-service airport hotel. There aren't many other options in the area if you're looking for this location, and we found the hotel far exceeded expectations. Complimentary shuttle from Ataturk airport runs on the half hour, or a 7 TL (~$3.50) taxi ride. Efficient front desk staff - this is a very busy hotel, so don't expect to be overwhelmed with smiles and fussiness! The desk staff was handling a barrage of people from many parts of the earth when we arrived, and they did so fairly quickly and without international incident, despite the rudeness of some of the guests. Our room was clean, and high-tech -- the television was mounted on the wall through a mirror, and light/controls are on a console by the bed. A quirk: Motion-sensor activated lighting in the hallway would occasionally lag, so the hallway would be dark for a few extra steps. But eventually they clicked on. Complimentary breakfast included with the price of the room. Good variety of foods offered, including fresh fruit. Fresh coffee. Enough fuel to get to the airport. Free wireless available in the lobby and restaurant. Wired internet is complimentary in the rooms. Staff will provide an ethernet cable if you don't have one.

Since we had stayed in the old town pre cruise, we were excited to get back downtown. THe train was quite convienent, a 3 minute walk from the hotel.

We enjoyed a dinner downtown, picked up a few souveniers, for less than $50 US including a beer. We were so glad that we ventured out of the hotel. One note, since the water in Turkey is not drinkable, you have to purchase water. This hotel did not sell it anywhere except at the bar.

I must say that I am very skeptical of the glowing positive reviews for this hotel. The rooms weren't particularly special (in fact, they appeared to be identical to the rooms in the Wow four star hotel attached to the same building), and particularly so when considering the price. The staff had a bad attitude and zero service culture. There was little interest in helping and service was very slow. The wife of one of my colleagues was propositioned by a male member of staff. Food and drinks were very expensive, and the service in the bar was glacial -- the barmen seemed more interested in talking to each other and flirting with women, than in doing their job. Not to mention the fact that I was initially billed for drinks I did not order. The rooms weren't particularly clean -- my colleagues in another room developed a rash after sitting on the floor. The only redeeming feature of the hotel is its proximity to the airport and expo center. My guess is that this guaranteed source of business is why they're able to get away with what they do. If this hotel were only three or four star and the pricing was in line with what they offered, I would have been reasonably okay with it all.

It is very close and convenient to the airport, but I was disappointed in several aspects. 1) There are two WOW hotels right next to each other. Before they would let us out of the hotel shuttle, they made me find my reservation and prove to them I was staying at the 5 star one. 2) Our baby cots were set up when we got to the room, which was nice, but one of them had a huge hole ripped in the side, which is not safe for a baby. We didn't feel like dealing with it, and figured it would be OK for our 2 year old, but a 5 star hotel? Come on. 3) I boked this one specifically because it had a pool, the bellman made a point to tell us all about the pool when he took us to our room. Our 2 year old was super excited about visiting the pool, so we thought a quick dip before dinner would be nice. We got all ready and went up to the pool, where we were asked if we had swim caps. We said no, and she said they were mandatory, so we asked to borrow some. She said they didn't have any to borrow, but we could buy them for 10 Lira each. For a family of 4, 40 lira for a 15 minute swim at a hotel we already paid for was ridiculous. Our daughter immediately started crying and they didn't seem to care. 4) For an airport hotel they weren't set up for early morning travel. We had to leave for the airport at 5:30am and we were told we had to take a taxi because the shuttle didn't start until 6. We also couldn't get anything for our included breakfast. The only reason this hotel got two starts instead of 1 is because the staff at dinner were so wonderful. They had a buffet that we didn't want because we wanted something light, but when our food came our daughter decided she didn't want it and wanted potatoes. We asked if we could have a couple from the buffet and about 4 staff members jumped to fill up plats with everything they could think of that a two year old might want.

It is the 5* hotel which is next to the Wow Airport hotel. So, you might get confused, as I was, when trying to look for reviews of Wow Istanbul. It is claiming to be a 5* hotel, but I would not give it to them. Why? - I can only agree with the previous reviewer, Bob, about the beds. It is indeed like sleeping on the floor. I stayed here 3 nights and now I have pain in my shoulders because of these lousy rock hard beds. After the first night I asked the reception if I could change to another room for the other 2 nights. They said no, as the whole (5*, remember?) hotel has the same type of beds. If you are a real 5* hotel you will have different types of beds available. So, with that statement they already loose 1*. - You can't open a window in the room, forcing you to use the air conditioning. Also during the night. I don't like to sleep with the airco on, but I was lucky these 3 nights as the outside temperature was not that high. Around 20 degrees. I can imagine how it would be if it is 40 degrees....... - Breakfast looks to have a lot of choices, which is indeed true, you'll have a lot of choice, but for me not the right choice. I've been in quite a lot of Middle-Eastern hotels (see my contributions) and this is indeed a Middle-Eastern breakfast buffet. Nothing wrong with that, but not my taste. I would like to have some butter on my bread, a pancake prepared by the cook would be nice, and some Nutella is something I like as well on my sandwich. Nothing of these were available. - It was probably due to Ramadan, but the bars (roof bar and lobby bar) were empty as well, not contributing to a lively atmosphere in the hotel. - The staff itself is friendly, although those at breakfast were looking on their watch a bit too much.

To start it all off, they stood at the door and watched myself and my fiancee struggle with bringing the luggage inside the hotel. After finally making it to our room, we were there for about 15 minutes and my fiancee was about to prepare for a shower, and a staff member (man) made two quick knocks at the door then barged right in. Then claimed he was in the wrong room. So I guess they just give master keys (master card-key) to the staff to just go into any room they feel like and when they feel like it. I was quite angry at this person for doing that. A few seconds earlier and he would have walked in on my fianc'ee. A claimed-to-be, 4 star hotel and they haven't figured out how to put wireless internet in place yet. if you would like to use the internet in your room and if you do not bring your own cable, Guess what? They will sell one to you. Isn't that sweet of them? If you and your partner want to use the internet simultaneously, then one of you will have to go to the lobby where they degrade themselves even more to make their lobby look like a internet cafe. If you want to eat breakfast in your room, you can, at a very high price. Apparently the room breakfast is brought to you from Greece or Germany or Italy. I mean, at that price, there is no way that is came from downstairs. By the way, don't waste your time trying to get fresh air in the morning or at anytime of the day. if you are in your room, that is. The windows are locked shut not even a small opening for fresh air. I am just simply tired of writing I could go on for a few pages.

We chose this hotel due to its close proximity to the airport, as we flew in there from Izmir one day at 3pm and needed to fly out early the next morning again. Yes, it's very close so no wasted time in transit, but that is all. We had booked a room that was supposed to be a triple according to the web site, however, when we arrived we were told all rooms were standard with only a queen. This meant that a cot was brought in for our teenage daughter. I was not pleased as this was one of the reasons we had booked there. Our room was in the 4 star section and was ok, but basic, the bed was too hard. The carpets could be cleaner. We were not impressed with the service at the restaurant when we went to have a look and ask about dinner options. So we walked over the the 5 star side to check it out, and were greeted by very helpfull staff. We enjoyed the food and the service here was excellent. But be aware that this is an expensive place, which takes advandage of it's customers. When we went to the restaurant to buy bottled water for our room, I was shocked at the price of 5 lira for small and 9 lira for large. This is crazy in a place where bottled water is not an option. We did take the shuttle at 6:30am to the airport and that was good.

Its not somewhere we probably would have chosen otherwise as the location of the hotel is a long way outside of the centre and sights of Istanbul. The only time this hotel would be a good place to stay is if you have an overnight stay either going or leaving the airport, as this is a short distance away, albeit not in the flight path of the planes - so no noise from that. There is the netro system that has a stop about 50m from the hotel that would get you to the city centre, however we did not brave that and understood it would take 3 different trams to get us there. The hotel itself is ok, not the 5 star in brands itself to be though. The rooms are ok, fairly modern with nice firm beds and good air conditioning. Breaskfast is fine as well with a large selection of foods covering most cuisines. The food in the hotel is not too expensive, however the price of alcohol is astronomical - we're talking \u00c2\u00a36 for a small bottle of beer, and the water is \u00c2\u00a32 for a small bottle, which is particularly harsh considering its a hot country and the tap water is undrinkable. The minibar is even worse, with some spirts being around \u00c2\u00a310 for a small bottle - avoid!!! The hotel does run free shuttle services to the airport and city centre, although the one into town drops you at an area called Taksim Square, and to our minds there was nothing in this area. We ended up paying 40 lira each (\u00c2\u00a315) to go on a tour bus which eventually took us to the Sultanahmet area where the Blue Mosque, St Sophia and Bazaar are. There are also many restauarants and shops in this area, so definitely the place to be. We could have gone back to Taksim Square by tour bus to get the coach home, but we needed to leave before this, therfeore our options were either a very expensive taxi back to the hotel, or (as we did it), get on one of the airport shuttles for 10 lira and pay them a bit more to take us to our hotel. Though you may find that people do not know of the hotel. All in all, I think partly because of the location of this hotel and its remoteness, neither of us had the best of times in Istanbul and wouldn't come back.
