I decided we were staying in Key West and didn't really have to have all the extras since we would be out and about having fun. Me and my fiance decided to go ahead and try it. We came to Key West to get married. Our wedding was amazing. I am so glad I did it here. As far as the resort, our room was 514 right in front of the restaurant and the squauking parrots. They did wake us up every morning very early. The room was extremely tiny for 2 people. Had no place to put clothes. Had to leave them in suitcase. There was no bathtub and shower was tiny. Hardly had room to move in there. I asked for a iron and ironing board. The staff brought me one but was to dirty to even use. I wasnt about to put my clothes on it. You only get one towel a piece. There was one day that we didnt get clean towels until 7:00 that evening. Had to ask twice for them. This place is no resort. It is more of a motel. We ate at the Stoned Crab restaurant the first night we got there. The food was nothing special but we were tired and just wanted something to eat. Service was very slow. We got told at front desk that you get 10% off meal but the waitress conveniently forgot to do that. She acted like she was stoned herself. The concierge was no help. He actually got rude with my husband. We had a great time in Key West. I am so glad I came here to get married but I will never stay here again. We made do since we had already paid for it through bookit.com. We are already talking about coming back to the Keys but will definitely do more research before booking again.

There is NO Key West atmosphere at all; it has all of the charm of a roadside motel in New Jersey. The room was terribly laid out. It was actually two rooms, one of which was quite large with an old, dirty convertible sleeper couch. When I called and said we needed the couch made up into a bed all they did was drop off some shabby sheets and leave them on a chair. Really? For a resort? I had to spend one night on it and my back still hasn't recovered - the springs were broken and prodding me everywhere. The next night my son chose to sleep on the floor instead. Apparently this room was renovated but if so they wasted their money. It had a cheap, outdated feel. The pool is a mediocre rectangle surrounded by motel rooms. The one nice thing was the restaurant, which does manage to have a nice atmosphere and decent food. People actually bike from Key West to this hotel for the food.

The owners have a decent place and try so I give them credit. I rented a bike off site at A&M bike rental, picked me up at airport and dropped me off. The main problem is the distance to the beach and uncomfortable bed. I would have sprung an extra $150 for the 3 nights and stayed closer. This hotel isn't worth more than $100 a night cause of the cons. Expect to pay the extra anyway for cabs or scooter rental. That's really the bottom line.

I wanted Key West weather within striking distance of Duval via cab. I did not want to spend $400 per night for a room we would only spend 6 hours a day in. Upon arrival the cabbie told us..\"this place use to be a dive but an Australian Gazzilionaire bought it and has been dumping money into it ever since.\" Well he dumped it in all the right places. Within minutes of opening our door housekeeping stopped by to see if we needed anything. We forgot and opener. She produced one in seconds. We ate at the Stoned Crab for lunch, breakfast an dinner over the course of our 6 day stay and it was all delicious and fairly priced with great service. Rooms were slightly better than expected. Everything you need for a stay in the Keys. The folks complaining about this properties age or room size were either unwilling or unable to pay the extra $200+ per night to stay within stumbling distance of Duval or they can't read a map.

The Ibis is exactly what we needed and expected for our trip at a fair price for it's location and current renovation state. I can't wait to go back in two years for my 50th to see what they've done with the place. Pros: Gets you in Key West for half the price of places near Duval. That buys a lot of cabs, food and mojitos. Walking distance of Albertsons and K-Mart. Cons: No hot tub. Pool unheated.

(Not just for this hotel but with many.) I wanted something cheaper, clean, and that basically got the job done. We stayed for a weekend and weren't expecting the Ritz. I settled on Ibis Bay at $125 a night through Hotwire as their 2 star option. I was satisfied with the Ibis and happy we picked the cheaper option. Here's what I thought: We got room 407 (a handicap room, not that we asked for one). It was simple and small, but clean. There were zero bugs like some other reviews claimed. (I even checked the corners of the bed for bed bugs.) Only a queen bed and a dresser fit in the room, but it was do-able. The bed was extra kooshy which I loved being that I'm 6 months pregnant. There was a TV that looked about 15inches from 1990. A dryer, but no mini-fridge. The air-conditioner blocked out any outside noise not that there was much. Checking in was quick and easy. We'd already planned out our own trip (which is easy due to this site and the internet) before coming so we skipped the 'fun desk' aka the info desk. There was no WIFI and cell service was dodgy all over the island. We got a drink at the restaurant, but next time I'd skip it because it was pricey even during happy hour. I did enjoy all the Ibis birds wondering around the place (the tall white birds). We brought our own car so the 2.2 miles to the heart of the island wasn't an issue. So all in all I was happy with our experience. I rated it 3 stars because to me that is an average rating. I expected average; I got average. I think some people just have too high of expectations and if you're like that you should shell out the extra money to begin with. For the price (in comparison to all the high prices in Key West) this was fine for me. Would I stay here again? Maybe. About Key West: This was my first trip down. Here's what you can expect. No beaches. The Key's aren't known for their beaches, don't expect ANY AT ALL. Go to Miami or the Bahamas if you want beaches. (I knew that going in so there was no disappointment.) I hear there's great snorkeling/diving/jet skiing/other water sports, but in January it was just too cold for that. (72ish for our trip, but the water's still too cold for me.)

The \"fun activity\" lady did not help in finding something to do for adults and a teenager at night, the information we got was: it was the city that never sleeps. We asked where to go to find the nicest beach and we got sent to the beach we couldnt swim in because the mud was gross in between our toes and we didn't want to feel that.This lady also was no help in finding our way around, she just circled where about something may be on a map they give you.Only one car is allowed. The liquor was very expensive, they filled the glass with ice and put very little alcohol in it for $8 and it was not very good. The room I was in had a glass door with chairs right outside looking at cars and a road, we did not get to see the water front right from outside the room. The positive things about this hotel was that they had parrots and a couple turtles as animals for everyone to see, the staff around the parrots were nice and brought out celery to feed them. They had a sand art area with a beautiful sculpture. The water front had an ok view, you can't swim in it. They had chairs out there you could sit on which was nice. There was no free breakfast and the location of the coffee in the morning was hard to find, we ended up having to go to the store and buying some there. The pool was decent. There was nice birds walking around too that was nice to see. The price was good for the Key West. I personally suggest paying a little more and going to another hotel.

We generally just want someplace to clean/dry our gear and catch 40 winks before we dive back in the water. On the other hand, for all my other travel, I look for 4-5 star places with white fluffy robes and lots of amenties. I usually spend the last week of the year in KW as a relaxation/sun trip. This year I added 3 days of scuba diving with a group who booked the IBIS thinking it was a 'resort'. Unfortunately, it is not. It is a 2 star motel trying to reinvent itself. Slowly...painfully...and not successfully. Our group had 3 different rooms so we could 'compare' what we were in against the rest of the group. We were shocked at the conditions. Dirt, grime, mold, chipped/missing tiles, no closets, no phones, and in our case NO ROOM KEY! We went a full 36 hours without a room key and relied on the hotel front desk to 'let us in' everytime we returned. They had to have a local locksmith make a key for the room. The pool is fine. Nothing to write home about. But it is clean and has a decent area around it to sunbath. It is close to the 'bar/restaurant' but we never saw them 'deliver' to the pool or even come by to take drink orders. We always had to go into the bar and order and then go back and pick it up to take to the pool. The bathrooms are small and bad. Rust, mold, missing/chipped tiles. In 1 of the 3 rooms, the shower stall was so small you had to practically step out of it to bend over and shave your legs. Seriously. Housekeeping is fairly bad. We never saw them before 2 pm and we ended up just asking them not to clean and requesting towels from the front desk. Our room was fairly large but no closet or dressers. You live out of your suitcases - literally, and your suitcase lives on the floor since there is nothing to put it on. The restaurant is ok. Food is 3 star but pricey. They are very slow. The two times we ate in the restaurant we waited 20+ minutes to order and another 30+ minutes for the food to arrive. Even poolside it took 40 minutes to get a burger.

I asked to be moved to a room with two beds and that is where all of the negative reviews came true. The room had not been upgraded since likely the 1990's. The floor was a really odd and dirty looking tile that the beds rolled on when you sat on them. The TV was a 19\" (while the king room had an LCD) and the remote didn't turn the set on or off. As someone else wrote in their review, the room had a musty smell which I figured was back flow from the shower (no tub) and after running water it wasn't as strong. The \"Beach\" area is a sand box bound by armour stone. The wifi was only in common areas and if you angled your laptop just right. This site is at the edge of town and no where near the action.

The pool area is wonderful and right next to the hotel bar & restaurant that seemed to always be open with good basic food plus some expensive options that we never tried. The resort owns some interesting animals that are fun to check out- giant parrots and giant turtles. There weren't as many families- it seemed to be older vacationing people so the vibe was relaxed and not chaotic. It was a great place to relax when we needed downtime in between vacation activities so on those accounts- I highly recommend it! The downside: the inside of the rooms. I was super disappointed that after we upgraded to a \"water view room\" there was no beach. It was on the water, but on a bay-front where it seemed to ALWAYS be low-tide. And if you've ever been to a beach or worse, a bay, at low-tide- the smell is horrific. Being that our room was right on the water, it constantly smelled like sewage even though we never opened the sliding glass doors because the stench was so bad. DO NOT REQUEST A WATER-VIEW ROOM!! If you do, bring airfreshener and candles. The bathroom was also sad as the lighting seemed like prison lighting. There was also only one mirror in the entire room which was the small bathroom mirror- which made it difficult for two people to get ready at once, or even one person really. There was no dresser or table or anything to put our luggage or clothing on or in. We requested a table which they told us they'd bring and they never did. We ended up leaving our clothes on the tile floors for the 6 days... we had no other choice. Basically, as long as it's a short stay so you have no need to put clothing away anywhere and you don't get a water-view room and you don't spend much time in your room... you'll be good!

The location is a long bus ride from down town and it's convenient to catch although it does not run frequently, that is the only down fall to staying here. On the plus side it is removed from town and gives you an escape from the crowds. Alot of the bad reviews were from before the renovations and the new owner is sprucing the place up daily. You can rent bikes or motor vehicles and they will bring them to you at the hotel and pick them up also. It is convenient to Kmart, Albertsons (great souvenir prices) and a liquor store, dollar store and pizza shop. All walkable. Don't forget to visit the Key West Tropical Gardens when there. It's a 6 min drive and so worth the time. Very peaceful, you can spend 1/2 hr or two if you wish. But be sure to spray with OFF supplied free at the admissions office before setting off. (it's only $5.00 for admission small price for the preservation it sustains). Save your bread from meals to feed the Ibis that will roam freely around the hotel.

The room we booked was #612... remember it... it is right next to the pool and next to the breakfast/bar area. Anyways, we were very pleased when we walked in. The kids attacked the first bedroom and we got the rear one which faced the pool. The rear room has a huge bathroom with a tub and separate shower. The good thing is if you need even more room than this, you can book the ajoining room, which connects (should you have a bigger family). The breakfast is free and great. Not the stuff you get at continental breakfast - what you do is, you print the coupon that is displayed on this page, and when you arrive to check in, you tell the front desk. They will give you a card for at least 4 people for a free hot breakfast, cooked to order.. really a great money saver. The staff at the resturant are attentive... just make sure to take care of your waiter. Danny was a great server as we tried to stay cool in the pool. The day was so hot that it felt like bath water. Danny kept the drinks and eats coming and made our stay great. Also, I strolled within the complex and found Mccaws and turtles. I found hammocks by the beach but the heat was so intense, I couldn't stay long. There are wet bike tours that leave from the property and boat rentals too. Now for the part that need improvements: The Beds!!!!They are too hard, please throw a pillow top on there - it would make for an improved nights sleep. Also the flat screens sit to low. Management should consider setting them up on the walls for greater comfort when watching TV from the beds. Tip: Ask for the renovated rooms only - the non-renovated are cheeper but you will not be happy. Also don't eat at the Hard Rock - it was terrible - no one ate their food and it was $80 bill!

They asked for my ID and CC while the other girl stare us down with a rude look that we interupted their important conversation. The room was great, for renovated room, at a buck and a half is decent. Pool is clean that go from 3'6\" to 5'. No ice machine, old style tv, restaurant is overpriced. This is a private owned resort so the owner is using his own money to remodel each room, once it's done, the things I've listed should be done. I think service attitude or front desk should be changed or replaced as that's the only reason why I wouldn't stay here again", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windermere, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWe will be back to Ibis Bay Resort!\u201d", "Author": "KM2011", "ReviewID": "UR115893748", "Content": "We had a great experience at Ibis Bay Resort!

The jerk chicken wings are the best wings Ive ever had. One thing we also enjoy is the parrots. They have a HUGH cage and they really add to the atmosphere of the resort. My wife brings grapes to feed the birds every time we come. They have a jet ski tour that leaves from the beach in front of the resort, and there's no better way to see the island than from the water. Its nice to have a resort that takes care of the locals and makes them feel right at home.

He did not know how to talk or explain things to me. Second, the comforter on my bed was dirty. I myself had to talk to the lobby and make the bed again with a clean one instead of the housekeeper. Third, next day the housekeeper put the same dirty comforter back on my bed. Fourth, the wireless connection was extremelly low. So whenever I had to search something on The Internet, I had to stand right next to the window. Also, the signal from cell phones was low inside the room. I could not get in touch with my relatives in the US or overseas. Fifth, whenever I had to get in touch with the lobby, the telephone did not work. so I had to walk back. the way from my room to the lobby was not well-illuminated and there was a huge container full of trash. Sixth, unfortunately there was no free shuttle to go downtown, so I had to spend a lot of money on transportation. The sad thing is that the hotel right across from Ibis Bay Resort did offer a shuttle. Seventh, I thought the hotel was next to the beach, but actually it is not. So the advertising \"Beach Resort\"is not reliable either. Eighth, the worst part happened at the resort restaurant. I decided to get a sandwich, and one of the workers complained in front of the rest of the workers because I had not included the tip. I didnot pay for it because it wanted to eat my sandwich in my room since this restaurant is right next to the waterfront and it is full of bugs. The guy literally threw the fries,chicken, lettuce, etc. in the box. it was all messy. He did not say a single word, went back to the kitchen and put the food in order. In my opinion this was totally disrespectful. After that, I went back to the lobby and the receptionist said he was sorry and it was up to me if I wanted to pay a tip or not. Ninth, as a consequence I had to start walking to the supermarket everyday to get some ready-made food.. Tenth, the second day two police cars stayed in the resort for the whole day. Apparently, something was going on on the second floor. Key West receives thousands of visitors from all over the world. The staff at Ibis Bay Resort should get a special training on how to treat guests regardless language, sex, religion, or country of origin. I am an international tourist, and I have been very lucky to travel all over the world.

We had stayed here last year when it was the Blue Lagoon. It really was not my first choice of places to stay for this weekend because we wanted to be in Old Town and at a nicer place. However, I had a tough time finding B & B's in town with (1) vacancies (2) no 3-night minimum and (3) somewhat reasonable rates. So, I turned to Blue Lagoon as a last resort, and was surprised to see that after years and years, it had a new identity: Ibis Bay. When we stayed at Blue Lagoon last year, it was cheap and had a huge pool, but not remotely impressive. The bed was awful, the linens cheap, the lighting in the room almost nonexistent, and just generally, trashy. What a difference a year has made. -The staff are cleaner. Last year the front desk guy was kind of scuzzy and uncommunicative. This year, they're in uniforms and are pleasant and helpful. -The lobby is no longer dark and dingy. It's bright and happy and Key Westy. -The exteriors have all been painted and are really cute. -The waterfront area, including the areas around 600 rooms, has been cleaned up significantly with new sand added. -The rooms - wow, what a difference. Our room had clean, white beadboard wainscotting with blue walls. The bathroom had expensive-looking blue glass tiles around the sink, which had new fixtures. The bed was awesome - king size, comfortable, with tons of pillows and high quality linens. I recognized the end tables from Ikea - simple, but they did the job. We also had a decent-size flatscreen tv, which was nice when we wanted to nap before going on. The window treatments were even nicely done. As for decor, they got rid of that stale, floral-print old motel stuff - no tacky pastel sunset paintings or anything like that. Instead, they had vibrantly colored, retro-style travel posters framed on the wall and a nice navy blue and white duvet. The remodel was really well done. -There were also plastic adirondack chairs in front of our room, which was nice when we wanted to have a beer before going out. The negative: -It would have been really nice to have a small refrigerator in our room. On our last day, I saw a small fridge, microwave and coffeemaker sitting outside the room next to us, as though they were going in. -We didn't use the pool area because there were just too many kids in it. I work with kids; I don't need to hang around them on vacation! Obviously, this is not the hotel's fault, but something that visitors to Key West should keep in mind - this hotel may attract more families than typical Key West lodging. -You have to take a cab (or drive. But who wants to drive in Key West?) to get to Old Town. -The parking lot still kind of sucks. We got blocked in the parking lot by a delivery truck at the restaurant one day. Also, they still have parking down by the rooms facing US-1 - a huge Chevy Tahoe was parked 6-feet in front of our room for our stay in a legit parking space. I don't know why they need to use those spaces. It would be nice for room 606 and the room next to it not to have other people's cars at their doorstep. I'm not sure what some of the people reviewing here are talking about, re: disgusting rooms and no phones. Our room had a phone and it was totally clean. Maybe all of the rooms haven't been remodeled? I don't know.

We checked in at 6 pm, and immediately Chris, the owner, offered to give us a ride downtown for the sunset celebration so that we didn't have to worry about finding parking. On the way down to Mallory Square, he pointed out various things to do and places that had good music and food. (All good recommendations, by the way...thanks!) Over the next few days, Chris would stop at our table at breakfast time and ask how our trip was going and make some more suggestions on things we might enjoy. Ana and Misty at the Fun Desk answered all of our questions about the different activities available on Key West, and helped us set up a moped rental and a snorkel/sunset cruise. We also did the jetski tour around the island, which was great. Our guides were friendly and funny, and everyone in our group (even the inexperienced riders) had a great time. I know that not all of the rooms are finished being renovated yet, but our room was beautiful and looked just like the picture on the hotel website. The bathroom (shower only) was bright and very roomy. We had a waterfront room and spent a lot of time laying in the hammocks or sitting on the bench enjoying the warm sand on our toes and cool breeze off the water. Wireless didn't reach the bayfront room but was available in the restaurant and lobby, as well as some of the outside areas. We ate breakfast in the Lighthouse Restaurant twice, and it was delicious and very reasonably priced. The one time we ate dinner there the service was a little slow, but the food was wonderful and they had good live music playing so we just sat back and enjoyed ourselves. I am pretty sure that this is the first vacation I have ever really relaxed on, and I owe a lot of that to Ibis Bay. Instead of stressing out about how to entertain ourselves the whole time we just went with the flow. Chris said he is working on setting up a website that will help customize your vacation before you even check in, and I can't wait to see the results. He also said he is going to try to keep the cost down (we paid $149 for a waterfront queen! In Key West!) and I am just praying he is able to do that with all of the improvements he is planning.

You have to sign a checklist of all these fees if you do something like lose your key. (Apparently they only have 1 key to the room HA!) They say if you lose your key they will charge you $85 for a locksmith to replace the lock. So we go to our room and it is nice that they painted but they didn't air out the room at all. We smelled paint so strong for the 2 days we were there. The room was tiny, basically all they could fit in there was a king bed and a tiny table. There was no alarm clock, hair dryer, coffee maker, ice bucket, luggage stand wifi only at the bar, refrigerator, microwave, or even a tub, small stand up shower only. The bathroom in general was so small I could practically put my arms out and reach both walls give or take a foot. Thankfully the AC was loud so our baby could sleep otherwise we would have heard loud and clear the drunken music playing at the bar. Also the live music that was there my husband and I thought it was karaoke it was so bad. The bed was hard and not that comfortable the comforter had stains and rough spots as well. We had a small window but you couldn't really open the blinds because people walking by all the time could see right in your room. The service at the restaurant the 1st night was very slow and we were with a wedding which pretty much took up the whole hotel and they only gave 1 waitress to about 40 of us. The food at the restaurant was pretty bad we had dinner and breakfast there and it was average at best. The fruit bowl was warm and tasted spoiled as well. We chose to do to Denny's the next day. They have a little sandy area that has a turtle fenced in that I thought was rather sad. They also have a giant cage with parrots as well. The customer service over all was horrible. We even got to see the honeymoon suite that our friends were staying in and it was huge but kind of disgusting. The refrigerator was old and rusted like it had been left outside for years and they had a sign posted on the ac that you couldn't put the air lower than 75 because it would freeze up. So the bride and groom had to go buy fans for the room and the groom was sweating like crazy the day of the wedding because it was so hot in there. The pictures online are seriously misleading the rooms look pretty with the new paint and the TV but that is about it. Not to mention the TV only had 6 channels and they were all local ones. For a little more money you can stay at the Marriott right next door and you know what you are getting with the big chain. All the advertisements for this hotel are misleading. It is more a motel, we didn't see any spa, there is no wifi, or cable in the rooms. Absolutely worst stay at any hotel we have ever been to.

I tried finding the restaurant to do a separate review, but it is not listed separately. My husband and I hopped into the restaurant for a nice relaxing lunch one afternoon. The restaurant had plenty of seating and was not too busy. It is a seat yourself restaurant, which may be part of the problem we had. After we sat down, it took about 15 minutes for anyone to even notice us, even though the tables around us were being served. Finally a a waitress comes over and takes our drink order, 2 ice teas, then disappears. We wait again for another 5 to 10 minutes until a very nice, large man comes over and asked if we had been helped yet. We tell him someone took our drink order but that was a long time ago and nothing since. We didn't even have place settings yet or menus. He says something about a change of shift and the waiters and waitresses were confused or struggling to figure out which tables they had, really?! Finally a new waiter comes out with our drink order and menus, then he too disappears. 30 minutes into this visit and he had menus and 2 ice teas. We would have left, but I guess we are just too nice to up and leave, plus we had nothing better to do than enjoy each others company and relax. This whole time 2 tables next us have their waitresses hovering over them and are never gone more than 5 minutes. Of course both of these tables had about 5 or 6 people at them so I am assuming the better service was because of the expected larger tip... Our waiter comes back and we order the Peanut butter and bacon sandwich, a turkey sandwich and a house salad. Poof, he is gone again. We don't see him again until our salad is delivered 20 minutes later, the rest of the food followed about 15 minutes later. We couldn't help but notice that people on the other side of the restaurant that sat down after us had already had their food and were about to pay by the time our food started to arrive! The waiter was very abrupt and borderline rude. When we finally got our sandwiches and were eating, the waiter did come over once to check on my husband, completely ignoring me. He looked right at him and said, \"How is your sandwich sir? Can I get you anything else?\" I just looked at my husband like, really? Our ketchup bottle on our table was empty, and when mentioning it to the waiter he was like, okay, what do you want me to do about it, grabbed a ketchup bottle of another table and left the empty one for the next table to have nothing... Only after our meal was done and we gave our credit card and local ID card to the waiter was he friendly and conversational, almost too conversational like trying to make up for the bad service kind of chummy! We arrived a little before 2p and didn't get out of there until after 4p - 2 hours for ice tea and sandwiches! Service was very disappointing. The food; however, was okay. Nothing spectacular, limited menu selection and a bit on the pricey side. Better sandwiches can be made at home.

I echo what another reviewer said, which is that if you are looking for luxury, do not stay here, but if you are looking for a quiet, clean place to stay, then consider the Ibis. This was formerly the \"Blue Lagoon Sports Motel\" which I was told had a spotty reputation. New owners are trying to change this back to a value place to stay and I think they are succeeding. Our room was small/spartan, but it was clean, freshly painted, and served as a great starting and ending point for our stay. We did not want to spend a lot of money on our hotel since we planned on being out most of the time. The Ibis fit that bill. You can wake up, walk to their patio/outdoor bar/restaurant and get a great latte for $2.50 and breakfast that is reasonably priced, then go downtown to enjoy Key West. The pros of the Ibis were the cost (and free parking), location, cleanliness, and quiet. Cons were the somewhat loud AC unit, waterfront (which is just a man-made bay with rocky shoreline), and small size of the room. The support staff were all kind, but we did have to ask for items that we had requested in our reservation, like a refrigerator and hair dryer. We also asked for a microwave, but we never got one, but that was OK because I'm not sure where it would have fit into our room. Another pro was that across the street is a large grocery store/pharmacy. It also has a nice salad/fruit/soup bar so if you want to save some money, you can make yourself a big salad to go. I would recommend a waterfront room. Being able to open the sliding door and sit outside made the room seem larger and more private. We never used the pool even though it looked great. We only ate breakfast there, so I can't comment on dinner but they did have live entertainment when we returned from our days out. I was concerned with possible noise (neighbors, live music, street noise), but that was never a problem. Also, there is not bathtub, just a shower which is fine for us, but may be important to you. Not to be rude, but one of my criteria for an OK bathroom is if I can sit on the toilet and close the door without hitting my legs. You can. Still, the bathroom is small, but servicable. All in all, the Ibis is more like a motel than a hotel, giving you the basics. But if you are looking for a reasonably priced place to use as a starting point, then I would recommend adding this to your list of possible places to stay. Outside of the Ibis, we drove into town each day (less than 5 minute drive). If you are going to spend all day downtown, then use the city's parking ramp at the corner of Grinnell and Caroline. Thirteen dollars for covered parking that's located right at the beginning of the boardwalk. If you want to park for free, then we found we could still find places a few blocks off of Duval Street (the main street in town) if we got downtown by 9 am. Key West doesn't seem to wake up until 10:30ish so finding a spot wasn't hard for us. We would recommend going to Ft. Zachary State Park. Great snorkling, swimming, eating (picnic tables in the shade), restrooms, and you can see the sunset without the crowds (I included a picture). Seven dollars gets a car in for the entire day. You can leave and reenter that day as long as you save your receipt. Finally, we did a 4-hour snorkling/lunch trip with Capt Alex (Islescapes). It was great. Just my family, Capt Alex and his first mate. We had lunch on the beach of an island about 10 miles offshore that we basically had to ourselves. Capt Alex will make whatever you request for lunch. Snorkling was great by a lighthouse around 9 miles offshore then we snorkled by a sunken pirate ship nearer to the Keys. It was about $450, but if you can afford it, we'd recommend it.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cIbis Bay - I loved my stay!\u201d", "Author": "KdgTeacherYLS", "ReviewID": "UR99726484", "Content": "My firends and I were looking for somewhere to get away for our Midwinter break from teaching and this was the perfect place.

They were unable to give a refund, and we were told we'd have to come back when the manager was in. We arrived in the room. There was a cluster of someone else's hair in the sheets when we turned back the bedcovers. The room was bare bones, without even a working telephone or alarm clock, and tile floors. Almost none of the features listed on Expedia were actually available - no wireless internet, premium cable channels, etc. Wireless internet was available in the restaurant only.

If you eat here, don't get things that are supposed to be local specialites - these were almost always the worst things on the menu. The peel and eat shrimp and the stone crab claws were especially bad. The steak, the lobster ravioli, and the sandwiches were almost always good. Breakfast was reliable and tasty.

The room was quite attractive, otherwise. Paint was very nice, tile floor very nice, the 3D lizard on the bathroom wall was priceless! The room has a lot of potential.

I've been on some bad mattresses in my short life, but this one was the worst one I can remember. They were either quite old or extremely cheap mattresses. We pulled the cover back to check it out and the mattress didn't look old. My wife called the desk to see if we might be able to sacrifice the view of the bay for a more comfortable bed. They were very accomodating and we loaded up in preparation to move to a more comfortable room. Laz greeted me at the office and thought it would be wise to check out the mattress at 401 since they were newer. Bad news was that the mattress was the same as the one we left in the 200 building.

Laz was very professional and seemed to be committed to satisfying the customer (the other gentleman seemed aggravated at the attempt to help us out, but I neglected to get his name).
