PERFECT location: close enough to Piazza San Marco w/o the noise & beautiful views of the adjacent canal from our lobby terrace. 2.

Trust me, the room size is plenty large enough to accomplish what you need in a room. *In Italy, a 'double' bed is 2 twin beds together (yes, a 'king' as it is known in the states). 3. WONDERFUL service: not only did the staff accommodate us with a late check in (around 1 am), they printed out maps and highlighted directions to restaurants and places of interest we wished to find. ...don't waste your money on any other hotel in Venice.

The room was adequate and the bathroom was excellent and very clean. Staff were very helpful which must take some effort with such a high turnover. Breakfast was adequate but choice distinctly limited, and at peak times the space is just too small, so I recommend taking breakfast early to avoid the crush.

The Violino d'oro is to me, about the best location you can get in Venice. Over the San Moise bridge, down the sal san moise and you are in St Marks , in the other direction,down calle largo xxii, 10 to 15 minute stroll gets you to the accedemia,passing on the way, my favourite watering hole in all of Venice, Tarnowskis bar, and through a narrow street with the best pizza sold from a little shop making it on site, cant remember the name,but I know where for the next time. On entering the hotel reception, you are brought back to the real venice, wonderful chandeliers and heavy drapes,and more importantly, great staff.The staff, especially Claudia, who seemed to be working every hour we were staying there are all very pleasent, and always willing to stop for a chat. The room on the second floor was the highlight, like walking back in time, big by venice hotel standards, more chandeliers, heavy drapes and flock wallpaper. there were 3 windows in the room, two looking down over the canal, and one, looking down over the san moise bridge. In the mornings, we would open the shutters and watch venice come to life, gondoliers sprussing up their craft ready for the days work. Then during the day , the bridge came to life with locals dashing back and forth, and the trippers and tourists getting their photo opportunities in,and listening to the singing as the gondolas swept past in a never ending train.We had only been there a few hours,and on return to the room, there was a bottle of prosecco and glasses to welcome us as return guests to our second home(claudias words not mine?) Breakfast was plentiful and good quality, and mention has been made in past reviews about the tea/coffee making machines, best coffee I had in Venice. there is a small bar, which seems to open at all hours, had a few drinks there in the evening before retiring , and am still waiting for the bill, its that sort of place.The hotel was spotlessly clean,and for 3 star, it is the best, why it is only in the sixties out of four hundred plus hotels in venice in the ratings, escapes me. In conclusion, for the price, a wonderful place to stay, we WILL return, and hopefully room 203 will be at our disposal again", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTHE Place to Stay In Venice\u201d", "Author": "Leegns", "ReviewID": "UR122177930", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel in late September and loved every minute of it.

The rooms were roomy enough. The only thing is that they use two twin beds to form a queen, but this is normal I guess. No big deal, we managed! LOL They had two new automatic coffee machines that gave you a myriad of various coffee choices which was very cool. We never used the bar but they have one if you want a glass of wine.

The bathroom in our room was set up for handicap access and there was no shower stall, just a corner of the room with a shower curtain around it. This made it difficult to keep the rest of the room dry. We had a corner room on the first floor with a view of the canal. I really enjoyed watching the gondoliers in the canal and we often took a glass of wine out onto the small balcony in the hall to enjoy the view. The 3rd floor terrace that is advertised is between two of the 3rd floor rooms and it felt like we were intruding when we went up there. Overall the location was good, but it is in the busiest part of the city and the crowds can be overwhelming during the daytime. The breakfast was probably the worst we had on our entire trip. Very limited choices of cereal and pastries, coffee from a machine, and a very crowded room that was difficult to move around in. The service was friendly but a bit reserved.

I really appreciated this whenever we made our way back from a long day sightseeing as it was always very easy to find, and very easy to get back to by vaparetto from anywhere else in the city. This was also much appreciated when pulling our suitcases on arrival and departure as you don't wanna be lugging them over bridges for half an hour to your hotel. The location is also quite picturesque, right next to canal with various gondeliers and a small square complete with church. Serivce from the staff was very good. We never called on them much as we never needed anything but check in and out was painless, they were friendly and spoke english, which is all you can ask for really. There is also the facility to leave your bags with reception at check out if necessary. The room, no. 111, was very nice. Small, was my immediate thought when walking in which slightly concerned me at first but we soon found out this was still more than adequate for our needs. Furniture was a desk with small TV, no english channels, although it's always more fun to watch the Italian ones anyway, enormous wardrobe which took up about half the width of the room and could have really been done away with to make more space. We didn't use it on our short stay. Bed was large and very comfortable, pillows likewise, we never had trouble sleeping and the lack of any traffic noise outside helps too. :) Bathroom was also small but perfectly useable, very warm, towels were changed every day. Shower was fine, small. Not a problem for us but if you of a larger nature it would be a bit difficult to move around. Both rooms were spotlessly clean and cleaned every day.

The bed was comfortable, the storage space was minimal. We overlooked the square which was nice and not noisy in spite of the crowds in September. Room could stand a bit of freshing up. It looked well used. Bathroom was tiny but immacutely clean. Breakfast was just ok. Selection doesn't vary and we stayed for 4 nights. Coffee and rolls were good so who needs more? The staff was extremely helpful especially Gianni the night desk person. He suggested places to eat and sites to see. And every evening it was a treat to see and talk with him on our way out to dinner. It rained the last day as we were leaving Venice and one of the staff helped us to a water taxi, which the hotel had reserved for us. He carried my bag, which was heavy, a long distance through back alleys to the boat. Location is great near everything. You can walk all over Venice from here. It was expensive, over $300/night in September. We had a much better deal in Rome and a much nicer room there. But this is Venice and it is a very expensive city.

Even though we were only staying for a night, they had prepared a chilled bottle of sparkling wine. The lady at the counter was also very helpful and friendly! Breakfast was decent and I would say overall it's been value for money, beautifully and tastefully done up, very venetian - perfect! Our hotel room was exactly what it looked like shown in the hotel website photos (don't expect huge rooms as I think almost all places in Venice are smaller in size anyway), and the location was excellent with the hotel just being a short walk away from San Marco, and but a stone's throw away from all the boutiques! The weather was slightly damp for us this time in Winter, but the wonderful location meant that we could walk almost anywhere and everywhere! I loved the view out to the small canal outside our window, where we could see some gondolas in the day, and I wish we had more time in Venice and the hotel! I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers for a romantic stay in Venice!", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe Violino d'Oro was perfect\u201d", "Author": "capecod1", "ReviewID": "UR6334350", "Content": "We stayed here last year as part of a large family trip and loved it.

Steps from San Marco yet none of the heavy tourist traffic nor noise. Probably most important was the ease of getting there with luggage. Very close to the San Marco vaporetto stop with only one smallish bridge to lug your stuff over. A bonus was the elevator. While the room was very spacious (triple with plenty of room for our 18-year old daughter, myself and husband), the shower is small. Despite this my husband (6'5 and about 235 lbs) managed just fine. Breakfast was quite good. The beds were wonderful! Although a little worn in spots, it was exceptionally clean and neat and the value was unbeatable! Venice is an expensive city (we spent an average of 160 euros/night for dinner--typically only 2 courses and wine) so we felt we got a terrific value for stay at Violino d'Oro. We bought the Venicecard which was handy for getting to Venice from the airport (by bus) and then to the hotel but found that after boarding the vaparetto from the bus station, we were never asked to show proof of purchase so you could probably easily get away with buying a one-way ticket on the vaparetto. One the other hand, the Venicecard allowed us to skip long lines to buy tickets to Doge Palace, etc. as well as freely travel back and forth from island to island. Beware, however, the vaparetto can be VERY crowded with lots of pushing. My purse (thank God without our passports in it!) was stolen on our ride in the vaparetto to the train station to leave Venice. It was a large bag and I had it looped over my luggage handle along with several other bags. I still can't figure out how or when it was stolen during that relatively short boat ride. . . My advice would be to never have it off your person and have at least one hand holding it tight.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Violino d'Oro", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d238969-Reviews-Hotel_Violino_d_Oro-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$165 - $383*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">San Marco, 2091</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Campiello Barozzi</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30124</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "238969", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/06/58/065860058a8f5bf884931c16adc72b079large.jpg"}}
