{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A real find This hotel was recommended by a local bartender, and it was well worth the price of a beer! As the previous reviewer has noted, the rooms are small and pretty basic, but are imacculately clean and airy (nice high ceilings); mine even had a huge terrace overlooking the terracotta roofs of Florence. It's a family-run place, and the owners are incredibly friendly and helpful. The breakfast is pretty basic, but enough to kick-start you for the day. If you're hung up on minibars and TVs this may not be for you - but I don't know why anybody would come to Flroence to watch TV. The only real downside is that the beds aren't great - if you have a bad back you may find them too soft. Also, there's no airconditioning so it may get pretty hot in high summer.The best things? The location, which could scarcely be better, tucked behind some of the city's nicest streets, near to the river. And the price, which is astonishingly low.I've given it four stars rather than five but if you're on a budget, this is hugely nicer than those tacky backpacker hostels for not that much more money", "Date": "May 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR871455931", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BritishDavid"}, {"Content": "Excellent hospitality Cheap one star hotel in the heart of the most expensive shopping areas in Florence.
