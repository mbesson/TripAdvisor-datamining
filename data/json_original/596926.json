The rooms are large and functional: If you want to recharge a phone/computer etc. do be aware that you need to have the roomlights lit ( including bedside lights ) in order to do this. Turn off the lights and there is no power to sockets. Try to get a room with a balcony, you get more square footage that way. Be aware that the safety boxes in the rooms are rather odd; after you have shut the door and plotted in your code there will bean 8-10 second \"wait\" before the box actually shuts tight.The green light has to go out before the box is shut. Wi-fi is expensive; the signal is very dodgy in the rooms, slightly better in the lobby ( though you still have to pay) My advice? Go down to the lobby,exit, turn right and turn first left to the first internet caf\u00e9, much cheaper amd a lot faster ;o) Avoid breakfast even if it is included in your rate.. it is chaotic, really noisy,at times inedible and very slow. I have to add to this that I found the Reception and Housekeeping Staff to be very friendly, accommodating and helpful; they did their very best and were, at all times, professional and effective.

Prior to going I had communication with the hotel via email. http://www.mayfairdubai.ae/ The hotel offered to send their bus to pick us up from the airport and the driver was there waiting for us as at arrivals. The journey to hotel is pretty short and it is possible to take the metro from the airport to hotel. There is a metro station less than 10 minute walk from the hotel. In one of our rooms there was some smell, once we informed reception they very promptly arranged a different room for us. The rooms are fairly large and clean. Air conditioning, fridge, telephone and tv in every room. The plug sockets are the same as UK sockets. You can pay at reception to acess the wireless internet. The breakfast provided until 10am was good with toast, cereal, juice, croissants, boiled eggs, tea, coffee and different cooked options each day. At the top floor there is a small pool and well equipped but small gym. The hotel location is very good, there were always taxis passing by the front of the hotel and reception will order a taxi for you if you ask. There is a 24 hour supermarket close by, an internet cafe and kebab shop across the road. There are two atms behind the building across the road. There is a kfc near the metro station about 10 minutes away. A taxi from the hotel to jumeirah beach hotel cost about 60AED.

The budget is highly moderate and the location is the best. I happened to stay with my parents-in-laws when they came to Dubai on transit. The hotel is well maintained and spacious. They have designed all rooms very smartly that we get best views of the nearby roads and skyscraper bldgs. Infact all kind of luxury is packed in this small hotel. There is a small swimming pool on rooftop, a good gym, a sauna/steam bath facility and a large multi-cuisine restaurant. The morning buffet is not good, as they offers typical western food only which is limited to eggs, breads, pastries and bacons. No Ala-carte is available. But that is not a issue. More than 4 dozen of hotels of all nationalities and tastes are located within walking distance of this hotel and hence its not a major issue.

There was a small disco on second floor and our room was on fifth floor,then the voice of disco doesn`t disturb us. Receptions are impolite and they didn`t friendly at all. It had a free transfer to Almamzar beach every day at 8 o`clock. Also It is definitely only a 3 star not 4 star hotel but we had a enjoyable travel in there.

There were so many hotels to choose from and after deliberating for so long, chose the Mayfair in Deira and we were not let down. We arrived around midnight, were offered a welcome drink whilst we checked in and our frist impressions were good. Room was good, although only 3/5 due to not having a balcony, very clean otherwise with a mini bar, which we used as a fridge to store water, juices and milk etc bought (very cheaply) from the supermarket opposite. There is also tea/coffee facilities. There is a bar serving alcohol upstairs, if you want it, a restaurant serving a very good breakfast, a night club on the mezzanine floor (although we did not go). The hotel has a small but surprisingly under used swimming pool on the roof which was ideal for us. A few cheap local eateries opposite. Taxis are very cheap, but a word of warning, avoid the private cabs outside the hotel, they charge double the official cabs rate. we particularly liked and used for three of the four days we were there, the hotel's own shuttle bus to the beach at al Mamseer Beach Park, leaves at 8.45 and returns about 1pm. I would both recommend and return to this hotel. A couple of tips for 1st timers, we had a couple of excellent evenings out, based on recommendations to us, take a taxi to the Irish Village at the Tennis stadium, there are 4 or 5 excellent places to eat where alcohol is available, and best of all, it was my wife's birthday, so we went to the Market Place at the JW Marriot Hotel for the most excellent all you can eat and drink international buffet, cost about \u00a365 per head, worth every penny!

I was nervous after reading all the bad reviews on TA but the tour operator couldn't get us into any other hotels for the dates we wanted to go. Overall, my sister and I had a fairly good time at the hotel. It is definitely really only a 3 star hotel on its best day. I found the hotel to be reasonably priced and although it wasn't in the best shape my sister and I didn't care too much. We went to Dubai explore and take in the culture. Our hotel didn't matter that much, as long as it was safe, and it was. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a good breakfast bar with a reasonable selection of food. The Jeep Safari we booked through the hotel was an amazing experience. The company they used was a good one; the drivers were all safe, friendly and did their best to make sure we had a good time. The hotel pool was small but clean. We were the only girls using the pool, though, so there was a LOT of staring going on, especially by the men in the pool area. Granted, we were the only ones wearing bikinis but I felt uncomfortable enough that I left after 30 minutes. The bad: We showed up at the airport and no one was there to pick us up. We were surrounded by hundreds of people, mostly men, trying to take us into their taxis and we couldn't figure out where our driver was. It was a little scary. I had to call them a few times before someone finally picked us up. They apologized for the miscommunication though. Our hotel bathroom smelled funny, almost a faint sewage like smell but nothing happened the whole time we were there and we saw no bugs so we were relieved. The hotel has shuttle buses to beaches in the vicinity. The bus we took was supposed to leave at 9am and everyone was sitting waiting for the bus driver. He spent 45 minutes talking to various people, chatting and smoking. I know things happen on middle eastern time here but I finally had enough and went to the front desk and complained, and we left shortly after. The hotel is situated in Deira so although it's close to some things, it's also really far some other locations and we spent a lot of money taking taxis back and forth. I think I'd probably find a hotel in Jumeirah next time...hotels there are more expensive, but you'd save time and money on getting around so that would even things out. Overall, though, a few minor glitches, but nothing that affected us greatly or ruined the trip for us. Would I go back?

There is a swimming pool that we made good use of as well as a fitness room and sauna. The hotel offers free airport transfers which is a great help. Our flight out of Dubai wasn't leaving until 11pm. The hotel told us we could have the room until 3pm (normal check out is 12pm) then they put our luggage in storage whilst we went for lunch and some last minute shopping.

This supposed 4 Star Hotel wouldn't even rate a 1 from me, and I have stayed in some rough hotels over the years. Some of the high points of my stay: - The car from the hotel, that was supposed to pick me up at the airport, never showed. I searched for the car for twenty five minutes, and then took a cab to the hotel. When I mentioned this to the rude young man at the desk, he accused me of missing my ride. I later mentioned this to the manager and he offered to compensate me for the cab I took. Compensation was never forthcoming. - The contents of the mini-bar were never replenished during my entire stay. The inventory sheet for the mini-bar didn't even come close to matching the contents of the refrigerator. On the morning that I was checking out, I received a knock on my door four minutes after the wake-up call. It was a young man coming to inventory the mini bar. - The hotel supposedly had a Russian disco and a restaurant. These were advertised on their website, in the lobby, the elevator and the room. Neither of these existed, nor had existed in the recent past. - The bar at the pool was a small, abandoned kiosk, with an empty refrigerator and no attendant. The pool furniture was filthy plastic and heavily stained lounges. - Toileteries in the room were never replenished during my entire stay. - The room was made up whenever the staff decided to get around to it. On one day, I returned to my room at 1430 and the room still wasn't made up. - I brought back a friend for a drink at their roof top bar, and I was told by the desk man that guests were not allowed to have guests in the hotel. - I sought a cash advance on my credit card for some gifts, and was rudely refused by the desk man and his assistant. When I asked for directions to another establishment that might be able to help me, I was met with a stoney silence. - The complimentary breakfast was marginal, and I never did get asked if I wanted coffee or tea. - I leaned back in my chair one night and felt a sharp pain. Tacks from the upholstery had come out and stuck me. - I decided to visit a friend at another hotel and went outside to get a cab. The two bellmen were completely ignoring me. I was approached by a young man who asked me if I wanted a hotel car to take me to my friend. When I asked the price, he quoted me a figure three times what a cab would have cost. I refused and sought a cab. That is when I noticed the young man waving cabs away from the hotel. Well, there you have it.Make your choices in Dubai wisely.
