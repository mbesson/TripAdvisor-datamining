After checking out the options on Trip Advisor it basically looked to be a lot of your standard chain hotels, and then this place. The cost was pretty close, so I figured we'd try out the I. First, the decor is great...from the lobby to the room. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was probably the nicest I've had in a hotel at the price we paid ($100/nt for a king bed room). Overall, it was a pretty good nice stay. If I'm in Champaign for a night ever again, I would consider staying here again. A few notes: for breakfast you get vouchers for a free coffee and pastry at the on-site coffee shop. If you want something more, you can use the same voucher for 50% off at the restaurant...which was pretty good. After tip, it cost us another $14 for the two of us, so consider that if you're pricing things out with other hotels and genreally enjoy something more than a coffee and muffin for breakfast. Also, you can use the hotel's Roku box if you want an in-room movie...for a $15/day charge. A bit steep if you were just hoping to stay in for an evening and watch a movie considering it was likely basically a $60 investment on the hotel's side. Finally, along the lines of the television...when will hotels figure out how to have HD signals on their brand new HDTV's??? Nothing but analog standard def stretched out onto the nice LCD HDTV here.

I have stayed here three times in the past year. Each time, same thing: wonderful when you get to the room (although just marginally clean) but terrible, horrible, customer service. First time: problem finding our reservation (we'd made 6 months prior) but finally found it. No apology. Then Houlihans restaurant was almost empty but took us over 2 hours to get lunch and pay for it. Second time I stayed, extremely rude front desk staff who would not tell us where to go for drinks, nor could they tell us best place to pick up the bus, and worse, when my spouse called at 10 pm, the main hotel number just rang and rang. Nobody answered! He tried 15 minutes later, same thing. This time, we made reservations 6 months prior, then two months ago I called to ask for late checkout. The person asked the manager and was given permission. We arrived and were told that regrettably they could not offer late checkout. We had to be out by 11 am. I asked why they could not have called or emailed me that. Was told, \"we are booked tomorrow and have to clean rooms.\" No I'm sorry, not at all willing to negotiate. Our room was $189! Much, much higher than the Hilton Garden in down the road which is very nice too. I was told I could come down to the lobby later in the evening and \"try to catch the manager.\" I said no, the manager could call me in my room. Of course the manager did not ever call. It seems the problem with the I Hotel is that they are not willing to work with a customer like a Hilton or Hyatt, or even a Super 8 is. They are always right, and never willing to look into something (like, where to get a bus). They say \"I can't help you.\" This is NOT a way to get repeat business.

We could totally sue for negligence. At any rate, the new room had a funny smell and an odd hum, which was later identified as the air conditioner of the conference center. Nothing they could do. They had no other room to change us to, and actually offered to give us a \"discount\" on another room! Further, the handicapped room had no place to hang clothes that were knee length (as if disabled people do not either travel with able bodied people).
