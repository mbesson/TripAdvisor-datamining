{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not ageing particularly well but a view to die for. The standard Superior room was very bog standard. The room felt a lot like the room of a homestay rather than a hotel charging as it does. We actually got a free upgrade for a reason that I'm sure is an isolated one-off so I won't mention it and the next room was far better and a pleasure to be in.However, the whole place had the feeling of a place that has been left to fend for itself. I can imagine the place ten years ago would have been incredible, but dust gathers, bulbs are left blown here and there, a little rubbish is left in places and mildew continues to flourish as the maintenance is left by the way side.The staff were great but I couldn't help but feel that they should be scrubbing the place clean rather than sitting about during the quiet times. The saving grace of Cahaya Dewata is the view. The restaurant and most rooms offer an incredible view of an incredible jungle valley with a white water river at the bottom - it is worth seeking out for a meal at the restaurant even if you don't stay, but I couldn't get away from the fact that the lack of maintenance made the place feel a little on the decrepid side. Very nice for a few days but not quite nice enough to return to.", "Date": "Sep 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR277240339", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "roskolewis"}, {"Content": "Affordable Hotel with a Priceless View We stayed at the Cahaya Dewata for three nights as we wanted to get a taste of Bali away from the busy beach resorts and the tiresome beach sellers.This short stay proved to be the highlight of the holiday and elevated Ubud to the top of my list of favourite places in the world!The hotel was an hour\u9225\u6a9a drive from Sanur on the coast and we passed through some of the most stunning countryside I have ever seen.The Cahaya Dewata was situated about 10 minutes from the centre of Ubud in a small hamlet called Kedewatan. Our room was enormous, though rather bare and a bit dusty, but all of these slight faults were forgotten the moment we stepped onto our balcony. The view was stupendous over the Ayung River valley. The lushness of the vegetation, the different shades of green, the curving slopes of the rice terraces and the river far below, were literally beyond words, and no amount of poetic waffle on a hotel review site can adequately describe the sight spread in front of us. As the evening drew in, faint singing and music floated up from valleys further afield.The gorgeous village of Ubud is ten minutes away. We decided to walk into Ubud along the country lanes but unfortunately managed to walk in completely the opposite direction. After a couple of hours and a massive circular tour, we eventually arrived.Ubud is a wonderful village and is one of those places that cannot fail to lodge itself in your memory for years to come.I shall definitely return to Ubud. I\u9225\u6a93 not sure whether I\u9225\u6a87 stay in the Cayaha Dewata again, but as long as I have a view of the Ayung River I\u9225\u6a93 not too bothered.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR853599527", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "testla"}, {"Content": "What A View!!! (and at earthly prices too!) The 3 of us (all male adults) stayed at the Cahaya Dewata in late Jul'07. I had arranged to have their staff pick us up from another hotel at 1300hrs. But they arrived at 1200hrs - an hour early! With two hotel reps to pick us up, I was impressed.The hotel was very peaceful and quiet when we arrived. It was as if we were the only guests there. We only got to meet other hotel guests at meal times.We got a junior suite as requested. It was large and decent. We got a queen and single bed with only three pillows. That meant one per person! We asked for additional pillows, which were brought to us promptly. The bathroom towels were thin, not plush. The airconditioning unit worked perfectly. And we got hot showers when needed.The room looked a little tired from age. The pictures on the internet were definitely touched-up. But the view from our room was indeed spectacular!!! We got the Ayung river lulling us to sleep every night. And the view of the river meandering along the padi/rice terraces made up for the underwhelming room interiors and decor.The food and beverage was nice. Not splendid, but nice. The buffet luncheon was adequate. The Ayung Restaurant offers sweeping view of the valley. Try to get the corner and outer most table and you'll get a commanding 270-degree view! Breathtaking!!! It was a balancing act trying to enjoy the view at meal times as the waiting staff at the restaurant were always eager to engage us in friendly conversation.We took a walk around the compound of the Cahaya Dewata one late aftrenoon. We discovered hidden wings of the hotel that have been left bare and abandoned. There were interesting nooks and crannies. It felt as if what was once an enchanted and majestic hotel has been swallowed up by the forest. A little moss on the wall here, a little cobweb there. Rustic and charming. We even found a dining chair perched on a platform looking out into the valley, and left there for months -years, maybe-, exposed to the elements on an abandoned terrace.The water in the pool looked a little cloudy. It'd be better if you swim in the river nearby. We did!!! There is a path from the hotel that leads to the Ayung river below. You'll get to balance on the bunds of the rice field on your way down.Cahaya Dewata is not for the faint-hearted. It is suitable for the romantic adventurer looking for character and the true rural Balinese experience. We heard rats scurrying in the attic at night, had a 5-legged spider (yes, 5 !!!) crawl out from our outdoor balcony out into the forest, and had a 6-inch garden snake cross our path on the garden stairs. All harmless creatures that made our stay truly exciting.When we were checking out of the hotel, we did it with a heavy heart as we'd made friends with the hotel staff who was very friendly (they seemed somewhat eager to leave the place with us!). It is interesting to note that some of them are trained cultural performers. By day, they are bellhops and waiters. But, by night, they transform into dewis and kecak performers in Ubud's performing arenas. We caught up with them after their shows backstage.I will definitely come back for the view and the staff. Expect the unexpected here.Four Seasons or Westin, it is not. You'll be sorely disappointed. But the view, the peace and tranquility. Priceless!!! Even those hotels cannot beat this place on these accounts(and at these prices!!!).", "Date": "Jul 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR141983242", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Brio_30"}, {"Content": "Nice view, service not good We stayed at Cahaya Dewata for 4 days in August. The hotel has very nice views to the jungle and the river, but it is old. We had booked a junior suite, which was a very big room, but very old and not like the pictures in hotel\u9225\u6a9a website. So, we asked for the junior suite which was shown in the picture and had a four-poster bed. The next day we were taken to a room with a four-poster bed which looked newer than the first one. We decided to stay at that room because the bed and the bathroom were much better. Although, nobody from hotel\u9225\u6a9a staff mentioned that this room was NOT a junior suite and that we had paid for a junior suite and finally stayed in a deluxe or superior room (I don\u9225\u6a9b know). We were very disappointed from this behavior. In general, the hotel and its service need improvements, but it is worth a visit for the very nice view.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR489329013", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "875"}, {"Content": "Not like their webpage Made a booking directly to the resort for a Delixe room. Called them of my late arrival. Arrived there at midnight after a long day. I was expecting a room just like their webpage. Boy! was I disappointed! It was far from what was featured on the webpage [--]The room was huge, facility in the room was adequate but does not look comfortable to the eyes. If you are expecting it to be like the pictures on the webpage, make sure you specify this. Even so, I actually asked for those rooms but were given to others even with conformation of my arrival time.The spa was excellent though. It is situated near the pool which is many steps lower (no high heel and no bad knees, these would make your stay here unbearable). It is overlooking the valley and the padi field below. Expect them to make you have your shower naked in the open air. Balinese believe that you are transparent when having a shower.If it rains, like now to mid January, you will find that the water actually flows on the steps from the spa/pool and your feet will get totally wet. Water looks clean though. For me this was a nice feeling. Menu is limited but edible.Good place to stay but just have a different expectation of the rooms, then you'd be okay.", "Date": "Nov 24, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR358948026", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LovesBali"}, {"Content": "\u93c5\ue21d\u58ca\u9287\ue218\u4e9c\u9287\u52e9\u20ac\u5098\u20ac\u5098\u4eb4\u9286\u4f77\u7cac\u9287\ue218\u4e97\u9288\u64b1\u4f28\u9288\u5a3f\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(20546957, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR616390209", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hashashas"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u4f75\u512f\u9289\u5fcb\u5130\u9289\u6c47\u5111\u9289\ue218\u506a   showReview(19913479, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR466779957", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Podr\u94c6a ser magn\u94c6fico pero...   showReview(10426885, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR545048592", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "VolandoVengo"}, {"Content": "\u93c5\ue21d\u58ca\u9287\u5c80\u790c\u93c5\u6dec\u501d\u9287\u693c\u4e9c\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19912842, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR758374699", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u64b1\u4f04\u93c5\ue21d\u58ca\u9287\ue1ba\u4ee7\u9288\u4f75\u4f00\u9287\u4ff1\u4ee7\u5a09\u5a3f\u4f28\u9288\u5a3f\u4ee7\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19910254, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR408667514", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u951b\u621d\u5bb3\u5a09\u5a3f\u4f28\u9287\uff43\u4ef8\u9287\u88e4\u4ee7\u9287\u5b28\u4eef...   showReview(19924540, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 25, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR310942632", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u3123\u501e\u9287\u5098\u4eaa\u9287\u6c33\ue511\u9287\uff43\u4ef8\u9287\u88e4\u4ef8...   showReview(19920791, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 27, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR546594967", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d577528-r19947090-Cahaya_Dewata_Resort_Spa-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "577528", "Price": "$130"}}
