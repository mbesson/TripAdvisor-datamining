There is a direct train from Fiumichino Airport to the hotel (just 200 meters away). Furthermore, there is a direct express bus (60) to the city center (Piazza Venezia), which is very convenient and fast. You can also get the 90/90D bus to and from Termini Station, which stops in front of the hotel. The property is relatively new, so it is very nice inside - both the public areas and rooms. The staff at the reception was friendly and helpful. At the bar not that much, but again in the satisfactory minimum. As a whole, I can definetely recommend the hotel to all travellers.

Only a short 15 min trip into the centre of Rome, bus stop is right outside. Take the No. 90 bus but most will head into centre. You have to take the 90 bus when heading back to hotel. Hotel is clean, staff freindly and helpful, breakfast is nice and plenty of it, bar prices are good for Rome, only 2.50 Euro for bottle of beer, restraunt has nice food at reasonable prices. Our room was a good size on forth floor with a nice bathroom, road noise was not loud enough to keep you awake. I would stay there again and recomend it to freinds. A good tip is to buy an all day bus ticket for only 4 Euro's which will take you anywhere in the city for about 12 hours on the bus or underground ( Metro )", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "@", "Title": "\u201cOverall nice\u201d", "Author": "Guest0987", "ReviewID": "UR124651567", "Content": "Nice new hotel. It is not in the center which must be understood before booking. Single room was small, literally I had difficulties to put all my things, bathroom was perfect. TV system was complicated but lots of foreign channels. Very good breakfast for 3 stars hotel (coffee from coffee machine wasn't so good). The only one complaint, I don't know what for they turned on music in the corridors on a Sunday morning.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Curitiba", "Title": "\u201cVery good option\u201d", "Author": "Kalcenter", "ReviewID": "UR122567042", "Content": "Excellent option not so far from the city centre (15 minutes by bus).

Ride to the heart of Rome was 15-20 min but to take the express bus there was a 5 min walk. The staff was very helpful, the rooms were clean and the bed very comfortable. The breakfast was good with scrambled eggs, bacon, bread, croissants and fruits The bathroom had a flexible shower head but there was no overhead structure to hold the shower head (we were told that some rooms do not have this feature!). However on our second day they fixed a structure to hold the shower head. The barrier to prevent the water getting on to the floor was not big enough to prevent water spillage; so had to be careful in taking showers. We had an issue with Best Western headquarters not having our reservation even though the hotel had the reservation. The issue was resolved on transit to Rome from USA but this gave some unnecessary anxiety and wasted time. The headquarters was not helpful in trying to resolve this. They need to improve their service on this.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN PLUS Art Hotel Noba", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1744816-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_PLUS_Art_Hotel_Noba-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$80 - $175*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Nomentana, 543</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00141</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1744816", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1b/0d/1b0d756af5e245a9b3ef9c812346f4a56large.jpg"}}
