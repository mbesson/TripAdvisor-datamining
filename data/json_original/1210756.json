For those of you taking the Airport Express Line, make a stop at Kowloon Station. There is a complimentary airport express shuttle bus (service K3) that runs every 10-12 minutes and it takes you directly to Hyatt Regency Tsim Sha Tsui (2nd stop). Do note that service K3 runs using a mini-bus, and it can get really packed, so do join the queue early so that you would have space to secure your luggage. The driver is a hell-rider so you have to be alert otherwise you might miss your stop or you might be hit by luggage that come flying off the rack. For those of you who wish to get a cab straight down, if the taxi driver is not familiar with the place, the entrance to the underground hotel porch/lobby is along Mody Road. The hotel is also easily via MTR specifically Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui Stations. From the mall, you may choose to exit from Carnarvon Road, Hanoi Road or Mody Road. There are road-level MTR access points to either station (they\u2019re connected underground) at the roads named above. I only found a lift along the access point on Hanoi Road. The other access points only have stairs. For the moderately mobile, I suggest going down to Basement 2 of K11 to find MTR Exit N4 (near misocool restaurant) instead. The lifts are somewhat complicated. The lifts that run within the mall is separate from the lifts that run within the hotel lobby and porch, and the latter itself is separate from the lifts which take you up to your rooms. You will understand when you get there, but I believe this is done for security of the hotel guests. The porters/bellboys are really friendly and constantly insist on handling your luggage for you. Tipping is optional here. There was a slight problem during check-in. I booked 3 rooms for my family of seven, and 2 of us were placed on a different floor. When we requested that our 3 rooms be placed on the same floor, the receptionist gladly obliged. He was very polite and courteous, and even arranged for two of the rooms to be connecting ones, for which I\u2019m really grateful. It made a really good first impression on the hotel and its staff. Even along the way up to our rooms, housekeeping staff would pause and greet us with warm smiles. It was as if they were telling us that, \u201cRest assured, here at Hyatt Regency, you would be well taken care of.\u201d Their service was put to the test over 5 days, and I must say that apart from several loopholes, the service was generally impressive. One of the toilets had a drainage issue which caused flooding when the toilet was flushed. Thankfully the whole incident was efficiently rectified with the prompt arrival of plumbers and housekeeping staff within minutes of calling guest services. Other instances include prompt delivery of an extra pillow when requested for. Then there are the discrepancies in service; for example, housekeepers give you new bedroom slippers each day but fail to replenish the coffee and tea. On my last night, they slipped a letter under our door containing a booking confirmation for airport transfer services (with additional charges) which we did not make. When we called up guest services to clarify the matter, the staff assured that they would check and get back to us but failed to do so. It was only after we approached hotel reception the next morning that the staff got round to checking. We were told that this was a mistake on their part. To err is human; such mistakes are understandable, but I just did not like the way they handled it. If we had not pursued it, we could have ended up paying unnecessarily for services we did not even request for. This really put a dent in the wonderful first impressions I got from this hotel. The interior of the hotel rooms have a simple yet nice modern touch to it. You can sit on the leather sofa by the length of the window to admire lovely scenic views depending on which direction your room is facing. I was lucky enough to get the room facing the Hong Kong Island side. It was really beautiful! No complains from me with regards to the room design, though I think this hotel would appeal more to travellers on business rather than families. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but the desk at the corner of the room really gives the room an \u201coffice\u201d vibe. The beds are very comfortable, the sheets are really soft; you would have no trouble sleeping at all. The mattress of the rollaway bed however, was thinner. When you sleep, you can feel the frame of the bed underneath. Pillows in this hotel are really thin and soft, so do request for an extra if you\u2019ve got a rollaway bed; they come with only one pillow, and it\u2019s very uncomfortable to sleep on. To be honest, the most fascinating part of the room is the toilet. Even the tap is designed to let water flow like a mini fountain! The toilet is really huge for Hong Kong standards! There is a standing shower accompanied by a bathtub. Even in the standing shower room itself, you can choose the conventional shower, or the overhead rain shower! The cupboard can be accessed from 2 ways, from the outside, or from inside the toilet as well. That way, you don\u2019t have to find places to put your clothing, all you need is to open the cupboard and grab what you need! The toilet has speakers too, so when you switch on the television, you can hear what\u2019s happening on television from inside the toilet. Pretty interesting stuff! All in all, my stay at this hotel was really enjoyable. I would\u2019ve like complimentary Wi-Fi though! Even though there were areas where there were shortfalls in service, I feel that as a whole, this hotel has some pretty high standards befitting of a 4\u00bd star-rating hotel.

When i inquired at the concierge then there was this guy (chinese like). I told him that i am looking for my visas , are they with you. Without thinking he said No they arent here Sir. I was not sure how can he say No so fast. I asked him to check the hotels mail maybe they are there. As a courtesy or to satisfy me he Should have checked again in front of me to satisfy me but he again said in a Flash Sir i have checked the system there arent no Visas. That was where i felt like i was getting Trash Service. Moreover he said if we get them you will be noticed in your room asap. I left the hotel came at night.

While it may not be as grand or opulent as the Grand Hyatt, this hotel ticks all the right boxes for me. First, I really love the location. It is smack bang in the middle of the hustle and bustle of TST. There is a free shuttle bus from the Airport Express station and there are numerous entrances to the MTR (subway) around the hotel, one of which is in the basement of the small shopping mall connected directly to the hotel. From these entrances, it is about a 5-min walk to both East TST and TST stations via moving walkways. Taxis are also plentiful. Being right in the heart of TST is great for shopping and the hotel is within walking distance too to the Avenue of the Stars for the nightly Symphony of Lights and also about a 10-min walk to the Star Ferry. Second, they really treat me very well here. Being a Hyatt Diamond member, I am always upgraded to a Harbour view room on a high floor with access to the Regency Club, even when I am staying for free on points. The room itself is somewhat small, but it is clean and modern, which I really like. The harbour view from the room is jaw-dropping no matter how many times I've been to Hong Kong. Third, the staff here is first rate, especially the staff at the Regency Club. The Club itself is also very nice, somewhat small but never gets very full, and I really like the design and interior and again, the harbor view. The food selection in the evenings and for breakfast is very limited but adequate. The service from the staff, while less polished compared to their colleagues at the Grand Hyatt, is still excellent and comes across as genuinely warm and friendly. The service does suffer during busier times at breakfast, where it is sometimes difficult to get the table cleared or to get another cup of coffee, etc., but it is by no means the staff's fault. The problem is they only have about 1-2 staff at any one time during service hours, but I can see that the staff does work really hard so I don't mind a bit of waiting.

The hotel is very modern and almost feels like a W hotel. The rooms had the standard twin double beds and a long bench in front of the window. We had 2 different rooms during our stay (we left for Macau for 2 days) and the first room had a view over the pools and the 2nd had views of Victoria Harbor. The bathroom was perfect for families. There is an large shower open on one side facing the tub. The kids could splash around in the tub without getting the floor wet and then get dried off in the shower area after their bath. The double mirrors over the sink was actually a sliding door that could open up to the room. You could watch the kids in the room or watch tv while brushing your teeth. There was also a door in the bathroom that accessed the closet so that you didn't have to bring any clothes into the bathroom, just have it ready in the closet. They also offered all the amenities (toothbrush, razor, cotton swabs, comb etc.) and the housekeeping services were excellent. We had the breakfast buffet included in our package, which included meals for 2 adults and 2 kids. They had an excellent selection of fruit juices - watermelon, honeydew, grapefruit, and orange. There was 2 types of congee available with all the usual topping and the fried dough sticks. There was also a noodle soup station. There was dim sum and other chinese food available but these were not their best dishes. I like the pancake and Belgium waffles that were made to order next to the egg station, which made fried eggs, scrambled, or omelets to order. There was also ham, bacon, canadian bacon, and a smoked salmon. The breakfast pastries were also good - I liked the pain au chocolat. My husband used the gym facilities and thought it was very updated and well equipped. We did not have time to try out the pools, though we did see other guests swimming from our room. The location is the only thing that could be improved at the wonderful hotel. The hotel is actually located in East Tsim Sha Tsui. Even though you can access the MTR area quickly, either across the street from the hotel where there is an elevator (we had a stroller) or through the K11 mall, the actual entrance to the MTR area is at least a 7-10minute walk (there are 2 people movers and an open area before you get the the station's G exit). The hotel is located in between 2 MTR lines. So while it is nice that you can walk underground to get to many different areas, it's A LOT of walking underground. Above ground gets a little confusing and around the hotel are a bunch of small side streets which were a little scary if you weren't sure you were walking the right way to the hotel. Luckily I was with my parents who are Hong Kong natives. Also the since the hotel is new, it would be handy to keep the hotel's business card/map that you are given at check in to show to taxi drivers since the hotel's main taxi entrance is underground and there isn't a direct street drop off area or you can tell them it's a the K-11 mall. We didn't really shop or eat at the K-11 mall, but there is a Jason's marketplace on the 2nd floor (?) so that you can buy drinks, snacks, candy, etc. Across the street from the K-11 mall is the Tsui Wah restaurant, a well known Hong Kong style cafe with reasonable prices and large corner tables if you have a group. i would recommended staying here just because the hotel is so nice and new and the breakfast buffet is delicious. However, traveling with little kids and anyone who has some difficulty walking, the location is just too far from the MTR entrance.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA true 5 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "Luxury_traveller504", "ReviewID": "UR130455014", "Content": "The hotel reception, restaurants, rooms and other common areas are modern and well designed.

I asked for the following well in advance since we were arriving in HK late in the evening and didn't want to have to get a \"leftover\" room with our baby probably being tired after a 14 hour flight. - HIgher level - above 15F to avoid any road level noise - Corner room - as I heard these are larger and potentially have harbour views - Baby crib - Late Check-in Upon arrival, the bell service was excellent as they brought our bags to our hotel room a few minutes upon entering the room, and we had a few heavy ones.The crib was already set up which was awesome... The room was a King bed room and it was pretty large for a HK hotel - small for a North American hotel. This is a new hotel so everything looked pretty good, but the carpets in from of the Lobby elevators are already showing a lot of wear. Good lobby and efficient services... The room was what we asked for - on 20th floor, in a corner and the view was good. THe bed was large as advertised (king) and the room temperature control was great (actually changes upon touch which is very decent). Other things were nice, new and standard. Love the washroom as it had a lot of glass and open space to the room. Things to watch out for as a guest - Internet is not free - $80HK (1 hr), $150HK (24 hrs), $350HK (3 days) - this standard should be free nowadays! - Make sure the taxi driver knows how to get into the hotel (ours was great and knew exactly where to go as we needed the bell service for our bags) - about $250HK from the airport - Bottle water was provided free of charge (2 bottles) and have to ask for refills or wait for room service next day - The lobby is 3 levels above the street so you have to take an elevator to the street every time. - There are a few bars across the street so it's probably quite noisy if your room is facing that direction and low.

I recognize that many travelers don't want children in the lounge, but I travel with one, so a lounge that actually welcomes them is important to me.

The hotel has a phenomenal location right in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui. The East Tsim Sha Tsui MTR Station (Exit N2) is right outside the hotel, which also acts as an underground walkway that leads to the waterfront. The lobby is located a few floors up. Taxis can either drop you off in the basement of the hotel where bellmen are present, or the side entrance, which is more low key. The hotel is extremely modern. One holds up the key card to the door in order to access the room as well as the elevator as opposed to the old swipe method. We reserved two standard rooms instead of a harbor view, but the city view rooms still have a partial view of the harbor. The rooms are really spacious and have a typical clean modern Hyatt design. The bathroom has a rainforest shower and a unique sink design. The breakfast and lunch buffets were very elaborate and could cater to anyone\u2019s taste with Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and American options. There was also a large outdoor pool and hot tub. There were two aspects of this hotel that really bugged me: 1. There was no free Internet in the rooms. In addition, there was no business center with computers. We stayed at the Langham Place last year, which at least had a business center with computers. Luckily, I discovered that the K11 Mall in the basement of the hotel has free wifi, so we went down there to get Internet access. 2. In addition, I found the gym to be really tiny! Free weights only went up to 14kg (30 pounds) and there were no strength machines. Not that this was a deal breaker, but coming from the Marco Polo in Shenzhen and Shangri-La in Guilin, there was no comparison. Overall, we had a nice stay at the Hyatt Regency. The location was great for us and the hotel provided a good value for Hong Kong.

The hotel is very modern and chic - call it the younger version of Grand Hyatt. Decor is not as stately as Grand Hyatt but still very elegant. The view is not as awsome as Grand Hyatt across the harbor but still quite nice. Location-wise, this is as good as it gets. It's near the MTR station and near HK's top shopping district, easy to get to and from, from just about everywhere... I had a unfortunate taxi experience on a different trip, so I opted for a taxi ride to the MTR station in the morning, to catch the airport express to HKG. It was super convenient but taxi driver was probably not too happy because of the small fare to the station :) Room is well appointed but the bathroom is a bit too chic for me that they prioritized looks over practicality but it met my expectation for the price point. Bath amenity is the standard spread for Hyatts in Asia, definitely not the spa ones provided at Grand Hyatt. The gym is quite expansive for one in a hotel, it served me, a bit of a gym rat, quite well, so thumbs up for that. Regency Club is modern and delightful. Food spread has a good variety and is quite tastey though seems to be in short supply. There were a lot of guests using the Regency Club, so it's understandable that things may run out. They kept the wine bottles full at all times, so that made the occasional wait not so bad ;) Overall, a great stay for a Regency class Hyatt.

The hotel is more the business hotel type, but with the large pool also excellent for the holiday traveller. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, we spent nine nights in three different rooms and were absolutely satisfied. The hotel occupies the lower third (up to level 24) of the K11 building in Kowloon. Subway is directly opposite the hotel entrance. In detail: Rooms All the room\u2019s interiors are new, modern and the rooms are very clean. The Deluxe Rooms have a larger bathroom with tub and separate shower, the standard rooms only have a shower, though very nice, see below. Our comments refer to room numbers 1418 (King Room), 1812 (Harbour View King) and 2310 (Club Harbour King). Room numbers xx08 to xx23 (see floor plan picture) are facing the harbour, some, as room xx18 have a little restricted view due to the adjacent room xx17 that is sticking out. Numbering is the same on all floors. On floors 23 and 24 the Regency Club occupies the space of rooms xx12 to xx20. The rooms are not huge (as often in Hong Kong), but practically equipped with a table and side board that is not stuffed with hotel directories and other things so that you find plenty of space to put your own books, mobiles, laptop or whatever. The cabinets and storing space is a little small for two people staying, but ok for business travellers or short time stays. See Hyatt website for room pictures. It is similar in all rooms. The windows are almost full front with a seating in front so that you can perfectly sit on the window and watch the skyline. Pictures were taken from room 1812. Room 1418 wasn\u2019t too much different, also nice view on the skyline but not titled a harbour view room. Yes, the higher you are, the view gets even better, but I think it doesn\u2019t make to much difference. From rooms xx12 to xx20 you have the view on the Hong Kong Island skyline anyway, from the higher rooms you see just a little more of the harbour. The building (see picture with Harbour view) with the Canon sign will always hide part of the view. And yes, windows are a little dirty from the outside as reported earlier, but it depends more on whether conditions, if you have a nice or foggy view. What else: Beds are great (it\u2019s a Hyatt). Complimentary mineral water in your room (again, it\u2019s a Hyatt). Room is cleaned twice a day. Club rooms have a Nespresso coffee maker. Bathroom Modern, very nice rain shower. The larger rooms (31 square meter) have a tub, the separate rain shower is a barrier-free walk in. Very convenient: it is large enough that you do not need to close the shower doors so you can easily walk in or out. The smaller rooms (28 square meter) have also a nice rain shower, a little smaller (here you\u2019d like to close the doors) and no bath tub. Plenty of space for your wash bag and stuff. A sliding door can be opened to the room, so you can have a view out the window while having a shower. Overall, a very modern and nice bathroom, new and very clean. Service Service everywhere was excellent. Very friendly and helpful staff at front desk, nice restaurant recommendations from the concierge. Special thanks to Emily, Fion and Chilia, and also all the others at the front desk or Regency Club. The same with the housekeeping, they also do a great job, no complaints at all on the cleanliness of the rooms. Location For us it was perfect, I prefer it to Central. But that depends, on how you are on your way. The Hyatt TST is on Kowloon side near Nathan Road. It occupies the first 24 floors of an 60+ floor apartment building (see arrow on picture taken from Hong Kong Island), directly connected to the K11 mall on the lower floors. Directions: First: Taxi drivers don\u2019t know the address (Hanoi Road), but most know Mody Road, where the car entrance is. A map for taxi drivers is on the hotel\u2019s webpage on the Hyatt website. Ask the driver to go to Mody Road.As soon as he turns from Nathan into Mody, it\u2019s only about 100 meters, then on the left hand side you\u2019ll find the entrance to the K11 parking. Hyatt is listed with other companies on the entrance. Once down the parking lot entrance, the driver will easily find the Hyatt entrance on level B3. Only if you don\u2019t have luggage, following Mody road and then turning left into Hanoi Road might be an alternative, where you find a small street side entrance of the Hyatt. Be aware, there is no large driveway as you might be used to from other hotels of this category. Once you have been there, everything is much easier, than it seems from all the reports you find. For us, the Hyatt TST is at a perfect location, since directly opposite is the entrance to the subway where you get to both lines, either Tsim Sha Tsui station or East Tsim Sha Tsui station. From here it is only two stops to central. When coming from the subway, you just follow the exit N3, and you\u2019ll get to Hanoi road just opposite the Hyatt street level entrance. From the hotel, the star ferry pier is only about 5-10 minutes by feet. Plenty of nice harbour view hotel bars are in walking distance (Sheraton, Interconti, Peninsula). Knutsford Terrace also is only a 5 to 10 minutes walk. The big restaurant and night life area however is in Central around Wyndham and LKF. If you prefer travelling by taxi and need to cross the harbour, then be aware of traffic and take cost for the harbour tunnels into account. Going by subway or star ferry is the better choice \u2013 and thus for us the Hyatt TST is at a great location. Facilities The pool is great, especially if you like to do some serious swimming. It\u2019s a 25 meters outside pool, with plenty space around. In addition you find a large jacuzzi. There\u2019s changing rooms and facilities. The pool area is on the 9th floor and belongs to the apartment complex. It can be equally used by hotel guests and residents. You obtain large towels from their front desk. When we were there during the week late afternoons and also on weekends only about 4 to 6 other people were around. There\u2019s life guards, but the pool side is without service of food and beverage. (This would be a nice addition though.) There\u2019s also a nice gym with new equipment, but not very big (occupies the size of an xx07 room). It is without any attendance. Restaurants and Lounges The Regency Club is on 23rd and 24th floor. Great views! Free breakfast for Club guests is between 6.30 and 10.00 (11.00 on weekends) and evening drinks from 5:30pm to 7:30pm. The breakfast is good, but not overwhelming (once you\u2019ve been at a Grand Hyatt Club Lounge, e.g. the GH Macau). At the Regency Club they have a small continental breakfast buffet with fruits, yoghurts, rolls, croissants etc. About two warm dishes are served, one western (e.g. eggs or quiche) and one Chinese. Of course there\u2019s varieties of coffee, tea and juice. With the evening drinks (beer, wine, cocktails) also two or three small warm dishes (e.g. Dim Sum) can be ordered. Everything is complimentary for Club room guests. We haven\u2019t been in the hotel\u2019s restaurants for dinner, just had a club sandwich in the afternoon which was good international standard. Other remarks Internet (wireless) in the rooms is only complimentary for Hyatt Platinum and Diamond members. Price Be aware, anything in Hong Kong is very expensive, especially hotels. So is the Hyatt, but it also provides very good value. Hint: When we were asked at check-out whether we would like to pay with our credit card in HKD or EUR, we decided for HKDs. This turned out to be the right decision, since the exchance rate offered was not very good. When we found the amount on our credit card bill (including exchance and transaction fees of 1,75%) it was still about 3% cheaper than the offered EUR price.

Here is why: Built on top of K11 Mall, a slightly quirky and arty shopping complex, in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui, you have everything a traveller (or actually any local person) needs at your disposal. Last time I counted, there are five 7-11 (a ubiquitous corner shop) within 5 minutes walk, with the closest being right opposite the hotel, though I tend to rely on the full-sized supermarket in the mall called Market Place by Jasons (HKD 299 for a bottle of Moet, anyone?). Eateries in the mall are forgettable and you're spoilt for choice at street-level (give those restaurants within no English menu a try and just point at the pictures!). Service is efficient and professional, as opposed to personable (check out my review of Shangri-La Kowloon). That said, Amy from the front desk and Fiona, a housekeeper on level 15 always seem to remember me and my surname, which makes a small but significant difference. Facilities wise, there is a decent swimming pool (but I've not used it...) and a very respectable gym. Wifi is free (for frequent guests with elite status of their loyalty programme, otherwise not extortionate either) and reliable. Those of you who are observant enough will have noticed that I 'only' awarded three stars to rooms! It is not that they are wrong and inadequate in any way, but the fact is everything you expect from a hotel of this standard is provided but there is nothing worth writing home about. Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station has many exits and the hotel is next to 3 of them. You can get to Central (business/night life district) within 15 minutes and Mongkok (a slice of authentic Hong Kong!) just as fast. Now, inevitably, I will talk about a few things one must do/eat in Hong Kong that your guidebooks don't tell you to: - Have a massage at Taipan, a no-frill place just round the corner. The reflexology is particularly good. - Make a shirt or ten (like I did!) at Baron Kay's Tailor (www.baronkaytailor.com), or a suit or two if you please, which is literally next door to the hotel (and they will deliver your items to you upon request). Ask for Davis Ng who's most helpful. - If you're after good food and couldn't care less about decor and service, my favourite restaurant in Hong Kong is Sheung Hing Chiuchow Restaurant (\u5c1a\u8208\u6f6e\u5dde\u83dc\u9986). Order the braised goose with tofu (\u5364\u6c34\u9e45\u7247)! - If you're after good food and DO care about decor and service, my favourite restaurant in Hong Kong is Tim's Kitchen (http://www.timskitchen.com.hk/).", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cVery Upscale Hotel in Awesome Hong Kong!\u201d", "Author": "Banshee123", "ReviewID": "UR121266556", "Content": "I loved this hotel.

We saw sushi (a huge platter) for $150 and then it was the end of the day so the slashed it to $100.

If you are staying 3 days or more, get the Tourist Pass which pays for the round trip fare and unlimited MRT rides for 3 days. Check in: The drop off was at the basement, which weirded me out a bit. You are greeted by the hotel staff as you get out of the taxi, you leave them to worry about your luggage while you go up to the lobby. Check in was okay, a bit longer than I hoped for considering there was only another guy checking in at the same time plus considering that I booked weeks in advance I wonder why they had to reprint my information sheet when I came in. Anyway too hungry to argue at that time so I just went to the room dropped by stuff and was on my way. Room: The room feels pretty standard, nothing really worth writing about. The bathroom though was nicer with a big shower stall and a nice tub. The walls could be opened to give a more open feel to it. Albeit a few years old, they were able to manage to keep it clean and updated which I really liked. Location: I have to be honest I'm not all that familiar with Tsim Sha Tsui since I usually stay at Causeway Bay or Central. The only reason why I decided to stay here is because I need to check out the camera shops before I leave for home the following day but since I was able to get a good deal in KL for the camera, I pretty much had nothing much to do. The hotel close to an MTR exit which is very convenient, it is also right on top of a mall with a few food outlets, you could walk to The One just around the corner for more shopping and restaurants. It's a good 10-15 minutes walk to Canton Road, I guess in the heat and rain it would be a little bit daunting but in November to March when the weather starts to get cold it would be a nice leisurely stroll. Breakfast: Breakfast was very nice, I didn't expect it to be this nice actually since it's a Hyatt Regency. I was impressed with how the place looked like and the offering was more than enough to keep you full for the entire morning. Check-out: Was thankful that the check out was faster than check in...there were cabs at the basement to take you directly to the airport of the airport express.

Therefore, we wanted extra time to be able to come back to our room after a morning of touring so that we could freshen up before heading to the airport.

It says Hyatt on the building but unfortunately that's where the similarities to a true Hyatt property stop. I'm a frequent traveler and a Diamond Member with Hyatt. As such I've stayed in many Hyatt properties around the globe and sadly this one was a bit like entering an alternate universe. A world where Hyatt provides no service, is patronizing to its guest, and is completely apathetic if you stay with them or go elsewhere, they really could care less. This property has so many issues, fundamentally to do with the way it is managed. Unfortunately the complete lack of respect for its guest permeates throughout every senior manager at the property, from the General Manager down. It's truly tragic to see such a property run into the ground by its management. With that said, the glimmer of hope for this property is the physical building. The rooms are fairly adequate, most everything is in proper working order, and it shows fairly well. However, so do most properties in Hong Kong at this level. Hotel standards in Asia dwarf most other regions in the world. One comes to expect a beautiful property, a very comfortable well maintained room, and if anything\u2026.service! This hotel is almost inline with every other property in Hong Kong, but it lacks service. Not just the level of service you expect from an Asian hotel, but generic service in general and nothing close to what you would expect from a Hyatt property. There are many better properties on both the Kowloon and Hong Kong side that not only offer a better value, but aren\u2019t so miss managed, and understand what the actual word \u2018service\u2019 means. As a top tier elite member with Hyatt if I couldn\u2019t even get simple service myself, I would hate to see what passes for service with the general public without status or the occasional leisure traveler. Save yourself the hassle of a bad experience and just book into another hotel. The building seems alluring but it\u2019s a bit like a Sirens call. Once you\u2019re in you can\u2019t wait to get out. The location is mediocre, the rooms are smaller than other properties in the area, the room rates aren\u2019t overly competitive for the Kowloon side, and the staff is just difficult. To my fellow Diamond members, I can\u2019t be positive this property even knows that Hyatt has an elite program, which is said considering they have a Gold Passport Manager on site. So if you arrive on property expecting typical Diamond or Platinum benefits you will be sorely disappointed. I was eventually given most of my Diamond privileges, but only after asking for them and then they try to sell it to you as if something already due to you is now provided as a brand new gift only for you. It was sort of like checking in and not having something simple like soap in the room. Then after asking for soap you\u2019re told they charge for soap. Your response is all 5 star properties provide soap to their guests and they reply well we charge double the room rate for soap. Then numerous conversations later they key into the fact that you are an elite member with Hyatt and then they offer to make a one -time exception and give you soap, completely bizarre.

Value wise, it's a decent hotel. The rooms are spacious for HK and most important of all, clean. The room is tastefully adorned and the bathroom in good working conditions. Minor setbacks such as a leaky showerhead and a shower door that refuses to shut completely keep it away from the coveted 5-star status...but it's not too shabby. I mean, you get what you pay for. The service personnel are very friendly; however, broad smiles don't always translate to stellar service. We checked into the hotel at 2:00 PM, and were told that our bags would be brought up to our rooms. I then went to Macau in a failed attempt to win my money back from my last trip, and returned at 11:00 PM. The luggage was still not there...what the fruitcake...After calling the concierge repeatedly a few times; they finally brought it up to me. It was nothing major, but a bit disappointing considering it was the Hyatt and not Holiday Inn or Novotel. One thing that did really annoy me was that there was no free Wi-Fi or real business center. So for those unfortunate souls that need to do work, bring your own laptops. The Wi-Fi will also set you back you about 100HKD for 24-hour usage. Hotel food was decent, but you can always try authentic HK food from the varied restaurants in TST. The pool was a bit scrawny and the hotel garden was not much to look at, but that's just nitpicking. You shouldn't go to this hotel to enjoy the facilities anyways. It's just a place to rest after a tired day of shopping.

So I was of two minds writing this review: of course I wanted to share our experiences but it wasn't without a twinge of regret that I was letting everyone in on a \"secret\". The bottom line is that Hyatt in TST is one of our best finds in Asia. Hong Kong is a particularly tough nut to crack: there are some incredible hotels but they have Manhattan-like prices, there is the mid tier but those are....MEH, so it was a great pleasure to find that most elusive of all creatures: a great 5 star room in Hong Kong with good service at an incredible price in a great location. That, in short, is the Hyatt TST. The location is superb and it is a a nice, glossy, modern Asian hotel with clean, stylish accommodations. Pros: - Location, location, location!! - Modern & stylish - Clean - Nice service - Great breakfast - Awesome views from the harbor facing rooms Cons: - the service was not the very best -- a bit brusque and business-like versus warm - the hotel messed up a shirt of mine in the wash --- but... their manager made it up to me in Hyatt GP points... Nice :-) - NO spa :-( Overall, I heartily recommend the place and I will stay there again when in Hong Kong. So much nicer than staying on the Island -- you really get a feel for Hong Kong.

However, I thought I'd give the Hyatt in TST a try on this trip. I was leery because it was right across the street from the Holiday Inn Golden Mile and I didn't want to be bothered with the riff raff on the street. The location ended up being great. It has an MTR entrance via the mall below the hotel. There's a Marketplace in the mall so you can get food and water there. The drawback is that you have to take several elevators to actually get to the hotel. Kind of a pain, but no worse than Langham Place. I booked online and stated \"No Adjoining Room\" and also asked for a quiet room. Well, I got a room with adjoining door and on the other side of that door was a screaming baby.... for the entire duration of my stay. Very noisy and unpleasant. I had to hear the screaming kid and the screaming mom yelling at the kid. I also booked Club access. The Club itself looked great, but it might as well have been just a sitting area. There was no service to speak of, very little in the way of things to eat or drink. At Breakfast you had to go hunt down someone just to get a slice of butter. Selection of food was minimal. During the day everything stayed locked up except softdrinks. At Langham you get a beer and chips or snacks whenever you want it. They offered an evening cocktail service in the Lounge from 5:30-8pm. Langhams usually goes from 6-10pm. For the business traveller, the Hyatt hours are not adequate. I wouldn't get back to the hotel until 7:30 after a long day in China. That leaves you about 30minutes to try and grab something to eat and get a drink. Not adequate, especially for the price paid. The food selection was really minimal and there were no hot appetizers to be seen. The non-existant staff would bring by a single sample and then would disappear. I was used to Langham's great lounge service and quite often that would be my evening meal since all I wanted was something light. That didn't work at Hyatt. Oh, and the screaming baby was in the lounge everytime I went there...... The lounge looked great, and I guess the staff liked it too since they had the lights up so bright that you couldn't see out the windows in the evening. The stunning view that they have of the harbor was blocked out. So, I think that this could be a great place to stay but the staff seems to be so inexperienced and not really grasping the concept of what they are supposed to do. I'll try it again sometime, but for my next visits I'm going back to Langham Place Mong Kok.

The hotel is wonderfully located in Kowloon - only 10 minutes walk from Hong Kong Harbour, the Avenue of the Stars, Hong Museum of History, and other key attractions, as well as a few minutes from the MTR and surrounded by shopping options and malls. Our room had been upgraded to the Club Harbour Twin, so we had the additional benefits that came with a Regency Club room, such as a bit more space, complimentary breakfast, alcoholic drinks and snacks in the early evening, and free internet usage in the private club lounge. While a little smaller than some of the other hotel rooms we'd stayed in, the room here was well equipped and comfortable. I loved the well-stocked bathrooms with toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, combs and so on which is something we'd become accustomed to in Hong Kong - not something you get in many other parts of the world! The only real downside we felt was that WiFi in the rooms was not free, while so many other hotels offer it for free. We had stayed in a three star hotel where it was complimentary. The Hyatt Regency Tsim Sha Tsui has several restaurants, we ate at The Chinese Restaurant. I have to say, this was some of the best food we tasted in Hong Kong. I had jellyfish for the first time here - tasty! In all, I'd say that the Hyatt Regency Tsim Sha Tsui offers a great value option in a high-standard accommodation.

The hotel is in an ideal location in the Tsim Sha Tsui, it is directly over a metro stop that will take you to all parts of greater metro Hong Kong Area. It is within walking distance to the night market, Jade Market, the Ladys market, habor city and the promenade. Checkin was easy, I arrived at 900A and me room was ready. Marcus was friendly, helpful and forthcoming with inforamation. The Deluxe rooms are nicely furnished and roomy. There is interesting moveable wall between the sleeping area and the bathroom that allows viewing of the TV while shaving or using the facilities. If you ask for a high enough room you should be able to get a great view without paying out of pocket. They have a great Rainshower facet in the bathroom for showering. The first day we noticed that the shower was not draining and we had a mini-flood. When we called the technican he unsealed the drain. When we returned to the room the next afternoon there was a musty damp smell. It wasn't overpowering nor intoxicating like others have reported, but rather like the smell of clothes that haven't dried correctly on the clothes line. I have had the same problem with the Ritz Carlton in Singapore, the Shangri-La hotel in Bangkok and severall resorts in Mexico. I think it is a problem with the piping in humid climates. It did not warrant a room change for me, but I could see if someone who was hyper sensitive to smells could be irrated. Also, do not fret when you don't see a coffee pot in the room as the hotel will deliver free brewed coffee to you room on request in the mornings. The gym was always empty, the equipment was top rate and had TV's on each piece. Bottled water was provided free. While in the gym there was aleast one staff member that checked the gym for upkeep. We ate the breakfast buffets as we could not find a place that served a full breakfast prior to 900A in that area. The area has a hughe slection for lunch and dinner choices at reasonable price. You can find anything from a MacDonalds to Dim Sum within a 5-10 minute radius. The staff was always present and friendly.

Bed very comfortable. Great bathroom with large walk-in shower and separate bath. Nice and spacious pool area with large pool and jacuzzi. Very uncomfortable bamboo loungers though. The pool was on the 8th floor but you could only access via the 9th floor as the 8th floor was a reception area for the apartments. Consequently, every time you used the pool, you had to sign in and out which was a bit tedious and made us feel a little like second class citizens against the apartment owners. One major problem we had was on returning to our room one day at around 5.30pm to find that it had not been serviced. This is the last thing you want to find after a day of sightseeing and sunbathing. We immediately alerted reception to this and, eventually, a young man arrived but the cleaning he did (or didn't do) was so bad we had to complain again.

Should one not stayed at the hotel before, chances are the cabdrivers will likely alight you along the street and you will need to drag your luggage into the hotel through a side door. It didn't help that the hotel level not at street level...you will need to take the elevator. The lobby is typical of any regular hotel...not too grand...just regular. The front desk informed me that they had got a double bed for me although I had requested for a single King-sized bed when I made my reservations. Fortunately, the front desk officer did not insist that that was the only roomtype available and took the initiative to give me requested room through an upgrade. The room is clean, came with a 54\" LCD TV, beautiful bathroom and full glass windows. Although I was on level 12, there was not much view...view from room consisted of office building across the street, rooftops of neighbouring buidlings and view of the skyscrapers through gaps between buildings. Guest service response, called from the room phone, was fast. Although, thinking back, no one came forward to help me with my luggage during both check-in and check-out... Though it's a brief walk away from the main shopping area along Nathan Road as well as Peking Road, it's also interesting to walk around the individual shops around the hotel. The hotel is also connected to a new shopping mall called K11 which has a supermarket. Across the street, you have 7-11. The hotel houses a few F&B outlets...The Chinese Restaurant serves delicious tim sum...but, of course, not cheap. Variety of food are available around the hotel...so no problem getting a good bite. The major downside of this hotel was getting a cab. Found that out when I was trying to get a cab to the airport. As it was raining, I was directed to the hotel drop-off/pick-up point - which happened to be in the basement. Thus, do pray that the bell-hop, on level one, is hardworking enough to get onto the street to direct cabs to drive down to the basement. I was third in cab queue and it took 15mins for my cab to turn up. Alternatively, you may take the shuttle bus from hotel to the Airport Express Station in Kowloon Station.

Basically, we couldn't travel without it but we also didn't have time to go back. When we rang the Hyatt they actually put a member of staff in a taxi with the letter. They arrived on time for us to catch the train and flight, and didn't even want to take any money for the taxi ride (we insisted!!).

I enjoyed my stay and so did my family members.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cComfortable Stay\u201d", "Author": "AvidTraveller05", "ReviewID": "UR50702309", "Content": "I stayed at the Hyatt for 7 nights and got a very good deal on the internet, approx. US$200 per night out the door including taxes. I was happy with my stay overall. The room was on the 17th floor. I found it to be very comfortable, clean, quiet and ok sized room for one person or a couple. The breakfast buffet was good, not great - consisting of limited selection of dim sum, congee, jap breakfast, noodles, eggs, meat, fruit, yogurt/cereal, juices, etc. Since I prepaid my room, it did not come with the free buffet. I paid US$29 for the breakfast buffet which I thought was expensive. I also ordered room service and they had a VERY limited menu. Room service was expensive and in my opinion the food portion/quality was not that good. Back to the size of the room, I ordered room service and the cart could not be wheeled into the room because the room hallway is so narrow, with my lugguage blocking it. Please note at this moment, they do not have a business center. I used their internet service and paid $6 for 15 minutes of usage. They gave me a laptop and asked me to sit at the lobby bench! Service was ok - nothing great. My biggest complains and anyone looking to stay here should be wary: 1. The exterior of the hotel is still in construction! Everytime you go in and out of the hotel be prepared to breath in construction dust. It was simply a mess - road was dug up and they were putting in water pipes or something (not sure). The shopping mall that links to the hotel is still under construction. The underground transportation drop off was also in construction. I encountered some taxis and tour buses would not pick up or drop off due to the construction blockade. I was really annoyed that the hotel website did not indicate that construction was still happening. 2. The location of the hotel is convenient being near Nathan Road and few blocks from Salisbury Road. However, the hotel is in a what I call \"side alley\". There are transients loitering around the nearby subway stations. Being a solo traveller, I would have avoided picking this hotel if I knew of this fact.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenwich, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cDelighted from the moment we checked in\u201d", "Author": "Gate73", "ReviewID": "UR50649529", "Content": "We are just completing a four-night stay at the Hyatt Tsim Sha Tsui.

Lighting options abound, from the convenient desk, to the perfectly situated reading lights over the bed, to the thoughtful night light (switch controlled at bedside) for the bathroom. Complimentary toiletries are top-notch. The shower is instantly hot (with the option of both an overhead rain shower and a hand-held shower head) and the water pressure is wonderful. Towels are abundant and fluffy, and everything is cleaned to the highest standards. Elevator floor access is controlled with a wave of the guest room key, making this hotel feel especially secure. Breakfast buffet is delicious and beautifully presented, with a wide variety of hot foods, beautiful fruits and pastries, and a variety of fresh juices. Service is quietly attentive--the perfect morning start for jet-lagged guests. Buffet dinner at the hotel restaurant has cuisines from many regions--all of it high-quality and served with obvious pride in presentation.

The price of the room is reasonable compared to other neighbouring 5 star hotels that have same or better quality (Grand Hyatt). But you must, at any cost, get a room with a view coz I viewed the other rooms in the hotel (including Suits) and they face other very nearby buildings and let me tell you, the view is not great at all. I loved the service, the staff were really nice and friendly. Food was OK. I took a room with a view at the club lounge level (23rd Floor). The Lounge was OK. The room had everything a businessman or couple would need including Nice Desk with Wireless and Wired Internet. And not to forget the amazing espresso machine which was really nice to be offered free of charge. The Bathroom was amazing with an open window overlooking the bedroom and overlooking the view of the harbour. Very nice at night especially if you are taking a shower and looking at the amazing view. The only not so OK thing was that you had to switch Elevators to go to the lobby level then take another elevator to the rooms floors. Oh, and there is no GYM or Pool yet as it is still under-construction, but the hotel gives you access to a nice public gym which is not a 5 star Gym but clean and you can get a decent work-out there, about 5 minutes walking distance. Some of the Hotel restaurants are not open yet, the lobby restaurant has a nice variety Buffet, so you should be ok for a meal or two. For Transportation, avoid taking Taxis if you can as traffic can be a nightmare especially during rush hour, use the Tube (Metro) which is right outside the hotel main entrance and it\u2019s very easy to use as everything is mapped in English and the ticket system is super easy just touch your destination on the map and the fee will be displayed, pay it and here comes your ticket, it\u2019s that simple. There are many shopping mall in the area and I recommend the Harbour City Mall which is 10 to 15 minutes walk from the Hotel. I have attached a video of the room and some picks to give you an idea.

But with Hyatt Regency, the staffs made you feel welcome and they are friendly, always giving you a smile no matter if they are just holding the lift door for you. The rooms are bigger than most hotels along Tsim Sha Tsui. I can't stand rooms which are dimly lit but the rooms here are bright. The best thing is that you can also dim the reading lights if you prefer a softer light. Just outside the hotel are many restuarants so you never have to look far for something to eat.

First, the good: The staff was utterly excellent in my mind, check in was fast, polite and friendly. Even bell boys were great, making sure the luggage made it quick to your room right after you check in. Totally reliable in my mind. The food at the cafe was good, whether you choose A-La Carte or Buffet. I do recommend the buffet as if was quite delicious, and the cooks there will do the cooking right in front of you and will even recommend whats good. Room was very new and clean. The room had a very good desk and chair for the business traveller who needs to work extensively. I especially liked the work chair, cause I like to slouch to work. As for the washroom, amazingly nice! Bed was pretty new and nice. Unlike some of the hotels in Hong Kong that I've stayed in, too my relief, there were no over-noisy mainland chinese guests who love to speak loudly in the corriders in the middle of the night and walk around the corridors without their shirts on (probably cause it was too new and no offense to some of you mainland chinese folks). There were also no young party go-ers coming back to the hotel late in the evening making a ruckus, so nearly every night, I had a good night's sleep. Convenient: The MTR station exit was just across the street from the hotel, but off course, the hotel is actually located in the middle between the TST MTR and East TST MTR stations, so you can either go left or go right in the underground walkway to each station. Now for the Bad Taxi drivers are completely clueless of where the hotel entrance is, since taxi's are apparently supposed to go to the underground parking to drop off and pick up passengers. Worst of all is the entrance to the hotel has double yellow lines, which mean if your car stops there, the police can ticket the driver. The Internet is quite pricey. It's not complimentary. It is quite expensive but fast. 1 day or 3 day packages. Also its for one computer to go online, not for 2 laptops in the same room. Just didnt understand why there are 3 entrances to the washroom. The normal washroom entrance door, a hidden door from the closet, and the mirror door to watch TV from the washroom. Been wondering if the hidden door from the closet is some hidden getaway if you were hiding someone from your spouse. You might think twice of the area. There are couple nightclubs on Hanoi Rd. Not the dancing kind I am talking about, but ones which you pay women for their time in a karaoke room. The parking car boys which hang out across the street for the nightclubs from the hotel are most likely Hong Kong triads, so last thing you want to do is to go offend one of them or touch one of their nice expensive cars they have parked right on Hanoi Rd at night when the their customer has gone up to the club.

Having stayed in most of the 4+ hotels in Hong Kong; this one was attractively priced and conveniently located. The 4+ Star rating by TravelAdvisor is on the high side..First, an important aspect to any highly rate property is the ease and convenience of gaining access. We were diriven from the airport to the hotel by Hyatt's car (680 HKD). We were desposited 3 stories underground, then taken by elevator to the 3rd floor where the lobby is located. Not an impressive start. In order to get to the street level from your room, you need to reach the lobby and take another elevator the 3 floors down to street level ! One's initial impression of a property is its Lobby. Not here. You feel like you've come to a YMCA. There are just two bench style seats in the entire lobby. Enough room for about 8 people ! The rest of the space is left void of anything, save a few plants. I'm not an architect, but the design seems outrageously stupid. Clearly, they chose to locate the lobby on another floor so that street level space could be devoted to Retail. The rooms are adequate in size (for Hong Kong); but not any larger than a Super 8 in the States. All the bascis one would expect of a 4 start hotel are here, so there is nothing unique to report. Interned access is 150 HKD per 24 hour period. No iron in room, but you can request one be brought up. Two small packs of instant coffee and tea. Daily newspaper in the morning. The breakfast buffet is ok. 190 HKD/person. It is clearly not up to the standards of other highly rated hotels. Presentation is only marginal at best. There are 3 to 4 'cafeteria' style lines. More like institutional feeding, than 4 Star Hotel. Try the Shangra La for an impressive Buffet.
