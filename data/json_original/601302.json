Its not a neighbourhood anyone would chose unless they had a reason to be in the area. That said its a quiet street, clean and close to transport links and a shopping mall. The reception was fine, clean modern decor. The receptionist was not rude as some have experienced. It may be a cultural thing, Berliners rarely greet anyone with a smile or indulge in any niceties, they are straight-faced and efficient and this is considered good service! The room was quite large by European standards. Its clean and the furniture is in good shape. Its Ikea style so all flat pack and MDF stuff but well maintained. Linen was very clean and beds (two singles pushed together to make a double German-style) are comfortable if a little soft. The ensuite batthroom while small is not cramped and also scrupulously clean. Breakfast is a cold buffet. Again functional but nothing to regret if you miss it. The dining hall feels a bit like a school gym or cafeteria. It does have a nice outdoor terrace with lots of lovely flowering plants so that will be nice in good weather (it was raining the two days I was there). Perhaps the only caveat is the soundproofing. Anyone talking in the corridor or opening a door sounds like they could be inside your room you hear it so clearly. And at this budget there are lots of families, mainly tourists from other parts of Germany or Europe so you hear the kids but its not like a backpacker hostel, no late night rowdies.

The hotel is 5 mins from Gesundbrunnen U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations which has frequent and fast trains to the center of town, and is underneath the Gesundbrunnen Centre mall which was really nice - lots of good shops like H&M and a shop with DHL facilities for mailing letters home. The hotel itself is incredibly quiet, I wasn't woken up at night by any noises (except for the wake up call that I ordered, and got dead on time), the rooms are big with enough room to move, have a massive cupboard, large windows which can open slightly or completely depending on the weather, and all are very well designed and modern, and they are cleaned every day with the soaps/shampoos restocked each time along with fresh sheets and towels. The hotel has a fantastic breakfast spread, lots of meats, breads and salad, along with cereals, teas/coffees and was kept well stocked the whole time, I would have liked more of a hot choice but this is Europe, so it wasn't a problem at all. The games room has two pool tables, a big telly and vending machines for snacks, drinks and cigarettes as well as an indoor smoking room, which was handy because it was raining heavily outside.

There are plenty of food outlets available nearby (chips, noodles, burgers - all the usual high-quality, nutritious intake that teenagers adore...), and the breakfast is more than adequate. I note that a previous contributor mentioned that his students were not allowed access to the bar. The reason for this is that kids can get extremely noisy, even when they think they are not being disruptive, and the simple remedy is to turn right out of the hotel and walk about 100 yards down the street to the 'Sheesha Bar' where they can drink, dance and chatter the night away if they want.

There were 13 of us, 3 aged 25+, the rest 19-24, about half of us were students, the rest were partners/travel buddies). The purpose of our trip was to visit some art exhibitions and enjoy a bit of nightlife. It was NOT a structured school trip and this was made abundantly clear to the staff at check-in, in both English and German. From the moment we checked in we were treated rudely and with suspicion. The fact that couples were sharing rooms was queried - again we made it clear that everyone in the group was an adult and free to choose who they roomed with. We were handed a list of rules before we checked in - including things like \"it is forbidden to climb from one room to the other via the balconies\" - and eventually we were allowed access to our rooms. We had barely settled in for a nap when a room supervisor came in without knocking, muttered \"Sie sind schon ins Bett\" and proceeded to turn on all the lights and bang around the room, quite unsubtley checking us out and trying to see what we had brought with us into the hotel. The service deteriorated rapidly after that. Main complaints: We stayed 4 nights and not once were our towels or sheets changed. Our group was not allowed to use the bar facilities despite everyone being over 18 (16 is the legal age for drinking beer & wine in Germany) and despite this being one of the reasons we booked this hotel - so that we could have a drink in-house without having to search for a bar. The reason given was that we were a \"school group\" - they refused to accept that we were all adults even on production of our passports to prove our age (I am over 30 ffs) and even though there was a group of German schoolkids there all aged 17 who were being served without any problems at the bar. We were not rowdy, loud or intoxicated at any point of our dealings with hotel staff, so I do not understand this. The breakfast was fine but the evening meal was dreadful - pasta with sauce, dried out salad and left over fruit and yoghurt from b/fast for desert. We had booked an inclusive rate but most of our group chose to eat outside the hotel even though we had paid for dinner. This annoyed the staff no end and they complained that we did not turn up for dinner - seeing as we had paid for it surely they should have to prepare it whether we came or not? Despite complaining (in English and German) none of our concerns were dealt with. I have not yet received a response to my letter of complaint. Tip: if you're travelling with a young adult group, do NOT stay here. Try the IBIS hotels on Prenzlauer Allee, they are vastly superior and in a better location. For something cheaper, go to the Circus hostel. Citylight is only good for school groups aged under 14 that need ridiculous rules to keep them under control.
