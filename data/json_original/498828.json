If you are however looking forward for staying at the hotel, swimming, eating and massaging or whatsoever then you are in the wrong place. Hotel Lamartine is a 4* hotel. Positive: Excellent location (that is 5 min walk to Istiklal street, the best and by far the most interesting street in Istanbul), good varieties in the breakfast buffet and for every taste, rooms are new and clean, not big but not small. Views are on the street if you are on the right hand side and views on the roofs of Istanbul houses if your room is on your left. Staff is friendly a little bit strict but not more. (we got our check in at 9:00 in the morning, what a surprise!! we did not wait till 14:00). The booking price is excellent for what you are getting (less than 50Euro/night) Negative Not suitable at all for people who are coming as I previously explained to spend much of their day in the hotel because there is nothing to do there but to sleep and eat your breackfast. There is no piscine or rooftop dining hall. The lobby was not of my taste. Some did like it but I did not and I avoided as much as I can for spending some time there. All in all, very good hotel quality and service for specific people.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "Small_BuG_123", "ReviewID": "UR123652171", "Content": "1.

Staff and Service is more personalised and seems better than a 5 star. You feel homely. Very centrally located. The Hotel is next to Taksim square - Main bus terminus, Funicular and Metro station are just close by. Shops to buy water and all other daily requirement are next door. At the end of the lane is the Exchange Counter which Offers very good rate. Staff is very helpful and attentive, They guided us well for all our personal trips to various places around Istanbul. Hotel was neat and clean. Breakfast was a large spread and there were enough items for vegetarians too. Rooms are small and compact but clean. Only small negative we found was that aircon was not very effective.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "iceland", "Title": "\u201cjust what we needed\u201d", "Author": "kria", "ReviewID": "UR82302503", "Content": "Lamartine is very close to the Havas bus stop on Taksim. I looks recently renovated and displays a modern minimalist design with a good colour scheme. My room was big enough, the bathroom was comfortable and all appliances worked as expected. The staff was fluent in English and professional. The breakfast was really rich - continental, Turkish and English food and a really good selection of local cheeses, 6 kinds of them. Standing in a narrow street it has no views. Small restaurants have tables right on the street in front of it and there was live music too. My room was on the 7th floor on the other side so I could see a lot of red rooftops and did suffer aany noise. Afraid it can be rather dark closer to the street. To put it short - it was a good bed, bath and breakfast in and superb location.

Staff there seems to be so displeased with their work and they do not show any interest on their customers. For example, there was a problem with the blinking light in my closet which I identified and reported on the first day itself. Till the last day I left it was not rectified. Another instance where there was no bottle opener in the mini bar and when I requested for it, the staff asked me to open the beer bottled with my teeth.

Musafir is the name of the Indian restaurant sure has fantastic spread and a street away. You are surrounded by banks and eateries. Yes a cool place to stay-They also have broadband connectivity for convenience. It was a memorable trip. Caution: I was on a non peak season and still the hotel runs full. The check in is 12noon only. So check with your flight schedule and map it to the check in time. If it does not match check with the hotel before you land, Whether they could accommodate you early? This is just to avoid any disappointment. Even in the waiting time they took good care.
