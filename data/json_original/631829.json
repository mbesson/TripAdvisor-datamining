However, considering it is a 1.5 km walk or a MXN 70-80 taxi ride each time into town AND the fact this hotel has no restaurant or bar, I made a mistake. Otherwise it was fine considering my previous hotel experiences here. The staff were all nice. There is a lovely, small pool. Parking appears to be free. Still, a cab ride is about the same as parking in town. The rooms are nice with minimal wear. The bed was comfy. WIFI is free but didn't work well in my room. There is a better version in the lobby so I spent a lot of time there. Breakfast was nice. Fruits, cereals, scrambled eggs, salsa verde, steamed nachos with queso fresca, sweet I reads, yoghurt. There is a moldy smell to the room, but I didn't find mold. It seems typical for the area. I suspect it is due to the fact the window doesn't open and they turn the air off when not in the room so it is generally moist and stale - ideal for mold.

The hotel itself is more than adequate, very much top-notch Holiday Inn standard. It is modern, clean, has a nice pool and provides a great breakfast service. It is quite well-located being on the fringes of Playa. During our last stay here, we booked online before arriving at the hotel, as we wanted a speedy check-in. Unfortunately, when we arrived the hotel did not appear to have received the booking via Expedia. The staff were not especially helpful and had us waiting for nearly 30 minutes at the reception desk without apology, whilst they tried to track down our booking. The two young men on reception were definitely lacking in the customer service element of hospitality, to the point I felt it was almost downright rude! We also had an altercation in the following morning with one of these gentleman 'Omar' when we were leaving. My husband asked Omar to order us a taxi mini-bus as we had a lot of luggage. Their courtesy shuttle bus pulled up and their driver loaded our luggage and was ready to take us down to the ferry. We thought Omar had called the driver, but he then made the driver unload the luggage, telling us we had to get a taxi and that the courtesy minibus was not for travel to the ferry dock. Even the driver seemed surprised. So we asked (yet again) for Omar to order a taxi, and 10 minutes later a small taxi-car pulls up! Useless as we had about 10 bags with us. Luckily the taxi-driver managed to radio and sort a taxi bus for us.

We had a week booked at a resort near Puerto Aventuras but we arrived a day early and needed someplace inexpensive to spend the night and the Holiday Inn Express in Playa Del Carmen was just what we were looking for. Yes, this hotel is a little outside of the main tourist area but if you don't mind walking a bit then you should have no problem if you choose to stay here. Its about a 10 - 15 minute walk to the 5th Avenue area in Playa Del Carmen. The hotel does have a scheduled shuttle to take you into town but since we don't mind walking we did not take advantage of the shuttle. You can also get a taxi into town and back to the hotel for about 40 - 50 pesos each way. The hotel is just off of Highway 307 but its set back far enough that you don't hear any noise from traffic going by. The walk into town is pretty much a straight shot down the road from the hotel. There was some ongoing building construction down the street from the hotel and it looks like there will be some retail shops and restaurants going in there eventually so those will definitely be positive factors for anyone staying at the hotel in the future. Don't worry about noise from the construction. The hotel is just far enough down the street that you won't have to worry about any construction noise. Although our stay was short in duration we slept well and there was no noise or other disturbances with the exception of Tropical Storm Ida which passed through the area the night of our stay but it was no big deal and we barely noticed. The rooms are above average in my opinion. We found our room to be quite spacious. The floors are tiled and there was also a table/work area with chairs. There was also a safe in the room which had an electronic lock. There is no additional fee to use the safe as its included in your room cost. The air conditioning worked good also. The bathroom was your average hotel bathroom and met our needs perfectly. Tiled shower stall and good water pressure. Our entire room was absolutely spotless and among the cleanest rooms I have ever stayed in. The hotel lobbies and hallways were just as clean as the room. A free continental breakfast is included and consisted of muffins, croissants, cold cereals, scrambled eggs, toast, and a selection of juices and coffees/teas. Its not a huge breakfast buffet but it is more than adequate to get you started for the day with a quick meal. Service at the hotel was great. Check in took about 2 minutes and then we were on the elevator up to our room. We needed to get a taxi to get to our resort the next day and the front desk clerk was more than happy to help us out and called and arranged for a taxi to pick us up at the time we requested. We didn't use the pool so I can't comment on that part of the hotel. If you don't mind staying a little outside of the downtown tourist area and don't mind walking 10 or so minutes to get to the main tourist area then I highly recommend this hotel. You can't go wrong for the price.

When we got into our new room it was musty as well, but not to bad, they only have picture windows so you can't let fresh air in, I opened the door for a few minutes a day, that seemed to help, plus the airconditioner removed the humidity, although the maids would come in and shut off the airconditioning and when returning at the end of the day it was a little warm. The first night sleeping in our bed, i noticed that the sheets and pillows stunk, it was like the linens had been left wet for a day and a few days later i noticed a clean towel smelt the same. The pillows are like couch cushions, small and square, my husband said it was like sleeping on a balloon, they look very nice, but not very practical.

We had trouble at the excaret park, we planned to pay our admission fee with our credit card but the card wouldn't work, so we scrounged enough money to get into the park, once we were in the park we went straight to the atm (money machine) to withdraw $100.00 CDN, we could here the machine counting the money, we waited and waited, then my card came out and a receipt but no money, we probably spent 4 hours trying to get scotia banks attention to resolve this matter. When we got back to the hotel we tried to phone Bank of Montreal Mastercard and couldn't get an outline, I phoned the front desk and asked her if she could help connect me to an operator, that i would pay with my calling card, she tried but couldn't get an outline, so she sent a maintenance man to our room, he couldn't speak english, he replaced the phone, and the same thing happened, I then realized that you would have to get the front desk to open the line, I phoned the next day and the new girl at the desk said she needed my credit card to open the line. (learn spanish before going to mexico). The Hotel advertised a smart lounge and they play music friday, saturday and sunday, it didn't happen while we were there and I don't know what the smart lounge was, no alcochol served. (probably a good thing, it keeps the hotel quiet). The walk to the beach is approximately 20 minutes, the first hotel shuttle leaves at 10:30 am and they don't bring you back to the hotel, a taxi is approximately $5.00 u.s. Make sure your money isn't ripped because they won't take it. The hotel is very modern , very clean and the staff are very friendly, they don't speak much english. When I returned home I immediately contacted the bank of montreal regarding the money machine at xcaret park and believe it or not, I was given my money back, it took a couple of weeks and they have a freeze on it till march 28, 2009. I received my mastercard statement and I noticed the Holiday Inn Express Playacar charged an extra $150.00 CDN, to my mastercard, they didn't advise us of any extra charges when we checked out and we were not notified by mail or telephone of any extra charges being charged to our creditcard, todate I am still trying to get the charge reversed, I phoned Holiday Inn Express Customer Care and advised them of the problem, they sent a fax to the H.I. Playacar and the staff at H.I. Playacar told them that they didn't know what they were talking about, I asked customer care if they had someone that could speak spanish and they advised me that it is their policy to send a fax. I then tried to phone Holiday Inn Express Playacar, I was put on hold, I was hung up on and then they didn't understand what i ment, I asked for the manager and was told he was out for lunch, this was late in the day, then I finally spoke to someone who could speak english, we checked out of the hotel January 28/09 and todate (march 18/09) we have not received our credit and Holiday Inn Express will not contact me after sending 10 emails asking them to let me know what is going on. The day we checked out of the hotel, my thoughts were,\" I will stay here again\" even though there were a few flaws, but because of the mastercard problem i will never stay there again.

The website said there was a complimentary local area shuttle for a radius of 3KM. In reality the shuttle was ONE-WAY to the beach club and a couple of other stops and it ran on a specified schedule. Therefore you had to wait for a scheduled time and either walk back or get a cab. We didn't mind this as we were willing to walk but it was not what I had expected. The breakfast was good and pretty much as expected. We are not coffee drinkers and really liked that they had REAL hot chocolate every day.

If you are looking for an inexpensive place to stay that is clean and comfortable and don't mind walking this is a good value.", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kona, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again\u201d", "Author": "superjojo", "ReviewID": "UR24486515", "Content": "Would definitely stay at this hotel again. The price was definitely agreeable - $60/night. The breakfast was great. The rooms were clean and the pool area was nice. It is a walk from the downtown area, but only 10 minutes. They have a shuttle to take you to 3 spots, but no return shuttles. The only problems I would have to say is, they do not supply you with enough towels in your room, almost as if they want you to call so they can make a tip off of you. They do not have accessible ice machines, you have to ask for it at the front desk.
