{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Want more room at Alam Kul Kul........ Have stayed at Alam Kul Kul on (now) 7 occasions.Usually stayed in Alam rooms, but on this occasion in Alam Villas.These are single bedroom units.Double and twin beds available.We were 7 persons, utilising 4 villas.The extra space in the villas makes for a more pleasant stay.Some units have , as well as an internal shower, 'external' shower and bath facilities, great fun. Villas facing the small pool and along the walkway directly from these rooms , afford a quieter atmosphere. All in all, excellent and would certainly stay again in villas.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR652317979", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "wayanB"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d678368-r17892871-Alam_Villa-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "678368", "Price": "$183"}}
