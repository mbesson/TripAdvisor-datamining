{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cha Cha The Hotel Jardin Amazonas was not one of the better hotels I've stayed at. However, in general the hotels in Mexico were not as nice as the ones in the US. The main problem when I stayed at this hotel was the pool was grren, and also the outside of the hotel was not very inviting and the rooms were very small. It was however pretty close to most things. It was in walking distance of places to eat, bars, and clubs. Overall, this was probally the worst hotel I stayed at while in Mexico.", "Date": "Jun 17, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR563916035", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d252621-r1091461-Hotel_Jardin_Amazonas-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "252621", "Price": "$52"}}
