We almost missed the entrance of the hotel. But, as we enetered we realised we got pretty good deal. From inside,the hotel has a look of 1920's or so royal building. It looks as if a big villa has been converted into a hotel. The old elevator gives you a feel of 20's films.The rooms are very spacious, neat and comfortable. The staff is nice and spoke good english.

We wan't a hotel that was close to an U-Bahn station and within walking distantance to the Olympic Stadium. The Brandies was a great choice as the location was perfect for our needs and the hotel itself was very nice. The hotel is an older apartment style buildling that was converted into an hotel years ago. The quaint old world elevator just adds to the feel of the place. The rooms however have been redone. Ours was very modern and clean with a clean private bathroom. The breakfast in the garden in the morning was a great way to start the day.

The hotel is located in the city's west end, with a U-Bahn station literally outside the front door. It is an older building (pre World War I), with a quaint elevator. But it is in excellent condition, and very clean. Our room was spacious and well-furnished. The free internet worked very well. But as this is an older facility do not expect luxuries like a swimming pool, room service, etc. The staff was most pleasant and helpful, and the breakfast was worth the additional 9 Euros.

Vi booked the hotel on hotels.com for only 130 \u20ac for 3 nights (breakfast not included though) We were a bit worried about the quality, when the hotel is that cheap, but we were really surprised. Even though it is placed a bit far from the center of Berlin, it is absolutely no problem. The U-bahn station Kaiserdamm is right outside the door, and the public transport is very effective. The neighborhood also offers good restaurants. The room was very big with a comfortable bed. We slept really great! The bathroom is small, but newly modernized, clean, and had a great shower and plenty of space to your stuff. It also had a \"real\" hair dryer, not a \"hotel hair dryer\", which I enjoyed very much! The room had creaking wooden floor, but it just contributed to the charm. Our room was facing the street, which is very busy and noisy, but with the windows closed, it is no problem. If posible, ask for a room facing the lovely backyard. But in return, the rooms facing the street had a big balcony. Our room on fifth floor had a fantastic view of the city! But again, you need to close the windows at night, which could be rather hot in the summer, and the hotel does not offer aircondition. The breakfast costs 9 \u20ac, and you can probably find it cheaper other places, but it is really worth the money! It was hard to choose between all the delicious things, and in the summer, you can enjoy it in the quiet backyard with lots of plants and flowers! The service is good, the staff will help you with any question. We will absolutely return next time we are in Berlin!", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201ccharming old world convinient for transport and reasona\u201d", "Author": "pelfad", "ReviewID": "UR12336996", "Content": "This hotel is a converted apartment budilding from 1910, one of a few pre WW2 buildings still intact in the area.

Although we had booked the hotel via the internet without knowing anyhting about it, it turned out to be a very good choice. Not only was the price (approx. 60 euros/night incl. a great breakfast) hard to beat, but what you get is way above average: - huge rooms (apart from a 5* suite i've never stayed in a room larger than the one we got) - comfortable beds (although not very wide, maybe 1m) - romantic setting (converted elegant house, even \"fake\" chimney with lights etc.) - great location - the subway is just across the street, the cab to the airport Tegel gets you there in about 10mins (cost me 13 euros in April 2007) - quiet (they apologized upon arrival that all \"quiet\" courtyard rooms were taken, but even for my light sleep the streetside room was quiet enought to get a night's rest) Negative: - they couldn't find my reservation on arrival (took us 15 mins to get everything sorted out) - took 10 mins to check out I can definitely recommend Hotel Brandies.

The woman at the desk was very helpful and spoke excellent English. The hotel is a converted house/apartment building. Small and intimate. We stayed in room 22 which had a nice courtyard (quiet) view. The beds were comfortable and spacious. The bathrooms were clean. You HAVE to go here just to ride the elevator.
