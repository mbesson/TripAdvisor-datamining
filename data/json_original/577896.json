Hotel Sileo is only about 2 blocks from the station, which was really convenient and the laundromat was only a block away. When we read the info about Hotel Sileo, it stated that they have a contract with the train company that provides daytime rooms for conductors on overnight trips, so we might have to vacate the room between 9a.m. and 7p.m. If that occurs, they hold your luggage for you. But we were there 3 nights and never had to give up the room during the daytime hours. We are two grandmothers who traveled together, and when I explained the situation to my friend, I told her we were renting the room by the hour... that evoked lots of laughter! The room was ample, clean and the bathroom - ditto.

There are a few places to eat around the hotel but I wouldn't recommend either one... The couple that owns and runs the hotel are nice and cheerful all the time, but they hardly speak any English. It is good that I had installed GoogleTranslate on my phone - it is quite useful for a asking few questions ;). The easiest way to find the hotel is to look for the MarcoPolo signs. The hotel is on the 4th floor of an old building which host a couple other hotels. The restaurant downstairs is noisy, especially if you room overlooks the internal part of the building. Even though the hotel is rated as one star, it has all the amenities you would find in a 3* one: mini-fridge, safe, TV, AirCon, WiFi, hairdrier, double bed.

But we did fine. We found it handy, in fact, to be so close to the key buses as we needed them often because the major sights of Rome are widely spread out (it's not a pedestrian city, that's for sure). And there were some decent restaurants with homemade-style food at a reasonable price (and others better not mentioned) near our hotel. The hotel was pretty basic. Cute lift to get there. Friendly owner, Alessandro, who speaks little English but somehow makes you feel very welcome \u2014 and teaches you repeatedly how to avoid getting pick-pocketed. While we were there, some repair or renovation was going on in another part of the building (the hotel takes up only one floor, and there are other hotels on other floors and other business tenants of various sorts) so it was a bit noisy at times \u2014 but we were out all day and there was no noise at night. Breakfast was the typically high-carb and no-protein kind found throughout Italian hotels. The two homemade-cooking style restaurants across from each other on the corner are worth repeat visits. Other than that, there's not much to see or do in the area and you need a bus to get just about anywhere else. We loved the Trastevere neighbourhood and if we're ever in Rome again would stay at a B&B or small inn there \u2014 but it would cost a lot more money than we spent at Hotel Sileo.

I am not sure but it looked like fungus growing on the doors of the bathtub/shower.Our room faced the back of the restaurant and we could smell the grease when we had our windows open.Luckily it was in the autumn months that we were visiting. so we could keep the windows closed for most of the day.it was also quite noisy because the restaurant would be cleaning up at the end of the night and the garbage containers were in the back of the restaurant .We found that the dresser had food stains still on it from the previous guests.the room was shabby and the lighting was very dim. I think they were using low watt energy saving bulbs.It did appear that there were rooms that were better than ours so we asked if we could be moved but they said all the rooms were taken.We did try to find other hotels but it was quite hard to just \"walk-in\" and try to find a room since some hotels were already booked to capacity and others were leery as to why you did not have reservations.It is quite hard to find a hotel at the last minute so we just tried to make the best of a bad situation.We took Rick Steeves recommendation for Hotel Sileo but now I do not think he has even stayed at Hotel Sileo.I think his recent books are outdated and the recommendations are now hit and miss.So buyer beware", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIdeal little hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Chris66_10", "ReviewID": "UR89129112", "Content": "We stopped at the Sileo in September and has a very enjoyable stay.

It is situated in the old building and the interior is also made in the early twentieth century style. We stopped here two times during our trip to Italy - once for four nights when we wanted to see Rome and once for just one night for the early trip to the airport. When we first came here we got a room with the street Magenta view and spectacular pictures on the walls and even on the celing. One picture was with Romen Forum, another with Tiber (just as on the pictures of the previous reviewer), and the third - blue sky with clouds on the ceiling reminded Pantheon). The hall and the corridor is also beautifully decorated. At first the only problem was a smell of the oldness - I usually dislike it, however just in several minutes I cased to notice it. The owners were very friendly - they gave the map and brochure about Rome and forgave us drinks from the mini bar - the shampane,beer, water and juices while it was not staded on their site. It was a nice surprise. Bathroom equipment workd all the time, towels were new and soft, the soup, shamoo and the hairdrier was provided. I asked Maria, the owner's wife, if they could provide us this room when we come back on the way to the airport but she refused since this room was provided only to those who stay more than three nights. So when we came back, we got a much smaller room with the view to the not so picturesque yard, the dish washing sounds came from the restaurant and the overall decoration and furniture was worse than in that beautiful room. The bathroom also was much smaller. If I got this room during the first stay I would be dissapointed. However the convenience to the location to the both Rome airports transfers and the hall with the sculptures and lighted globe was still very attractive and the walls of the second room were also with pictures. I advise to stay in this hotel when you plan to stay more than three nights and choose another hotel if you plan to stay just one night.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay- great value and centrally located\u201d", "Author": "daisylind", "ReviewID": "UR46551860", "Content": "We had a very enjoyable stay here, also known as Albergo Sileo.

The reason I am giving this hotel 5/5 is that it exceeded my expectations for a hotel in its price bracket and the ownership and staff were both exceedingly kind and accommodating. Our triple room was a very decent size considering the relatively small size of the average Roman hotel room when compared to its American counterparts. It was certainly clean, as was the bathroom. I am a rather big person (6'4, 230ish) and my broad shoulders made the shower feel a bit small, but that is a relatively minor issue in the grand scheme of things, and is about the only complaint I have about the hotel on the whole. The room was very quiet at night and attracts a quiet and respectful set of visitors. It is also a fairly good location for hotels in this price range. Most comparable hotels are a few block further from the train station and thus are a few long blocks further from the public transportation hub at Termini Train Station and are also a few blocks further from the historical center of Rome. Due its location, it is also is a safer neighborhood than many other hotel options that are further from the train station. The only negative that some might find annoying is that the hotel is located on the fourth floor. Their is an elevator, but some might be uncomfortable taking it if they are accustomed to large elevators, and this one is rather small. There is a very well priced internet center on the most direct route to the train station, which also makes this location even more convenient.
