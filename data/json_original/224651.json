We had an opportunity of transferring rooms though uppgrades until we were given the \"best room in the hotel\" ,room number 25. Unless you have a particular fondness of milldew I would advise you to stay away from this hotel. In the three rooms we lived in, none had a decent adjustment for the hot water in the shower. Consequently only scalding hot showers with diminishing pressure as we moved uppwards from ground level were available. As we moved the personell moved our stuff, \"accidentaly misplacing\" our brand new shampoos and conditioner, until we accused them of stealing. The constant moisture on in the carpets and the visible milldew on in the corners of the rooms eventually led to severe breathing difficulties. TV sets in all the rooms were old and the size of postage stamps. with hardly any channels visible;the ones that were, were adjusted to slight snowstorm. The generous complimentary 1 teabag per person were replenished by a once a day visit from the room service. Continental breakfast at \u00c2\u00a32.95 was watery coffee with marmelade and toast on the bottomfloor, where the beams had apparently given up, so that if someone walked past your table you spilt your coffee as the floor swayed. Luckily I had my loving wife with me and that kept up our spirits, otherwise we might have become a bit annoyed. We would recommend this hotel for masochists.

I was staying for the night before an interview in order to relax and unwind. Firstly there was noise coming from one of the nearby rooms (mainly a TV with some rather loud and foul language being used over the top of it). I woke up and reached for my glasses and they had fallen behind the bedside cabinet. I moved the cabinet to retrieve my glasses and felt something sticky attached to them. To my disgust I found a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153used\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd condom stuck to them!!! I was horrified and felt repulsed. Aren't the rooms supposed to be cleaned? Is this acceptable to you? I am a Christian man and do not want to see things like this particularly when I stay in a hotel. The bathroom also had a few pubic hairs by the loo (disgusting). Added to this the water pressure in the bathroom was pathetic (the tap pressure at the sink was very weak). The shower also did not heat up so I ended up not having a relaxing hot morning shower but a tepid one. This again was unacceptable. The remote control for the TV did not fully work (and was kept together with sticky tape) and the volume had to be altered manually. I complained to the Hotel the next day via email as I was too embarrassed to discuss at a public reception. I did not receive any kind of reply from the Abcone Team and I had to chase up. I received this reply- 1) About the noise and use of foul language from adjacent rooms - Unfortunately the guests cannot be told to speak a certain way or made to watch television at a particular volume. Hence I can only apologise on their behalf. 2) About the bedside stand- There is no space behind the bedside stand. The only space that exists is between the wall and the stand (on one side) and the bed and the stand(on the other side). The room was inspected before and after your stay. Also on the day of your complaint. No evidence of any sticky substance was found. 3) The water pressure and temperature is usually uniform across all the rooms. We did not receive any complaints from any rooms that day and therefore assumed the water pressure and temperature is fine. However it was inspected again and it seemed to be working alright.

On arrival, I discovered that the hotel had not received my booking from TravelRepublic, through which I had booked and paid several weeks in advance. The receptionist phoned TravelRepublic, who said they would call back. After 15-20 minutes without a reply, the receptionist gave me the room and said they would resolve the issue with the booking agent later. Needless to say, I will never book through TravelRepublic again. My room was on the fourth floor and there was a nice, modern lift to take me there. The room was very pleasant, with a fresh smell on walking through the door. It was of a reasonable size for a single room, with good quality matching furniture. The room was at the font of the building, with an outlook over the gardens across the road, although the window pane was badly cracked. Tea/coffee facilities were provided and a small old-style television. The bathroom was of a satisfactory standard with a double-shower, but the 'hot' water in the shower was not very warm. Another slight problem was a thin wall with the room next door, through which I could hear a loud telephone conversation which carried on after midnight. Breakfast was served in a basement conservatory, which was pleasant and spacious. However, the Continental breakfast was very basic, with limited choice.

I then returned and got the right room number but my room card did not work. Again up the stairs. I then asked for wireless and was told it was down. I also asked for an iron. I mean, this is supposed to cater for business guests, right? No iron in sight, and finally by 10pm I told them to forget about it; just as well as he had not managed to locate an iron. The room (single) was dark and very basic. If you expect any amenities this is not for you. Shower pressure low. The real surprise was the breakfast; it lists 'organic breakfast' on the website. Do you consider Kellogs packaged muesli as organic... no fresh fruit, no yogurt, we are talking BASIC. The wait staff walked around looking like slobs, wearing sweat suits and no one bothered to come around for tea as I sat for 10 minutes. I decided to leave knowing I'd find something much better elsewhere. Thankfully I left and found a local cafe, thereby forfeiting the included \"Organic breakfast\" - after getting a glimpse of the scene I did not trust what would come out of that kitchen.

We arrived at the hotel at around 1.15pm and were told to come back at 2pm as that was check in time (despite the hotel being empty). When we came back we were booked in and went to find our room - a twin room. Having paid three pounds short of \u00c2\u00a3100 we went back to the reception and explained we had paid for a double - receptionist was very rude and seemed agitated about changing our room to what we had paid for. Finally got a double but the room itself was disgusting and below basic standards. Stains all over the carpet, we did not have a double bed just 2 singles pushed together the bathroom smelt of sewerage and the sheet on top of the bed looked like it had seen better days. When we later came back from the theatre the hot water wasn't working we had to let it run for 20 minutes only to have luke warm water. In the night the mini-fridge in our room was buzzing so loudly we had to turn it off (after only a few hours sleep because of this I woke up the next day with awful back pain because of how uncomfortable the bed is). When we woke up my partner said he had heard a mouse in the night, which given the state of the place doesn't surprise me. Needless to say we didn't have breakfast there.

My first trip I stayed across the street at what was then called the London Forum Hotel through a BA offer. A very nice, but typical 27 story hotel. Knowing that I would be back in London again, I scouted the area for the more 'affordable' and 'quaint' hotel. Spotting The Abcone I noted the address and phone number. Sure enough I had to return to London and I contacted The Abcone to inquire about their hotel, accommodations and rates. Satisfied with my decision I then booked my stay. Now, everyone knows a family run 40 room hotel will not decoratively compare with a 400 room incorporated hotel chain nor compete with its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcluxuries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But I felt I had found a home away from home feeling I prefer. I was a name not a room number so to speak. The staff and owner were always there on hand. My room was spacious enough for my travel companion and me. The ensuite bathroom was just fine and there was enough space and hot water. Though this is not a modern interior everything was clean, in good condition and in its place. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat a big breakfast, but do enjoy morning coffee; juice and roll or toast and I chose that over something heavier. There are a few places within a 3-5 min walk to experience how Londoners do a big breakfast. Being a heavy duty sightseer the hotel location was near perfect for me. An ideal base. With short 3/5 minute walk to the Gloucester Road Tube Station with 3 popular tube lines to choose from!! I could easily run back to the hotel to drop off things collected through the day, change clothes, or take a nap. There are plenty of places to dine and shop for essentials and late night snacks. The second time I stayed at the Abcone my brother lost his passport, a traveler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest nightmare. Upon notifying the desk, Ali, the owner called to say he had instructed the staff to have a look for it, provided a photocopy he had taken of his passport, given us the address, phone number, directions to the US Embassy and offered to get us a cab. Over the years Mr. Ali, or his Uncle Rayani, was always there to say a hello. and accomodate guests. This is much of the reason I always stay at The Abcone when in London, and will continue to do so.

They clearly had some good marketing people that chose the best aspects to highlight. It looks pleasant enough from the outside, part of a block of typical London town homes (I believe this hotel was originally two homes). Our room was on the second floor facing the back. There is a lift but it is very small, clearly an afterthought, and two people and luggage won't fit. We used it as a dumbwaiter for the bags and walked the stairs ourselves. Our room was probably once a bedroom when it was a private home, but the bathroom and the lift shaft were carved out of the original space so it was the size of a large bathroom, smaller than our stateroom on the ship we had just disembarked. There was just enough room to get in the door and circumnavigate the bed. The furniture was modern-ish and sensible and the bathroom, though quite small, was beautifully tiled (obviously added later) and sparkling clean. However, the carpet in the room itself and mattress pad were both grubby. The website calls the breakfast \"organic\" or \"gourmet\", I forget which, and claimed it was included but that was a little ambiguous. Full English breakfast was optional/extra. The included breakfast was a adequate but spartan Continental setup. The space where it is served is very pleasant greenhouse-ish room on the basement level. Service is perfunctory at best. In summary, if you want someplace relatively inexpensive (for London, which is -- in general -- outrageously overpriced) in a convenient area (a block from the very pleasant Waitrose supermarket and tube station) this is a tolerable choice but don't expect what you see on the website unless they've done some cleaning and attitude adjustment.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv", "Title": "\u201cPretty damn awful\u201d", "Author": "Tal1976", "ReviewID": "UR21121908", "Content": "Tiny room without even enough space to open my suitcase, awful shower with no water pressure, poor quality mattress and bedding, and TV was only a 14 inch.

It isn't often that I feel the need to complete a feedback form, and I cannot remember the last time I truly complained however, having just had my worst stay ever in a hotel anywhere in the world I feel the need to tell you about the Abcone Hotel, 10-11 Ashburn Gardens, London SW7 4DG. This is supposed to be a three star hotel so although I didn't expect anything really flashy I did expect a comfort and level of service worthy of a professional hotel. I booked on Tuesday 03 October and we stayed last night. The hotel boasts the following facilities amongst others: Satellite TV/ In-House Movies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c If you try to watch anything other than the terrestrial channels it asks you to insert your Sky Card. Room service (24 hours) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c However, I have no idea what room service was offering since there was no menu in our room, or mention of room service facilities Wake Up Service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Only if you ask for it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offered. Health Club \u00e2\u20ac\u201c No idea where this was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again nothing in the room to indicate where you were supposed to go. Hotel Parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c If you delve a bit deeper this is advertised as Private Parking - This is my main reason for complaint. As stated when I made my reservation we needed a late check in. So as it was Central London I deliberately opted for a hotel with parking. In fact, upon arrival we were told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is free parking in the street outside until 8:30am. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t park in our car park it is closed!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I found this a bizarre situation and complained that the street outside was completely full and we needed to park, we had stated we would be late arriving \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had nobody thought it a good idea to contact us and tell us the situation with parking. The aggressive, rude receptionist then told me that he would take me to the car park and arrange to get our car in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it would cost \u00c2\u00a330.00, at the Holiday Inn across the road! I had assumed that as the details on the website said that there was hotel parking, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t note an additional charge that it was free onsite parking. He then went on in pigeon English to try to explain the concept of Inclusive versus Exclusive to me; which frankly by this time I was in no mood to hear and it bears no relevance to the circumstances. I am extremely angry that we were duped in this way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c faced with Hobson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice; wait for a parking space outside and move early in the morning, pay \u00c2\u00a330.00 to park in another hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car park or go elsewhere and forfeit \u00c2\u00a3135.00 for a room you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use. We were lucky a parking space became free but it did mean we had to leave earlier than we needed to this morning. Breakfast - A continental breakfast was supposed to be served this morning; it consisted of small boxes of cereal and toast, little pots of jam and slices of processed cheese still in their individual plastic wrappers. According to the website you can have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast to go\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but when you ask for it your toast is handed to you in a scrunched up serviette and you have to fill your pockets with the jam. No orange juice or water is given to you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just a handful of toast! Hardly a three star menu or the superior service promised. There was a nice little balcony outside our window; used to house the green floodlights that lit the front of the building \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and our room. I finally managed to drift off to sleep around 6:30am when they went off! Without a shadow of a doubt we will remember our stay at the Abcone for many years to come.

The bathroom was clean though very small. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels and tea/coffee delivered daily. There was a small fridge with drinks. We didn't partake so can't say how expensive they were. In the mild October we had, it was necessary to keep windows open during the day. It was okay to close them at night without overheating. As a light sleeper, I was relieved the hotel was located at the quiet end of the street away from noisy Cromwell Rd and that we were not bothered by noise in the hotel itself. The biggest disappointment was the \"organic\" breakfast. A small selection of cereals, processed sliced pan toasted and cheese slices in individual wrappers are hardly organic or even acceptable as a selection for breakfast. The serving staff were busy and rather sullen and annoyingly wearing high heels on wooden floors. One busy morning (about 14-18 people) we arrived for breakfast and while we found seats ok, we were told there were no cups or cutlery left! We were left to scavenge some unused ourselves from uncleared tables. Cooked breakfasts were available for an extra charge. When we visited much of the paintwork in our room was chipped and the TV had a fault which meant it switched off then on again every five minutes or so. The reception staff weren't terribly friendly. On some websites, I notice it says you can check in here at 11am. We tried to but were told it would be 2pm at least. .We were able to leave our bags though before check-in and also after check-out which was good.

I was in a group of four people so we got 2 rooms. My room was one of the basement rooms. It was small, but not that bad. The bathroom was nice, and there was plenty of hot water. The other room was upstairs and was smaller than mine, but similar in condition. The beds were only ok, a little hard for my liking. The self serve breakfast for 3 pounds was pretty good and consisted of toast, cereal, juice, coffee, tea, etc. (I did not try the full English breakfast). The staff was friendly enough, although they did try and charge us for a few extra breakfast's, so beware. Overall, I would say the hotel was fine for what we paid. It is in a good location, 2 blocks from the Gloucester Road tube station, and in a good neighborhood. That said, I would most likely not stay there again, as on the end of our trip we stayed in a much nicer hotel, for not much more money (see best western mostyn).", "Date": "May 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cWorried but positively surprised\u201d", "Author": "GoofyBoi", "ReviewID": "UR4729133", "Content": "After having read some of the reviews here at Tripadvisor I kind of regretted that I had booked a stay at Abcone Hotel. We arrived very late a Friday night and were kind of expecting the worst\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Luckily we had booked a deluxe room which was tiny for being such a room however spotless and very clean - even the bathroom was sparkling. Nothing to complain about when it comes to cleanliness and the beds were also very comfortable. Most of the complaints here at Tripadvisor are referring to the size of the room but you simply can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare a Victorian building in central London with a modern hotel anywhere in the world; Victorian hotels usually have small rooms. I find Abcone well suited for a weekend-trip to London but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re carrying tons of luggage and are in need of loads of space I would recommend you to stay somewhere else.

What you would expect for the reasonable price. But, I will never stay there again and for one reason. They are dishonest. We checked out of our room and the man proceeded to tell us we owed almost 80 pounds for telephone and mini bar use. We never touched the mini bar - not once. We did use the phone but checked out our calling cards with TWO front desk staff to make sure they were free to call out. The front desk attendent told us that there was nothing he could do and offered to take 25 pounds in cash and wipe the record clean. I refused this - there is no record of cash transactions! Plus, we did not use any of the services we were being charged for. He was rude, telling us to be more careful next time! It was an awful experience and I would hate for anyone else to have these same mystery charges on check out.", "Date": "February 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAWFUL!
