Nearest town with grocery and other services was about a 15 minute drive away so a car is a must. The few other guests were all American contract workers who were staying several weeks.

This hotel is clean and modern, good for it's price, but with no room service other than the minimal cleaning ( ie. we asked for cutlery to eat fruits, and we had to get it ourselves from the bar near the lobby.. a bit of a walk indeed). It's 28km from city centre and to the airport, so you would really need a car. Car park is free but there is a persistent puddle in the car park which we had to jump across everynight after returning which is a nuisance.

The bar and restaurant service is painfully slow, and the staff can be abrupt and outright rude. The food is generally OK when it eventually arrives, but don't expect gourmet Catelonian food. If you want that, head for the Can Bonastre wine resort 5 km north, which is an oasis in comparison, but also much more expensive. Unless the Barcelo management sort out the staffing problem, and unless you're luckier than we were, this is a place to avoid. Also, the spa costs hotel guests 13 euros, which is a disgrace.

The first thing to say is that you have to have a car to stay here. If you don't then don't consider it - the nearest town is Martorell - which is quite industrial and about a 10-15 minute taxi ride away, costing \u20ac15-20, with the train to Barcelona costing just under \u20ac5 return. There are not really any restaurants that we found nearby, and the nearest town - Sant Esteves which was very sleepy - has little amenities and is about an hours walk away. Thats the bad part - now for the good part - (as long as you have a car!) Parking in Barcelona is unbelievably expensive - expect to pay \u20ac30 for over 12 hours parking anywhere near the city. However we did find two gems - one in particular. The first is that there is a limited amount of free parking spaces towards Parc Guell, but there are normally full, and they are still around 15 minutes walk to the nearest metro. The best parking is in the City Centre by Glories Roundabout with its own metro station 2 stops from Pl de Catalunya. It normally costs \u20ac31.20 for over 12 hours, but if you go in and park, take your ticket to the booth and ask to buy a \"Metropark\" ticket, then you can get up to 18 hours parking for \u20ac5.50 INCLUDING unlimited metro, tram and bus travel. This is unrivaled and we found it to be excellent. We also found a fantastic place to eat in the harbour on the main pier, at the rear of the aquarium, where we had 1 bottle of cava, 2 bottles of wine, 5 tapas, 2 bottles of water, bread, 4 mains, 1 dessert, and 7 liquers for \u00a325 each with a harbour view and tables outside. It is decked out in black leather seats and looks very fancy, with a set of tables located at the front with blue and orange lights. The hotel itself is great, with underground parking, great pool, nice rooms - no doubles, just two singles pushed together, made up seperatley, nice reasonable bar and restaurant, as well as indoor pool, ping pong and pool. The bathrooms have no doors, just a glass one to the toilet and shower. The Restaurant lacks atmosphere but the food was great, as were the breakfasts. We also drove to Sitges for the day (40 miles and \u20ac10 return in the toll road or free on the costal road) which was beautiful. The beaches and sea were great as is the entire coastline south of Barcelona. The Friexnet Cava factory is highly recommended, and you can get a tour of their huge factory and a glass of Cava for \u20ac4 each, although we were not charged for some reason!! The hotel is located 10 minuted drive from the E-90 Motorway, which is just past a toll booth from and to Barcelona, and in any direction on the motorway - this costs \u20ac1.85 for a regular car. In terms of a supermarket there is a large Carrefour in Martorell by the station. Overall the hotel is really good - clean, friendly, reasonable bar and restaurant, lovely pool, large rooms, and great rooms - most having a great view of the Montserrat Monestry. A great option for exploring the region - but if you are only going for Barcelona, then stay in the City, and also stay in Sitges if you want a beach! 8/10 for this hotel!", "Date": "September 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "cphyde", "ReviewID": "UR8496873", "Content": "This is a very up-market hotel with good sized rooms with quality fittings and tiled floors. Excellent restaurant - huge breakfast buffet for 12 Euros and brilliant 4-course dinner menu for 25 Euros. Stunning views over golf course and surrounding hilly countryside. It was very quiet in all senses. Mostly French and Spanish guests, some English. Pool and lawn area very good for sunbathing and keeping our 9 year old happy. Table tennis, pool and bar-footie available. All in all, a very good hotel. The one issue you might have is that the waiters do not speak much English. Reception have good English, but the waiters very little. Sometimes, service was slow. The waiters seem a bit amateurish, but in our experience not a problem. You need a car: it is about 20 km outside Barcelona and off the beaten track. Not a tourist area and you will struggle to find many that speak English in the local area. We ate in the hotel partly because nowhere else was open. Barcelona can easily be reached by car. We were advised to park in the University (closed for the summer) and take the Metro. It took about 20-30 minutes by car. Metro was very efficient. But keep hold of your purses: we had money stolen on the Metro. Incidentally, you have a great view of the mountain of Montserrat and the monastery at the top is worth a visit (on a clear day).

We hired a car and were able to see something different in the region every day (Barcelona, the mountains, the wineries, the coast etc etc). However, although the hotel, the accommodation and the location were all stunning, there was definitely something lacking (atmosphere?). For what should have been a very busy time of year, it appeared almost empty, and if it hadn't have been for a couple of functions happening during our time there, we would have seen very few people! Service in the bar and restaurant areas was very poor- language (and lack of enthusiasm) was a constant problem - , and the night we ate in the buffet restaurant, there were only 2 other tables occupied. The food, although very good, looked as though it had been set out some time before, and obviously since there were very few customers, it hadn't been refreshed. The bar at the pool was never open, which meant if you wanted a drink you had to climb the stairs to the bar and hope someone could be bothered to serve you. The pool area was lovely and always quiet - no chair hoggers here! Contrary to that, however, was the service we received from the reception and maintenance staff. We had a couple of small \"niggles\" which needed attention in our room (safe locked when we got there, shower not working) and each of these was attended to immediately. We were very impressed. I don't know if we would stay here again. The lack of other places around to eat out is a big down point (although try the restaurant at the top of the road - it is obviously a favourite with locals, and when we ate there for lunch one day, we got 3 courses with bread, bottled water and coffee for 8 euros each!
