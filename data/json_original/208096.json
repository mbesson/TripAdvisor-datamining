Simply ideal for exploring Paris on foot. Notre dame, Lourve, musee de orsay, opera, and much more all within walking distance. St germain itself is simply charrming. It depend on your tastes but i preferred St germain to the Opera area. Very cool and funky without being prententious. Has a great vibe with all the winding streets and cafes and charming shops. Not loads of tour buses ect. For booklovers..shakesphere & co bookstore is just up the road and just delightful. The apartments are very well designed and equipped with comfortable space and windows that open (great as i found the heating can get quite stuffy in paris). Very comfortable bed and pillows that were like clouds. Having Kitchenette really great for bringing home some of those french delights. There is a supermarket a very short 5 minutes walk away which has everything you would need as well as many independent food shops selling many treats, sweet and savoury. The hotel offers breakfast at 15 euros (continental). However with the many cafes and supermarket you may want to consider your options. Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful. Special mention. There is a spa around the corner on Rue Daulphine called 'Ban Thai spa'. Simply magical massage treatments. I visited twice.

On the Seine just a few blocks from the Louvre and Notre Dame, the hotel is a most convenient home base for meandering treks through the 6th and 5th arrondissements as well as Le Marais on the right bank. An added money-saving advantage: you can take the RER train from the airport (CDG) directly to the St. Germian metro stop, a short 2 block walk to the hotel. The Citadines is an apartment hotel, and our room on the 6th floor did have a very functional small kitchenette. The room was clean and the bathroom was modern with a European setup which means some shower water will find its way onto the bathroom floor. An electric towel warmer was a nice unexpected amenity. We can't say the Citadines evokes old world charm or the sophistcation of some of the newer hotels.

Since we were there 10 days, I would have liked them to change the sheets at least once during our stay.

This extends to most customer service staff, even in most hotels and restaurants. On the day of check-in, a counter staff by the name of Alejando greeted me with a deadpan expression and made me wait for almost 30 min (I was the only person at the counter), while entertaining queries over the phone. Why he chose to engage someone making a phone query about a prospective room reservation instead of engaging me, a guest who just arrived with 2 big bags and a confirmed pre-paid reservation, escaped me. I figured I must have arrived too early to check-in (around 11 am). Also, when I asked specific questions about the Internet (I needed it for work purposes), I was replied with a curt \"I will explain everything to you at the end.\" The internet connection, which was part of the room package, was a major pain. My roommate went down late one night to complain about the poor connection and was met with \"I am not a technician\" reply. The next day, we discovered that there IS a resident technical specifically for the Internet, but after multiple phone calls and instructions to re-configure our laptops, the problem still wasn't solved. In the end, we got free and faster Internet speeds at McDonald's at Orly Airport when we were leaving Paris. That said, the hotel is in a good location to explore the rest of Paris. It is a RER train-ride away from Effel Tower, and is connected by metro to major hubs such as Paris Nord station and Chatelet. Walking to the metro station, though, takes about 10-15 min, but the scenery along the way along the Seine makes up for it. There is also free coffee, tea and cocoa for guests in the hotel lobby.

It was everything we expected. Nice comfy bed, clean spacious room, good sized bath and bathroom. Staff were friendly and helpful. There were a few nice little extras like free internet, free 'proper' coffee, free chilled water and there were also nice toiletries in the room. The only thing missing was an oven (just two hobs and a microwave) but quite likely you would want to eat out anyway. The location is great- the Metro from Gard Du Nord takes less than 15 minutes followed by a 5/10 minute walk up the road. If you come into Gard Du Nord I thoroughly recommend using the metro rather than a taxi- the taxi will take much longer and cost 20 Euros (we were told) rather than 1.7 Euros (I think) per person on the Metro. Another Metro tip- at GDN don't queue up at the main entrance for tickets where everyone else is- there is a machine which takes coins or credit cards just before the barriers you pass through before going onto the platform and that is less crowded. Machines also have an option to read in your own language and tickets are easy to buy as they are a flat fare. The location is also great for shops and restaurants and I would have thought within 10 minutes walk from the hotel you have a restaurant for almost every cuisine on earth. Aside from French restaurants there were Indian, Thai, Japanese, Italian, Mexican, Lebanese etc etc. Plenty of cafes as well and although Paris is pretty expensive there were one or two streets that had cheaper meals. You are stil probably looking at a minimum of 20 Euros per person and probably a lot more at most places. The main supermarket is about 15 minutes walk but simple to find (the hotel has maps to show you where the main places are). Other than the supermarket and a few bakeries we didn't find much choice if you are self catering. We arrived on the Sunday which is the one day the supermarket closes early (generally I think it is open until 10 at night or similar) and we got rather hard done by for immediate provisions- milk, butter and cheese setting us back about 10 Euros which was double or more than we would have paid at the supermarket. So if buying for self catering it is more than worth making the effort to get to the supermarket rather than buying from the nearest little shop (of which we only found one anyway!). Best of all location wise is that it is perfect for the boat trips and main attractions. There are boat trips running from Pont Neuf which is very close to the hotel although they just tend to be one hour up the Seine and back. It's a bit more of a walk to a 'bateau bus' stop off point which is a hop on hop off boat that will (roughly) take you to the main places of interest in the city such as the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysees, Notre Dame etc. The boat costs 14 Euros each for a day ticket. We did find it busy though and not the best views from the boat either with no commentary. So if it's just a trip on the river with a commentary you will be better off with the trips from Pont Neuf but if you want to get around the main attractions in the City with relative ease the bateau bus is best. The Louvre is within walking distance (maybe 20-30 minutes with the distraction of things on the way). All in all a comfortable environment and a great setting that made it a hassle free and enjoyable trip.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "Cashmra", "ReviewID": "UR116135758", "Content": "Great apartment hotel.

Instead of breakfast in the hotel, however, we had a great time venturing out every morning to Carton, the neighborhood bakery, and opted for their goodies! The palmiers and pain au chocolat were exceptional. Also, a grocery store was a few minutes away and was a convenient way to stock our fridge with beverages, cheeses, and the fabulous local butter that we slathered all over the baguettes we bought at Carton.

The location is arguably the best in Paris, overloooking the Seine, 2 blocks from Notre Dame, right by the Latin Quarter. Having been to Paris many times, in my opinion, it doesn't get any better than that. The apartment was modern, well lit, pristine, with a large bathroom, a queen size bed, flat screen tv, Ipod player and all necessary amenities, inlcuding a crib for the baby (which was placed at no extra cost) and a state-of-the art kitchinnette (crucial if you travel with a baby). The Quai can get noisy with sirens during the day, though, which can be annoying. For us, the view was well worth it though and at night it's amazing. Breakfast was great, not lavish but just what we needed to start our day. Newspapers were provided, so were high chairs, and service was absolutely amazing thoughout our stay. Staff were corteous, helpful and always there. Note that this is an Apart Hotel and not your typical white glove, room serviced, 5-star hotel. They won't have a bell boy to take your bags and you won't be able to order in. The only problem we had, which was a major pain, was that a 24-hour blackout affected the area of the hotel and we were left with absolutely no power overnight, inlcuding no elevators. The hotel does not have a backup generator, which made us pretty upset, and made our night bwith a jetlagged baby pretty challenging. On a good note (which is why my review of this facility is \"excellent\"), the staff went out of their way to make our life easier. They were courteous, appologetic, understanding and efficient despite the circumnsances. They waived the charges for the night, payed for a taxi and placed us in a suite in an amazing nearby Citadines facility. I later got an email from the managers appologizing again. Despite a major glitch in the facility (no backup electricity), their customer service is extraordinary. Bottomline, if you're looking for a fancy hotel with room service, marble lobby, valet parking, etc, look somewhere else and be ready to spend over 500 euros/ night. If you're looking for an laid back, reasonably priced, spacious, clean, modern, well-serviced apart hotel this is one of the best choices around.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cLocation,Location\u201d", "Author": "tutscruiser", "ReviewID": "UR104883033", "Content": "Stayed here for 8 days in a one bedroom apart.

It would be handy for the hotel to add a few more euros to the price and provide basic toiletries, tea, coffee, sugar and cooking oil. While the nearby supermarket had such things in stock and the front desk can provide some items for a small fee, I often wondered 'why can't it just be in the rooms?'.

In particular, I recommend these restaurants, both on rue Dauphine, about a 5 min. walk from the hotel (unfortunately not French food): Pizza Marinara - run by a family from Napoli and the best Italian food you'll find outside of Italy.

I traveled with my wife and three children from 8 to 12 years old in this intro to Europe trip for them. Located right across from Ile de la Cite and a few minutes from active cafe area though touristy Boulevard St. Michel and a more local cafe and restaurant area in the opposite direction from the hotel, this was a great spot to base out of to visit Paris. Nearest Metro is just a block or so away and with the St. Germain area restaurants nearby, and a grocery store, combined with the kitchenette at this family room for 4 plus additional cot, a convenient laundry on site, we were very pleased. We did not opt for the 15 Euro per person breakfast at hotel but purchased our bread and cheese, fruits and juices at the nearby grocery store which was indicated on the map handed out by the staff, and spent 20Euro's total for a much more complete breakfast for 5. We had some miscommunication regarding the room cleaning service - which came at an extra price - and despite repeated attempts to have the basic cleanup performed, it was only actually done only one day of our 4 night stay. This was inconvenient only since we were expecting towels to be washed and beds made, but ok, as it isn't hard to hang your own towels and with 3 young children we are used to putting together our own beds. On this issue the manager was apologetic and seemed sincere and offered our family free breakfast on our final day - something we hadn't asked for, but was convenient on the day we packed out. In the end, we stayed 4 nights and found this location to be extremely convenient, the rooms clean and spacious, kitchenette ample, and the staff was pleasant and helpful.

BUt, of couse, we will be SHOCKED if that were to really happen. We were so disappointed as we had others we were meeting up with over the weekend (long, long distance relatives). They had booked all their rooms around the corner from the original Citadines. BUt now we were quite far apart. (small children were involved!) DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU! THey overbook on purpose as they have contracts with the airlines and take care of them first....then decide who to bump. I had read several reviews such as mine. But, they have been taken down from this sight.
