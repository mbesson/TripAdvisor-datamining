I have never had 'bad' service at a Westin, but the service here was even better than I am accustomed to. From the concierge, the front desk staff, to the staff in the hallways and room service, I am hard pressed to remember a time I have gotten better service at Any hotel in my travels. The pool and workout facilities were great, and of course the awesome heavenly beds keep me coming back, I find them very comfortable and they make for a good nights sleep. Nice to have the heavenly baths as well, complete with robes. I definitely recommend the Bayshore for vacationers and business travelers alike. I only wish I had known I was able to get a shuttle for free within 5 miles of the hotel, I chose to drive instead and had to pay the over $40 fee for parking, when I could have left my car at my sisters place a few miles away.

I wasn't a big fan of the closet being in the bathroom.

Water closet and clothes closet shouldn't mix. Rooms were a tad small. Not a deal breaker but it should be noted. Something else I wasn't keen on - the internet charges. While I was prepared to pay the $14.99/day charge, it was a bummer that I had to pay that for each computer or internet device I had. It was mostly a pleasure trip but there was some business thrown in. Because of this, I had a couple internet devices.

They showed me another room at 1:45am but the heat was broken and it was sweltering.... Thus back to original. By then i was wired, and couldnt sleep.

We have stayed there over christmas and again in February. It is close to downtown and really is the only hotel to have really fantastic views of the harbour, Stanley Park and the mountains. The hotel boasts Westin \"heavenly beds and the service is absolutely four star every time we stay there. On our previous stays we were always frustrated that the internet was extremely expensive whilst several other priceline or travelocity secret four star hotels in downtown Vancouver offered free internet to their guests. This has now been resolved and the hotel now issues free one hour coupons to their guests to use in the lobby. Well done Westin for listening to feedback from their guests! The hotel has a nice bar, restaurant and two swimming pools. It really is a delight to stay there but it is not yet our favourite hotel downtown. When you first enter the hotel there is a huge mostly empty lobby that has very little ambiance. We really think that the hotel is missing a trick by not using this space to create a more welcoming public area. We regularly use the Seattle Westin that has a similar public area but has much better seating and ambiance. It is a shame that guests to Vancouver don't benefit from a similar design and I am sure that the Bayshore miss out on revenue by creating a better space where their guests can relax. We never stay and eat breakfast at this hotel because it is ludicrously expensive compared with most other four star hotels. The problem is that the pricing structure reflects expense account guests and not the average leisure traveller. Our only other criticism of the hotel is that the televisions in the room all have had very poor signals unless you are watching a paid for HD movie. When we have raised this with the hotel they will generally send an engineer to the room to fiddle with the wires behind the tv but it is about time they got it right. When we stayed at Christmas we were offered a free HD movie by the front desk because their engineer could do anything about it. All in all this is a great choice for a trip to Vancouver, providing you don't plan on feeding your family in their restaurant or sitting in your hotel room watching the television.

So let\u2019s address the location first. If you are looking to be right in the middle of action (shopping/bars/business district), the Bayshore is indeed a bit out of the way. But it is only a short cab ride from all those things, and is a block north of Georgia Street which is serviced by fairly frequent bus service toward the downtown core. The location however is also one of its strength. It is located in Coal Harbour, where Vancouver\u2019s most expensive condos are found. It is also right at the marina and is next to Stanley Park. It takes about a lovely 15-minute walk on Denman down to the English Bay beach. The room I got overlooked the Marina and the hotel pool, which was a very pleasant view in late summer/early fall. The room was very spacious, well decorated, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was modern and well designed. Since it was September, it was still warm enough to take advantage of the large outdoor poor (if swim the diameter of the circular pool, you are swimming about the distance of a 16.6 m lap).

The property offers a variety of decent dining options but let's be honest in Vancouver with Denman, Robson and Gastown walking distance from the hotel, there are alot of great alternatives to hotel dining. Room serivice is worth a try- the late evening menu offers some good value. What really makes this property a favourite of mine if the location right up on the edge of Coal Harbour and a stone's throw from Stanley Park. You want a real West Coast experience, then you can hardly do better than the Westin Bayshore. no other hotel compares. Smell the sea salt from your room. Marvel at the magnificent Cypress and Western Redcedars and Arbutus trees that crowd Stanley Park. Enjoy the choreographed dance of the float planes, cruise ships and helicopters as they come and go on Coal Harbour right outside your guestroom window.

The cruise company recommended the hotel to us and overall it was a good recommendation. The position is absolutely perfect, as first time visitors to Vancouver it was central to the majority of the attractions.We were upgraded because we had requested a room on the executive floor, they do not have such a floor however they did give us a room with a view of the bay which was spectacular. Our stay did not start well, we had 6 bags to carry once we got out of our taxi and there was no porters to assist. Having struggled inside there was a long queue at the check in desk which didn't help our mood after a long flight. The decor appeared a little \"tired\", however the dark brown colour scheme did not help. However the room was comfortable and the staff were generally very efficient. We only ate breakfast in the hotel which was very expensive. Perhaps this relates to a difference of culture, Europeans in general eat small healthy breakfasts whilst you cannot help but notice our American cousins tend to eat very large meals at breakfast which probably explains the high price charged. We had chosen restaurants for dinner from reviews prior to arriving, however right outside the door of the hotel was an Italian restaurant which was excellent. We ate there twice. The hotel was very busy as there was a large convention in Vancouver at the time and the hotel was also the venue for television programme \"Canada's Got Talent\" which made every day very interesting to say the least.

The hotel is wonderfully situated in Vancouver, overlooking Stanley Park and Vancouver's harbour. The area around the hotel has great restaurants, is close to the convention centre, sea plane airport and cruise ship terminal. Stanley Park offers numerous bike, walking and jogging trails and was a great place to work out in (for active guests the hotel has a well appointed gym). The hotel has a variety of small stores, including a Starbucks outlet. Complimentary coffee brewing facilities are provided in the room offering Starbucks Coffee and Tazo teas, I did not have a mini-bar, but the room had a small refrigerator. My room was on the 18th floor of the tower, unfortunately not fully facing the park and harbour, but a bit off to the side. The views over the city, harbour and marina were great, especially from the small balcony (having a sliding door to let fresh air in was a plus too). As with all Vancouver Hotels on the water, guests do need to put up with a bit of sea-plane noise as well as the arriving and departing ship's horns. These noises are a minor irritation, and were not a factor at night. Westin's beds are very comfortable, and my room had a selection of different pillows (soft, firm, thin etc.). The bathroom had a bath (with weird double shower head) and hotel toiletries were of a high quality standard, robes are also provided. There is lots of cupboard and closet space, and my room also had a spacious work desk. Little extra touches such as towels at the entrance for joggers, and bowls of complimentary apples were nice.

With the Westin being located right on the waterfront it offers endless sights of shear natural beauty as you look out from your lovely room to the harbour and then over to the magnificent mountains (our wedding pictures testify to this!). In fact the windows, well sliding glass doors actually, are all part of the enchanting experience of staying at the Westin especially as you take in the amazing sights during the day then the color struck skies during dawn and dusk. Even the night views of the harbour and city are really striking from the rooms. Being surrounded by the beautiful Stanley Park and many top restaurants and cafes along the waterfront, nobody had to venture far or think hard to be entertained. Walking and cycling around Stanley Park was a top favorite amongst our party. It is an out of this world experience and even more so since we spotted seals in the water. Even within the hotel itself our guests were able to take advantage of the Starbucks, Whale Watching trips, the Spa and moreover we all loved being able to gather together as a group in the mornings during the fantastic buffet breakfast. The staff at the Westin were amazing, particularly as some small and unexpected touches pleasantly continued to surprise - such as offering popsicles at the peaceful poolside in the hot sunny afternoons! We loved the afternoon turn down service in as the staff were so thorough and friendly that our room was very well kept and so comfortable at all times. In conclusion, we have to say that with the Westin Bayshore you are living in the best of all worlds as a guest. While the hotel itself has everything you could want for a luxurious and restful stay, the fun city of Vancouver is right at hand while on the other side you have the magnificent and striking beauty of Vancouver\u2019s nature.

We could have stayed at less expensive hotels in Vancouver, but some friends stayed there a couple of years ago and said it was nice, plus we wanted to be on the waterfront. We prepaid $1315 in May to get a good rate for 3 nights. We reserved an upper floor room with a guaranteed room overlooking the bay. We arrived on the day of check in at 12:30pm because we had to check out of a different hotel, knowing check in there was at 3pm. We were prepared to site see the harbor area until check in time. The desk clerk said our city view room was not ready yet. I told her we had a bay view room. She said we didn't. I showed her our confirmation letter and she said okay. She said our 11th floor room would be ready at 3pm. We had the luggage people hold our 4 suitcases and we went sightseeing. We returned at 3:30 and our room still was not ready. But she said she had a similar room on the 10th floor, so we took it, as we were tired from walking. I went to get our checked luggage and the guy brought it out and left it in front of me and started to walk away. I asked if he could deliver it to our room? He had a very poor attitude and said he could. It was obvious he was very busy, but his poor attitude was unnecessary. He did deliver it to our room, and was all friendly when it came time for me to tip him. On a positive note, our room was awesome. Also breakfast in the breakfast area was good. One night we went into the bar to have a late dinner. We were enjoying a drink, waiting for our food, when the bar suddenly filled up with a huge drunken crowd who just got off a party boat docked outside the hotel. We had to move onto the patio, wrapped up in a blanket, under a heat lamp, just to be able to hear each other talk. And our bar waiter got all pushed out of shape because we moved, apparently because a different waiter would get his tip. One last gripe. The hotel has an outdoor pool, and an indoor pool and spa. All 3 nights we wanted to go for a swim in the indoor pool or soak in the spa. But every time we checked it out it was like a kiddie pool!

We've stayed closer to the main shopping district near Robson in the past, and I have to say that staying at the Westin was much more convenient and pleasant than I would have thought. The hotel faces Coal Harbour, and your room will either face the Stanley Park view or the Canada Place view. Both are pretty spectacular. Our room was on the 7th floor, and our other family member's room on the 9th. Ours had the Stanley Park view, and it was pretty wonderful. The only minor downside is that the outdoor pool is on that side, so you do get the gleeful screams of children swimming. The room is nicely appointed, and those Westin beds are super comfortable. The bathroom has kind of a strange barn door mechanism that precludes total privacy, but we got used to it. The showers are the rainfall kind of showers which aren't my favorite, but everyone else seemed to love them. Great storage in the room for clothes, and there is a safe that easily held my IPAD and valuables. The lobby is huge, and there are many areas for gathering with family to meet up for a Starbuck's coffee (great lobby Starbucks with efficient and friendly staff). The restaurant for breakfast has top quality food, and also super efficient staff. We were even given a \"chef's tasting\" of a smoothie that was delicious. Try the turkey omelet - sounds weird, but was amazing. The bar and grill restaurant has seen better days from a decor standpoint, but the drinks were well prepared, and again, the staff was friendly and efficient. Sitting outside is nice, but again, those pool folks are noisy. You can sit on the quieter side for a coffee outside Starbucks, but it is a little too shady and dull for such a magnificent location. Also be sure to walk along the seawall and visit Stanley Park. It is just minutes away, and the Canadian's brilliant separation of cyclists, roller bladers and pedestrians is something to see (and emulate!) In terms of transportation, I would NOT rent a car. It was $300 for four days of a car rental, and the hotel parking is $41 per day. Just take a cab from the airport, and you can walk just about anywhere else. There is also a new train from the airport, but we didn't take it. For a family celebration we rented a limo from Posh Limousines, and Dorel, the driver, was about as great as they come. For dinner, we went to Seasons in the Park, which is about a 15 minute drive from the hotel, and it was just over the top fabulous. What a view. And the food and service were both spot-on. Everyone visiting Vancouver should go there at least once. Even if for a drink. We also went to a new spot on Denman called Cosca. Mike, the owner, is so personable and wonderful. The Italian menu is extensive, and between our party of 6, we didn't have one dish that wasn't spectacular. I would highly recommend walking around English Bay, then dining at Cosca. We had the added bonus of one of the most amazing fireworks displays we have ever seen, but the sites and sounds there are always a treat. One last great tip. For a terrific meal, go into an Urban Fare market and visit their buffet. Fresh, beautifully prepared food, and a perfectly pleasant dining area to eat in. This is also a good idea if you have picky eaters, since there is everything from sushi to salads to chicken and fries. And on your way out of the store, stop and buy some of the locally made craftsman chocolates.

FIRST IMPRESSION Upon nearing the hotel, we were a little unimpressed with the exterior. Unlike most Westin hotels that I've stayed in, this one seemed dated. However, as we entered the hotel, I began to feel much more at home. The lobby is beautiful and very spacious, and they even provide ice cold water infused with lemon (I definitely took advantage of this after a bike ride through Stanley Park!) ROOMS Though we arrived around noon, my room was ready. I was given a room on the 3rd floor in the lower building. Now that I think about it, I should have asked if there were any other rooms available on a higher floor. I had a view of the concrete building beside me. However, the other party I was with got a room in the taller tower with a beautiful view of the seawall, harbour, and Stanley Park. The room itself was very nice, with everything you're used to in a Westin hotel. There was a safety deposit box and a mini-fridge (accessible with the key, so I didn't use it). The washroom was spacious and beautiful, and even had a double shower head. Something I did notice, though, was that the place could have used a bit of a dusting (on the alarm and on the shelf underneath the sink). Something to note is that they have a program where you can refuse housekeeping for the day and be given either 500 starpoints or a $5 voucher to use in the hotel. The wait for the lobby elevators to the shorter tower can be a little long, but if you walk towards the Starbucks, there is actually a second elevator there for use. SERVICE The service staff were very helpful, and we got to know quite a few of them over the duration of our stay, such as Johnny, who recommended some of the best restaurants we ate in. They were always willing to provide answers to our questions and went out of their way to check things for us using their computers. Housekeeping was also very helpful. I left my curling iron at home and they were able to provide one for me throughout my stay. The only dining I did in the hotel (if this counts) was the Starbucks, so I cannot comment on this aspect of the hotel. LOCATION The location is an interesting one, being right by the sea wall and Stanley Park. It is about a 15 or even 20 minute walk to the convention centres and the heart of downtown, but I really liked the calm of the location. There are many eateries along Denman and also along the seawall for you to enjoy (I really liked Cafe Villagio right along the sea wall for breakfast). You can also rent bikes very close to the hotel (Spokes is where I got mine, right at Denman and Georgia) to take into Stanley Park. TRANSPORTATION The transportation staff was very helpful and made sure we got our taxis briskly (It's about a $7 taxi to the Convention Centre and Canada Place). There is also a shuttle - driven by a nice man named Viktor - that runs every hour on the :40 to the Pacific Centre. It picks up at the Pacific Centre to head back to the hotel around :45. We used the shuttle quite a few times, and Viktor was often nice enough to drive us right to our destination. We went to Chinatown early one morning and he took us right there, including letting us know where we should go and where we should stay more vigilant. On my last day, I rented a bike and needed to lock it up with the hotel. This was a very time-consuming process, as I needed to go over to the parking, ask for the bike room key from the attendant, and lock it up in this small, dark room. My bike was definitely safe, though. For those of you who are planning on taking the bus, walk down to Georgia Street and there will be quite a few buses taking you downtown. From downtown, walk to Pender and the 19 will take you back towards the hotel. FITNESS CENTRE The hotel has two pools - one indoor and one outdoor - as well as a small whirlpool and a fitness centre. I did use the fitness centre once, which was just off the indoor pool. It was an appropriate size but was jam-packed with machines. The machines were usable but were starting to show their age. They had weights, but were missing mats. I ended up doing warm-ups and mat work on a thin pilates mat that was there. There was a constant stream of families coming into the indoor pool, but no one looked cramped. Having stayed in the hotel for almost a week, I was very sad to leave.

The bedsheets were clean - no so the bed skirt, which sported an uncomfortable brown stain. The white cloth chair in the room was appalling - more grey than white, with obvious grime on the armrests and seat. Saturday evening service left a bit to be desired, as well. When we arrived there was only one person working at the check in desk - and later, when we went down to check with the concierge regarding things to do around the hotel, there was a sign on the concierge desk instructing us to speak to the front desk attendant for assistance...

It was supposed to sleep 4 people, but when we got there we found that it was a single king bed without any pull out. We had the option of sleeping in 2 double beds but didn't think that would work well with two small kids who go to bed very early. So, we upgraded at a cost of $80 to the next level up, which was a junior suite with a separate room (king) and a queen size pullout. That worked perfectly and the room was nice. This was the best part of the stay. Pros: * on the waterfront so you have a nice walking/running area. * next to Stanley park * the room was nice--luxurious really--and the beds comfortable. Cons: * the biggest issue with us was the parking. We drove up from Washington, and after reading reviews of Vancouver decided it was safest to park at their garage. I had read online the cost was about $26. However, when we got there the cost was $36. What really was upsetting about this is two things: the parking garage is totally unsecured in a high-crime area, and it's across the street from the hotel in a public garage! That's a total rip off. There were signs everywhere saying to take all valuables out of the car, it was a high crime area, they weren't responsible for theft, etc. On top of that the Valet was worried about some stuff we had in the car and advised we haul it all to the room. Since that wasn't possible he told us to back directly up to a wall in a corner of the garage so people couldn't break into the back of the vehicle nor a side window. Seriously?? This is what $36 gets? We had no other choice but do it, and I made 2 separate trips out over night to check on the car. I also was lugging bags back and forth to the car. Way too much anxiety to stay at a place like this. * The hotel is being remodeled, which is understandable, but they had a work area in the main hallway to the swimming pool. No slippers were provided, so my family and I had to walk through the work area in bare feet. Not really a great experience. * The hallways and pool of the hotel seem dated. They are focusing on the rooms and lobby updates first. * the bathroom in the room had a sliding door that kept coming off its track. When it did you got locked in the bathroom until someone forced the door back out. A little scary for a kid. * Although the room was nice, it was set on an inside corner. We had a patio (which we didn't use) but had zero view from the room itself because we were in the corner. We looked at a wall (the patio wall) out the window of the bedroom, and out the main room window we saw the other hotel wing. So, overall, good hotel cleanliness, decent location, room was pretty good itself (except the view), the staff was nice, but the parking is a no-go, and they should tell you that a King room doesn't really sleep 4 as advertised.

Without our knowledge, the Westin Bayshore generosity even went as far as to pre-pay our taxi fare from the hotel to the airport when we departed Vancouver.

Unfortunately, we were placed in the back part of the building that stands only 4 stories tall (as opposed to one of the towers) so our view of the harbor was just OK. I would recommend this hotel to friends if they got a room on a higher TOWER floor. The big drawback of being on the harbor is the noise from the seaplanes and the smell of fuel from the boats. We couldn't really leave the windows open if we wanted any quiet at all. The room itself was decent, but the common areas in the hotel were beautiful. Perhaps that is why they decided to shoot a movie in the lobby and on floor 5 during the 3 days that we were there. Normally, I would think \"how fun\", but the filming just added to the noise in our room. We were on the 4th floor of a 4 floor building which meant a pebble/rock covered roof was above us. Problem is that they ran cables and set-up equipment for the movie on that roof so from 7 AM until they quit in late afternoon, all we'd hear was crunch, crunch, crunch as workers walked back and forth on the pebbles above our heads. Since it rained all 3 days in Vancouver, we were in the room much more than usual so the constant noise drove us crazy\u2026.you couldn't even listen to the TV and forget about sleep. The 2nd day I called the front desk and asked about the noise and told her the problem. At no point did she apologize\u2026instead I got a short response and a \"would you like to talk to the manager\" to which I responded yes. Of course, I got stuck in voice mail instead of being connected to an actual person. I called the front desk on several occasions and got no answer after letting it ring on each occasion for at least 10 times. I suggested that they not put someone in a 4th floor room in the back building when they know they'll be tromping around on the roof for 3 days, but that got no response and at no point did they offer to move us to an alternate room. Bottom line is that the customer service was abysmal. That said, I am trying not to knock the entire hotel for a few sub-par staff members. The concierge was helpful providing information for local restaurants and shops. We did take a hop on/off bus tour of the city that I would definitely NOT recommend because there aren't that many sites in the city and you basically get shuttled from one hotel to the next with little to see in between. Most of the sites are within walking distance of the hotel with the exception of the Chinese garden which I would recommend taking a taxi to. My husband rented a bike for 3 hours and biked all over Stanley park and the rest of town - he loved it and would recommend taking in the sites that way. P.S.

We were advised to ask for one of the refurbished rooms which we got. It had terrific views across the bay to the mountains beyond. The room was a reasonable size, but seemed to have too much furniture in it which we were constantly moving around to get to the desk or window etc. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The room had tea and coffee making facilities, along with an empty fridge we was great. This should be available in ALL hotels. The bathroom could have done with being a bit bigger. It had one of those rainfall showers which I \u2018m not a fan of as you end up getting your hair wet even when you don\u2019t want to wash it (the plastic caps are never that good). The toiletries were ok. The closet was quite small and located in the bathroom so the clothes kept getting a steaming! We struggled to fit all our clothes on the rail for a one week stay. It has a fitness room and indoor pool which are both quite small. There is also an outdoor pool with loungers etc. The spa is nice, but I found the staff to be a bit condescending. I had a massage which was ok. It\u2019s a very expensive hotel and we wouldn\u2019t have stayed there if we were paying for it ourselves. The food was also expensive. We had breakfast from the buffet most morning as it seemed quite good value compared to ordering everything separately. It offered a good selection of food which looked and tasted fresh.

To be sure, it\u2019s beginning to show some wear (the establishment could you a little sprucing up here and there), and if you\u2019re one who\u2019d rather leave the kids at home then you may have to do a fair bit of strategic planning in order to avoid those precious little ones. These potential drawbacks aside (depending on your taste, of course), it\u2019s a pretty fine establishment. Check-in was pretty efficient and swift (perhaps given that I arrived pretty late without any other patrons waiting in line), and the attendant was pretty friendly. Rooms are quite spacious with oversized bathrooms and most feature views of the harbor. Usual Westin staples are present \u2013 brew your own Starbucks, \u2018heavenly\u2019 bedding, bath and body (who doesn\u2019t love those white tea aloe scented toiletries), robes, and, a pretty impressive room service menu. There\u2019s a spa onsite, fitness center with indoor pool, outdoor heated pool, and restaurants like the Seawall Bar and Grill, serving scrumptious fare overlooking the harbor. Westin\u2019s breakfast buffet (you know how I love a good spread) though satisfactory, is a little sparse at $27 CAD. I found that ordering off the menu seems to be a better deal (again depending on personal taste). For breakfast items, Westin features what they call \u2018SuperFoods\u2019 which tend be of more nutritional value and rich in antioxidants. I tried the Blueberry and Orange Granola Pancakes and it was quite tasty \u2013 certainly recommended.

Glad we did choose the Westin Bayshore as we found it to be a delightful hotel in a perfect location (especially if you want to visit Stanly Park - if you do, you have to try the bike rides!). Its also easy walk to downtown areas, and we even walked to/from Granville Island (about 30 mins each way). Lovely room overlooking the Harbour (majestic views), great bed, and the service was great (eg when the safe locked - due to squeezing too much into it - the engineer was up within 5 mins to rectify it). We only ate once at the hotel but the california cob salad lunch was terrific on a lovely terrace (views nearly as good on the hotel restaurant terrace as on the nearby Carderos restaurant which is worth trying, or The Lift, also beside the hotel, which is worth trying for drinks, didn't eat there). The fitness room was one of the better ones I've encountered in many years using hotel gyms.(didn't use the pool) And they had no problem arranging a later check out for us. While we were there a TV series was being filmed one evening outside the hotel and we had to wait 2 mins or so before we could leave, this was the only inconvenience encountered! The previous review said TV reception was poor, we did encounter this problem but we only turned it on once as we rarely watch TV when visiting locations (even on business, who wants to spend leisure time watching TV!!); and there was no minibar (which I've encountered before in some Canadian hotels, although they did provide a fridge for you to put your own stuff if you like) and there was free bottled water each day; this was a minor issue and overall I'm happy to award 4.5 out ot 5 and recommend Westin Bayshore to anybody visiting Vancouver.

The Bell Captain pointed to the self parking lot across the hotel and said this was $36 CND/day! After parking, I went back to the hotel. The Bell Captain was gone and there was a balding Persian Bell Hop at the front instead. I asked whether I can pre-pay for parking so that I don\u2019t have to pay each time I pull the car out. He scoffed a response which was incorrect and gave a lot of attitude. I was turned off by his poor service, so decided to go to the front desk who quickly clarified my options. NOTE to future travelers: DO NOT PARK at the hotel\u2019s self-parking lot! PARK at the \u201cPublic Parking\u201d lot to the LEFT of the hotel\u2019s self-parking lot.

If you have little ones, there is a cheap and good Petting Zoo in the park, including a 15 min Train ride. There were plenty of people out doing their morning walks. Next time I will bring my bike so that I can bike the entire 2-hour Sea Walk trail. The bikers and roller bladders had their own side of the trail so walkers don\u2019t get run over. If you are hungry, skip the hotel restaurant and walk to Robson (5 min) where there are plenty to choose from (also a good place for shopping). If you want even more restaurant variety, walk down Denman (10 min) all the way to English Bay (20 min) and I\u2019m sure you will find something that fits your palate.

I found it just too big; lots of walking just to get to concierge or elevators. We had to move rooms once because the bed was uncomfortable for my husband's bad back and the second room we got, though larger, had a noisy air conditioning unit which drove me crazy all night long. The housekeeping staff behaved like I was asking for far too much when I called for more dry towels after using ours during the day and then while we were out they left new towels but they never took the heap of wet ones from the floor. Our safe broke and had to be repaired and the line ups to speak to the concierge took forever. The location is fabulous; right by Stanley Park and the view is great but perhaps there are other hotels with more to offer. Breakfast buffets are $27.00 and not all that good. There is lots of food but it's just not that well prepared. Staff can be surly in the morning as they get so busy. There are large tour groups coming in and other business groups using the hotel so it is not cozy. The hallways look drab and tired and the brown glossy paint on the doors and trim just add to the dated appearance. The linens on the bed feel fresh and new and crisp. The internet in our second room was not working and we had to fuss with it to get it going. All in all I found it frustrating although there was one staff person who seemed to work hard to please us. On our first night my son would not even get in the huge outdoor pool as it was filthy with leaves and debris and lots of bird poop.

The hotel was our favorite place to stay in the 1970s and 1980s, so this visit, post a renovation a few years ago, was of considerable interest. First the bad news. The once convenient parking lot, an integral part of the hotel property, has been replaced by building development. Guests\u2019 cars now have to enter the cavernous parking basement of an adjacent condominium development. Although self parking is a stated option, most of the spots assigned to the hotel read \u2018valet parking only\u2019, forcing some, I\u2019m sure, into this track in busy times. Self parking for us ran $31.00 per 24 hours. The lobby renovation has rendered the previous incarnation even more austere. Elegant-in-marble to be sure, but not warm. The room we were assigned was rather spartan\u2013 the norm in the main building \u2013 and had an adequate if tiny bathroom. Although sporting a flat screen TV courtesy of the latest renovation, the cable reception was quite poor, not that one would wish to spend much time at it in this environment. Of the two \u2018Happy\u2019 housecoats provided in the room, one was shop worn and yellowish. House publications in the room failed to provide any useful information about the bars and restaurants in the hotel, and except for the outrageously expensive room service breakfast menu, no other was found. A final blow: the invoice slipped under the door contained a double billing for the parking. Now the good part. The property still exudes understated class. Much of this derives from the spectacular physical setting, adjacent to Stanley Park, and right on coal harbor. The rest comes from the many moneyed guests who drive up in their Lexus,Bently and similar pedestrian vehicles, most with USA plates. The popular bar, in the wing that once contained Trader Vic\u2019s restaurant, is warm, marine themed, and a touch tropical. It\u2019s clearly meant to appeal to folks attending the big conventions which this iteration of the hotel is designed around. No tables for two, just for parties of 4-6 or more. We didn\u2019t eat at the hotel on this occasion but the appetizers being served in the bar looked very attractive and were reasonably priced. The main restaurant has historically been expensive, but then, so has the hotel in general. The chefs seen in the corridors on occasion appeared to be very professional and seasoned. The beds in our room were almost as good as the Westin logo \u2018heavenly\u2019. The room was a wonderfully quiet environment looking over the interior garden pool and harbor. Those desiring a larger, more modern and of course more expensive room can book into the Tower building, where Howard Hughes camped out in the entire top floor for months near the end. There is a great looking indoor pool and gym, neither of which we visited on this occasion. There are several useful shops in the hotel, including a full-fledged Starbucks which opens at 6AM. The marine walk, surrounding the coal harbor sides of the hotel, is spectacular, and takes you past acres of amazing power and sail craft, as well as a chic new over-the-water bar and grill called \u2018Lift\u2019. The\u2018Cardero\u2019s seafood restaurant is encountered nearby.

The hotel is in an excellent location and both Stanley Park and the downtown area are a 10 to 15 minute walk away. Our room in the tower was very nice although quite small. It had a vew of Stanley Park, but the balcony was not big enough for a chair, so we could only enjoy it from inside the room (it would have been nice to be able to sit outside). Service in the hotel was consistently excellent. Every staff member I dealt with was friendly and efficient. The room was quiet (except for noise from the marina outside) and the common areas of the hotel were always spotless. The fitness centre was okay but the pool was not big enough for swimming laps. There were a few small things that surprised me at a hotel at this price point (my room was $289 a night). First, they seemed a bit stingy with the in-room suplies. There was no sewing kit, no shoe shine cloth and no city guide. Small things, but when I get to a strange city in the middle of the night, I don't want to leave the room to look for supplies and info. There was a coffee maker with a good selection of Starbucks tea and coffee, but it only came with 2 paper cups, 2 individual creamers and 3 sugar packets (they were replaced daily). Again, a bit stingy, and since there were no coffee mugs in the room we could not make more than one cup of tea or coffee each. The first day we had breakfast at the buffet downstairs and I was not impressed. It was $26, and the waffles and bacon I selected were cold and hard. When I spoke to the hostess, she had the kitchen make me a fresh order, but the supplies on the buffet were not changed. Some items on the buffet were finished and were not replaced. Finally, the room came with a card stating that customers could help the environment by declining room service. If you chose this option they will give you a $5 voucher to use in the hotel restaurants. This seems to be a new trend in hotels, but I find it truly ridiculous. How does it help the environment if my room isn't cleaned? They only change the sheets if your request it (which is fine with me), but if I'm paying close to $300 for a hotel room, I don't want to make my own bed and clean my own bathroom. It seems to me that they are using the environmental angle to get away with offering less service. On a related note, there was no bottled water in the room and a sign urged guest to help the environment by drinking tap water. That's a nice thought, but when I'm in a stange city and heading out to do some sight seeing, it's nice to be able to grab a bottle of water to take with me. If hotels are serious about helping the environment, maybe they should provide reusable water bottles or coffee flasks (I ended up buying both at the Starbucks downstairs for $12 each).", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cExtraordinary Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "dennistarrant", "ReviewID": "UR61374165", "Content": "I was absolutely floored with the high level of customer service and attention to detail.

This was easily the nicest hotel I have stayed in to date, and that includes all aspects of things - room, staff, amenities, etc. We booked it specifically for the view, and it certainly lived up to expectations. We stayed in the main part of the hotel (not the rennovated Tower), in a Harbour View room. The full length sliding windows are a wonderful feature, which really allowed us to enjoy the view. We looked out straight over the marina, with a nice slice of the city to the southeast and the water/mountains to the northwest. Watching the pontoon planes land and takeoff was a highlight of the trip. Watching the joggers on their way to/from Stanley Park in all sorts of weather did have a way of making one feel like a wuss. The room was very clean, and all furnishings were in good shape. The bed was comfortable enough to make me want one at home. We never once heard a sound from other rooms, save the occasional water flow through pipes. The hotel pool and hot tub were clean and comfortable, though it was too cold to try the outdoor pool. Everyone we spoke to who worked at the hotel was very kind, helpful and friendly. The location is also nice, depending on what you're looking for. It is in a bit of a quieter area, which we found extremely nice. Stanley Park is an easy stroll away, and a few blocks over are plenty of food options. Starbucks is in the lobby if you don't want to walk one of the 37 others within a two mile radius. My only possible gripe is with the price. Parking at the hotel, as in most major cities, is expensive at ~$30/day, but probably the easiest option. Breakfast, which we did not partake in, is ~$20/day/person. Internet is ~$15/day, and there is no free public access computer to use as an alternative. The overall price of the room is not outrageous, given the quality of the hotel. It was just a bit irksome that anything extra had a fairly hefty price tag attached. As a whole, however, I really enjoyed my time here and can't imagine staying anywhere else if I find myself back in Vancouver. I would highly recommend the Westin Bayshore.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cIts location next to the park makes it one of the best, relaxing places to stay\u201d", "Author": "WestCoaster31", "ReviewID": "UR60840796", "Content": "I absolutely love this place. First of all it's located right next to Stanley Park, which is a huge, beautiful park that offers great views of the city skyline. It's a lot of fun to go out for walk or jog first thing in the morning. Secondly, the views are great. Even though you're in the heart of a major city you feel like you're almost away from it all. You wake up and you look at the snow capped mountains or the harbor. The staff at this hotel have always been friendly and willing to help. You can walk to the heart of Robson street in 15 minutes. They do have a shuttle from the hotel, too, that will take you there and pick you up. I believe it leaves every 30 minutes. The breakfast at the hotel is hearty but I have to admit, a bit pricey, so there are other little cafes near the hotel to get something to eat. The rooms are all nicely renovated and quite relaxing. There's a big conventional hall that's a part of the hotel but when it's busy you're life at the hotel is not impacted too much. If you want the mountain/sea views make sure you ask. And, the higher up you are the better the view you get. The biggest selling point of the hotel is it's location and of course, Westin comfort. You sacrifice extreme close proximity to the heart of attractions but it's really worth it and shopping, restaurants and what not are totally accessible by foot, the FREE hotel shuttle and/or taxi.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unity, SK.", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, best location in Vancouver.\u201d", "Author": "SaskTraveller5", "ReviewID": "UR59759410", "Content": "After check in, my wife and I found 2 double beds looking onto a brick wall, so phoned down, desk indicated maybe change in a few days.

Started off on the wrong foot when they didn't have the king connecting with doubles room we had requested. Staff was nice but didn't/couldn't fix the issue. One of the major reasons we booked this property was because of the great looking outdoor pool seen in on-line photos. Consequently we were really unhappy to find out that the outdoor pool was closed the night of our arrival for a private function(which as my kids pointed out didn't involve swimming in the pool but rather schmoozing by the pool). The property does have a fairly nice indoor pool but it was very frustrating to have a major public area like the pool closed down for the night. On top of that the party going on by the pool was very,very loud with (bad) music blaring. Staff was very unresponsive to our complaints about this(basically sorry but nothing we can do). This party was essentially going on in the center court of the hotel so it had to be bothering anyone with a room overlooking the pool. Then at 5am we were awakened by loud,drunk people next door-walls must be thin. Security did come up and quiet them down fairly quickly and hotel did send up a cheese tray to apologize the next day. Many of the reviews seem to reference the \"tower\". I think we were in an older part of the hotel-halls looked a bit tired. Room was ok and bed comfortable but nothing special. Outdoor pool area has lovely view and when we did get to use it it was enjoyable although too cool in July to swim by about 6pm(again the indoor pool is a bit warmer). The one(only?) reason to stay here is the location. We were thrilled to be staying outside of the congested downtown vancouver area. We loved being able to walk to Stanley Park and the aquarium(which we highly recommend). Definitely have more of a resort feel with the nice views of the bay. We ate at a really good seafood place nearby (don't recall the name). The breakfast buffet was very nice at the hotel(loads of fresh fruit) but fairly pricey.

Overall it was a very good stay but the Hotel is not perfect. Booked through priceline and got a great rate but in return they assign whatever rooms they desired. In an effort to obtain a room with a King sized bed, I faxed a letter kindly requesting just a King and some nice places to eat, etc. Normally I'm not picky but it was a special weekend for us so I made that request hoping they would help. Besides, two doubles is more \"sellable\" than a King anyways. When I arrived, they advised the hotel was full and actually would have put me in a room with two doubles and after politely requesting again in person (this high-ranking hotel may have not gotten my letter?) they found a King room that needed to be cleaned, so we returned a few hours later - I wonder if the Hotel was really booked up, but nonetheless I was glad they accommodated. The service at the front desk is at par with your typical high-end hotel and they were accommodating. The room was on the second floor of the main tower and was well furnished and nicely appointed (bathrobes are a nice touch). Our bed was exceptionally comfortable. The pools and exercise room are top notch and it definitely gives you a feeling of luxuriousness.. However, not to be nitpicky, but as a high-end hotel I did come in with great expectations. The room itself was a bit on the small side and the view was poor (the front veranda). We could hear the water go on/off and flush at night and if people in the hall were loud at night, the noise permeates through the doors. This is the type of hotel you come back to sleep at and not live in for the day; it is Vancouver after all, so the sights and sounds are what matter. The mini-bar and restaurant's prices are quite pretentious for what you pay (ie. $5 for a bottle of water) so expect this coming in. The showers are beautiful and unique, but if you are a bath type person, this may not work for you. Also, the closets are actually in the washroom. And don't forget parking will cost you $26+ and if you self park the parkade is actually down the street. Also, internet will cost you! If you decide not to receive maid service, the Hotel will give you a voucher towards any restaurant, room service, etc. so we used this to offset the high costs of breakfast. A ton of restaurants and other amenities are nearby, even a Safeway so for cost-concious customers (not sure if this is the type who would stay at this hotel) there are a myriad of dining options. Overall, aside from the points above, if you are looking for the experience of a high class hotel, this is a good choice. The location is top notch right by Stanley Park and the hotel does offer excellent amenities. It does become a money pit once you factor in your meals, mini-bar and parking though, but again I imagine this is the type of hotel that wants to cater to customers with such luxuries.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in Stunning Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "ja2008", "ReviewID": "UR35415709", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights at the Westin Bayshore.

Upon arriving at the other \"boutique\" hotel, we were extremely disappointed in their room, their facilities and their staff, but were at a loss as what to do, since we had no other options immediately available to us. I called a friend, and he recommended I call the Westin Bayshore, as he and his wife had stayed there before. I called Westin reservations, and began what turned out to be one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had with a hotel and its staff. When I explained our predicament to the reservation clerk, Kathy, I was pleasantly surprised when she went well beyond my expectations to help us get a room, at a great rate, even though it was last minute. She stayed on the phone with me until I had time to talk to my wife and to check with the people at the \"boutique\" hotel to see if we could leave without any penalty (fortunately, they did allow us to do that). I booked the room, and we then proceeded to drive directly to the Westin Bayshore, where we were greeted as we pulled into the porte cochere by the head valet, valet staff, and bellman, who unloaded and parked our car while we were directed into the hotel and the registration desk. After a quick check-in, our bellman took us to our 16th floor corner room in the tower building. Our bellman hung up our clothes, set up our suitcases, filled our ice bucket and asked if there was anything else he could do for us before leaving. Our room had magnificent views of the harbor and the city out of its floor-to-ceiling glass windows and doors onto the balcony, and was immaculately clean and beautifully appointed with its contemporary wood furniture, a well-stocked mini-bar, great closet (with plush his-and-her robes), generous drawer space, an in-room safe, flat-screen TV, one of the most comfortable king-sized beds I've ever slept in, a beautiful bathroom with granite countertops and a glass-enclosed tile shower with a large center shower head in the ceiling. What a difference compared to the \"boutique\" hotel we had just left to come to the Westin! After we were settled in, I went down to Concierge, as my existing reservations for our anniversary dinner were at the aforementioned \"boutique\" hotel's restaurant, which I no longer wished to patronize. Emily, who apparently takes care of the concierge duties at the Westin Bayshore, recommended two excellent restaurants; \"Seasons\" in Queen Elizabeth Park, and \"Sequoia Teahouse\" in Stanley Park. At my request, she then made arrangements for both restaurants, one on the night before our anniversary and one the night of our anniversary. When we went to the restaurants, we were pleasantly surprised to receive free hors d'oeuvres, compliments of the Westin Bayshore concierge.

My most recent stay was no exception. As others have mentioned, the staff members are uniformly great, making guests feel at home and at ease immediately. The doorman watched my car while I checked in without forcing me to park and then retrieve it within just a few minutes' time. Although I arrived quite a bit before noon, the desk clerk found me a room on the 7th floor that was ready for occupancy and got me right in. The concierge was happy to answer all my questions and provide me with a map of the local area so I could find my way. My guest room (724) was very Asian-modern and incldued high-end amenities like a flat-screen TV, robes in the room (without having to be requested), and an increasingly-rare commodity these days: a minibar. It also had the famous Westin Heavenly Bed but, interestingly, no Heavenly Shower...or tub. The bathroom had only a shower, but with a \"drench\" showerhead, similar to those at the Savoy Hotel in London. Very pleasant; just a bit of a surprise. The Bayshore has a self-service business centre (yes, spelled \"re\"; you're in Canada, after all), an indoor pool and spa, a fitness centre they're in the process of refurbishing, and an onsite restaurant and bar. With the hotel located on Coal Harbour, many (if not all) of the rooms have great views, either of Burrard Inlet, Stanley Park, or the mountains. It's a few blocks from the popular shopping area along Robson Street, but it's not a bad walk unless the weather is horrible. And the area immediately around the hotel is fairly built up, offering a selection of cafes, restaurants, and a bit of shoping as well as nice places to walk. There are a few drawbacks of which one should be aware. The Westin Bayshore has an attached conference center; therefore, things can get a little crazy if there's an activity or two underway. Also, as an older facility, the walls are a bit thinner than many newer hotels and I could easily hear the two women next door when they returned to their room after what I have to conclude was an evening of partying. It's not that they were especially loud; they just weren't church-mice. When I mentioned that to the clerk upon check-out, he was most conciliatory and urged me to call the front desk next time and allow them to intervene.

The hotel was booked as part of a business convention and we could not have been happier with the Westin. The location of the hotel is right on the harbour adjacent to Stanley Park with a commanding view of harbour, Stanley Park and the city depending on the room. We were on the 7th floor in the lower tower facing the harbour/city. The room has been recently renovated and although the bathroom was a bit on the small side due to the size of the vanity, it suited us well. The shower was a bit different with a plate glass partition and no door. The shower head is an overhead 'rain' style that falls directly on you. Takes a bit to get used to it and it does swivel. The room was of a typical size with a comfortable king sized 'heavenly bed' and a wide choice of pillows to choose from. The television is a 32\" LCD mounted on the wall directly accross from the foot of the bed. There are about 60 channels and specialty pay per view, however, none were high def except the rental movies. There are two comfortable chairs and a small table next to the balcony window. Although there was no balcony in this particular room the floor to ceiling glass window/patio door slid accross and virtually opened up the room. The views from most rooms are excellent, however you need to be at least 5-6 floors up to clear the service buildings. All of the tables in the room were glass covered which gave the room a modern contemporary look. There is a mini bar fridge and electronic safe available. Closed space is limited and located in the bathroom. An iron and ironing board is also supplied along with two oversized housecoats. The service in this hotel is above standard. Everyone was pleasant and most helpful. The foyer is expansive and very impressive. There are two pools, one outdoor adjacent to the seawall and an indoor with a large hot tub. The business facilities were standard with only two computers on a cost to use basis located in a separate room on the mall level adjacent to Starbucks. The meeting rooms are large and the grand ballroom is able to handle a sizable crowd. The bar is located next to the seawall and offers the standard fare with an excellent view. We did not try the restaurant as it seemed to be closed everytime we checked. There are excellent places to eat within a few minutes walking distance. Both Stanley Park and most of downtown are about a 10 minute walk. This city caters to health conscious people with many walking/biking trails entwined with the streets. Pets are welcome virtually everywhere and the pace is a bit more laid back then other large cities the size of Vancouver.

When booking my vacation, I was assured that all my hotels were of excellent quality. In the case of the Bayshore, I'd beg to differ somewhat. Check-in/check-out: no problems here, though you might have to queue. The staff were friendly and pleasant, but didn't offer me any help with my luggage. Facilities: there's a pool (which I didn't try) and a number of shops (including a Starbucks, which is handy if you don't want to eat breakfast in the restaurant). Eating: I only ate once, sampling breakfast. There was a decent range of food available, though it was fairly expensive. Service was reasonable, nothing more. Room-wise: I stayed initially on the third floor, and then on the ninth floor. Both rooms were of a good size and had a decent-sized bathroom. For some reason, though, the shower did not have a door that closed, so if I had a shower, the bathroom would rapidly fill with steam. In addition, the storage where you hang your clothes is right next to the shower, in the same room, so you might end up steam-cleaning your clothes if you take a long shower. Beds were not all that great. I had a huge number of pillows to choose from, most of which were too soft and one of which was too hard. So, no pillows for me. Noise-wise, the third floor room was appalling. This was thanks to the many seabirds in the area, which made a huge amount of noise at all hours of the night. This meant that I got very little sleep at all during my first visit (not aided by being jet lagged). The ninth floor room was somewhat better, perhaps due to its height and being on a different side of the hotel. Location-wise, the hotel is perfect for Stanley Park, which is five minutes or so walk by foot. It's not much good for anything else, so you'll need to catch a bus or walk to down-town. There is a convenient taxi stand right outside the hotel. If I had the opportunity, I would not stay at the Bayshore again, mainly due to the location and the noise from outside.", "Date": "September 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "newyorklover123", "ReviewID": "UR19345333", "Content": "Close to Stanley Park!

Heating/cooling was controlled by a convenient thermostat with both C/F scales. The room was decorated in an average fashion. I enjoyed the comfy beds with down comforter and the large flat screen television. I was definitely not a fan of the remodeled bathrooms that included a glass wall that only enclosed half the shower. It made for a chilly shower and concerns of making a wet mess on the shower floor. I was also annoyed with the ways they try to nickel and dime you. There were no vending machines. Bottles of water were $6 in the room and $2.50 in the gift shop. They charged for the business center, which is free in many hotels. 30 cents a minute for internet, plus an extra charge for printing. It was an additional $20 a day for internet in your room. Overall, I would stay there again.

Well, I should just call Priceline if I had any questions, then. IF that's what I need to do, fine, but I was stung by his deliberate rudeness, and convinced that our stay at the Westin was going to be rather unpleasant if the staff were on a par with him. We arrived at the Westin a few days before our cruise, and checked in. The bell staff and desk staff were very friendly and efficient. I could not believe that we were given gorgeous rooms overlooking the bay, considering that we booked them for a pittance and we had Priceline cooties and all... Our rooms were clean, large, fresh smelling, with comfortable beds and great linens. We never heard any noise from other guests. See some of the other reviews for comments regarding what you will see out the window if you are lucky enough to get a bayside room. Staff continued to be friendly and helpful throughout the trip. We did not dine at the hotel, other than one poolside soda. There are many fine restaurants within a five minute walk of the Westin, and some gas-station type convenience stores. We did use the valet parking which was very expensive, but sometimes it is worth the convenience. When we went to check out, there were a couple of errors on the bill. There were extra drinks charged to the poolside tab. And both our room and our daughter's room were each charged for the valet parking, even though she did not have a car. Desk staff quickly removed the extra charges. I would have rated this place a five if the first man I spoke with on the phone wasn't so rude. We looked at a lot of hotels as we toured Vancouver.

I always chose a Harbor View room, which I find is a good size. The bathroom is a wee bit on the small side but it does work. The dual head showers are great. The view from your window is truly a 10 - 20 million dollar view as the condo's that surround the hotel, cost that much. Watching the sea planes take off all day long, is very relaxing. There is a nice size indoor and outdoor pool plus indoor hot tub that is hot plus a steam room and sauna's in the ladies and men's locker rooms. The exercise area is top notch, no token one piece of each type. You can certainly maintain your workouts here. I have also eaten at their Sunday brunch which currently is about $45 per person. The amount and variety should please almost anyone. From custom made Omelets to Smoked Salmon & Oysters on the half shell, you can certainly eat your moneys worth. The location in my opinion is great. You are only 5 - 10 minutes from the business district or the oodles and oodles of choices for shopping or eating. At the corner of Denman and Davies (about a 10 minute walk) on the 2nd floor is a Chinese Restaurant called Won More. If you like Hot & Sour soup, this is a great place to go. The beef and black pepper dish is also great. There is a Greek restaurant that would be a good 20 minute walk or 7 minute cab called Stepho's on Davies that serves good Greek food at reasonable prices and their Tziki sauce is loaded with garlic. The greatest strength that the Bayshore Westin has is that it is very quiet day or night. No blaring sirens or loud party goers. A good night's sleep is easy to find here.

Right by the harbor and Stanley Park, it is driving distance to most shopping areas in downtown...but that to me is a positive. I'd rather stay in a quiet hotel that is not on the hustle and bustle of a major street. Step outside the hotel and you have the clean air on tap. Watch seaplanes land and take off. Sit back and admire the towering forest tops with the blue and white mountains in the background. Second is the service. I've always been very delighted with the service at the Bayshore. Doesn't hurt if you're a Starwood Preferred Guest. Third are the rooms. Older, but very well maintained. Cons? It's a drive to most Vancouver shopping districts. The only parking options are valet $26 or self-park $23. You can see what they're doing here. Wireless internet access, now standard, is $14.99. In this day and age, why can't hotel chains just suck it up and offer this for free instead of nickel and diming customers?

If one were to compare the locations of Vancouver's downtown hotels, the Westin Bayshore, in my opinion, has the best; its waterfront location is peaceful and serene. The hotel is within easy walking distance to all of the downtown attractions/shopping, as well as Stanley Park. Here are the highlights of my stay: Pro's: - Gorgeous waterfront locale. - Beautiful Lobby with acres of marble, blonde-wood accents and a large, cozy fireplace. - Friendly, courteous staff. - Views from the rooms are great! North/North-West facing rooms of the Bayshore Tower have the best views (Mountains/Ocean etc.). - As always, one cannot go wrong with Westin's Heavenly Beds - Exercise Room is very nice, and there are two pools on site (Indoor and Outdoor). - The Starbucks in the lobby-area is nice and convenient. - Currents Restaurant: excellent hotel restaurant that serves breakfast and Sunday brunch. It can be a little pricey, but the food is definitely worth it. The brunch buffet is amazing. Con's: - The hotel is large and has an expansive layout (can be confusing to navigate the hallways at first). - The elevators for the main-building were not all operating, so sometimes we had to wait a bit for the elevator. - The hotel's biggest fault is its age: though it was renovated in the late 90's, the hallways and rooms are showing some wear-and-tear. The main-level public spaces are perfect, but the guestrooms definitely need some upgrading (one of the hotel employees mentioned that this is rumoured to happen soon). - Seawall Restaurant: this is where the hotel serves Lunch/Dinner. Eating lunch here might be worthwhile, but dinner is overpriced for what you get (the waterfront views are appreciated, though). - Because the hotel has a large convention centre, it can get quite busy (especially evenings on weekends). Overview: Despite the hotel's shortcomings, with regards to outdated infrastructure/guest rooms, it excels in guest service, location, and atmosphere.

I should have listen to the other reviewers To whom it may concern, After reading many bad reviews on tripadvisor.com about your hotel, we decided to keep our reservations anyway as we already paid for the rooms and we've always had a great experience with Westin around the world. We did get an upgrade to a harbour view which was great although I'd like to point something out that actually came up on tripadvisor.com. My mother stayed in room 516 (my husband and I in 515) and her wallpaper was not only falling apart but there was some mold underneath. I called guest services and after 45 minutes, a tech came and put a blue pin to hold the wallpaper and told us that , that way, we wouldn't have to look at the mold anymore... i don't know about you but for the price of the room, mold is never out of sight, out of mind in my book. I explained my concerns to a guest service agent who gave 2 people of my party of 4 a complimentary breakfast for the next morning but although appreciated i feel that $70 was not fair compared to the moldy room situation. Last but not least if Morton at the concierge was extremely helpful and professional, Colette on the other hand was borderline racist and very rude. I asked her about Richmond and she said \"I wouldn't know as I would not shop in that area\". As an SPG member, my husband and i felt that the experience was awful. Next time if we are in the area we will probably stay at the Soleil or the four season hotel. I hope STARWOOD will review whether or not the bay shore should be on their hotel list.

We were able to park for free on the street all six nights we stayed at this hotel, which was great. Of course, you would have to move your car by 9AM (11AM in case of one of the side streets).

The bathroom was small and without any ventilation, which made the room rather musty.

The room itself was better and the beds were reasonable. There were two elevators for the nine-story part of the building (not the tower part). One of these was broken during three of the six days we stayed at this hotel. Often you would see long lines in front of the only remaining elevator. There were no stairs to use; we were not allowed to use the emergency staircase. It shouldn't take a hotel more than three days to get an elevator fixed. I have mixed reviews for the hotel staff. I felt they could have done a better job (show more interest and attention, provide fuller answers to questions) of answering a few questions we had about points of interest and local events.

It's nothing special in terms of a room - even a bit on the small size. But great view of the harbour. We had a number of service problems during our stay which were echoed by MANY other guests. 1. One of the main elevators broke down and remained unfixed for the entire 3 days we were there. People were waiting for a long time for the elevator. 2. Skip the SeaWall restauant in the hotel. I called the concierge to make reservations for the restaurant for Friday night and was told that the restaurant as a policy did not accept reservations and that we just should show up. Well, we showed up and were told by the hostess that all their reservations were filled long ago. We asked how long the wait would be, first they said 30 minutes and then finally they said probably 1 hour. I asked for their help to find us another restaurant - the two hosts - one male and one female - unhappily called two other restaurants for us. And then the female host suggested \"why don't you try the White Spot?\" (White Spot is the equivalent of Denny's in Canada.) It was insulting suggestion when I told her we were Westin guests, it was Friday night and she saw that we were obviously all dressed up and planned to be at a nice restaurant. 3. Concierge more problems - There is only one concierge and the hotel was full and had a conference. The concierge's phone was never answered the entire 3 days I was there - it always went directly to the voicemail. You had to go downstairs and stand in line - always at least 2 people in line in front of you - and wait. 4. Bugs in the swimming pool. LOTS of dead bugs. I counted over 20 insects floating right next to the shallow steps area where the kids were all playing. I called the spa maintenance to let them know - they said they'd send someone, but I did not see anyone cone to clean up the bugs. 5. I had two reservations for my stay - and told them when I checked in. On my third day - I was locked out of the hotel entrance (side entrance) coming back at night because my key doesn't work. I finally was able to get in - and the receptionist told me - \"oh, we deactivated your keys because your room is under two separate reservations.\" It would have been nice for them to tell me when I first checked in and told them so - instead of this nasty surprise of being locked out of the hotel.

As such, I expected an enjoyable stay from the Westin Bayshore, as I know it's a resort property as well as a recipient of a Conde Nast award. However, my extended stay with them had significant problems from the start: 1) The room itself: The room was in major need of renovation, as wear and tear of the carpets and the walls were evident. Stains highlighted the condition of the carpet, and it was a bit surprising/disorienting to see a stain on both the bed's white sheets as well as the comforter. My room, at approx 300 sq ft, was the smallest Westin room I've ever stayed in. Honestly, the Westin Berlin's gigantic bathroom was just 1/4 smaller than the bedroom in the Westin Bayshore. 2) Bedbugs! This was a big point of disappointment for me. During and after my trip, I was/am extremely itchy and have developed red bumps and welts on the skin. My traveling companions, also have the same symptoms. I understand that bedbugs aren't uncommon in hotels - however, I do expect more from a Westin than a middle-range hotel. Being that the bed's sheets and comforter had stains on it though, perhaps it is not that surprising... 2) The bathroom: Again, the size of this bathroom was incredibly small. Two people could not be in the bathroom at the same time, as there was just not enough space. Most disappointing in the bathroom, however, was the shower. The famed Westin dual showerheads was not a high point at this particular Westin -- one of the showerheads did not work. Additionally, water pressure for the other showerhead was low. The most uncomfortable aspect of the showers, though, was how the water temperature kept on alternating between warm and cool. 3) The \"view\" - this is a minor one for me. My room's \"view\" was of the hotel's own conference center. Not very pleasing. Additionally, the Westin was hosting a high school prom during our stay and we had the pleasure of hearing the loud music's bass due to our proximity to this conference center/ballroom. 4) Service/Checking in - As a Starwood Gold member, I've always been offered a complimentary upgrade upon checkin at Starwood properties (Westin, Sheraton, Le Meridien, etc.). However, upon check-in, the staff informed me that the 300-sq ft room I was assigned to, with a \"view\" of the hotel's own conference center, would not be eligible for an upgrade. By itself, not being upgraded is not a problem - however, coupled with the other problems presented at this Westin, it further dampered my experience. 5) The Good Points: Although I do not plan to stay at this property again, based on my poor experience here, I did thoroughly enjoy the hotel's spectacular, convenient location. Its setting amongst the harbor is gorgeous, and it is walking distance to Robson Street. Additionally, I liked using their gym. They had many machines (ellipticals, treadmills, bikes, stairmasters, weight machines) in addition to exercise balls and free weights.

(Denman St.) Mondo's gelati - best we ever had, so many flavors, I had 14 in 7 days! (Denman St.) Cupcakes - you should try it once. (Denman St.) Banana Leaf - amazing Laos food, only a few tables get there early. (Denman St.) Pho Number 1 - very inexpensive subs and ok soup (Denman St.) Falafel King - amazing beef swhwarma, must try it!!! (Denman St.) Nates Pizza - great cheap snack to go. (Denman St.) New York Grill - lots of basic food for cheap. (Denman St.) Modern Burger- great burgers (if you are into fresh/homemade type burgers), fries, and milk shakes! (Kitsalano area) Restaurants: Places we did not like! Samay's Hot wings - chicken fat and skin in the chicken swhwarma DISGUSTING! (Robson St.) Zakasushi - just ok, more hype then it's worth! (Denman St.) Other: Time Square Inn is definitely worth looking into if you would like more of an apartment style vacation. We took a tour of it and will be staying there next time we are in Vancouver. It's much cheaper ($189 per night) then the hotels, and has much more space (living area and kitchenette and in room laundry) 650 square feet. It does not have a ocean view but is on the corner of Robson and Denman which is also an excellent location. Tips: - Laundry mat on Denman if needed - HUGE outdoor family swimming pool along seawall down from English Bay (end on Denman) - Go to the aquarium in Stanley park - You can rent bikes on the corner of West Georgia and Denman - All restaurants are very very small in downtown. If you have a stroller like us for the baby, go early! - Most hotels have free shuttles to the mall down Robson.

The indoor pool (ok), steam room (awesome) and sauna (awesome) all were maintained and clean.

I had signed up for Starwood before embarking on our journey so maybe that had something to do with it. I do love the non-smoking feature of this hotel. We loved that we could open the sliders (no balcony though) It was nice having fresh air. However, someone was smoking marijuana which wafted into our room, and the man next door to us, he complained as well. There was a very loud wedding going on late into the night with LOUD music and we called the front desk as did several other people, and management took care of it immediately! It was simply a matter of turning down the bass and closing an outer door that led into the courtyard which our room faced. We loved the amenities of this hotel. The bathroom, although petite, is not that small compared to a cruise ship bathroom. So to us it seemed like a spacious bathroom after dealing with phone booth-sized shower stalls on the ship. We ate at the restaurant downstairs which has the outdoor patio area. Can't remember the name -- but we had two great dinners. Service was a bit slow, I must say. But it afforded us a chance to just soak in the great views. We lucked out with 80 degree weather the entire trip. This property is approx. a one-mile trip from Canada Place cruise terminal, and we walked with our luggage all the way from there to this hotel. We stayed here not even one week ago. We will go back to this property.", "Date": "July 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire UK", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "Sophie2604", "ReviewID": "UR5380824", "Content": "This is my 4th stay at the Bayshore in 2 years and it has got better.

Rooms are lovely. My husband is disabled and it did have a great accessible room. But two concerns made me feel that this hotel has some problems to work out. First, they encourage you to use Quick Checkout. I believe this is easier for their staff as there were no line-ups at the front desk at check-out time. They leave a form and paper invoice under the door of your room on the day you are leaving. You sign the form to authorize the charges although there is no final amount shown. Then you receive an e-mailed Folio of your account. The Folio account was very confusing. The charges on it appear to be more than they should be because the show the \"Credit Card Hold amount\" - except nothing indicates it is a Credit Card Hold amount. In my case it just showed an extra $80.00 charge to my Visa. I had to contact the hotel for an explanation. Staying at a Westin you can collect Starpoints. My e-mailed account says I'm entitled to 320. My paper invoice says only 23. The hotel does not know why there are two different amounts. I really think that what you receive in an email confirmation from any hotel, especially one with the Westin name, it should be clear and correct and you should not have to waste your time figuring it out and contacting the hotel. My other concern was that because my husband is disabled and I have to push him in a wheelchair to our room I requested assistance with our bags. As there was no one available, I was advised they would be immediately brought up to our room. After waiting 25 minutes and no bags brought up, I went to the lobby and there they were sitting in the middle of the lobby - anyone could have taken them.", "Date": "April 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland", "Title": "\u201cThere are better deals out there...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5007024", "Content": "Pros: Location is good Pool and hot tub are great concierge is helpful non-smoking hotel Cons: $40/night upgrade for the tower rooms onslaught of ads for buying their \"heavenly\" stuff, which wasn't so heavenly $15/24 hours for internet (isn't the modern world about free wi-fi???) no mention about the free shuttle (\"take a taxi\" which will cost you a ton) small, i mean TINY, bathroom shower head is too short for someone that's taller than 5'8\", bathroom is dark mold/holes in the ceiling $23/day for SELF parking I went through priceline and got a great deal, but then the $40 upgrade (as the other reviews have said) was a bit of a scam.

The hotel staff were on the whole very friendly and eager to please, especially in the seawall restaurant, where the food was good value. I recommend the oversized pint of Okanagen lager to wash down their generous portions of local fish - the fish and chips is substantial. The only drawback if you want a really quiet restaurant is the number of young children in there before 8.00 - not overly annoying, but you are very conscious of them. Also reserve a seawall table, the sight of so many jogging/cycling/skating past while you tuck in is bound to amuse ...on both sides of the glass!! Excellent fitness centre in the hotel though - if you do want to keep yourself under control ! Room on 19th floor of tower was brilliant with superb views of the harbour by day and night - try to get an upgrade if you are initially given a room in the main block, it is worth it! If you hire a car from the Hertz outlet in the hotel, ask if you can leave your car in one of their reserved spaces if they are free. The charge in the main car park is $26 per night, in the rear car park it is $18 per night - if space is available and you have a hertz car that is obviously quite a saving. I recommend visiting the Granville street market area, many of the craft outlets there are very individual and the work on sale is all local. The road to Whistler is well worth the journey, although you may get held up by the improvements currently taking place in readiness for the olympics, Whistler itself is rather brash and loud - you'll either like it or loathe it , the new environmental centre at Squamish is well worth a look.

We got a $60US a night rate through Priceline. An unbelievable price considering on the website it was about a hundred dollars more. My boyfriend checked pretty quick and we were off to our room on the 7th floor. He didn't ask for anything specific but we got a corner room and it faced the water. We had a tiny balcony but it was nice. The room was pretty spacious and appointed really nicely. The bed was truly heavenly. One thing that really was great was the shower. I stayed in a Westin the week before in San Diego but the water pressure wasn't as strong. This shower head was amazing. Westins have a double shower head. I really didn't want to get out of there! The only thing is I don't really care for their Heavenly bath products. I wish they were like the W and offer Aveda or some brand name product. One great thing is that now Westin is a completely smoke free hotel. No more smoking in any of the areas or rooms. Woo hoo (sorry smokers)! I forgot the name of our doorman but he was amazing. Really helpful and gave us his name and asked us to ask for him if we had any requests or needed anything. Service was pretty good so far. Parking over the course of the 5 days wasn't really a problem. I could always find free street parking. During dinner hours once I had a tough time but just parked by a meter because we were going to step out again anyway. It's pretty nice if you want to save some money. Valeting the car costs about $18/day and if you self-park it's $12 and you have to walk to a garage which is beside the street parking anyway. You might as well street park for free. The signs say 2 hour free parking from 9am-6pm Monday to Saturday. They don't really check up and you just have to move your car by about 11am. I was pretty happy about free parking. The hotel has an indoor and outdoor heated pool. Inside there's a hot tub and a eucalyptus steam room as well. There are seperate men's and women's saunas in the washrooms as well. There's a fitness area that is \"Powered by Reebok\" that looks really good. I didn't use it but I would have if I felt more motivated. Haha...I just watched people sweat from the swimming pool. We didn't really eat at the hotel. There's so many great places to eat in Vancouver so we just dined out most of the time because we had our car. We did grab some muffins and juice at a cafe about half a block from the hotel. There's also a corner store where you can buy juice and water, rather than dive into the mini-bar. There's a great restaurant called Lift close by but we didn't go. Great reviews though and just behind the hotel facing the water. Denman is close by as well and we ate there as well as Robson. Overall the place was amazing. I'd definitely go back. I always enjoy Starwood properties. The only problem that I had was on Monday night, the eve of my birthday, a fire alarm started going off when we got home from dinner. This was about 11pm. The alarm was due to a flood. They couldn't shut off the alarm for over an hour. My boyfriend passed out but I couldn't. I even called down and asked what the problem was and told them it was my birthday. I was quite disappointed when I woke up and all we got was an apology letter. I was hoping at least for breakfast buffet or something!

We wanted nothing more than a place to sleep, but it was the musty smell of the room that actually drove us out.

It was a little slice of heaven! ;) The service was great. We started off in a small room that smelled of smoke actually, but called down to the front desk and got moved for $30 more to a room that was enormous with a balcony and gorgeous view of the marina. Spacious room, lusciously decadent beds, nice bathroom, lovely service, good location (close to Robson and Denman with lots of good shopping and great sushi).

I had a corner room in the Tower. It seems like a bit of a walk to get to the Tower from the lobby but the view was worth it. Gorgeous view of the mountains and the marina. The sea planes land in the harbor near by which is a very neat thing to watch in the mornings. The room was a nice size and the beds were great. Bathrobes were provided which is always a nice touch. Spent a lot of time in the Lobby Bar / Restaurant and the service there was always very good and the staff were very friendly. I also found the front desk, concierge, and valet staff to be very friendly and helpful. They went above and beyond on a couple of occassions. The only thing that keeps me from rating this hotel as Excellent is the difficulties that I had with the hotel provided wireless internet access. I was unable to use their wireless-equipment to access the internet from my room. Their tech support tried to get it to work, couldn't, said they would come back the next day, but never returned. So, I was stuck going down to the lobby to check my company email. I was too lazy to pursue this with the management so I don't know what they would have done to resolve it. But, all in all, a lovely hotel and I would definitely stay again and recommend to family and friends.", "Date": "May 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOverated Hotel, Not a Resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3354628", "Content": "Due to the great reviews, I decided to stay at this hotel. Exceptional location on the water but too far away from the rest of downtown Vancouver. Very poor service at reception and restaurants. Bedrooms were old and tired. Bathroom was appalling and in need of renovation. Not sure why this property is called a resort? No spa, no tennis courts, organized activities or outdoor recreation. They have a marina and are next door to Stanley Park but that's about it. Very dissapointing considering the price.
