The facilities are brilliant, the rooms are spacious and well finished an furnished \u00c2\u00a0and the shower makes it difficult to not luxuriate for just a bit longer. Further highly commended is the spa, gym and mini-Hamam in the lower levels of the property. Where the Titanic does sink, pardon the pun, is in its reception. I found the reception staff to be particularly unfriendly and less than helpful, there was a particular gentleman at reception who was incredibly impatient, so much so that we tended to avoid him. I imagined that it could be a language issue but I also take it that we were not the only English guests to stay at the Titanic. This was certainly the one issue that tainted the experience. I will be heading to Istanbul again later this month, the Titanic is still on my list of hotels to look at, I'm hoping that my experience was a fluke, but as a contingency I will not to be booking my full stay there.

The hotel is new and modern, we picked it among dozens in the area for that reason, allthough it wasn't the closest to Taxim square and Istiklal and was pricey. Our rooms were ok, (not so spacious for 2 people - the one for single use had only a small window higher than usual). Lighting was very poor, sometimes sewage smell came from the toilet and some towels were old and had stains, closet had 4 hangers only and a small safe. Some nights we could hear club music coming probably from the street, but all this did not bother us so much. Breakfast had a variety of things, but in some days bread products were not fresh. The bar on the roof was awfull, depressing, no view, dark, with a big tv showing football... and no music. The gym and spa area were small, we used it only once since the \"hamam\" (full of fat semi-naked men looking at women...yuk!), sauna and shower were communal for men and women! Private massages were very expensive. Our stay in this hotel ended badly, when the last day, during our brief absence for breakfast hotel staff robbed us. They took our wallet (no money, but driving license) and mobile phone. We ended up spending our last holiday hours talking endlesly with receptionists and managers, watching cameras, explaining... All this time their attitude was unfriendly, almost hostile and cold. We never heard a sympathetic word, or a simple \"we are sorry\". They even charged us for a small bottle of water we used from the mini bar (after all this mess we forgot to buy from outside...)! We wanted to call the police for fingerprints (we have seen 2 people entering our room twice without cleaning it, as they did to all other rooms) and they agreed but they said that police only interrogates both sides. We then decided we had no time for this, it was our last day... After pressure, they agreed to refund us 1 night stay the next day in our credit card. We were a bit relieved, (our loss was worth more than this) but it was a compensation and could make us forget our turmoil. If only we had known... It proved they only wanted to get rid of us, since they never refunded a cent !!! This was the most ennoying part. It is supposed to be a 4 star hotel, professionalism, integrity, honesty and hospitality should be absolute standards. Instead they tricked and befooled us...

(1) Take the metro from Ataturk Havaliman airport (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a single line there). Interchange to the tram line at Zeytinburnu and take the tram towards Kabatas and get down at the end there. Once you get down from the tram, exit, and transfer to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTunel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 metro/tram that will take you to Taksim Square. Go towards the McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on one of the arteries of Taksim, and LaMartin Caddesi (street) will be opposite that. A two minute walk down the end of the street will get you to the hotel. Cost will be 6 TL/person (3 modes of transportation). (2) Easier way is to take the Havas Airport shuttle. It costs 10 TL/person and will pick you from the airport and drop you at Taksim (again in front of McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s). Total journey time till be 45 minutes by Havas. Staff: This is a 4-star rated hotel so the staff, including the bell boys, were thorough professionals. We did have a small problem one night when we wanted some cutlery to be sent up and it took an hour and a visit to the front desk to get it done. There was also another guest who was displeased about something \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe in the night they get short staffed, something you do not expect in a star-rated hotel. Room: Standard Double Room. The room was like any typical 4/5-star standard room. Adequately spacious with a closet, a sofa, etc. Televison system was advanced but there were few English channels (the movie \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTitanic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 played in a loop). The bathroom was modern and good. Room was both functional if you were not going to stay in much as well as one for relaxation, especially if you plan to make use of the spa. Other Facilities: The hotel has an excellent spa. The free facilities include a swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna, steam bath, and a Turkish bath. These are well maintained and not too many guests were around, so they can be used in leisure. View: None to speak of. Meals: Breakfast was not included in our tariff so we did not take any meals at the hotel. At EUR 10/person it was still expensive and since you are in the heart of the city, you can find cheaper alternatives everywhere. Things around: Since this is the modern part of Istanbul, I will not recommend staying here if you are looking to do more things around the Sultanmehmet area. Taksim square is the hub of all night activities and a long walk along the Istikal Caddesi off Taksim is highly recommended. There is also a multi-story mall on the street. Area has a feel of New York, with lots of boutique cafes, eateries, shopping places around. To take in some history, you need to walk downhill from Taksim towards Besiktas, until you hit the Bosphorous. You will find the Dolmabache Palace to your left. This tourist attraction should not be missed. Guided tours leave every 30 minutes and walk you around only some of the rooms and halls of the 300+ rooms in this palace. You can also get great views of the Asian side of Istanbul from here. Eat & Shop: Taksim square has a lot of standard fast food joints as well as eateries. You can always grab a doner (wrap) at one of the small eateries. Shopping will be expensive here as there are a few shops dedicated to local trinkets and arts; it is better to buy those from standalone shops near Sirkeci/Sultanmehmet (Grand and Egyptian Bazaars are also a rip off). Tips: 1. Do not need a taxi if you are going to hang around near the hotel and Taksim area; cab to Karakoy on the Galata bridge should not cost you more than 10 Liras. 2. To take tickets on the metro/tram, you would need Jeton tokens (1 token = 2 Liras = 1 trip on Metro/Train/Tunel). Machines are near the stops and take both paper and coins; 3.

I wound up with and in the Titanic City and was not disappointed at all. Thus, if you want to stay in this area, I would recommend the hotel very highly. The main reason for this, and for giving it 5 points, is that you really get ***** quality at **** price. The lobby and restaurant are just okay, but the rooms are really *****, in furniture, size, and amenities - such as bathrobes and slippers. Nice large writing desk, perfectly working free wifi, a view of Asia (7th floor). I especially enjoyed the spa area, which is nicely done and maintained and which features - unusually - a pool that is small but still large enough to swim laps, and a sauna, steam bath and a hamam. All were free, which is unusual, and perfect in ambiance and decoration to relax. The staff was friendly and professional. The hotel is at the end of Lamartin st., so not as close to Taksim as some others, but it's really less than 10 minutes to the metro, and the walk to Taksim is pleasant. There are cheap convenience stores just seconds from the hotel entrance, the neighborhood is safe, and taxis, Havas airport buses, the historical tram to T\u00c3\u00bcnel, the funicular to the main tram, etc., are less than 10 minutes away as well. If staying in Taksim, I would definitely stay here again. One thing: I would definitely not book the airport shuttle the hotel offers - I did it this time for convenience, but there wasn't any. It was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 59 which is double that of the regular yellow cabs even if they try to, well, correct the price a bit upwards; the pickup person was almost half an hour late (and nobody to reach and check); and the driver mistakenly crossed the Bosphorus because he thought I was staying in another Titanic hotel. Oh well, a nice if brief trip to Asia! :-) Back I took a normal taxi because it was raining; otherwise, as I said, the Havas airport bus, which is just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 5, is less than 10 minutes easy walking away from the hotel.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in a nice area\u201d", "Author": "Steinbrenner", "ReviewID": "UR116537402", "Content": "My wife and I had a wonderful time in Turkey and The Titanic City in Instabul was a wonderful way to start.

When I asked what places to visit, they explained to me the highlights of the city such as the Topkapi palace, Aya Sofia, the Basilica Cistern. They would call the places to make sure they are open and there was enough time for me to go. The staff also made me aware of the big taxi scams and to be careful. They told me if I ever had a problem with the taxi driver, for example, if I felt the fare was too high, I should not pay, ask the taxi to wait and call one of the hotel staff to clear things up. I wanted to visit a Turkish Hamam, but after reading so many negative reports about the big Hamams being tourist traps, I asked the Hotel staff for advise, on my last day. They recommended a nice classic Turkish Hamam in the Taksim neighborhood, about 15 minutes walk from the Hotel.

The rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds, muted furnishings and expensively tiled bathrooms. Our only gripe with the room was that the air conditioning had been turned off (and the wires disconnected), presumably because it was thought that at this time of year it would not be needed, but as the weather was warm we found the room very hot and had to sleep with the window open. Our room also opened onto an air shaft with other windows on the opposite side so there was virtually no daylight. However this didn't really matter to us as we had a hectic schedule and spent very little time in the room anyway. Breakfast was buffet style in a pleasant dining room and there was a chef there cooking eggs to order, which was nice.

In fact we are glad to share our good experience. We arrived at the Hotel frustrated after a long wait at the airport for our luggage that was missing. While sitting in the lobby upon arrival, an elegant lady with a bright smiling face approched us and introduced herself as the hotel guests relations officer. Ipek Gunes, immediately realized we have a problem as we looked tired and frustrated, she asked if she can do anything to help. Once she realized what happened, she immediately was on the phone contacting the airport, the airline company, travel agent etc. Our luggage that was supposed to arrive a couple of hours later in the next flight never arrived. Since then, every hour, she was on the phone trying to locate our lost luggage and updates us on her findings & reassuring us. Every morning she greets us with her lovely smile \"Don't worry\" enjoy yourself, have a good day. I am confident I will find your luggage very soon. We consulted her on places to visit, restaurants, shopping venues and directions. Her recommendations and guidance were fantastic as the restaurents she recommended were excellent, very good food at very reasonable prices. She highlighted on the city map she provided, simple, easy and clear directions on how to get there using public transport. As a matter of fact we spent the whole Holiday without luggage and we had to do with only the few items we had in our carrry on.
