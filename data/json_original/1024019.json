The hotel was easy to find and in a great location for kings cross/st pancras stations - no more than a five minute walk even lugging a big suitcase. I just wanted a cheap hotel room to sleep in as I was only in London for one night and was so busy out sightseeing that I was only in the hotel for a few hours to sleep, which to be honest I was pleased about. The room was freezing, probably due to the fact it was snowing, minus 5 outside and the single-glazed windows were blowing through a draft - but after turning the heating up as high as it would go it eventually warmed up. A thick blanket that was on top of the bed had a stain on it but the actual duvet cover, pillowcases and sheet seemed clean. The door to the room had an inch gap at the bottom so light shone in from the hallway and you could hear everyone walking around. My room looked nothing like those on the website and it wasn't the best nights sleep i've had! The staff were the best point of the hotel, very friendly and helpful and as I had to check out at 11am they looked after my suitcase for me while I attended a job interview. There was no hairdryer in the room but you can request one from reception along with the code for wifi. Breakfast was in the basement room and when I entered there were no staff around. Assorted cereals, milk and fruit were out on the tables but anything else is made to order by the staff in the kitchen - to be safe I ordered coffee and toast which was fine.

The hotel is old and has a few \"worn edges\" but what was broken while I was there (the shower head and some tiles in the bathroom) were also quickly fixed. Breakfast was also well made and tasted OK. Nothing to complain about there! The only problem for me was that the WiFi network didn't work properly in my room - I solved it by sitting on the stairs to the dining room (basement) with my Netbook.. oh, well I could live with it. I didn't travel all the way to London to sit all the time with my PC :) Location was perfect, a short walk to King's Cross Tube station - or a bit longer walk and I reached central London by foot.

We needed a downtown place to stay since our tour for Paris on the Eurostar was leaving early the next morning. And the price was within our budget. I had read the past reviews on this website and just want to tell everyone that we noticed the proprieter is making efforts to update her hotel. We were just pleasantly surprised. The reception area and rooms have been repainted and new decorations added, too. We stayed in #6. We were pleasantly surprised to find crisp white sheets on our king sized bed. Our room was clean and ready for us even before the 3pm entry time. The shared bathroom was clean and the water was warm and best of all - a tub with shower. And there is a stool-only room available a short flight upstairs. Our room had a sink which was really helpful. The best part of our stay was the great breakfast. We had our choice of eggs with ham and sausage, our choice of cereals, thick white toast with real butter and jam, juice and even a bowl of fruit. Everything was fresh, warm and served with efficiency. We were given the opportunity to evaluate our stay. I will have to be fair in this review to say that our bathroom needs to be completely updated. I then suggested the mattresses should be replaced. You can feel the springs beneath the mattress. But we were so tired that we slept easily. But of course, when these improvements are made, the prices of the rooms will go up, too. And the wife of the couple from New Zealand we met at breakfast the second morning reported her bath was cool. My advice is to take your bath the night before, if possible. The weather was unusually warm and sunny for London in June but we opened our window and had plenty of ventilation. There was no noise from the outside that bothered us in the least. The LIsa Court Hotel is located in an area of other hotels with little traffic. There is even a McDonalds and a Burger King around the corner if you need a quick meal. Walking to the international train station in the early morning took 5 minutes tops. We are a couple in our mid 60's from the USA.

I couldn't have breakfast because it started too late (8am) so I can't comment on that! The woman who worked there was a bit abrupt with me - I had booked the room the night before but she seemed really surprised to see me and a bit suspicious, spending ages checking and photocopying my ID and going through the booking, and she also seemed surprised when I asked to use the internet, as if I wasn't supposed to. Just didn't particularly feel very welcome. She was OK though when I checked out at the crack of dawn (the '24 hour reception' basically means she slept in reception rather than going to bed.) I didn't get a very good night's sleep - you have to ring the bell to go into the hotel because the door is locked, so people kept ringing the bell all through the night and traipsing up and down and there was also quite a bit of noise from the road outside.

There are better hotels in the adjacent streets but ask to see the rooms before you check-in. For the price i highly recommend going to a much better location. For example Bayswater has a hostel with private rooms in a better, cleaner, safer, cheerier location at a much cheaper price for the single rooms.
