Not a big deal, but it puts it below the other Hyatt Place locations. The coffee bar was open the evening we were there, but the cappuccino/espresso machine was broken. I have read that Hyatt Place is supposed to be/or has improved their breakfast. I hope this is the case. That would be great! All in all the hotel was fine. It was extraordinary. It wasn't terrible.

The location is great, particularly if you're interested in shopping; the phenomenal Galleria is just a few blocks away. There are some good restaurants nearby along with plenty of \"supplies\" type of places like Wal-Mart within a few miles. It's easy on/off the major highways but there is a phenomenal amount of road construction going on all over Dallas, day and night. The hotel staff was nice and friendly. The room was very large with a sitting area/large sofa, work desk and wet bar with a small fridge. I enjoyed the massive television and watching a movie one night in HD was definitely a treat. It was relatively clean but the carpet was worn. The bed was nice and comfortable. On the negative side, the room lacked any drawer space. There were three very small drawers in the dressing area by the sink. One of them contained a hair dryer and bible so it basically left two small drawers. There weren't any luggage stands so I basically lived out of my suitcase which sat on the floor in the living room. The most notable drawback was the closet. It was the smallest closet I have ever seen in a room. My shoes (8.5) barely fit in the closet and rested against the rail for the sliding door. I found the wet bar leaked after the first few hours resulting in a soaked cabinet under the sink. They had maintenance come fairly quickly to fix it. Overall, room space was fantastic and would make for a great long-term business stay. The lack of space to unpack your suitcase was a huge negative for me.

One thing to note is that because of the age of the building, the a/c unit is bolted to the wall, rather than built into an overhead vent. This means that if you happen to be getting into that side of the bed, you might have considerably less space than you thought, although the units themselves are modern. They are quite noisy however, so you're unlikely to get a good nights sleep with them on. There are no in rooms safes despite several pieces of literature advertising them, but otherwise the room is warm, cozy and very fresh. If you're into your television, the screens in the room are HUGE even by American standards. The bathroom however isn't. It's very cramped, although the shower does get plenty hot enough. The lifts are slow as treacle and don't inspire you with the most confidence however this is neither here nor there. The pool is outside as advertised, we didn't use it but it looked clean and clear enough. The breakfast is adequate although lacking in cooked meats and cheeses. The selection was cereal, yogurt, fruit, toast, english muffins and donuts... oh and if you were lucky there were some croissants. While plenty more food was available at cost, we would have liked to see a little more here, cold cooked meats etc. The coffee bar was welcome but had no prices displayed although worked out to be well priced in the end. The car park is easy enough to get to from either direction. if you are coming off the highway, you'll see the hotel on the left, theres a U-turn spot a few yards up which is easily negotiable. There's also a gas station down the road although it's expensive. Location couldn't be better.

The location is great, short distance to the Galleria and approximately 500 feet from the DelFrisco's steakhouse with its great steaks and seafood. It's also close to a gas station and a bank as well as the connection to DFW Airport making it that much better of a deal.

And restaurants around are typical Texas style. Hence you miss the multi cuisine luxury that is offered in other Hotels. There is no service at all. For any needs, such as housekeeping requirements, Laundry, one needs to go to the reception in person and collect what is required or give and collect laundry. The hotel claims to provide Buffet breakfast, but they have the same spread each day which consists of Baggels, Toast, Flakes, Milk / Coffee and fruits only. It can get pretty annoying for a long stay. The hotel claims to have a business center, but they have a computer with internet connection and printer near the reception. Nowhere close to t business center. The Hotel provides WiFi internet, however, there is no alternative if the Wireless is not working or if your laptop does not have a WiFi.

The hotel staff are friendly and happy to help with any query you may have. It was nice to have breakfast in the hotel before heading out for the day (as many hotels in America only offer \"Room Only). We found the breakfast to be more than adequate as you can choose from fruit, cereals, yoghurts, bagels and toast every morning or order something hot (at an extra charge) The hotel offers a free shuttle for anyone wanting to travel within a 5 mile radius and we used this to get to the DART station every day. We found this to be a very convenient and economical way to travel as the trains arrive and depart every 20 minutes and we always got a seat on the train. The journey to Downtown Dallas takes around 35 minutes. There are plenty of eating place close by the hotel and shopping can be found in the Galleria. We ate at Del Frisco's which is just outside the hotel and although a little more expensive, we had a lovely meal. Another place we enjoyed was the Cafe Grand Lux in the Galleria, we ate there a couple of nights. While in Downtown Dallas we visited the Sixth Floor Museam, Holocaust Museam and the Aquarium. We enjoyed all of these attractions however it might be best to try and avoid the Aquarium on a day when there is school trips - can be busy!!! Outwith the centre of Dallas, we visited the Zoo which was really enjoyable and the Stockyards at Fort Worth ( we purchased a Regional Pass for $7.50 and this got us right to the Stockyards as you can travel on the DART, TRE and the local buses with your ticket). We also visited Southfork and toured the house etc which was fun. If you are looking to get to Southfork and you don't have a car (like us), you can get the DART to Parker Rd Station and then phone for a taxi which will take you there. The only down side was that we were glad that we had done our homework (some of the tips which I have added above) before we went, as the city itself isn't set up for tourists and the places of interest aren't really advertised. All in all we had a really great time and we discovered that the people in Dallas where some of the friendliest and most helpful people we had met on our travels.

From the five star reception by the amazing staff to the spacious, modern rooms with huge flat screen TV's, this hotel is a real find. Apparently Hyatt started this concept about 4 years ago, and they've really come up with a winner. The rates are very reasonable and there's plenty of room for a family (or business traveler) to spread out. The lobby decor is modern and chic, and a continental breakfast is included in the rate. It was actually quite good, with fruit that is really fresh and a nice selection of cereals and breakfast beads, plus a menu is available for additional hot items. Lunch and dinner items are also on the menu, and while there isn't room service, you can order from menu 24 hours a day. The menu prices are incredibly reasonable and the food we had was excellent. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, having ordered pizza, grilled cheese (they use real cheddar!), and mac 'n cheese (this is not Kraft from a box!) for the kids. My older daughter and I also tried the spinich artichoke dip and it was excellent as well, although we wished the portion was a bit larger because it was so good. Every room at this hotel has a small refrigerator and the sofa, which makes out into a double bed, is large and comfortable, wrapping around the corner of the room. There's free wifi in the rooms, the towels are actually soft, and did I mention the 24 hour bar offering wine, beer, and Starbucks coffees, lattes, and cappuchinos? The pool was also nice. It is outdoor, but is heated and was already open in mid-March. The only drawback to the room was that the closet was tiny, but I would hang my clothes from the shower rod (which is curved, providing tons of room in the shower) to stay at this hotel. The other possible negative is that the vanity area, which has granite countertops like the wet bar area, is open to the sleeping area. My older daughter was trying to sleep in and the vanity light lit up the sleeping area, but again, that small minus is more than balanced by all the positives of this hotel. The coffee maker is also evidently designed for the business traveler as it is a one cup brewer, but there are 2 packets of coffee so that you can make 2 cups, and the coffee is Starbucks - best cup of coffee I've every brewed in a hotel room. They even have a shuttle over to the Galleria, or you can stroll over if the weather is nice - it's only 2 blocks. I will definitely stay here again, and will look for this chain in other cities.

The living room contained a sleeper sofa & chair, 3 tables & 2 table lamps. I slept on the sleeper and it was ok, about normal as far as these go. Extra pillows, & bedding was stored in the closet area. There was also a desk with a chair & lamp. Also in the desk area, was a small kitchenette. This contained a small sink, small microwave, mini fridge, and even dishes & silverware. This was perfect for the snacks that we had brought with us. The bathroom was adequate with a toilet & bath/shower combo. A sink with plentiful space was just outside the bathroom door. Although near the airport, we never heard airplanes from inside the room. All was very quiet. Breakfast: Included in the price was a complimentary breakfast buffet. This had about anything you could want, including make-your-own waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage, cold cereal, pastries, fruit, milk, 2 juices & coffee. Even my picky girls could find plenty to eat. Social Hour: This hotel also had complentary social hour on Sun.-Thurs. We looked at it, but didn't stay. It seemed to included several snacks, as well as wine & beer. Pool: One great amenity was the pool. It was a nice size, ranging in depth from 3.5 - 5 ft. It was never crowded, so the girls swam both in the evening & the morning. The only bad element was the morning swim. When we went down to swim, the maintenance man had been called away & had left the cleaner in the pool. After waiting about an hour & checking with the front desk a couple of times, we were given permission to remove it. After this the girls had a great time. All in all we thought this was a great hotel and would gladly stay here again. For the location, price & amenities it can't be beat.", "Date": "June 14, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hyatt Place Dallas-North", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d122699-Reviews-Hyatt_Place_Dallas_North-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$100 - $176*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "122699", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/36/18/3618a590a73f67f5eca679ff9f01ac727large.jpg"}}
