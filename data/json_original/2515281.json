I expected better and It is very expensive for what you get. The best thing going for the hotel us the location, It is perfect in many ways and easy to quickly get to most of the parts of Paris you want to get to. Howeverm the rooms of the hotel are lacking. The first one I was given was a strange L shaped room on the 5th floor. Very awkward feeling and just not pleasant. The room also was extremely hot with no a/c in the room. I called down to the reception to switch, they said no as they were completely sold out. That was not the case, as I was offered to pay for an upgrade. I told them they need to find another room and they called back with the upgrade. While it was bigger and a bit nicer, still just ok. The downside with all rooms you have to have the windows open, and the noise was very loud of the taxis, scooters etc going by. I felt like I couldn't win. The carpeting was a bit on the shabby side. The bathroom was dated and there was no light over the shower , so all felt very dim in the bathroom. It had an old tub with marks on the bottom. Again, expected better and by no means would I have been happy , had I paid. My suggestion is to shop around. The location is fab and can't be beat. However, just does not meet expectations.

We didn\u2019t check Tripadvisor first, because having pored over many many options for our February break to Paris, these three factors overcame our usual caution. It was a 10 minutes walk from Opera down to Rue de Cambon, along impressive shop windows when some rather welcoming windows revealed attractive furnishings within, which we thought was a plush office or maybe a designer showpiece. Very pleasantly surprised to see it was the bar/lounge of our hotel! Reception staff could not have been more pleasant or helpful. We were offered an upgrade on our room at \u20ac40 per night and when we asked what improvement that offered over the standard room we had booked, the receptionist told us the room and the bed would be bigger. I asked her how big the bed would be in the standard room: she looked it up and told us 180cm wide. That was plenty for us, so we declined the upgrade. Upstairs in our standard room we were not disappointed. The bed was plenty big enough, and very comfortable, though firm. The room was compact, but we had enough space, and the bathroom was well appointed, nicely decorated, with marble everywhere, and all the toiletries you need. At minus 3 C outside we were happy to find it very warm, though didn\u2019t manage to reduce the temperature enough during the night for our liking. Breakfast is what we had expected it to be, based on our Mallorca experience: that is a good buffet with a fine choice of hot and cold food, and decent coffee. It was expensive at \u20ac28 a head, and was not included in our room tariff. However, we had been told the price at reception when we checked in, and, importantly, told that if we applied for a Melia club card (loyalty card) breakfast would be half price. We took the application form up to our room and decided this was well worth it, so the card was issued to us on our first night. Too early to say if there will be any spam related downsides to this., but we ticked the no publicity box so here\u2019s hoping not. All the staff we encountered were cheerful and helpful. The location could not be better for what we wanted: near to the Tuileries Gardens and the Seine, all the places we wanted to visit were walkable.

I selected the Melia Vendome Boutique hotel since I generally like the Melia chain. Melia Vendome is a small scale hotel, well looked after, rooms are of a reasonable size for Paris with great beds. Big problem is that it's impossible to control the heating, same - very high (25 degrees celcium) - temperature everywhere in the hotel. Rooms are fully sound-proofed, but if you think you can get some fresh air by opening a window at night, it's impossible to sleep due to noise from outside! Location is great, many interesting sites are within walking distance. Staff was welcoming and very friendly. One not so nice experience which I do want to mention just to warn new guests: don't leave anything with the concierge desk. On the day of our departure we left our 2 small suitcases and a bag with some Paris shopping with the concierge's desk. When we were in the taxi we realised that one small bag had disappeared.

She stayed at Le Meurice (out of our price range) so we wanted something close that would allow 3 adults in the room. We ended up in the Grand Suite which was perfect. We arrived very early (about 8 am) and the room was not ready, so we went out for breakfast. Came back and the room was ready about 10:30 (although check-in, I believe, is 3 pm). Elevators are typically small; one person and their luggage or 2 persons without. Walking into the room on the 2nd floor, there is a spacious living room with TV, sofa, 2 chairs, desk and faux fireplace. Tasteful except for the odd sofa fabric. To the right is the bath (marble, combination tub and shower, dual sinks). Excellent water pressure. Tub too small for a bath. No bidet. A roll-away was set up against the windows (no view to speak of). Around the corner is the bedroom. King bed, great mattress and linens. Decent closet (no drawers), mini safe. Ipod dock/stereo was appreciated. It was very expensive, but it was NYE. Three nights averaged about 575 Euro per night, plus about 50 Euro for the extra person per night. We rolled in on the morning of New Year's Day at 7 am exactly as the buffet was opening. We had a split of Champagne and they did not seem to charge us for the meal (unless I paid cash and didn't charge it to the room; my memory of that morning is hazy). Beautiful meats, cheeses, fruits, juices, breads and made to order omelettes. As we returned home at about midnight the last night, we were all in our beds, talking, and we got a call from the front desk asking us to be quiet. Walls may be a little thin. Service was always pleasant. They always had an umbrella for us, happily kept our bags, and immediately responded to my email request for a copy of the bill after I was home. The bill is in a combination of French and Spanish, so I had trouble understanding it but figured it out. If I were choosing again, I would take a hotel in a less posh area and save the money.

In addition, the breakfast buffet (whcih is included in certain room rates) is AMAZING.

Upon arrival the front desk staff (And everyone except one guy vacuuming the stairs) spoke English well and got us checked in quickly. When you get to your room (at least in Paris and Rome) the air conditioning will not be on super cool,and it wasn't super pleasant to have the room warm after walking a few blocks from the metro (but if you take a taxi they aren't super air conditioned either [ compared to the USA]). You have to leave your room key in a special power outlet that allows the lights and power to be on when you are in it. We got super lucky and the person before us left theirs so we were able to leave and return to a cool room. Ask for a second or extra room key so that you can do this too. It shouldn't be a problem unless you are traveling alone. The room had a view of the street, but it wasn't bad, I actually still enjoyed looking out the window. This hotel is one block from the Tuilieries garden but does not have a view of it. We noticed the Westin a couple blocks away had tons of rooms facing the Tullieries if you really want a room with a view, that hotel would probably be better. We were very happy with the value of the hotel (except for breakfast) and paid $200/night thursday-saturday nights. The location is perfect for walking to all of Paris. We are late 20s and fine walking 4-5 miles a day, or taking the Metro to the further places. But overall I can't really imagine a hotel with a better location for the price. As I said above, the Westin is a couple blocks away with a better view, but probably costs a lot more. Our one major qualm with the hotel is the breakfast. The literature says something like \"come join us for breakfast\" and we took that to mean free. When we got there it was a buffet like most free hotel buffets, so that added to my belief that it was free. There was NO SERVICE whatsoever, they showed us to a table and then as we were up getting food, dropped off a check. It costs 56 euros, or about $75 USD! Yes, the breakfast was great, but we certainly would not have eaten it if we had known it was so expensive. Any food the hotel has to offer is this exorbitantly priced. A Heineken at the bar is ten euros, unless it is happy hour (which is tuesday night) then it is five euros. The minibar prices are even worse. I think a single drink of gordon's gin would have been 13 euros. There were also some food items that were 10. We even took the minibar menu with us to show our friends.

In all, a superb hotel in an excellent location- highly recommended.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, ny", "Title": "\u201cThis was the most dreadful hotel we have ever stayed in.

Fortunately we got to stay at an airconditioned hotel at the end. We lost an enormous amount of money. . . and time, which is priceless. The hotel advertises a business center. There is one computer in the public area. People wait, but to no avail, since there is always someone sitting there who has paid for at least an hour's usage. They advertise the usual amenities. To my mind, this does not mean thin, cheap towels and the absence of the usual toiletries (cream, shower cap). The hotel advertises (I've forgetten the word) television that is comprehensive. They had only the local French stations, not even CNN! (Perhaps there was one German station). It was terribly frustrating to ask when? will the a/c be repaired and to be told, \"tonight,\" \"tomorrow,\" etc. (I wonder if it is cold there in the winter!)

I found the room smallish and not decorated with the level of sophistication one would expect from a Paris boutique hotel. My room faced rue Mont-Thabor and every morning there were incredibly noisy deliveries to the hotel basement beneath my window. The bedcovers were made of cheap material that spread white lint all around. Service was unremarkable. There was one silly incident when, during a weekend, I informed the receptionist that a lightbulb had gone out in my room. She answered that a technician would fix it next monday earliest! I even offered to replace it myself. Finally an experienced maid appeared and took care of the matter. After this I decided to try more expensive hotels in Paris and I've had wonderful experiences at Four Seasons George V, La Tr\u00e9moille, Pershing Hall and Lancaster (where the service is really superb). My experience turned real sour last week when I was walking past the Melia Vendome and felt the need of a gents' room. As soon as I stepped into the lobby (dressed neatly in French designer brands) an enraged porter started shouting at me MONSIEUR! I enquired politely about the toilet and he continued yelling aggressively: \"It is not possible because you don't have a room here\". That's right, I didn't - and never again will. Are restaurant patrons banned from the toilet as well? I realize that the hotel may choose whatever policy they want but I fail to see the business sense in alienating clients from the hotel and, quite easily, from the entire Melia brand.

Let me just start by saying that on our second night we were awaken by a couple of mice that were trying to binge on some the flakes of a left over croissant (the bag was in a trash can). After making the front desk aware of this situation, they responded as lazily as if I had just requested an extra set of sheets. The rooms (we tried 2 different ones) are poorly ventilated and have no air conditioning. You need to keep the windows open almost the entire time or the room will quickly get warm. And since we were afraid of mice jumping in from an open window, we just were uncomfortable the whole time. The hotel had two very claustrophobic elevators that could fit two people very tightly (almost like touching each other). So you wouldn\u2019t want to take the elevator with a stranger. One of elevators seemed to be broken and did not go to our floor (the 5th floor) so we had to go to the 6th and walk down one floor. One evening, we headed down to relax in the small, dark, bar lounge of the hotel and also came away very disappointed. Service was very mediocre at best. Wine/aperitif selection very poor. They did not have a Dubonet or Lille for us to try\u2026 I mean you are in Paris at a hotel situated a few blocks away from La Madeleine, Louvre Museum, \u2026 The Spanish-speaking staff is somewhat uncompromising and very unattentive.

I spent more time than usual searching for an acceptable hotel in Paris. Most of the 4* hotels I considered offered good deals on their websites, which I would recommend checking out, in addition to the major travel gateway sites you normally do. That said, the hotels seem to release their inventory to consolidators at about one month out, so if you wait too long in anticipation of a last-minute price drop, you\u2019ll end up with zero availability (and higher prices, for some reason). My (standard) room was on the first floor (above the lobby), which I liked because it was accessible by stairway. The elevators are *really* small and not particularly fast, and if I stayed there again, I would definitely request a room I could walk to. The room was basic but not at all shabby and certainly above satisfactory\u2026but not luxurious. It was small, but not tiny, and very clean. Closet space was more than sufficient, but it needed to be since the room had no dresser. The bathroom was larger than one would expect, and well-appointed\u2026lots of marble. Three complaints. First, I could never get the heater to work. Second, completely separate from the bathroom, the toilet has its own incredibly cramped room that is not designed for anyone taller than six feet. Finally, an Internet connection will run you \u20ac23/day; I found this expensive compared to the other hotels I had researched. The hotel staff deserves special mention. Without exception, they were friendly, helpful, professional and polite. Their English was better than my French. In my opinion, the Melia Vendome is a 3\u00bd-star property (a notch closer to four than three, though), and I would happily stay there again. The hotel is ideally located in what I feel is the best tourist area in Paris, because it is both upscale and perfectly centered.

Every day, we were able to see the view of the major sights of Paris - the arc de Triumphe, Eiffel Tower, Obelisk and fountains as we went to and fro from the metro. At the end of a full day with tired feet, it was great to have the hotel so close. We were in room 516, streetside. We asked for a non-smoking room. Very traditional lovely decor and a nice sized bathroom. Being in the city, the traffic noises were heard when we opened the windows in this unseasonably warm Spring. However, it was virtually soundproof with the windows closed. Since we were there before the air conditionaing was activated, we kept the windows cracked. We will always remember hearing the beautiful choral music on Good Friday floating through the air from the nearby church. The staff was very cordial and helpful at all times, and our fears of not speaking French were set aside immediately. We grabbed our coffee and croissant breakfast around the corner rather than eat in the hotel, so can't comment on the restaurant.
