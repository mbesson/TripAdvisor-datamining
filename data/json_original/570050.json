I actually rang and made my booking and everything seemed fine. Apon arrival I noticed that the spot where I thought the pool would be was dug up and men were working with jack hammers. I immediately asked the man booking us in and he rudely informed us that they were renovating and that there was no pool. I asked him why the pool was still on their website, and also why I wasn't informed when I rang the day before, I was informed that I should have asked about the pool and received a rude shrug. It was too late to move elsewhere. The room was worst than I thought for a hotel at this price. It was reasonably clean. The bathroom was horrible with tiles missing, a strange smell and the shower grubby. On the second night we returned to the room late in the evening to find that the room had been serviced but no towels had been left out. I rang reception and was rudely told to come down and they would be given. I did that and was questioned about whether the do not disturb sign had been left out and therefore the room had not been serviced. When I explained that the room had been serviced and that the sign had not been left out, I was again rudely told that he would check with house cleaning in the morning and that I would be charged if it was not correct.
