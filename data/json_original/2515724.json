I booked this room because of the low price, free parking, in room amenities like free high speed internet, microwave & refrigerator, laundry facility, and the fact that it is stated on their website ([-]) that the rooms are \"newly renovated\". Well, I don't know about the other rooms but ours didn't seem newly renovated (see the pictures) BUT, it was clean (except the carpet...it needed to be deep cleaned or changed) and we only needed a place to sleep as we would be out all day at Sea World & San Diego Zoo. I didn't mind that it didn't look at all renovated but I just feel like I was tricked to thinking so. I hate walking around in the hotel room with my slippers on so I walked barefoot and then washed it before I jump in bed or before I put on my shoes. So, besides the carpet being a little dirty, everything else was fine. The biggest pro for us was the easy & short access to the freeway/highway, very short drive to Sea World (5-7min.), drive to San Diego Zoo was about 10-15min. (of course on depending on traffic), and close to grocery stores & restaurants (located on Garnet St., Balboa & Grand Ave.). Because we were there at a not so peak time, there were very few guests so it was pretty quiet (which we love), not crowded at the continental breakfast (which was pretty decent & satisfied our morning to last till lunch), & LOTS of parking. I did a lot of research before booking this hotel and a few other hotels I had in mind were reviewed by other travelers saying that the parking was too tight & narrow and we were renting a mini-van so I didn't want to take a chance and that was the other reason I booked Inn at Mission Bay. The con about this hotel (besides the room & carpet), was the noise from people next door closing their doors or people walking on balcony hallway (if you're on the 2nd or 3rd floors). The flooring was wood so you could hear the footsteps. The other thing was the room door has a small gap at the bottom so at night there would be light shining thru and the gap is probably the reason for the noise. I know I mention below that I would not recommend this hotel to a friend but that's only because I know how my friends are but, if they are on a budget and don't mind the small room, outside noise, and somewhat dirty carpet, this place is just fine. Why get a fancy, shmancy room and end up paying up the whazoo for something you're only using to shower & sleep?!?

Also, each room included a microwave, small coffee pot with coffee provided, small fridge that worked well, and plenty of towels.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amado, AZ", "Title": "\u201cGood Buy for the Money in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "luckymonster", "ReviewID": "UR6893400", "Content": "After reading other reviews in TripAdvisor, we were not sure what to expect, but for less than $60 a night including tax, we were willing to take a chance.

We checked in and were given precisely what we asked for, a room at the back end of the motel on the top floor. There was an elevator (something not mentioned in the AAA Book) which was a bonus for a third floor room. The room was EXACTLY as pictured in the website and in their ads. It was a bit small but extremely clean and the amenities were all there, fridge, micro, coffeemaker, hairdryer, etc. The bathroom was bigger than normal and very clean. Mattress was new and very comfortable. The motel was not too busy and it was a comfortable place to stay, especially for travelers who wish to visit Sea World, as The Inn is less than 3 miles from Sea World.

Since this was a last minute decision to visit family and friends in San Diego, I decided to just try it because it was the best price out there. The other reason I decided to give this hotel a chance was because the last review left here was from several months ago and I was optimistic things had changed for the better. I can say we were pleasantly surprised :) I booked my stay at this hotel through their official website and it was very easy to do. The website said the hotel was newly renovated and I can tell you that the website photos of the room decor is accurate. There isn't a seperate closet space but there is an area to hang your clothes off to the corner if you choose not to use the drawers. We had 2 queen beds and that suited us fine. We took a peek at the mattresses and you could tell they were worn but there was a mattress pad topper to try and revive the \"cushiness\". It wasn't the most comfortable bed I ever slept in, but I didn't toss & turn like I have at some other hotels either. We checked in that day at 3pm and I was helped by a young woman who was friendly and we just unloaded our stuff and headed out again. We came back later that evening and found that parking spaces had filled up quickly. We found a spot right near our room but I assume people that checked in very late might of had issues with that. The room seemed stuffy when we got back but once the AC kicked in, we were quite comfortable. When making my online reservation, I requested a ground floor room because my brother has knee problems and has trouble navigating stairs and that is exactly what we were given. I didn't see anything on their website mentioning an elevator but we later found there was one. We tested it out just for this review and it worked fine. The rooms are small but they are clean. The bathroom was simple and clean and the shower had great water pressure. The only bad notes I can make about this hotel is that there was an old stain on the carpet in front of the fridge. It looked as if someone had spilled their drink. The other negative note is the parking situation that I already mentioned. I know they had a pool but we didn't have time for that. The next morning we checked out early because we were heading to the Kobey's Swap meet before we headed back home. We grabbed some of the free breakfast before we checked out. The breakfast room is on the 2nd floor and it's a very small area with just a few tables. The beverage items I remember are coffee, milk, orange and apple juice. I believe I saw tea packets as well. The food items were small muffins, danishes, a couple of cereal choices and apples. (I don't recall if there was other fruit as well and I know there was a toaster but I can't remember what types of bread were offerd.) After we grabbed a handful of stuff, my family headed to the car while I went to check-out. This time it was a different young woman at the front desk and I found her to be friendly as well. Checking out was quick and easy. The hotel is located on a fairly busy street but I never had any problems getting around. It has easy access to the freeway so as soon as you are out the parking lot, you're on your way to your next destination. Even though it is close to the freeway, we didn't have any problems with the noise. I only heard the person above our room a couple of times and it was only loud footsteps, not voices. So... why did I rate this hotel just 3 stars? Well... because 4 stars is ABOVE average and you shouldn't expect that from this hotel. I'd say it's an average hotel where you get what you pay for. This place suited our needs just fine and if I had to make another last minute trip to San Diego again, I wouldn't have any problems staying here again. I saw lots of families stay at this hotel and I assume they also found it was the best place to stay if on a budget :)", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ca", "Title": "\u201cHorrible\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5434847", "Content": "Made reservations for two nights when they had us down for only one.

Firstly, it had everything we wanted - microwave, fridge, dryer, wireless internet, continental bfast, central location. The fridge was empty and that was a good thing since we needed the space for milk, etc. I hate it when hotels stuff overpriced junk in their fridge. The wireless internet was flawless and speedy. Probably since the place is small and nobody is far from the main lobby. The location was central since you are 10 min from downtown, 5 min from seaworld, 10 min from La Jolla. In fact, there is a 7-11 next door, a Rubio's To Go across the st, and a McDonald's around the corner. However, the mornings were noisy since Mission Bay Drive gets busy at 7am. Parking was excellent since it was 20 feet from your room and free too. I hate walking 4 blocks to my car at most hotels and still have to pay $10/night. The room was also small - about 250 sq ft. My kids liked this since they are small and don't mind tight spaces. Bring your own crib/playpen if you have a baby. The bathtubs edges were too narrow so be careful if you are getting up from a tub bath. The breakfast was well stocked for the most part except for a day when they ran out of bananas. Staff was for the most part nice and professional except for one girl that was rude when we asked for extra shampoo (she was sick but I know that's no excuse). The website pictures look better than the real place and anybody is naive to think they didn't use a wide angle lens when taking those shots. The pool looks way smaller than the web pic but is heated. For about $100/night during August, I guess it's a value. Would we comeback?

I'm so glad we did, because The Inn is only a few minutes away from the beach and it saved us almost $100 with the cheaper room rate and free parking there. This hotel rating really deserves 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 stars, because it's almost above average for its motel class, but not quite, and the negatives might outweigh the positives for different types of guests. I give the owners credit because it seems as if they're trying to make it nice, to make the most out of an older building in an odd location--in the middle of a 7-11 and a car dealership, on a busy street--with pretty good amenities at a great price ($93 total, AREStravel.com).

Cons: Did not see the \"free wireless Internet access\" anywhere (was that supposed to mean a computer?) aforementioned room and bed, clean but TINY pool and sunning area (keep in mind if bringing kids), thin ceilings and/or walls, and an abundance of housekeeping personnel. For such a small place, there were at least four ladies with carts spread out on the property, along with pool guys (and their children?). It was strange and made me feel slightly uneasy. The Inn was a great choice since we were just passing through on our way to a nicer hotel downtown, and it was comfortable overall, but it's not an extended vacation spot.
