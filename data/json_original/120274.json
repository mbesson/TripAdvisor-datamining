The Hotel does provide free shuttle buses to Sea world, Universal/Islands of Adventure & to the Epcot Centre (transfer by Monorail at Epcot for the other Disney parks). The only issue i had with the transfers were that they were overcrowded. One day, the bus was so overcrowded that i would say it was very dangerous (approx 40 people standing in the centre isle). But it was free so cant complain! The Hotel used to provide a continental breakfast but this was stopped on the 1st of January 2012, so now you can only get coffee in the gift shop. There are plenty of other shops & restaurants around the hotel. The rooms were cleaned everyday and were nice and spacious. We had 2 double beds, a safe, ironing board & Iron.

Coffee was always available at the shop in reception. at $1 a cup. I cannot really comment on breakfast as we never had it except for a cup of coffee before we headed out. It looked ok, very basic, coffee, toast and cereals only yet it was always busy so can`t be that bad! Facilities at the hotel were good. 3 washing machines and 3 tumble dryers if you needed them ( $2 per wash and $2.25 to dry), small games room for the kids and a shop ( the guy in the shop was lovely so friendly and helpful) The pool and pool area was excellent. Pool was heated and a reasonable size. Enough tables,chairs and sun loungers so there was no need to panic and clean towels provided for use at the pool only.The actual pool area was very quiet considering the close proxmity of the road and loved the idea of no alcohol in the pool area. It was open until 10pm daily. All the staff always seemed cheerful and always acknowledged us with a smile or good morning. Maybe its because we were always cheerful and polite towards them.

Its approx 10-15 minute drive to epcot. We're the last hotel it picks up from so thats nice, and picking us up we're the first hotel drop off so that's great too. Bus going to magic kingdom comes to hotel at 8am, pick up 8:45pm and 10:15pm; to epcot at 12:50pm, pick up 10:05pm; sea world 9:20pm, i dont remember pick up time.

Walking distance to Walgreens, market grocery place, dennys, wendys, macdonalds, indian cuisine, LOTS of souvenir stores, they all have the same thing at the same price but its nice to look around. Cici pizza is right outside the hotel, its the best, i really liked it, its $5.99/adult and theres coupons inside the continental plaza hotel that gives you one adult 1/2 price with 2nd paying adult plus 2 drinks, so for 2 adults $11.54 all you can eat pizza, salad, dessert, soup, pasta. They had 2 types of soup, 1 type of pasta, they had 8-10 different types of pizza (veggie, cheese, meat, pepperoni, mac$cheese, alfredo, ground beef, chicken, etc). Salad and dessert (apple crisp, banana cream pie, or brownies) - very delicious very good, You can also order 3 medium pizzas for $9.99.

The room was spacious and there were laundry amenities - Free breakfast. It's VERY simple, so basic cereals, toast, orange juice and tea and coffee. You can have as much as you like so it will get you through a day of theme-parking - It's really close to Disneyworld (10 minute trip). The hotel also offers a free shuttle to Disneyworld, Universal Studios and Sea World. The catch is you have to go at specific times - when we went, the shuttle departed for EPCOT at at 8.10am and there was a later shuttle at noon. To get back to the hotel, make sure that you get to the pick-up point on time. Shuttles depart Magic Kingdom at 7pm and 10.45pm. The shuttle can get pretty full as it does pick up guests from other hotels along the way and the Continental Plaza is one of the later stops. Being dropped home first is a big advantage though, and you don't have to waste time meandering around as the shuttle goes from hotel to hotel. If you get Giovanni as a driver, be sure to have a chat to him! He's a real character :) -Its located off the 192 and there's a grocery store and Walgreens for your everyday needs, a fruit stall (with AMAZING oranges), all you can eat buffets and fast food options within walking distance. I would not recommend the Golden China buffet on the same property as the hotel. -Guest Services in the lobby sells discounted tickets to a fair few of Orlando's attractions at a discounted price, and you can see back your used portion of your tickets to them. You can get tickets to most of the theme parks anywhere in Orlando really. Cons: -As soon as I entered the room, I was hit my a strange (and rather unpleasant) musty smell. I think it came from the air conditioner. We didn't use the air con throughout our stay and tried to air out our room as much as possible so towards the end of our stay, the smell was less overpowering. -The bed and the pillows were lumpy -I do not rate the maid service very highly. A few of my things were thrown away and I came back one time to see the bin bag on my things (probably left there by accident when the maid was changing the bin liner). Ew! - The shower is really hard to use and seems to be stuck on a needle setting. - The towels are pretty threadbare - The wifi only works in the lobby. But it is free.

The hotel didn't really play a part in making the holiday the best though, that was down to our days out, the food, and the experience we had in that amazing country. Regarding the hotel it is mediocre, there is nothing major to rant and rave about but there is no reason to have a toast to the hotels memory either. We spent 26 nights at the CPH and the first problem we had was with the fridge, the knob which was needed to adjust the temp was missing so we reported this to reception but nothing was done about it so we made do. Second problem was the cleaner, we had a name and contact details written on a napkin and the cleaner bizarrely saw fit to throw this away! Whether she was practising for the Orlando Magic I don't know but I left a note out questioning whether she had seen it or mistakenly thrown it away and later that evening when my girlfriend and I arrived back to the room this note had also vanished without a trace! Needless to say when we left we didn't leave a tip. Be warned, the hotel charges a standard fee of $2 a night so after being there for the month this was a considerable amount we had to hand over, this goes towards air conditioning, pool towels and the \"free continental breakfast & internet\", the latter three of which we didn't even use. Originally we had breakfast at the hotel only for a couple of days which was a basic cereal and toast but we decided to invest in some worthy fun cereals and snacks for our room so we wouldn't have to get up extra early each morning to eat before getting the free bus. This brings me on to my next warning, the free shuttle buses, these times were absolutely daft, the only pick up for Universal was 7.30am and then you have the pleasure of stopping off at all the other hotels for collections and then the pick up from Universal isn't until 19.30pm! It's not so bad at Universal because when the parks shut you have shops, bars and restaurants at CityWalk to keep you busy. As for SeaWorld this is the same shuttle as Universal so you arrive at SeaWorld before the park opens, and when the park closed at 6pm we had a nice 75 minute wait until we got picked up, that's if the bus was on time which it usually wasn't. Disney pick ups were slightly better, we had a 7.30am and 12.30pm pick up from the CPH and the collections from Disney were 17.45pm, 20.45pm and 22.15pm but when there are shows to see in the evening which masses of people go to, the shuttle times were very touch and go as to whether you would make it back in time to get the bus after having to battle through all the departing crowds! The irritating thing with getting the shuttle back to was each time we were the second from last to be dropped off so while you may get back to your strip in good time you have an additional 15 minutes waiting for drop offs. Sometimes driver's even stopped off uneccessarily because they didn't even check who was getting dropped off where. The hotel is in a good location, we ate somewhere different each night due to the vast choice of eateries. There are plenty of gift shops too for any souvenirs you may wish to take home. There are supermarkets nearby, across the road and up the road so if you do want to stock up on supplies you don't have far to go. For UK travellers like us, the roads are absolutely huge so be prepared for a walk each time you do want to go out for a nibble unless of course you have a car which we didn't. As for staff friendliness, it was nothing to write home about, a few grunts was the most you could expect and there was one particular occassion when we received a call from home and the message wasn't even passed on to us from reception! Our room on the recommended Third Floor was clean and tidy, free of bugs beside from the odd spider, it had a fridge/freezer, microwave, tv, ample sized drawers for all of our clothes and also a safe and an iron. There was a pool which was unsupervised which may not be good if you're travelling with children but it was a nice temperature and did the job if you wanted a quick dip to cool off. This is a good hotel to stay at if like us you are travelling on a budget and aren't too fussy, but if you are expecting five star treatment this isn't the place for you! The CPH will certainly suffice for a stay because sleeping was really the only time we spent at the hotel as we were out all day at the parks etc. Hopefully this helps, if you have any questions feel free to ask.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merced, CA", "Title": "\u201cOk for the price\u201d", "Author": "grammajeri", "ReviewID": "UR85388973", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel since it was reasonably close to the Disney parks.

Pillows were awesome. We were able to get a ground floor room on the end where it was quieter without a problem. The pool was outdoors, and fenced in...not too much noise there. Seemed to be in good repair the one time I was in it. There is wi fi advertised with room rentals, but you will be forced to take your devices to the large lobby sitting area to use it. It doesn't reach the rooms, but they claim it does. We sat outside the lobby in our rental car when we needed to use the wi fi.. Continental breakfast available every morning till 9 in the lobby. All the usual: coffee tea juices, cereals, milk, bread/toast, u-make-them waffles, fruit. The Front desk Clerk frowned at me when I filled my reusable mug with coffee and pointed to the environment killing Styrofoam cups. Very strange. Shuttles to Disney 2x per day are free, but you need to sign up. There is laundry, but it looked pretty skanky. Its outside and there are no cameras. I didn't trust to leave my clothing while it was washing. Never did find the ice machine they claimed to have.... There is a Chinese food place right next door, but in the 6 days I was there, I was warned by hotel staff 3x not to go there due to food poisoning risk.

Reasonable food available with a short walk across Irlo Bronson Highway, or a short drive in either direction. Close to an open field with a man made lake in it.

Clean and comfortable and have stayed in MUCH worse (if you have ever holidayed in Spain, Greece, France etc then this is the Hilton!!) so don't believe the negative hype and enjoy a modern day bargain!!", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gravesend, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fantastic little hotel :) A++++\u201d", "Author": "jadeaggy", "ReviewID": "UR71174361", "Content": "Well folkes I do hope that my review will help put some of your minds at rest as i have been mortified by some of the comments made. I stayed at the hotel approx 15 years ago and had a fantastic trip, the trip was through Virgin Holidays so we expected a good quality hotel. When deciding to return to Florida there was no question as to where to stay. Unfortunately the bad reports about this hotel nearly put us totally off and we even approached the holiday company in the hope of changing to another location. Thankfully the other hotels were too expensive so we had to stay with the Continenial Plaza. On arrival the comments that we had read on here were going through our minds non stop... what if... what will we do.... are we going to have our holiday ruined???? over and over we were very concerned about what we woud face!!! Well on arrival to this hotel i noticed the perfect setting that i had been so pleased with before. We walked into the reception at approx 6pm - the polite helpfull receptionist checked us in and allocated us our room No 315 - it was on the top floor over looking the restaurant and with a view slight view of the pool. As we opened the door we were relieved to find that everything was in order, very clean and tidy... what more coud you ask for. It is hard to try and cover all the points that you may be worried about but i will do my best :). Room - very clean and tidy. Ants - NO ants were seen in or outside the room. Bed - depending on what type of bed you have, we found them to be perfect, not too hard, not too soft. Sheets - all perfectlly clean and changed when ever you put the sign on the bed - Our maid Annette cleaned and made our beds each morning, she is a very polite trustworthy and friendly lady who even picked up a few cents from the floor and putting them on the side, if we had left money/jewellery on the side it was never moved. Noise - NONE. Pool - cleaned each morning, nicely warmed, no noise, dosent get very busy ( some days we were the only 2 people using it ).Breakfast - well to be honest we ate out most mornings at the Golden Corral ($17.10inc tax for 2 all you can eat buffett!!) but we did have the free breakfast one morning - it was very busy and due to only a few tables we had to wait for a table but what more do you expect its a free breakfast so everyone will try to get it - there was toast, cereal and hot n cold drinks - nothing special but hey its breakfast and will get you started in the morning. We did notice that some people had bought peanut butter and choc spead to put on the toast which was allowed. A couple of mornigs i did actualy call in and pick up 2 glasses of orange juice to take back to the room - again no one minded. Hotel Location - PERFECT - you coudnt ask for a better located hotel you are down the end of the 192 so all you need to do is drive out to the main road turn right (no choice) and the do a u turn - drive down here for everything - all your restaurants (Black Angus is a must) Old town, shops and much much more - u can pick up the interstate 4 fom here and everythign for Disney/Universal/Nasa etx is sign posted along. Like i said before you get what you pay for and this hotel offers you excellent value for money. It was my 2nd visit and my Husbands 1st - he said without question if he ever returned to Florida he would check back in....

I also examined their website which includes very little information. Upon arriving at the motel I was asked to pay the resort fee which I knew about and indeed most of the motels charge this or charge you for the safe in your room which amounts to around the same thing. The room that we stayed in was on the third floor furthest away from the main 192 road. I asked for this because in the many trips that I have been to in the US before they seem to expect that you will want a ground floor which is usually noisier. The 192 roadway outside is not too noisy and certainly nothing like the noise levels at night that you would experience up at International Drive beside the I4. The room interior was recently decorated and in a style similar to most US motel rooms with two large queen sized beds, air conditioner mounted at the window and came with safe, refrigerator and microwave. Many other reviews suggest that rooms smell of damp, I did not experience this but it wouldn't surprise me as Florida has a sub tropical climate with very high levels of humidity. As to complaints other reviewers had regarding crawling insects, maybe this occurs on lower levels and yet again it is a sub tropical area with loads of insects. Overall it depends what you are looking for. If you are expecting a European style hotel you will be disappointed. The vast majority of the accommodation available in Orlando are motels and having stayed in many of them I would not say that this is the worst.

I used an online travel site to try and save some money. I got the room for about half the price, rather than pay night-to-night. The room definitely wasn't worth the advertised price (about $60/night) and I would be hard pressed to say it was worth the $32 I paid. First, the desk clerk was one of most dis-interested people I've ever seen. He has a lot to learn about customer service. Second, the room had only a fraction of the advertised \"amenities\" that were listed on the hotel's main website. No refrigerator, no microwave, no coffeemaker, no alarm clock, no data port/modem connection, no newspaper. They need to either furnish the rooms as described, or change the descriptions online. The \"Cable TV\" consisted of only 28 channels, including 4 Spanish networks, 2 \"vacation\" channels, and HBO that was too fuzzy to watch without getting a headache. The \"Internet access\" consisted of a shaky wireless signal in the lobby. The room had the typical hotel feel, same musty smell, same loud wall unit A/C as most cheapies. It was clean, but I didn't bring my blacklight so who knows? Third, the bed was awful. I can only describe it as turning a boat upside-down and trying to sleep on it. Thank god for Ambien. The employee-of-the-month mentioned above also forgot my wake-up call for Monday morning, luckily I set my cell-phone as a back-up. The continental breakfast was an absolute joke. 3 loaves of bread, 1 toaster, two tubs of no name cereal, 1 jug of room temp OJ and a pot of burned coffee. I ended up grabbing a sandwich at McD's instead. The only good thing I can say about this place is the location. It is literally 8 minutes from Disney. My conference was at one the Disney resorts and it was a very short commute. That being said, if your in town to anything Disney, there are plenty of other hotel's located on the same stretch of road.

Never ate breakfast at the hotel because it was somewhat underwhelming so had breakfast in our room and we would drive to McDonalds to get our morning coffee. On-site laundry great feature for our stay. We were on the 3rd floor backside of hotel therefore no noise from above and very little walking by or from road.

Now for the negatives again keeping in mind we were able secure a great price for our stay so negatives are very few in our minds Wi-fi does not go much further than the lobby we already knew this from prior reviews and it really didn't matter. The rooms and hotel are a bit tired and in need of a reno. Keeping in mind that we did not travel to Florida for a hotel room. We simply needed a safe, clean place (our room was somewhat clean we helped it out a bit) to drop our stuff and lay our heads at night for 2 weeks. Everything we requested we were able to have. I did phone a couple of days prior to our arrival to secure the items that I had requested via our internet reservation.

The man who came to the room checked it & said it was OK - the safe flashed 'lowbat' but allowed us to lock our belongings away.

It was enough to sustain, and walking distance to $3.99 buffets is you wanted more. And yes, the shuttle had limited schedule, but it was at the times most folks would want to go.

I paid $16.66/day for a room in 2009, and got a free shuttle round trip to Disney (or Universal or Sea World), and a basic breakfast. Yes, I had to pay 25 cents for a bucket of ice. I'll bet lots of folks were filling up coolers when it was free. A quarter...no big deal...I just got a room for $16.66 / day in 2009!!! Oh, and the pool was clean as a whistle, with plenty of pool towels and nice warm water. I was very pleased with our stay.

They offer some good prices that do not include a high pressure sales tour. I would prefer to pay full price than have to go to one of those. Rooms are clean but very basic, there is no fridge or microwave, which is very unusual even in a budget hotel. There is a safe in the room that it very easy to use and would hold a laptop easily. The pillows are actually cushions and not the most comfortable, I slept without any. There are a lot of little ants around and sometimes some bugs but it's a tropical area and this comes with the territory. We didn't use the pool so cannot comment but there always seemed to be people there having a good time. We cannot comment on the breakfast as we didn't bother. It appeared to be bread (toast) cereal, juice tea and coffee. We went to the Golden Corral most days $17.10 for 2 all you can eat buffett which is about 3mins away in a car. The hotel is ideally situated for both Disney approx 15mins, Sea World 20mins and Universal 25mins both by car, although the hotel does offer a shuttle service we did not partake. I would throughly recommend Kennedy Space Centre, we spent 2 days there and could have gone again. We paid extra and did the up close tour, which we both found very interesting as you get close to the shuttle launch pads and the NASA building for picture taking. You see a bit more than on the normal tour to Saturn V centre and the clean area. One ticket covers admission for 2days but you must remember to get the ticket stamped on your way out and return within 7days. I would also recommend the Arabian Nights dinner (good deal if you book through the services desk) 90mins of entertainment and a reasonable 3course meal, as much soft drinks and house beer as you like. The horses and riders are very good and at the end you get to meet the horses up close for pictures and a chat with the rider. My favourite theme park was Busch Gardens excellent even if you don't like the rides there is plenty to do. Sheikra, Montu and Rhino Rally are excellent my favourites. The train that goes around the park is a must do as is getting a birds eye view on the cable car. Then you can check out all the animals. The Meerkats are my favourite along with the Hippo and the tigers. In all fairness it is all excellent. The only drawback is that it is about 90mins from Kissimmee/Orlando but again transport is included if required. My favourite water park is Blizzard Beach, I have been to all in the Orlando/Kissimmee area and I think this one is the best by far.

Not a big issue, but that shouldn't happen. We complained to the manager and were promptly offered another room. Since it was late at night and the other room was in a different part of the hotel we chose to stay. Apart from this initial hickup our stay was uneventful, the staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was decent - not as good as I've had at other hotels, but it was free so one shouldn't complain :) The location is awesome, about 15 minutes to Disney and almost within walking distance from some nice restaurants. There's a Walmart and a Target store about 20 minutes West from the hotel, some shopping arease (groceries, pharmacy etc) are closer by. On site there's a (small) pool, washing and drying facilities ($2 each, I believe), very cool. The one thing I was a bit 'meh' about; you have to pay for ice. Not much, but you have to bring a quarter to fill your ice-bucket, annoying if you don't know this and have to walk back to your room to find change.

specific to our room... we got a room on the second floor, back facing the pool (and lake). the good thing is that the pool opens til 9pm so it might be a little noisy to get a room facing it. our room was about the 8th room away from the lobby, so we got free wireless internet (signal was 4 bars out of 5) inside our room, which helped us with our disney trip planning (we used ridemax, btw). if you get a room further from the lobby, you can still bring your laptop to the lobby and use the wireless internet. otherwise, there is one internet kiosk next to the concierge, which costs a quarter per minute. the beds were okay, but pillows are mediocre. bring your own if you are that fussy. breakfast... we found it to be really good (esp if you consider most motels at this price do not offer any). 6:30-9:30am. there was toast, juice (apple, orange), milk, cereals (frosties, corn flakes and frootloops), and the notorious waffle maker. the 2-minute waffle making process takes practice (you'll get it after one or two tries) but every now and then someone fumbles and cause unnecessary waiting for the rest of the line. expect to wait 5 mins for your turn to make a waffle, or more during \"peak periods\". our one week experience tells us that there are mainly two waves of breakfast crowds -- those aiming for taking the complimentary disney/universal studios shuttle will eat 30 mins before the shuttle (check with concierge for schedule that changes every month; we actually emailed them for a schedule before we left for orlando ocplazareservations@orlandocontinentalplazahotel.com), while those who drive to disney will eat around 9am. that means that if you hate waiting for the waffle maker or for a table to sit, you will need to get up early. we hit the peak period twice during our stay, and had to bring brkfast back to our room, which is okay since our room was sufficiently close. service... concierge was reasonably nice and helpful. i give it 4 out of 5, given my limited experience as i only checked in and out, and got pool towels. housekeeping was immaculate and deserving of a good tip. they tend to come around 930am (may vary depending on room location). i thought the maids were friendlier than the concierge. i did not use the onsite car rental, so i cannot comment. the car rental office is situated just behind the lobby. btw, parking is free, of course and plentiful. it gets real sunny and hot in the late morning so be sure to secure the shady spots (optimize with the trees, the motel building, and the sun!). amenities... limited within the compound. there was a gift shop where you can get disney merchandise and sun screen and stuff, but we did not patronize it. kissimmee is a great place for food though.. really. the entire 192 is like a tourist area with lotsa restaurants. we found TGIF to be top-notch. there was a small japanese place right across the 192 highway from the hotel with decent lunch set meals (it became a mainstay of ours after getting tired of disney hotdogs and its famous turkey leg). dont ever try the angels seafood buffet place along the 192. it says $19.99/$29.99 for seafood/lobster buffet, but when you get there, it becomes $26.99/$36.99. and the food selection and quality sucked. also, avoid cici's pizza buffet 2 mins drive away. pizzas are nothing but cheese with no meat, terrible selection of pasta and salad. it was cheap but trust me, i've never spent so little money and still felt cheated. we didn't try the china buffet right next to the hotel, but we saw bad reviews here and opted not to go. it was crowded from time to time though and we decided that we would try it only if the weather was bad enough which didnt happen. btw, there's a walgreens 5 mins walk from the hotel. get your water there. we got 24x500ml for $5. basically, would i stay here again? yes, definitely, cos the hotel was decent. i got my bed, tv, internet and airconditioning. the kissimmee area was great (of course, you need a car to enjoy this part).", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent price\u201d", "Author": "Happycustomer24", "ReviewID": "UR31171932", "Content": "We stayed in room 163, the room was very clean, my wife Santa enjoyed our stay very much.

Part of the back vent on the bus kept banging on my husbands head. We went to Discovery Cove, interacted with the dolphins and went snorkeling, it was amazing. However the pics package is expensive. We went on a time-share talk to get tickets cheaper for Magic Kingdom and Epcot, well worth saving the money for two hours of time. However do not get caught up, as we nearly said yes !. If you do not like big roller coasters i.e ones that spin and loop or have no children, Islands Of Adventure was a little dissapointing. The water rides kept us going, Popeyes barges was excellent until you see other people putting quarters in water guns to squirt you. Best parks for us was Epcot and Universal, the queue for soarin and test track in Epcot were worth it, to be honest they were the only real queues we had the whole two weeks, we were lucky ! Seaworld was very good, the shows were well worth seeing. Wal-mart is definately worth a trip, we got a notepad laptop and mp3 much cheaper than home, and as they are part of Asda, if anything goes wrong you can take it back there.

Yes there was clean towels every day and clean bedding but our room was not hoovered and it was thick with dust near the skirting boards etc... the rooms only ever had a quick clean. Hairdryer didnt work, dead bolt on door nearly coming off. I must admit when i checked in i was expecting to want to move elsewhere the next day. But as that area has just so much to do we were that tired every night we just literally used the place as somewhere to sleep. I just thanked god we were on an action packed holiday and not stuck there!! The breakfast was basic, okay if you want a quick bit of cereal or toast but it did tend to get a bit chaotic and the 8 or so tables was just not enough to seat every one. We booked our theme( universal/disney) park tickets through the lady at the desk and this involved going to a timeshare presentation to a resort 10 minutes up the road. It was boring as we had no intention of buying a time share. And trust me they will give you the hard sell, but saved us nearly \u00a3300 on the on the door/travel agent prices. I must admit the travel agents in the UK try and scare you into buying tickets in the UK before you go but if you have time to do this it is worth it. Even on the door is the same price as agents if not cheaper. I would never but my tickets before i go. One of the most annoying things was the damn takeaway pizza leaflets under the door twice a day!!!! we used to stick our back out but they just stick more through. There was a notice in the lobby saying not to use the guys - maybe they should be more pro-active and stop them and their flyers coming onto the property! But if you do want good value Cici's pizza up the road was a top all you can eat pizza buffet with dessert for $5.99 and worth every cent!! In all this place is a cheap motel with a few hygiene issues if you can hack it it could provide you with a cheap holiday and more money to spend on the attractions.

When we arrived at the room, i found it to be very clean with two double beds, a t.v with cable channels, a bath and shower in good working order and a large vanity sink with hairdryer and lots of space for all my toiletries and a dressing area with an iron and ironing board, of which i hadnt been expecting, also plenty of room for our luggage and clothes. We decided to have a look out and see what ammenities were around the hotel, as I thought we would be a bit out of the way from things, but it is excellently situated, Straight over the road from the hotel they have a T.G.I Fridays, of which is lovely and we spent quite a few nights there, it is also very reasonably priced and they are great with families and children, our daughter is 3, and she loved eating there, they had a balloon man come round every time making the kids balloon animals etc, also on the next block they had a similar restaurant called the Outback, which i also highly rated, the food was excellent and again very reasonably priced, also great with families and kids, also behind t.g.i's they have an off licence and supermarket, so if you like a drink its a good idea to stock up as drinks we found were very expensive over there, but cheap at the off licence, and also i would advise hiring a fridge for your room to keep the beers cold! also within a five minute walk on the same side of the road as the hotel they had a mc donalds, pizza hutburger king and a dennys restaurant, which is great if your on a budget, it was amazingly cheap!!, also the food was good and the service very friendly. There is also a chinease restaurant on the hotel grounds, but we didnt eat there. We decided not to drive over there on our trip as it was our first time, we were a bit worried about driving over there, and the insurance package offered to us by our operator was extortionate! over \u00a3300 for the two weeks!, and we werent informed of this until i phoned to check that the car offered to us in our package was insured as it hadnt been mentioned through the booking process, be careful not to be caught out with this one as if you have been offered a car with your package, and you get out there without insurance, it would be a bit of a shock as you would have to take out insurance over there before driving it away, and i would certainly be more expensive as well!!, anyway, we were using the shuttles provided by the hotel to take us to the theme parks, all i can say is they served a purpose, but took a lot of time out of your day, i dont want to complain too much about them as without them we would have been stuck, but all i can say is be prepared if you do take them as they were always between 10 and 25 minutes late, and take between an hour to an hour and a half to get you to your destination which is literally 10 minutes down the road by car, they would pick you up, and then go on to about 4 other hotels on the same side of the road as our hotel, then turn around and pick up at hotels on the other side of the road, half an hour later, you would go past the quality inn on the other side!!, coming back wasnt too bad, as you would be the second drop, so it took about 15 minutes to get back once the bus had turned up, again usually quite late. We learned a fewtricks to avoid being hassled with them to much, so i will pass these on to you!! The bus to take you to the magic Kingdom is at 8.10am, then you have the Universal and Seaworl one at 9.10am, then another disney one a 11.50am, which takes you to Epcot and Hollywood Studios, my advise wherever you are going within disneyland get the early bus to the magic kingdom!, once you get there, if you walk past the ticketing area from the bus depot, you will get to the polynesian hotel, which is a couple of minutes walk, from there, you just walk through the grounds of the polynesian, veer left and you come to the hotel bus depot, and the buses turn up literally every few minutes to go to all the other disney theme parks and water parks, it was great, if you do fancy a lie in, get on the later epcot bus, where you can get the monorail over to the magic kingdom, and then do the same if youwant to go somewhere else, we used it as a bit of a hub. Also if you want to leave early one night and dont want to wait for the shuttle, use disney transport to take you to the animal kingdom, as this is the closest disney park to the hotel, and get a taxi, ask him to take you down the sherbeth road shortcut, and it is $10 to get back, which is really cheap, its about $25 from any of the other parks. If you dont ask the taxi driver to take you down sherbeth road, hell take you down the highway which is an extra $5, i know it doesnt sound much, but when your money is running out youll appreciate it!!. The only other thing i was anoyed about with the shuttles is that they leave slightly to early to see the fireworks at the magic kingdom, so either risk the bus being late one night and watch them as we did, and because the bus was so late we still managed to get it, but obviously you cant rely on this, as now and again they are about on time, then make sure one night you just get a taxi as they are well worth staying to see, but unfortunately you would have to get a taxi from the magic kingdom, as the animal kingdom closes at 8pm. If we do go again i think we will definately save up the \u00a3300 pounds for the insurance and drive as the hotel is situated so close to all of the theme parks, all of which are fab!! and it is $11 dollars to park, and the roads all looked vry easy to drive on, very clearly signed and all pretty straight routes. we worked out we spent 52 hours on the buses, sad i know, but its quite a chunk of your holiday!! Back to the hotel, it also has a heated swimming pool which is great, dont get me wrong,the place isnt luxurious and if that is what your after it wont be for you, but it is a great base for a disney holiday, clean, friendly and has all the basics you need with lovely comfy beds and the rooms were cleaned and tidied daily and yes we did get clean towels in our rooms every day! I know ive had a few moans about the shuttles, but it didnt spoil our holiday, im just being honest as to what they were like and what to expect, i would use them again if i had to, it would just be a lot more convenient to drive but they get you there and back if you dont want to drive, also i noticed a lot of people had a moan about the breakfast area at the hotel as they said it does get very busy and there were not always enough tables for everyone,the breakfasts were good, they served toast with different spreads, 3 different cerials, juices teas and coffees and waffles, all of which filled us up plenty for the morning, if you want to avoid the table issue either get there very early or very late and youll be fine, failing that take it to your room!! anyway we would definately stay at this hotel again as we had a really fab holiday!! happy hols!!", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chattanooga, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGood for price\u201d", "Author": "Greenwillow", "ReviewID": "UR16807407", "Content": "I went to this hotel last year, and I thought it was a fantastic deal for the price!

The breakfast was ok but as mentioned a little crowed but I just used the tray in my room and took it back, or you can pay $5 outside at golden corral or cracker barrel both in walking distance. If you are on your way to this hotel don't worry its clean safe and the staff are very friendly. I had 3 problems in 2 weeks the safe was locked when I arrived (fault of last person to leave) I contacted reception a man was at my door 5 mins later and to fix problem, second problem was with safe no power (my fault caught switch inside and turned it off) again fixed in 5 mins, the third was the light in bathroom blew again one phone call fixed in 5 mins what more can I say. If i was being really picky there was a crack in the bath that had been repaired but you cant expect them to rip out the whole bath for a small crack. please use this hotel it really is fine. i give it 10 out of 10", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "sCOTLAND", "Title": "\u201cDont Be Put Off By The Few Bad Reviews.\u201d", "Author": "sOUPkING", "ReviewID": "UR16666429", "Content": "Dont Be Put Off By The Few Bad Reviews.

Reading some of the reviews afterwards I spent a few days getting a bail-out plan in place - I wasted my time. Honestly I just don't know what some people see to complain about with this place, sure it's no 5 star establishment but you knew that when booking at $40 a night right? Trust me if it was dirty, covered in spiders, falling apart etc we would have been out of there without unpacking. The room was fine, clean, decent beds, new and clean bedding every day if you so choose, loads of towels in room and at poolside again changed daily. TV with 20 odd channels incl Sport and Disney channels. Shower room ok, not pristeen but not filthy by any stretch of the imagination. Free safe, pool nice and decent view of the lake and the lights on 192 if you get a front facing room. Sure the corners could be swept a little better and the silicone around some tiles could be freshened up but don't stress about it. We really could not complain about the value for money at this place and had a great time. My daughter saw the rewiew relating to spiders below before we travelled and obviously remembered.

Basically a hotel close to Disney that we could stay at for one night, Three of us arrived about 3:00 p.m.. We had requested a handicapped room for my parents, first floor rooms for all of us and close together if not adjoining. Only the handicapped request came through. I made my initial reservations for all four rooms back in March and got a good rate through Choice Hotels.com. Then when I was reviewing the hotel in early May, I happend to recheck the rates on Choicehotels.com and found that the rates being offered at that time were lower than my March rates. I cancelled the March reservations and made new reservations at the cheaper rate. (which was the rate we paid.) Three of the rooms groups arrived together around 3:00 p.m.. At that time, my parents were assigned a first floor handicapped room, my family was placed a whole building away on the second floor and the third group was three doors down from us in the second building. I asked where the fourth room was going to be, and was told 244 (two doors from one of our group.) In defense of the hotel, the hanidcapped rooms are all together on the first floor of the first building and so we could not be on that floor near them. (Understandable.) Our group went to dinner around 5:00 p.m. and the fourth room group showed up. I had already talked to them on the cell phone and had told them the room number that they would have and where it was in relation to us. When they did check in about 6:00 p.m., they were told that 244 was no longer available and the only rooms the hotel had left were on the third floor. I'm not sure why the hotel would give out a room that was already assigned, especially after telling others that room number! I also don't understand why our group could not be on the second floor of the first building above my parents. I helped my parents put their luggage in their room when we checked in and then walked to my room by going up the stairs in the first wing and down, passing the rooms above my parents... unassigned rooms have the drapes open and you can see in. Most of the rooms in the first building appeared to be unassigned when I walked down the walkway at 3:30 p.m.! If they were going to switch our other group from their assigned room, then why was it any different for these rooms? The hotel simply wouldn't honor requests, so don't waste your time making them. The pool was very nice and the kids had a great time. The room was clean altough the bathrooms could use some upgrades. The location is very good. Finally, the breakfast. I have been to alot of hotel breakfasts and this one rates near the bottom. They had waffle makers, bread for toaster, muffins, bagels, very limited cereal choices and beverages. No fruit at all. The toaster was a rolling one and would only toast one side of the bread. The biggest problem with the breakfast was all of the \"outsiders\" who were eating there. There were several construction workers (appeared to be from a road crew) in the breakfast area. They monoploized the waffle makers, they took 7-8 slices of bread and toasted them and just basically pigged out. I don't have a problem with the hotel giving the work crews free coffee BUT when they wipe out the food supply and monopolize the cooking devices so that the PAYING customers have to wait and are shut out of some items, it is not fair.

The beds are VERY comfy and rooms are cleaned daily!! The stuff you may have read about the flies is partly true but I think it's the time of year plus it's not as bad as it's made out to be. Breakfast is complementary and consists of waffles, cereal, tea, coffee, toast etc. A good place to fuel up for the long days at the parks. There is also free shuttle buses to the parks but can get full as they pick up from several places. There are countless places to eat around the hotel & there's an all you can eat chinese buffet next door that's good. In short don't expect a flash, fancy place but do expect somewhere cosy to get your head down at night that's clean and friendly. How much time will you be in the hotel anyway???

Here are some tips to find them. Lift the head board off the wall and look behind it. They come off very easy and the bugs are easy to see. Also, look inside pillow cases and pull sheets up quickly and look for anything running. there's a product called [--]. this stuff kills bed bugs and leaves a nice cinnamon smell. Anyway, no bugs, room was clean, plenty of towels, air worked fine. Do NOT count on breakfast. It was very crowded and they basically had toast and cereal. We grabbed donuts. Tip on Disney. Water tastes like sulfur or burnt hair. yuck. Ask for cups of water from concession stands or to fill a water bottle. every park, disney or not, will do this for free and water tastes MUCH better. we also brought food in a small cooler bag and saved a lot of money.

Take a moment to consider that I travel ALL YEAR, and stay in dozens of hotels all over the country in the $49-79 price range. This hotel has all outside entrances, which is generally a bad sign. We arrived to find a heavy mildew smell that immediately made me realize I'd made a bad choice in picking this hotel. Upon quick inspection it looked like the room was kept just clean enough to be acceptable to a tired and road-weary guest that didn't feel like putting up a fight. As noted in several reviews this hotel was plagued with what the locals call \"love bugs\" ; little soft-bodied black bugs that are hooked together mating...EVERYWHERE. They were supposedly brought into Florida by a University to help control the mosquito population, and now they are out of control. They were swarmed all over the property to the extent that we couldn't lay out at the pool and relax without them covering us, and there were plenty of them in our room and even in the bed. When this was brought to the property manager's attention, (via phone call)his response was a canned; \"This is Florida, they are everywhere\". Amazingly enough, we didn't see them anywhere at Disney, (where they spray for bugs for the comfort of their guest). The carpeting in our room was old and dingy. While taking my first shower, I noted the bottoms of my feet were black from mildew after walking barefoot in the room. The bed was old, but a thin mattress pad was added to try to extend the life a little longer. The T.V. armoire was big and beautiful, and had plenty of storage for clothing and accessories. The lamps were old and out-dated, and one of them had to be smacked a few tiimes to keep the light on. Upon leaving the room on day 1, I flagged the housekeeper who was cleaning the room next door to let her know we were out of our room for the day. She didn't speak English so I pointed at our room and gestured we were leaving and it was OK to clean our room. Upon returning later that evening our bed was hurriedly put together, the cup of coffee we had left on the nightstand was dumped all over the nightstand and the cup was on the floor. Our new towels were thrown on the racks as if they were in a speed-housekeeping competition, and there was no new packets of coffee or bars of soap left. Day 2, upon leaving I flagged a couple of housekeepers that were talking out front of our room to let them know we were leaving, none of them spoke English either. We did however get housekeeping that day, and it was much better than day one. The only thing left untouched were the bugs stuck in the cobwebs attached to the window curtain, not complaining, I think they kind of added to the room's decor. The entrance to the lobby is made of large windows that look as if they hadn't been cleaned in years. The front desk staff was cordial, and there was a man (maybe the manager?) that staffed an information desk and tries to sell you tickets to local atractions. He seemed quite dissapointed when I declined. There must be a fat commission on selling tickets in Kissimmee, everywhere we went aggressive sales people were trying to sell us tickets. As far as vending machines, there are several Coca-cola machines on the premises for a $1.50 each. There is a grocery store directly across the street, so I recommend stocking your mini in-room fridge on your first night. The Chinese restaurant built in the same parking lot was good (for buffet food), but dinner was $11.95 + drink & tip per person, very pricey for limited selection and NO SUSHI. According to the coupon-clipper magazine I got at the information desk, there are several more Chinese buffets with much more selection and cheaper just down the road. If you like Japanese/Hibachi, I strongly recommend \"Kaburi\". For lunch, Hibachi chicken is $6.50, and includes vegetables, rice, lo-mein, and the salad station. Drinks are additional. The Hibachi steak was only $7.95. The food quality was excellent, and our chef was very friendly. Be sure to clip your coupon for 10% off. As for this hotel, this will be our last stay here. Unfortunately, it looks like most of the hotels on the main drag (Hwy. 192) weren't really kept up. Kissimmee looks like a town that is soley based on tourism and is slowly dying. There are many hotels that are vacant and out of business up and down this highway, and it looks like the general maintenance of most businesses are of the by-gone era. If you're in this area and need a hotel, spend the extra $100-200 for your entire stay, and get a 3-star hotel elsewhere.

All the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and approachable. We were upgraded to a kingsize room without even asking and our check out was extended to 1pm without any problems. Our room had a brand new air conditioning unit which was quiter than the ones we are used to, a microwave, fridge, freezer, hairdryer, safe and TV. The TV had premium HBO channels (perfect for after a hectic day at the parks). The bed was clean and comfortable and the maid came 6 times a week. The pool was a good size, very clean and looked out onto the lake. Yes there were some little black flies but if you got a lounger away from the hedge they didn't bother you and there certainly weren't any in our room. There are a zillion places to eat along the 192, Ponderosa is great for it's huge buffet breakfast and filling up before a day at the parks. I would highly recommend a trip to the Rainforest Cafe in Downtown Disney, Hardrock Cafe in Universal, Bennigans on I drive and Johnny Rockets at the Pointe they are all brilliant!! If you're looking for a quiet night in Publix is less than a mile up the road where you can stock up on ice cream, crisps, beer & wine etc. Without a doubt I'd return to this hotel, it's superb value for money.

Despite expecting a dive from previous reviews, I was pleasantly surprised. Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential. Ten minutes to disney avoided spoiling the day with a long drive home. There are loads of places to eat locally, although you will have trouble if you want 5% healthy food 5% of the time. Sick of fatty junk food after the second day, and despite our quest to eat in a half respectable fashion, no luck was had. We could both feel the excess weight on arriving home, despite running from ride to ride at the theme parks each day! We were not being overly fussy, the chinese eat as much as you can next door is highly recommended. Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative. The pool is fine and everyone is friendly. Especially the (only little) lizards. A great place to stay. I would definitely, go back, unless I won the lottery or got a serious payrise! P.s. Don't forget to go to adventure island next to universal. the best theme park we visited! We were too scared to go on the hulk ride, please don't share the same regrets.

Maid service is brilliant clean towels everyday and beds made. Pool is heated which is nice, the weather was beautiful, too hot somedays. staff on the front desk very helpful. Hotel shop is very expensive so be warned. Area around isn't bad we had a different restaurant every night of our 14night stay, try the corral more than you can eat for $6.99 and I mean more than you can eat food was really nice, red lobster was good so was the minning company. across the road from Quality Inn was TGI Friday we had a nice swiss steak and frys there and its a bar too we had trouble finding a bar locally. We wanted to go to International drive to see all the shops but we ended up after taking four buses at a mall still it was a sight. A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too. Go to Kissimmee old town theres the biggest bunggie ride I have seen and its a nice small place. Hotel does supply free shuttle buses to all theme parks which go every day and you don't have to bye your tickets from the guest services at the front of the hotel happy holidays.

As an apology, we were given a 2 nights free voucher for this hotel good for a year. I had never expected to stay in Orlando/Kissimmee again (I have no interest in theme parks, which is really the only thing to do in the area), but I ended up attending a weekend-long music event in Februrary 2005 and luckily used the voucher with no trouble! This is a no-frills hotel, but everything appeared clean and well-maintained, which I feel is most important. The staff were always helpful (if they didn't have an answer, they would take the time to find someone who did!), and when I needed a handyman to fix the safety latch at 9 PM, he appeared in 10 minutes, absolutely the quickest service of that nature I've had at a hotel! Although I had a car, there were local bus stops nearby, and some 24 hour chain restaurants such as Denny's in walking distance. The surrounding area does have heavy car traffic, but is very pedestrian friendly. My room was quiet, even with a visiting youth football (soccer) team playing in an empty area of the parking lot. My only complaint is the swamped breakfast area located in the lobby. I come to expect this sort of situation in hotels anymore, but with the amount of people in the small lobby each day, it may be a good decision for the hotel to expand this area a bit. Overall, if I find myself needing a hotel in the Orlando area, I would definitely try to get a room at this hotel again.

Firstly, reception won't really care as we found them quite surely and unhelpful, and secondly the rooms are not gleaming and smelling of rose petals! The less said about the pool though the better. You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
