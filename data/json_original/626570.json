Although we love luxurious hotels, we decided we would rather have extra cash to shop and eat in Rome. The convent made this possible. We were given a triple room, which was great. Our room was in the back and we were not bothered by noise at all. The beds are indeed v. comfortable, but the pillows---while excellent for reading---are not comfy. If you are accustomed to good quality down pillows, soft & squashy, you will want to use one of those air-sucker-outter-things and get your pillow into your suitcase. The rooms are immaculate. I am a habitutal bed maker, but my son (surprise) is not, and we were very pleasantly surprised to see that the housekeeping crew straightened up for us. Our bathroom was not private, but there was no one else at our end of the floor until the weekend, so for the better part of our stay it was private. The convent filled up with lots more guests for the weekend. Breakfast is nothing fancy, but the coffee is quite good, and Sister Breakfast is very efficient. The location is spectacular, literally in the backyard of Navona and across the street from Campo Fiori. It was a bit of a hike, but we were within walking distance of the Great Synagogue. Convenient cash machines, a 24/7 vending place across the street where we picked up bottled water at night, and close to buses, trams, bars, etc.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent place to stay for the budget minded\u201d", "Author": "niramt", "ReviewID": "UR86076190", "Content": "The rooms were immaculate, the bathrooms very clean. The sisters were very friendly and a joy to get to know. The breakfast was simple yet substantial as we got on with our tours of the day. It is a excellent place to stay if you are budget consious and just looking for a peaceful place to sleep. It is located very near Piazza Navona,and walking distance to much of historic Rome.

Breakfast served between 8-9 am., was simple, yet ample. There is an elevator and a midnight curfew. Although there is no wi-fi, Sister Catherine printed my boarding passes at no cost. Numerous restaurants, cafes, and gelatto stores are sprinkled around Piazza Navona located a short walk away. The sisters went out of their way to be helpful. The rooms are basic, clean, adequately sized, and have shutters to block the sounds of the city.

It is clean, comfortable, very well served and manned by nuns. This small \"army\" of sisters, of whom quite a few were fluent in English, was difficult to beat in terms of friendliness, efficiency and finesse. By continental standards it was a cheap, affordable (and no-frills) accomodation. The area where the building is located is very attractive and looked safe. The rooms are basic, clean and comfortable. My room had a private bathroom adjoining it. Continental breakfast is served at 8 a.m. at the communal dining room, amidst a cheerful atmosphere.

Clean and comfortable, it offers rooms of different sizes to quiet travelers. Centrally located, it is ideal for visiting Rome, most attractions being within walking distance (less than 30 minutes for the most distant). I had reserved through email (no website yet) a room with two single beds. A couple of sisters speak English and usually man the desk. With the continental breakfast, the room was 79 euros/night for both of us. The reservation made, I received by email a document giving me more information (how to get there, deposit, final payment, etc.). When I reconfirmed the reservation a month before our arrival, one night deposit was charged to my credit card as stated in the document. I paid the rest by credit card upon arrival. The convent was easily accessible with the well-known bus #64 who dropped us off almost in front of it at lunch time. Without further ado, we were assigned our room by a pair of very kind and cheerful nuns. As in many places, the key had to be returned every time we went out. Curfew was at 11:30 p.m., a reasonable hour for travelers. A small elevator in good working order took us to the 2nd floor. The room itself was comfortable but without any frills: two beds (with excellent mattresses), two night tables, a table with two chairs, a cupboard, a sink and bidet. Four towels and shampoo were waiting for us on the table. As it was situated at the back of the convent, we were not disturbed by any noise. I was told that rooms facing the street could be noisy. Four bathrooms with showers were nearby. No fan, phone or clock in the room but there was a hairblower in the nearby bathroom. No computer with internet access was available in the convent. Out of habit, we made our beds in the morning; so I am unsure if someone would have straightened things up if we had not. Breakfast, served on the 1st floor at 8 a.m., consisted of one croissant and as many slices of good bread as you wished, all served by a small nun with limited English but who smiled a lot. Tea, coffee or hot chocolate completed the meal. On our last morning, we had to leave before breakfast was served. I mentioned that fact to the sister at the desk and, when we came down to check out a couple days later, two small paper bags, containing each one croissant, were waiting for us at the desk. This convent offers good lodgings at a reasonable price for Rome. The location is excellent, near most attractions and stores. The rooms are simple but clean and comfortable. The nuns are kind, helpful, and welcoming. People with simple needs will find this place more than adequate. Traveling tips: -Piazza Navona offers free entertainment (acrobats, music, etc.) every evening. If you wish to have your portrait drawn by an artist, this is the place. -On Victor Emmanuelle, just past Largo Argentino, there is a small grocery store. Another one can be found on Via della Farina (the street beside the church Sant\u2019 Andrea della Valle). Both will supply you with the basics if you don\u2019t wish to go in a restaurant. The Campo dei Fiori is barely 5 minutes away but offers little besides fruits, vegetables and a few souvenirs. As for restaurants, we found the following cheap deals in the area: around the corner from the convent, a mini pizzeria sells good pizza by weight; the chain Insalata just beside the church Sant\u2019Andrea della Valle offers big salads and pasta at a decent price (less than 30 euros for two, with house wine); just pass the library Feltrinelli on Victor Emmanuelle, il Delfino offers for 11 euros your choice of 2 plates + bread+dessert. Very ordinary but a favorite place for young locals. For fun, almost across the convent on the Corso del Rinascimento, a little candy store will fill anybody\u2019s sweet tooth. -On Victor Emmanuelle, many buses run by. The #64 runs from Termini to Saint Peter\u2019s and stops everywhere. The #40 does the same but with less stops. At nearby Largo Argentina, you can easily take the tramway to Trastevere Station and change to the local train for the airport, the whole trip taking less than an hour and costing 1/3 less than the Leonardo Express running between Termini and the airport. - To visit museums and other attractions, consider the Roma Pass (20 euros), valid 3 days. First 2 attractions free and the others at reduced price. Free transportation for 3 days also. The Coliseum, Palatine & Forum are 12 euros all together (1 ticket for all three). Most others museums are 6 euros. The bus or metro cost 1 euro each time. Note that students from outside Europe have to pay adult prices. Only the Vatican museums accepted the ISIC card during our stay.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Istituto Santa Giuliana Falconieri", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d626570-Reviews-Istituto_Santa_Giuliana_Falconieri-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Calasanzio, 1</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "626570", "ImgURL": ""}}
