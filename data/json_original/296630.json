We stayed 2 nights in the Tolkien suite which was large and comfortably furnished with a king sized bed, large sofa and plenty of seating areas. No canal view but it had high ceilings and lots of light. The bed was very comfortable and bed linen top quality. Bathroom was not very modern but was big enough with a separate bath and shower and was spotlessly clean.

Breakfast was beautifully done, a full continental with all the trimmings you need without the pressure of larger hotel offerings. The location is perfect and we were able to walk to all visitor areas, restaurants, museums and shopping. The only taxi/car usage was to the airport and do allow the hotel to arrange a car as we found this no more expensive than the taxi we took from the airport. Friends met us for pre dinner drinks and the option of three very comfortable public rooms to welcome them in to a roaring fire on a cold day was wonderful, reminding us of the very pleasant boutique hotel we use in London in the same way. Our junior suite Tolkien (4) was very spacious and aside from the unusual bathroom door arrangement was excellent for our purposes and on the quieter side of the Hotel. That said I would not expect there to be an issue on the canal side certainly not in the low season. We will certainly be back again perhaps in warmer weather.

We had been traveling for the week prior to our stay there and arrived there at 6:30pm unsure of what to expect. We were greeted by Jerko, one of the several wonderfully welcoming staff we encountered there. Jerko checked us in and then asked if we'd like a bottle of wine and \"snacks.\" We climbed the stairs up to the 3rd floor--we were staying in the Picasso Suite which overlooks a canal. The room was gorgeous and comfortable--a hotel room with charm, personality and every creature comfort you could ask for. We loved it. One of my least favorite things about high end hotels is that they so often nickel and dime you for every little thing. Want a bottle of water? That's five bucks? Want a bottle of wine? That's forty bucks. At the Seven one Seven, however, all food and drink is included in your room rate. Wine, cheese, olives, beer, bottled water, Diet Coke--it's all included. We loved that aspect of the Seven one Seven. Each day we would wake, go downstairs for a very good breakfast (including warm chocolate croissants!), head out, explore the city for most of the day, come home, have a bottle of wine and snacks sent up, spend a couple of hours relaxing (the internet is free as well) and then head back out. When we came home at night, we'd be greeted by a charming staff person all of whom unfailingly asked us if there was anything we needed. Our room on the canal was louder at night than I'd have liked although the Seven one Seven is in a relatively sedate part of town. The hotel does the best they can with heavy windows and interior and exterior shutters, but, if you are a light sleeper, I'd ask for an interior room.

We first visited Amsterdam seven months ago and stayed at the Banks Mansion. Even for a small city Banks felt a little out on a limb and in terms of looks and character could have been anywhere. It didn't do Amsterdam any favours. After much consideration we decided to give the city another try and chose the 717.The trip was much more enjoyable. First the negatives and which have featured in some other reviews.It is expensive. Noise from the street is a bit of problem.The hotel is very near the Leidesplein and you do get alot of late night revellers.We stayed during a very stormy March.I imagine the noise could be worse during the peak summer period.There are plastic flowers.The service can be bit hit and miss,eg the need to remnd the staff we had ordered tea.On the first two nights we returned to the room to find it had been tidied and the shutters on the windows closed but not on the final night.Lack of double glazing and inferior heating in the room meant it could be a bit chilly.But these are minor quibbles. Now thepositives. Overall, the location was great.After a night visiting Boom Chicago and Jazz Cafe Alto we able to walk back to the hotel in minutes.Whilst there was street noise it was not threatening and didn't make for too disturbed a night.The hotel is within 15 minutes walking distance of all major attractions.The staff are extremely friendly and are eager to please.We were offered afternoon tea each evening.Complimentary wine was always available.

This leads to the most important point.Without being twee,the hotel excels in giving you a feel for living in a genuine old canalside house.The minor flaws are worth having to be able to have this experience. If you want antiseptic perfection book into a large chain hotel which could be anywhere in the world. I think some people book and constantly think about the price during the stay.This can only cause them to over emphasise the defects.

Each previous time the rooms were superb, the service gracious, the location great, and we left wondering what more could you want from a small hotel/B&B? We wonder no more. We booked the room at the Top, which has a window facing the canal. It's a steep climb up the stairs, but the room was large and pleasantly decorated. I must, however, agree with the previous comment about the plastic flowers. At these prices, a few real flowers would have been nice. The bed is towards the front of the room, just underneath the window. Our first night was fine; we were tired from the flight over. We slept well. Breakfast was pleasant, but the service quirky as others have noted in their reviews. Little did we know, it appears since we last stayed there several years ago, that a rock and roll club had opened just across the canal. Bedlam was about to begin around 11pm, or was it midnight? It's tough to tell when you're woken from your sleep. Friday night was bad. It was loud, but we thought that it was part of staying in an active urban area. We voiced no complaint. Saturday night was awful. Dreadful. We had friends, from Germany, stay in one of the suites overlooking the canal. They were finally able to go to sleep sometime around 2 or 3 in the morning. We fared no better. It sounded as if the rock and roll club had thrown open its doors and the party was on the street, right outside the hotel. Firecrackers, drunken revelry, cars honking, bands playing, fights, screaming, etc. At this price, or at any price really, part of the implicit compact between a guest and the proprieter is that they'll do everything possible to provide a satisfactory and restful stay. Unfortuneately, this wasn't the case. We complained bitterly. No matter how charming the rooms, that's it's constantly held up as a shining example of how to run a small establishment, that it's a legendary hip hotel...none of that is worth the price we paid for not being able to sleep through the evening. The problem isn't going away till the rock and roll club closes. Do yourself a favor, ask about the club when making your reservation. If it's still open and you want to stay up till 2 or 3, grab a dozen beers, or roll a joint if that's more your style and join the party at the club or on the dancing in the streets.

We only saw one other couple in the hotel and had the elegant and snug lounge to ourselves late one evening with a lovely bottle of complementary wine and very nice snacks (without having to request them which is always nice) The hotel organised a restaurant for us and taxi's etc and we were impressed with the professionalism. The downsides to this room were minimal but considering the cost perhaps worth mentioning: Being so near the ground floor meant that we did hear the hotel phone ringing but it wasn't much of an issue. There was no air con and it was a bit too hot and stuffy which I imagine in Summer could be more of a problem. The bathroom was tired and certainly not luxurious but adequate. If this had been updated the room would have been fantastic. The staff were friendly and polite and breakfast in bed arrived on the dot and in a huge basket which was a lovely touch and also had delicious freshly squeezed orange juice. Something was always missing though, ie. no milk, no butter and on the last day 2 boiled eggs with no egg cups!! We did not eat downstairs as we just wanted to be pampered and lazy which was such a treat! These really are minor faults though and the overall experience is to be recommended.

The restoration of this old building/house was fantastic and the decorating. Like another person said, a welcome change from the sleek minimalist look of so many hotels trying to be so cool. We stayed in the Tolkein room which was as pretty as it seemed in the on-line photos however--- it was UNBEARABLY noisy. It was like being in someone else's house. Forget about relaxation. For some insane reason, in this humongous room, they decided to put the bed smack-dab next to the door that opens onto the main stairwell leading to all the rooms (no elevator). So you really felt like you were well aware of all your neighbors comings and goings including their conversations. You could even hear conversations that were taking place two flights down at the front desk at the bottom of the stairs. Worse than the stairs, was the fact that the staff/cleaning supply room/lounge was just a few steps down from our door. Starting at 7am, that door was literally opened and closed twice or more every five minutes on the average. You could not only hear the creaking of the hinges but also when it shut-- OVER and OVER and OVER... we would sleep during the five min intervals and had a horrible sleep each night. we were NOT there for business. We told the staff each night to please make sure that the morning person was informed to please be considerate and enter this room quietly. During a four day stay, we only got one hour's worth of their compliance to that request. We got the feeling that they thought we were inflexible which ticked us off all the more. Also, we found that the hotel staff was friendly but in many ways inept regarding their concierge services. For example, we called down one afternoon to ask them to call the restaurant they had booked for us for that evening and see if they could be called and the reservation pushed back a little later. The person at the desk (at all times there was only one person available or in sight) told us that he did not know which restaurant we had been booked at and he'd have to call his colleague at home to find out. Why was there not a general log of this stuff like a normal luxury hotel?? The breakfast was really nice and the atmosphere of the dining space super nice. All in all, it has a lot of charm, but I would never stay there again if I were going there to have a relaxing weekend. You'll be up at 7! A couple we met staying in a nearby room from New Orleans, had the exact same sentiments as we did- especially regarding the staff room door issue--and their bed was way away from their door!!

The price is far less important than the value I receive for what I pay. Seven one seven is a pretty hotel, well-located and discreet.

There were many lovely touches in the hotel. Complimentary wine and snacks brought to one's room, fragrant fresh flowers in the marble entry way, shelves full of interesting books at the patrons' disposal. However, I also feel as though the hotel is resting on the sublime reviews it has received. For example, in both our rooms (we stayed in the Tolkein the first night, Room at the Top the second), all the plants were fake. You would think that in a room that costs more than $600US/ night, in a city where a dozen cut tulips can be purchased for less than $10, they would try to avoid the plastic plant syndrome, or at least supplement the fake with a vase of simple flowers! The ceiling in our Room at the Top bathroom was badly stained and cracked (see attached photos). And sometimes the decorating felt just too excessive. Although I really appreciate a hotel that isn't slave to the current sleek and minimalist trends, most of the tables in the place were so covered with ralph-laurenesque tchochkes that I couldn't find space to set down my drink, and feared that I would knock over the collection of antique fountain pens, a painted plate, a fake plant... Most of the other guests seemed to be corporate types who used the salon or study in the evening to host business acquaintances. For these patrons, the price was probably worth it, since it has the air of a private club and having a few client 'round for a bottle of (complementary) wine in front of a lovely fire is better value than taking them out to a nice dinner.
