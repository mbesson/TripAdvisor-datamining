From Westlake Center you can walk to Pike Market, The Hardrock Cafe and The Original Starbucks. From the airport I took the light rail to Westlake and then took a cab, which was 1 1/2 miles and cost me $7. The hotel itself is very nice and clean. Staff were very nice and helpful.

The 3rd floor corner room (Western & Boren) was a little noisy with traffic at times, but like the other reviewer, I kept the fan on a lot to block it out. The other downside was that Housekeeping was not up to the usual Hilton standard. Once I needed to ask for face cloths & hand towels. Another time the garbage wasn't dumped.

The suites perfectly suited our group of 5 (2 rooms for us) which included everyone from a 10 year old to an 83 year old. The rooms were clean, spacious and well organized. The kitchen was extremely handy and the tuck shop downstairs sold all kinds of small grocery items incase you wanted to come home and heat up some soup or make mac 'n cheese in a pinch. The free breakfast was perfect for families with little kids. The hot food was not great (frozen/airplane quality) but the kids didn't mind. The grown-ups enjoyed the bagels and fruit. I would avoid Saturday and Sunday mornings though - it was a totel mosh pit. There wasn't enough staff to bus the tables so people were piling dirty plates etc. on empty tables, counters and even in the Lobby area. I had to knock on the kitchen door and track someone down when the milk pitchers were all empty and I saw an elderly lady slip on some spilled yoghurt on the floor. The other days of the week were fine, though. The location is perfect - just a 10 block walk to Pike's Market (for those who can do it - easy downhill on the way there but difficult and uphill on the way back) and the centre of it all. Our problem was that their website (as well as this one) touted a free all day shuttle to and from the Market area for hotel guests. This was the specific reason we booked at this hotel. With an 83 year old in our group the walk back to the Hotel was impossible. Luckily due to the proximity to the Market, the cab rides (2 cabs needed) was not too expensive - but the inconvenience of waiting for a cab at the waterfront for over an hour each time with a line-up of typically over 50 people was WAY too annoying. At least with a shuttle you could plan your day a bit. When we asked the staff about the shuttle, the staff apologized and said it had ended just the week before. When I told them it was the main reason we booked there they offered no alternate solution other than cabs at our own cost. The staff was friendly but seemed very overworked. One night we were trying to reach the front desk to ask a quick question (the only time in 5 days) and tried for over an hour, letting the phone ring sometimes 20 times. We eventually gave up.

I liked that it was off the beaten path a little bit but still considered \"downtown\" as we are not much for city noise. Our room was one of the two-bedroom king suites and I am glad we spent the short money to get the extra space. All of the two bedroom king suites are located on the back side of the building overlooking a quiet side street (and away from the trains - yea, or the views - rats). We had plenty of space for our two teenagers (opposite genders and needing their own beds!) - a king for us, a full or double bed for one kid and a pullout full or double couch for the other kid. The bathroom was very nice and large, the kitchenette was very small but adequate. One thing I was not prepared for in Seattle was the hills! It reminded me of San Francisco! So, even if you think it is a quick walk somewhere, it could be a half mile straight uphill. For that reason, we kept our car and parked it overnight in the locked parking garage for a mere $15 per night...cheap compared to most \"downtown\" places. Although I suppose you could walk to Pike's Place, it would be a REALLY long walk, so we ended up trying our hand at the bus that stops right out front of the hotel every half hour (during the middle of the day). The Space Needle was walkable, though...just uphill and a surprising challenge as a result. Thanks to Trip Advisor, I was prepared for the yummy full breakfasts and weekday dinners. The breakfasts were huge and hot and we were so glad they were included every morning. My husband and son ate a meatloaf dinner one night, and I think they enjoyed it.

Be very careful when exiting the lower level garage if your car is low to the ground or else the car will scrape and drag! The pillows are way too soft and the bed is very uncomfortable... too hard.

We walked several times to restaurants (despite the hilly streets nearby), simply because we were concerned that there wouldn't be sufficient parking space in the garage upon our return. Since we were paying for garage parking, we did not want to park our car on the street. There is a Safeway grocery store only a few blocks away if one is looking to purchase food items for use in the room. Incidentally, although most kitchen items were present, there were no paper towels in the room... which was a bit odd and unlike other Homewood Suites. Most Homewood Suites are much more spacious. This looks as if it may have been an older Homewood Suites or perhaps even another chain originally, that was converted. It's laid out very much like the old style Embassy Suites, but without an atrium.

We spent a few days in Vancouver then we took Amtrak to Seattle to spend a few days there. We booked a \"King Bayview\" suite at this Homewood Suites property (for which we paid more than a regular suite). We chose this property over another, less expensive, hotel near by because of the \"bay view.\" We arrived at the hotel around 11:30AM and were told there was one room available. It was on the first floor. I asked if it had a bay view. The young lady told me it didn't. I told her that we had booked, and paid extra for, a suite with a bay view. She said none were \"ready,\" but we could stow our luggage and one would be ready when we returned. Since check in time isn't until 3PM, this was understandable so my wife and I left our luggage and went to see Seattle. We returned later and were told we had a choice of 2 rooms. One was a large room on the first floor but had a lot of street noise. The other was on the second floor towards the back of the property and quieter. I asked if either had a bay view and was told no. I told the gentleman that I had reserved a \"bayview\" room and paid extra for it, and that's what I would like. He told me that there weren't any bay view rooms available but \"that's ok because they cost the same as the regular room.\" (Not true according to the website I booked through.) After arguing with the gentelman for a while, we decided to take the quieter room and sort things out in the morning. When I opened the door to our \"suite,\" it looked like 2 caves connected by a hallway. The rooms were cramped and dark. They looked nothing like the bright, spacious rooms on the website. As far as being quieter, well I guess that's relative. There's a train track about a hundred yards away. Yes, you can hear them when they go past along with the parking lot noise that's just outside the window. I called the front desk and told the young lady who answered that the room was unacceptable as it was not what we had booked. I asked to speak with the GM. Was told he was gone for the day. I asked to speak with a manager. I was told they were out. I asked if they didn't have a manager on duty. I was told that the gentleman who checked us in was the manager on duty. Didn't think speaking with him further would be helpful. My wife and I decided to end our vacation early and return home the next day. When I told the manager on duty of our decision his reply was, \"ok.\" Seems like he didn't care that they had ruined the rest of our trip. I did email the GM of the property and the coporate customer care. Coporate customer care emailed back that they give the property management 3 days to reply. I did get a call from the GM who apologized for the trouble we encountered and said he would look into it. He also told me that the \"bayview\" rooms were not priced higher. He said originally there was nothing across the road from the hotel so all the rooms on the front of the hotel had a bay view. In the ensuing years, the other side of the road has been built up blocking the views from the lower floors. He said they still refer to them as \"bayview\" rooms because there \"older clients\" know that means the front of the hotel. I advised him that such advertising was misleading at best. I forwarded an email outlining this misleading advertising to corporate customer care. They haven't responded as of yet.

Living Space: It is a huge room, which offers a sleeper sofa, coffee table, flat-screen TV, and a small table and chairs. The colors and d\u00c3\u00a9cor are simple and are of the typical hotel style. Upon first glance it looks clean but with a closer look at the TV and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dresser/stand it all needed a good dusting. Bedroom: With the bedbug scare going around I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste any time doing a search with the bed. We rolled back the comforter, looked at the linens and pillows, and examined everything for small black specs. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything however maybe I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to look for yet. But in the meantime after examining the headboard and nightstands we found them covered in dust. And we all know dust contains dust mites and other human skin. Yuck! Housekeeping is doing a quick job and not being thorough. See pictures that document our observation. Bathroom: The bathroom seemed clean upon first glance, but it did not pass my washcloth test. I took a washcloth and soaked it with hot water and some soap. After wiping the floor in front of the toilet for just a little bit the washcloth turned black. *See photos. We initially thought the floor had been mopped because the tile grout was darker in the center of the floor and the cleaning service simply did not mop to the edges. Well, it never got lighter so that means it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wet and it was simply very dirty. We noticed with the toilet that when you held the handle to flush you needed to hold the handle longer than usual and it needed to be flushed twice. The water pressure must be very low. An area of the bathroom that seems to be missed way too often and shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be is the inside of the door. I saw filthy, smear marks left from someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands and fingers. If someone is leaving a bathroom with unclean hands I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to even imagine why they are dirty. This is a sanitary issue that really needs to be addressed with the house cleaning service. Kitchen space: The small kitchen unit is a great bonus for any extended stay where you can fix some of your own snacks. There was a refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher and a few dishes and utensils. It seemed clean at that angle, however, the floor had that darkened grout in the more central section and then the grout was light and clean closer to the wall. Again, I did my washcloth test and found the floor to be filthy! *See photos. Continental Breakfast & Dining Room: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Homewood Sweets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has new meaning here. The Continental Breakfast is a deal if you are not picky and not concerned about having a sugar overload. We had breakfast there for a couple of different mornings. A few good choices included wheat bread, low-fat cream cheese, fresh fruit and water. I also tried the sausage patties, scrambled eggs and an omelet with cheddar cheese. The patty was cold, the eggs tasted fake and the cheddar cheese in the omelet was horrible. The food warmers were barely keeping the food luke-warm. It would be nice if the plates were warmed to keep the food warm just a little longer. For some healthy options it would be nice if the hotel offered low-fat cottage cheese for those of us that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to eat meat or fake eggs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great mixed with the fresh fruit. The juice offered was orange and apple, which are heavy with sugar. Cranberry juice could be offered for those patrons that would like to cut sugar calories. There were assorted muffins but none were a dark healthy grain option. Cereals offered were also heavy with sugar. Coffee was offered around the clock and was fine for swigging down that high-sugar overload. But, for those Latte lovers it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t substitute and you will have to go on a hike to get your fix. We would highly recommend a bottle of hand sanitizer at the coffee bar and a sign to suggest using it. Some people do not wash their hands. Some people eat with their hands and then return for a coffee refill. Everyone is touching the coffee pumps, cups, straws and counter. The garbage can should have an open top that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to touch. Hand sanitizer is good, please use it everywhere! The tables and chairs seemed clean and taken care of. The staff was on top of that and kept everything organized. It was a large dining room ready for a large crowd. The upholstered over-sized chairs around the tables at the windows are great for those over-sized sugar lovers. However if you are of a healthy, normal size you will sink in and feel like a toddler because your feet can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch the floor. So they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not that comfortable and hard to get out of. Some normal-sized upholstered chairs by the windows would be nice and be more practical. They would also fit around the tables better. View & Location: Location is great with its proximity fairly close to the water, park and the walking and biking trails. As well, the walking distance is convenient to the boardwalk, piers, great restaurants and the Seattle Center. Nice Bonus: Small store next to front desk is nice for small toiletries and goodies to eat.

And housekeeping missed a day - so we needed to call them in the evening for fresh towels, toiletries, etc. To be fair, they responded promptly, but it felt that the organisation of the hotel was a bit haphazard.

The suite was quite large - a room containing a sofa, chair and small dining table with 2 chairs plus a TV, seperated from a King sized bedroom by the kitchenette and bathroom. The sofa converted into a reasonably comfortable bed for a 17 year old boy (or maybe two smaller children) but I don't think 2 adults would have been comfortable on it. This 'inner' room was quite dark and with greeny/brown furnishings needed constant electric light. The bathroom was roomy; the kitchenette was just about functional - hob, 'fridge, sink, microwave with a couple of saucepans and some basic kiitchen tools - okay for a few snacks but not really upto a proper meal.

A note about what we learned about the shuttle, since you'll have to do surgery to extract the information from the desk staff: it's $5/pp and although they ask you to sign up for a time on a clipboard kept by the front desk, get there early. Our driver was waiting for us a half hour before our scheduled departure time, and although he had originally told me he wasn't waiting for a party by our name when I asked him, about fifteen minutes later he loaded in another family and then called for us. I hate to imagine what we would have felt like if we had gone downstairs at the arranged time only to discover that the shuttle had already left. And yes, using a shuttle or taxi is a good idea - the distance to the pier is just far and not linear enough that trying to walk it with a lot of luggage (and don't forget it rains a lot in Seattle) could get very uncomfortable. Back to the hotel. Both the public spaces and the rooms were not up to the usual Hilton standard of cleanliness. There is quite an extensive spread for breakfast (it was nice to see a hotel include a free breakfast with some substance since most don't anymore) but seeing the number of flies buzzing around the dining area after the meal was over was just gross. When we got back to our room at 5:00 in the afternoon and found that it hadn't yet been changed, my husband got an earful of nastiness when he flagged down a cleaning person and asked him when he was going to get to our room. It turns out that we didn't gain much by asking him to come in: he didn't even fully make the bed (he just straightened the sheets a little) and he didn't replace any of the items (coffee, soap, etc.) that we had used. On top of that, in a city that is probably more environmentally responsible than most in our country, I was shocked that he put a grand total of four glasses in the dishwasher and ran it on a full cycle. If you're looking to travel to Seattle on your HHonors points and this is the only hotel available with them, my advice is to hang onto your points for another trip and just stay at one of the many wonderful boutique hotels and inns that Seattle offers instead.", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay at this Property\u201d", "Author": "caneshockey31", "ReviewID": "UR17039206", "Content": "Okay, first of all let me clarify there isn't jackhammering going on at this hotel now, we stayed here in mid-June 2008 and had a great stay.

The hotel is a 30-35 minute walk to Pike Place Market & 10-15 to the Waterfront. The breakfast area was more like a college eating session than anything. Very busy and crowded and if you don't get there in time might not get everything that was available when breakfast started. The Managers Receptions were nice and complementary wine & beer was available. The hotel has no pool for those who like to swim during their stay but does have a 24 hour fitness center and there are plenty of hills around the hotel to walk and jog as well. Some comments: Front Desk staff were very friendly & helpful The hotel is the closest of all the Hilton Properties to the waterfront The rooms are in good shape, but the bathrooms are small in comparsion to other Hilton Hotels & the sort that i've stayed at. The internet service stinks in the room even though they tought to have this service that is 50 times faster than usual service. It is more like 50 times slower, 5 mins just to get loaded onto AOL fro m the room, but from the 24 hour business center it took about 10 seconds. A good hotel & I would stay here again.

Check in was easy and we got to request a room on the top floor with a bay view earlier then the check-in time since we got there about 2 hours early. Check-in is at 3pm. We got a good rate on a King Bay view room with a kitchenette. The room was nice and big. There was a sitting room with tv. then the kitchen and bathroom. And, then you walked into the King room with a big window. The bed was super comfy! At first, we didn't think the neighborhood was very nice. It seemed a little ghetto as we drove down Western Avenue. But, we never walked down that way, we always walked up towards the Space Needle that was a short walk away. It was a nice walk too. The Queen Anne neighborhood just 2 blocks away was cute. There is a nice bar called Buckley's that we went to twice and it was enjoyable. It was very low key. We didn't walk to the market since it was a little too far to walk. It was only a mile or so but with some small hills on the way it wasn't our cup of tea. Instead we went to the Space Needle area and took the Monorail down to the Mall on 5th and walked 4 blocks to the market. It cost $4 round trip or $2 one-way. The free breakfast was great the next morning. They had a big buffet area and big seating room with dining tables. What was also nice was that they included free starbucks coffee packets in the rooms, and free popcorn. The only thing that sucked was no windows to open for fresh air and no fan in the bathroom. Kinda weird but I assumed they want to prevent smoking? Well, the toilet was clogged and they didn't have plungers in the bathroom so we had to have someone come up and plunge the toilet and replace the flusher. It wasn't too bad though, they were quick about it. The staff was nice. They had a suite shop in the lobby with snacks and beverages as well as souveniers to buy. I got a picture frame of $9 vs. $15 at a Seattle shop downtown. Go figure! They also provid toothbrushes and toothpaste for free if forgotten, which we did. The only thing I didn't like was that they charge $15 per car to park in their parking garage. I thought this was tacky. There was a parking lot adjacent that cost $5 to park until midnight all day on the weekends. But, we just paid the $15 to move our cars inside at night so they would be safe.
