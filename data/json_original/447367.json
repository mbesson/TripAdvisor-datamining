{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good and clean but no English spoken The good: The hotel is in a great location and withing walking distance to the Forbidden City and some other sights in this hisrotic district. The rooms were comfortable and clean, really good value.The bad: Hotel staff speak zero English. Breakfast is only Chinese breakfast. The process at the hotel is a bit confusing (make sure you keep those pink receipts they give when you pay, you need them to check out!) and staff weren't overly friendly. Internet is expensive and slow.", "Date": "Oct 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR229864204", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Melbourne123"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d447367-r5947853-Nei_Meng_Gu_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "447367", "Price": "$108"}}
