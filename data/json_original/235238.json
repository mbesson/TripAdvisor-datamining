Housekeeping alerted Whatever/Whenever, and they sent up several selections of tea and a nice note wishing me a speedy recovery. Classy! I had an excellent corner view facing the Hudson River which was recommended by the staff as a better location for business travelers who required quiet time for working. I initially questioned this recommendation, but it was spot on. Times Square is directly outside the door of the hotel, which to be properly enjoyed, should be done from the street not from the hotel window!

To start with I will give you a quick overview of the room then the hotel in general and finishing on the service we received, so here goes (this could be a long one); Room: We had a fantastic suite situated on the 53rd floor with views of times square and a view up Broadway towards the park. The views from this high up were unbelievable, you get such an amazing view of the skyline. As Times Square is really busy you do get some noise of traffic and people down below but we did not find this a problem and come on, you are in NYC not an isolated beach location\u2026 The room itself was really clean when we arrived and cleaned daily to a high standard, towels were replaced, dishes taken and bed made daily, our cleaner did a fantastic job. As you enter the room from the hall way you come into a large living room with a HUGE corner sofa and massive flat screen TV, there is a desk with some stationary which looks straight out of the window right up Broadway and it almost made me want to do some work from this desk just to have that backdrop\u2026 almost\u2026. There is a closet and half bath in the living area as well and some drawers underneath the TV (I have read plenty of reviews saying that there is no drawer space, look harder as we found 4 drawers). The bedroom is through a separate doorway, the bed in here was the comfiest bed we had ever slept on and was just what you needed after a long day of shopping on 5th Ave, we had an iPod dock but didn\u2019t use this, there was another flat screen TV slightly smaller than the living room but still large. As we were on the corner we had a window on two sides of the room which gave us views from our bed of Broadway and out over times square, there is another desk area in here and a REALLY comfy lounge style chair. In the bedroom we also had a closet with a safety deposit box in which was large enough for us to store two laptops and iPads the room had plenty of wall sockets to charge electrical goods. Through a sliding door was our master bathroom which consisted of a large walk-in shower, basin and wc, the water pressure from the shower wasn\u2019t too strong but was fine it did the job. I have read reviews where people have said that the rooms are dark. Fair enough you do not have one main light which lights the room, but there were lamps situated around both the bedroom and living room, all of which give off adequate light. Hotel: The public areas of the hotel are really nice. When you come in through the front door you have a waterfall and water running over head which gives off a calming effect, you take the elevator up to the 7th floor to reach the lobby area which has a bar in there and is lit really cooly lots of purpley pink colours which gives off a fantastic vibe. Everywhere we went in the hotel had a really nice smell, which I did mean to ask what the scent was but I forgot. We had a drink at the bar on the first night, I think we paid $18 for a Corona and a sprite which is a little expensive but given that you are in Times Square and a really nice bar made up for the price. To use the elevator to the rooms you have to insert your card which we really liked, made you feel safer knowing that not just any random person can come up to the room floors. Service: Now this is the area that makes this hotel stand out head and shoulders above the rest. Any hotel can throw money at the d\u00e9cor and build really nice rooms but what money can\u2019t buy is the experience that their staff give you and help to build on your stay. As this was my wives birthday I did contact Patrick from the Whatever, Wherever team and he added some personal touches to our stay which really made my wives birthday one to remember, the service we received from Patrick was amazing I have never stayed in a hotel which offered such a personalised stay to meet your needs. I had also contacted Jarrod prior to arriving to get some ideas for a dinner reservation to celebrate the occasion and he not only suggested the Marea restaurant but which he had the knowledge and experience to know that this restaurant books up a month in advance so he took the liberty to reserve a table for us and by the way, his recommendation was great, the food, atmosphere and night were brilliant. We also went to the concierge desk (in the lobby area) to get some directions and Jarrod once again gave us a top notch service. The girls at check in and check out were all really nice and polite, as I had forgotten my SPG card she found my details on the system to make sure I got my points. In summary I cannot pick fault with the hotel, like I said above it is the service and experience you get from the staff at this hotel which make it my number one choice for New York and in fact out of the many hotels I have stayed in for leisure or business this has been my best experience. I just want to say thanks to Patrick and Jarrod for their help and advice sorting out surprises for my wife\u2019s birthday, you guys made our stay that extra bit more special.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cUnforgettable weekend!!\u201d", "Author": "Monica T", "ReviewID": "UR126519862", "Content": "I recently took my 8 year old daughter to visit New York City for the very first time.

Our meal at the hotel restaurant and our one evening of room service were both great. However, what set this hotel apart was the amazing service that we received throughout our stay.

The car service that the hotel provided to get us to our dinner reservation in the meat packing district was a complete bonus. On every level, the service was top notch. To top everything off, Patrick of the whatever/whenever went out of his way to make the weekend for me and, particularly my daughter, so memorable.

I chose the W because I have stayed at several (~15) W's worldwide and they are all pretty consistent, clean, comfortable, and trendy. Sometimes I think overall they try to hard but I appreciate that consistency and like that I don't have to leave the hotel to have a drink and socialize because the W bars are usually pretty fun and busy with travellers and locals. Overall I was very pleased with the W Times Square. As expected the rooms were well equipped, very comfortable beds, and good style. Surprisingly for a W in metropolitan area the room was actually quite large. I didn't feel cramped as you do in W Chicago City Center. Due to the unseasonal weather (75 degrees in mid-March) the first night I arrived my room on the 56th floor was pretty unbearable with heat. I called and a very nice maintenance man came up and tried to fix the problem. He did his best but I ended up having to sleep with the window open. The following night I had a fan brought up and it was still pretty hot. That next morning I was considering looking elsewhere for the remaining 5 nights of my trip but was very pleasantly surprised by an email from a rep from the concierge desk (Patrick A from \"Wherever Whenever\") checking in on me as he noted I had called for the same issue twice. He offered any assistance that I could think of and showed he truly was concerned for my enjoyment on the stay. That was enough for me, I very much appreciated him taking a few minutes to check in on me, and with the weather cooling off a bit there were no more issues. This great customer service has convinced me to try to stay with the property this time again upon my return in a few weeks. While it was pretty annoying that an expensive hotel couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adapt to the weather, this level of customer service made up for it . Now on to the \"above and beyond\". Patrick had asked if there was anything he could help me with while I was in town. I mentioned I wanted to get some discount tickets from the TKTS counter in times square but could not do the line as I was there for work. Over the next several days Patrick let me know he was seeing what they could do. To my surprise/amazement/delight he did better than helping me avoid the line to buy tickets - he provided me amazing seats to an amazing show (Jersey Boys). Even though the customer service already displayed made up for the slightly uncomfortable first nights, this was something that I won't ever forget and kicked the stay up from a very solid B+ to an unquestionable A. Beyond Patrick every employee I encountered had a smile on their face and was more than willing to help in anyway they could. The front desk clerk was surprisingly cheerful for dealing with the throngs of tourists and the taxi helpers were also very cordial and helpful. If you want to stay near Times Square you won't go wrong with the W. Good gym, very good restaurant on-property (BlueFin), and as I mentioned great service. I left the location ranking blank as that is all dependent on what you are after.

Here's where this W is getting a little tired. From the start, anyone could have guessed that the interior decor for this hotel had a short shelf-life. Even though the hotel is just over 10 years old, the decor looks 30 years old. The entry lobby's faux waterfall effect is still captivating, even though the mortar around all the stone and glass wall cladding is dirty and discolored - and for some reason, the space smells moldy and sour. The bar on the check-in lobby floor has no windows, and it looks like a druggy teenager's basement bedroom.

The rooms do not stand out for me. Room size is not impressive compared to other W properties in other cities and countries but I understand this is quite the norm for Manhattan hotels. Apart from the relatively small size of the room, I felt that the lighting of the room is a little too dim. It is probably an extension of the supposedly hip and loungy design of the hotel. Further, the walkway from the lift to the room is also dimly lit. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a little too gloomy with light grey walls and metal doors.

Needless to say, when we checked in at the W Times Square, we were blown away. \u00c2\u00a0Thanks to Patrick, we were upgraded to a beautiful corner suite on the 55th floor, 5511, \u00c2\u00a0with a great view of Times Square and the city (you could even clearly see central park from one of the windows) with a full living room a powder room and a large bathroom. \u00c2\u00a0The room was also decorated with rose petals which lead from the door to the bedroom, and in the bedroom, the bed was decorated with more rose petals and bliss chocolates in the shape of the number 15, along with handwritten card from Patrick wishing us well. \u00c2\u00a0Fantastic! \u00c2\u00a0Upon returning from our first night out, we were again surprised with a bottle of Prosecco and a note from Jenna from front desk- again fantastic! \u00c2\u00a0 In fact all the staff from front desk to the bellman and doormen to the Living Room Bar were always helpful, affable, easy to chat with, and got things done.\u00c2\u00a0 The hotel itself is still a unique and great property. \u00c2\u00a0From the cascading water on the glass walls and ceiling of the ground floor entrance lobby -a serene diversion from the frenetic vibe of Times Square-to the loungey atmosphere of the lobby and living room bar, to the great beds, super bliss products, cool contemporary design, fantastic views, central location, and seamless service, W Times Square can't be beat. \u00c2\u00a0The hotel has a great informal chill vibe - not too quiet, but not too crazy either- while still providing a sense of modern luxe. \u00c2\u00a0 Don't hesitate to stay here if you're thinking about it. \u00c2\u00a0You will not want to leave. Thanks to Jenna and Kelly at front desk,and especially to Patrick who made our stay memorable, incredible, and unforgettable. Some tips: \u00c2\u00a0If you have brunch at Bluefin, you get a free good cocktail (mimosa, etc) and get the lobster club or the lobster benedict - good food and great view of the action at street level on Times Square. \u00c2\u00a0Sit in the front room (the bar) for the view. The W Times Square has a great shop-W the Store-with some great cool stuff which may be hard to find - bought a great canvas backpack and cashmere scarf -make great souvenirs. For a view of Central Park go to Columbus circle and take the elevator up to the mandarin oriental and have a drink in the lobby bar-floor to ceiling windows and a fantastic view. \u00c2\u00a0 Carey car service was great for us - top of the line Escalade - took us from the hotel to a bar we wanted to go to one night, and to JFK when we were leaving for a great price - ask for Nancy. \u00c2\u00a0 If you're thinking of the Campbell Apartment at Grand Central \u00c2\u00a0Station for a fancy drink in old school style grand New York, give it a miss take a pic and don't stay- the place is very dark and snoozy with uncomfortable furniture- try Bemelmans at the Carlyle or the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Tjm100", "ReviewID": "UR125427395", "Content": "The Central location is great, easy for midtown, shopping and getting to restaurants.

I would certainly visit again. Just left the W Hotel following a 4 night break in New York and enjoyed every minute of it! As it was our first time in New York we had booked a Spectacular room as we wanted to soak up the views of the City however we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a Corner Room that overlooked Times Square on check in. The room was well decorated, the bathroom was stylish but above all the views were amazing. The location of the hotel also means that you really are in the heart of the city. All the staff at the hotel we bumped into were pleasent and professional. The concierge recommended some nice restaurants that were in keeping with the style and feel of the hotel and made us reservations. By the time we left the hotel we really did get the impression that \"Whatever Whenever\" was more than just a cheesy slogan; nothing seemed too much trouble. It was our first time at a 'W' brand hotel and it impressed. Patrick (whatever/whenever talent coach), seems to have the best job in the world - Making people happy. The smile on our faces when we got back to our room from watching the Lion King to find the soundtrack playing in the background was priceless. When there is very little to differentiate between hotels, it is the thoughtful little things like this which count and that's the reason I will be recommending the 'W' to family and friends. In the interest of providing a balanced review, the only really minor negatives were that the Corner Room has very limited storage space, this made storing lots of clothing, luggage etc a bit difficult especially if you want to keep the minimialistic style of the room (that said you will spend most of the time looking out the window and probably not notice the messy room!) Second, In a world where you can get free wi-fi internet with your morning coffee I still struggle to understand why large hotels continue to charge for the service. However the charge isn't extortionate should you require the internet for whatever reason and I believe it is free for premier members so those on business should be looked after.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amman, Jordan", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location.

It is close to all of the Broadway shows, as well as most of the off-Broadways. Decent dining options abound in the area, and they are all reachable on foot. The hotel is typically New York in style, trying to be young, modern and chic. It succeeds in some cases, but doesnt quite make the grade in others. The rooms are reasonably sized, perhaps a touch too small as is common in NYC. We found lighting to be a problem in some rooms, and had to change rooms as a result. Our first room had a single small recessed halogen light in the ceiling of the bathroom. You could barely see your hand in front of your face. No lighting in the shower or adjacent to the mirror. The second room was better, with reasonable lighting in the bathroom. The living area also suffered from a lack of sufficient lighting. We turned-on every light and kept the window fully open to take advantage of the daylight, but after sunset the room was dark and dreary due to the taupes and browns used decorate. The bathroom had a great rain-shower (no tub), and also had a cool frosted-glass wall which helped a bit with lighting. Sound proofing was good, and we had a quiet stay. The best thing by far was the exceptional bed. I had one of the best sleeps ever at the W. My wife was critical of the lack of closet space, which was almost fully used-up by winter coats.

First, he gave us a fantastic 50th floor King Suite upgrade - 2 bathrooms (good for 3 women!), gorgeous furnishings and to-die-for views of Times Square. He also gifted us tickets to a fashion show as part of Mercedes Benz Fashion Week - these are seats that cannot be bought - he just gave them to us! This kind of trip does not happen in real life. Patrick also went out of his way to create an amazing event for my 13 year old. He had a red carpet placed in the room, a disco ball and lights glowing and some other treats for Sara including a SmashBox makeup kit! Amazing, Patrick would not even allow us to show our appreciation. The overall service at the W was excellent. All staff were cheerful, professional and attentive. Patrick checked in regularly and offered additional helpful support throughout the weekend. I stay in hotels at about 200 nights per week. This is now my go-to property when in NY.

I put in a special request in advance to Patrick Amano, and he and the rest of the W staff far exceeded even my lofty expectations. How's this for a recipe in awesomeness: start with an amazing upgrade (the top-floor Extreme Wow Suite and the views were jaw-dropping, even for New York veterans like us), add a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, throw in some rose pedals lining the pathway to the bedroom, and top if off with a hand-written note and some personalized amenities in the room from Patrick. Needless to say, my wife was overwhelmed (as was I) with our experience. We had dinner next door at Blue Fin - ask for a table upstairs along the glass wall for a good mix of privacy and energy. The fish was great as was the service, and the live jazz complemented the mood and feel of the night. Since our stay was just one night, we didn't get to experience all that the W has to offer. But I can say without a doubt that should we get a chance to once again escape for a night and want a hotel that provides an oasis of cool in the madness that is Times Square, the W is the top of the list.

My good friend Jim McPartlin just relocated from W Hollywood to W Times square and i had to visit to see if he was already starting to do the wonders he did in Hollywood at his new stomping grounds... 1) Was upgraded even \"before\" i got to the hotel and the suite was awesome and very convenient as it was next to the elevator (no it is not as noisy or loud as you woul think) 2) Jims staff was on their A Game and this was even before anyone new that i knew Jim...the curb crew was in abundance and very helpful and informative and told you exactly where to go just in case you have never been to the hotel before so you didnt look lost trying to find the reception...and also whenever you walk out the door to leave the property you have 2 or 3 people askig if you need directions...need a cab...need a limo etc etc.... they are very concerned you have a great impression when you arrive and leave the hotel...even if it is to go next door to the deli.. 3) Girl at the recption was VERY helpful and cute as a button...she was from New Orleans and there was not a quiestion you could ask that she didnt have the answer to....once she pulled my profile up she was very effecient and courtesy...they were VERY informed as to my profile and preferences....they asked about my fiancee and what type of wine we would prefer..(she loves wine but i dont drink),, so i informed them i was traveling alone this time....they asked about my dogs (when we stay at the W Westwood my dogs are very popular with the staff)...once again i had to inform them i didnt bring them this trip..(they had a complete Doggie set up for 2 dogs already waiting in my suite...aaaawww...my dogs appreciated the pics i took and the thought that went into the gesture)...and they had a massive fruit basket for me and refilled it daily... 4) after i was cked in i was introduced to the Dir of Ops for the hotel as Jim was not due back in town till the next day and he was very helpful and gave me his card and personal # in case i needed \"anything\" while i was in town,., great guy... My room was fantastic...very quiet...and every nite they brought me an amenity to take the edge off the day.... the 1st nite it was pretzels shaped like a W with either cheese or spicy mustard...next day was large bottle of Sparkling water and a bowl of mixed berries...they didnt miss a thing :) Lobby was very Airy and very friendly...a bit loud at nite as it turns into a lobby club...DJ and lots and lots of beautiful people....great place to people watch.... ONLY downside...hotel is wired for Sprint..so i had VERY limited ATT service...when you are in the lobby during the daytime there are lots of people there makeing calls n texting as that is the only place \"in\" the hotel you will have good service... its kinda funny...i didnt feel so bad when i reliezed i wasnt the only one who was out of contact with the world.. finally saw Jim on my second day and he told me about all the changes that were upcoming and i will definately be back to give you all an update...there will be a BIG change to the lobby and lounge so it will be even more atrractive and user friendly than it already is...cant wait...next time though have to bring the missess as she is from south beach and loves a good lounge or club... BTW...only thing i can really even complain about was that when i finally was going to take a nap i realized that my bed was broken...lol...sssooo loud...i called down to whatever whenever and explained ...literally within 2 min's 2 guys from engineering were at my door and 5 mins's later all was fixed...didnt have to wait forever for anyone to respond to my concerns and were extremely effecient and quick.. also...room service... FANTASTIC...food is awesome and room service crew was very very polite and effecient...food tasted great and follow up phone call to make sure i had all i needed etc etc... bottom line is that if you are heading to NY...you might as well go to the best hotel in the city that gives you access to everything and anything you could possibly need to do or see with little or no inconvenience...and a fantastic people watching perch... go and enjoy....if you have any concerns or problems i am sure that the W and Jim himself will bend over backwards to make sure that you are left with an Ultimite W Experience I am sure now that the new GM is on location they will only get better than they already are (will be hard but i am sure somthing can be improved...lol) Enjoy Mike", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSemi Regular Guest\u201d", "Author": "R_Gaffney_UK", "ReviewID": "UR123259330", "Content": "I stay at this hotel every time I come on business to NYC from London which is about 5-6 times per year, a week every time.

Perfect room and very spacious for NYC. We could see Times Square from our room and watch Lady Gaga perform during the main event. The bed was very comfortable. I feel asleep in a matter of minutes, that doesn't usually happen to me. The concierge were always willing to help us and the doormen were polite no matter the time of day or night.

I wanted tom comment on the bathrooms since that seemed to upset some guests. The bathroom, I felt was large with great storage for my things. There is an opaque panel that you can see through, but unless you are brother and sister is doesn't really matter. I would come back to the W times square in a heartbeat.

We were comped a room here by another Starwood property when we arrived at that property to find that the room that we had reserved (not a specific room, but ANY room) was not available. This property lives up to its trendy marketing and those travelers looking for what is advertised will not be disappointed. Travelers requiring privacy in the bathroom should stay elsewhere. The bathroom walls are translucent glass and offer no privacy unless the bathroom is completely dark. There is no curtain or shade on the window walls and no obvious way to improvise with a sheet or blanket. So, plan on using the bathroom in the dark if you are a mixed sex two generation family that is used to privacy in the bathroom. Travelers with aging eyesight, i.e. anyone over 40, and/or with depth perception issues, should also look elsewhere. The walls, carpet, furniture and glass are all the same color gray. There are no visual clues to help you find your way around the room and through the the hotel. Plan on feeling lost and/or walking into walls, windows, and furniture. Travelers who prefer to avoid elevators should stay elsewhere. The lobby is on the 7th floor. There are no escalators and the stairs, I was told by the \"whatever\" desk, take you through the kitchens of the restaurant complex that occupies the floors below. There are only three elevators, so plan your time accordingly. Be sure to ask for your coffee maker when you check in. And check to be sure that the paper cups they send you with it fit under the drip spout. Otherwise, you will be without your first cup of coffee while you are waiting for an elevator to get you out of the funhouse. Or, you could ask in total exasperation for a comped pot of brewed coffee and a real cup to be delivered to your room. I got the coffee and cup quickly, but do not know yet how much, if anything, I paid for it. The speed with which the coffee was sent up is why I gave the W a 4 star rating for service. So, if a trendy bar and trendy decor are what you seek, by all means put the W on the top of your list.

I thought I could get away from him by traveling to New York, but nope there he is checking in right next to me at the W. I think he must live by me because I see him everywhere. Why can't I see someone like Clive Owen all the time? We checked in to the 49th Floor / Room 4902 - right outside the elevator. The guy at the front desk was pleasant enough. The room was very ordinary but for NY it was sufficient and comfortable. The views were nice. Then the problems began.... Mr. C went to use the restroom and first off you can see right through them, so hopefully you don't mind people watching you take a poo. I love him to death, but really this is not a wonderful experience. For the rest of the stay anytime he had to use the restroom he went to the lobby. Also, it would be nice to have the sink and shower separate because there were no mirrors to do my make up or hair while Mr. C took a shower. When looking at the toilet seat he noticed there was pee all over and then looked around the rest of the bathroom and it appeared to be very dirty as if it never had been cleaned. Disgusting! I am pretty easy going and know things happen, so we called to have it taken care of before we got back that night. Someone came right away to clean. We complained at the front desk and the woman was very apologetic and said she would give me 10,000 points for my trouble. Great. I am easy. I had forgotten something upstairs, so I went back up to get it and got to my room at the same time the woman who claimed to have cleaned the bathroom earlier had gotten there. Apparently she had gotten in trouble. I felt bad for her for about 2 seconds. She basically accused me of using the toilet and blaming her. She \"knows how she cleaned it and now it is a security issue.\" I just kept saying that I wasn't angry I just wanted it cleaned and we can go on our merry ways. No... she continued....ehhhh I decided to use the silent treatment before my anger turned on. No cleaning lady deserves the wrath of Marie - she has to clean disgusting hotel rooms for a living. She did end up apologizing, but it is a little late I am pissed. I began to just look at her and nod as I bolted for the door to get out of there. We were both standing there for the elevator in awkward silence and in my head I just kept repeating \"please don't get on my elevator. please don't get on my elevator *breath* she hit the up button. *Side note* My 10,000 points still have not posted. Honestly, I don't think our bathroom was ever fully cleaned through our whole 4 night stay. Concierge - My husband called down because we felt like getting some good Mexican food. He put him on hold and the phone went silent. My DH thought he hung up so he called back and the guy gave him a lot of attitude. He gave him a few places but when we looked them up they didn't look that great, so when we got downstairs we went over in hopes he forgot us. He didn't. At least he apologized for being rude. We ended up taking one of his suggestions and when we got there the place was closed, but in his defense it did look good and it took us a while to get there. Too bad. Speaking of being closed; the concierge also gave us directions to the Guggenheim. We went out there only to find it was closed every Thursday. Seriously - I don't expect the concierge to know everything but please know when a major museum is closed so I don't waste my time. Location - I wasn't a huge fan of the location. If it is your first time in NY you may like it. It is of course very touristy and there doesn't seem to be a lot of cool places to eat. If I end up staying at a W in New York again I think I am going to try Union Square. On 10/4 - they gave us what appeared to be our statement which I thought odd since we weren't checking out until the next day; it ended up being our neighbors. Shouldn't these be private. I basically saw how much he paid, what card he put it on and if he rented any movies. The good news is I got a better deal then him. Pros - 50% coupons for the bar As a Starwood Gold Member they gave us a late check out (4pm) which was very helpful. They renewed our Bliss products every day, so I was able to load up on them.

The hotel is situated directly on Times Square, unlike many area hotels that make the same claim, but are actually located a few blocks away. I usually stay at hotels in SoHo or other neighborhoods that aren't so busy, but my Midwestern friend wanted to be in the heart of the Big Apple. His wish was granted. <grin> Overall, my stay was good. I requested a higher floor with nice views and my expectations were met. The size of the room was typical for Manhattan - no room for even a chair but enough space for our belongings. When I needed various items (silverware, extra towels, etc.), the housemen delivered them in a timely manner. The positive and negative aspects of the hotel (IMHO) are the following: Positive 1) I loved the decor (especially the ground floor waterfall) and high energy music. Stepping off the elevator Saturday night and hearing \"No Diggity\" (don't laugh!) blaring in the popular lobby bar got me ready for a night out on the town. If you're looking for Ritz-Carlton decor and Wilson Phillips/Enya/John Tesh songs playing softly in the lobby, this ain't the place for you. 2) The views, if you're in staying in certain rooms, are spectacular; especially if you're still a small-town boy/girl at heart and love seeing \"big buildings\". 3) If you want to see one of the countless Broadway shows in the surrounding area, you can't beat the location, natch. 4) The complimentary ride (minus gratuity) to Penn Station in the hotel's Acura was greatly appreciated. 5) The bellman who assisted us upon arrival was very friendly and didn't seem to pressure us for a tip. We still gave him one, of course. Negative 1) Minus the aforementioned housemen and bellman, most staff I encountered were aloof and rarely made eye contact. (example: upon arrival, a doorman grabbed one of our bags from the taxi; my $5 tip didn't even result in a simple \"thank you\" or smile) Maybe it's the hipness factor of where they work, but still, your main responsibility is to make sure each guest feels welcomed. 2) If you're sharing a room, I hope you're comfortable with him or her seeing the blurred details of you stepping out of the shower or answering nature's call. The sliding door wasn't really an issue, but the blurred \"glass\" wall-like partition led to a bathroom lights-off policy when one of us needed some privacy. 3) This isn't the hotel's fault, mind you, but if you want access to nearby affordable restaurants and convenience stores, this is probably not the best place for you. (examples: a pack of cigarettes at a Times Square retailer is $4 more than a nearby store; the Times Square locations of Olive Garden and TGI Friday's, places I wouldn't frequent anyway, mark up their food by nearly 50%) Despite the staff and exhibitionist-friendly bathroom, I recommend this hotel for first-time visitors to NYC or theatergoers. I'll probably choose the nearby Westin or Chatwal hotels on my next trip though.

The pros: Right on Broadway in Times Square, easy walking distance to all Broadway theaters, close to ALL subway lines. Rooms are modern, comfortable and large by New York standards. The hotel has the typical swanky W vibe that makes you feel like a movie star, if only for a weekend. Beds are comfortable, bathrooms have ample space (shower only, no tub), and there's a really cool chaise lounge right by the window to take in the Times Square views. Bonus - there's a nice Starbucks directly across the street from the front door (important to me!). It's a very busy one, but you can get your fix close by, nonetheless.

The worst part of the blackout was the way it was handled. Although we complained to reception, no apology was ever given, and there was no compensation at all. A few days later we received a note under the door saying there was some construction happening to the building and they apologised for any noise that may occur. They should have at least done something similar to apologise for the power outage. And have accompanied that with some compensation. We met other guests in the ensuing days all of whom confirmed that they had not received any apology or compensation and were also angry and disappointed. 3. Housekeeping: apart front leaving us toiletry products used by other people as described above, other aspects of housekeeping were hit and miss. eg, there is meant to be a nightly turn down service. But a few nights this just didn't happen. 4. The door men/women: they seem to hang out in groups of 2 or 3 at the front of the building talking to one another but never greeting guests. It's like a little gang meeting at the front of the building and they can look quite intimidating. One night I recall some of them meeting up with friends (at least people not in uniform) and talking loudly at the door so the \"gang\" looked even bigger and more intimidating. During our entire extended stay not once did we receive a polite greeting. 5. Little things you might expect from a hotel with the reputation (& cost) of the W just don't exist - like shower caps, or the ability to have your mini bar cleared at no extra cost so you can use the fridge for other things. 6. Check-out: at checkout, we had resolved to say something again at the poor way the blackout was handled. Whilst the check-out clerk asked the 2 guests in front of us \"how was your stay\" when it came to us he did not bother at all! He just told us our bill was settled, gave us a receipt, and that was that. This really made us feel less important than other guests. We started to walk away, but after everything we just needed to get it off our chest. So we turned around and told him how disappointed we were at how the blackout was handled. He then told us that guests had received a complimentary breakfast as compensation. We were shocked as this compensation had never been offered to us (or other guests we had encountered) despite us complaining earlier. It was like one last cruel joke on us. He then said sorry but there was nothing he could do to make it up to us now. OVERALL: very disappointing, especially when we paid over $500 per night. We really expected more. We would discourage anyone from staying at the W Times Square, and would not stay there again.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cHotel gets by on its name and location only\u201d", "Author": "yippee1999", "ReviewID": "UR120379043", "Content": "I never ever stay in hotels when I travel. I always stay in pensiones or B&Bs or similar. Hotels are a huge ripoff and impersonal. And so I was once again reminded of this fact when I recently stayed at the W in Times Square, only because my sister was staying there on business. I live in NYC and so after a night out with my visiting sister, I stayed at her hotel for the night. First off, this hotel is a bit high on the \"hip\" factor (though I'm sure there are other hotels that try even harder). They've got the big 'bouncer' type guys out front, the house music playing in the elevators, the attempt at a minimalist lobby and check-in desk. And then in order to get to the elevators for the rooms, you have to pass by their lounge/bar area, which they try to make seem like a 'club'. As for the rooms, I understand that my sister's room was about $500/night. The bathroom was 'nice'...nothing extraordinary. As for the living area/bedroom, it was downright cheap looking. A poor attempt was clearly made at trying to look minimalist and modern, but to the discerning eye it was clear that everything was very cheap...the tables, the lights, the desk... The only good thing about this hotel is the central location. But for less than half the price, you could stay in an equally nice B&B in Manhattan or one of the other boroughs, and have a much more personal experience. I'll just never understand why people pay such outrageous amounts of money to stay in a sterile hotel, where all they do is essentially sleep there.

We stayed from Friday to Sunday and we were in NY for business and some shopping. We had originally planned to fly back home on Sat night but there was a freak snow storm (in October!!!) in NY and our flight was cancelled so we had to book another night here. The W is somewhat of a commodity and known as a destination in its own right. It's a famous hotel yes and being situated right in the heart of times square, it is a very busy place. And also since it was a weekend, you can only imagine how busy this hotel was. I was actually a little disappointed with the crowd at this hotel. There was a lot of families and lots of big travel groups which caused long line ups and noise in the lobby. We got in the city early and tried to see if they would let us check in early but the rooms weren't ready so we had to wait about 4 hours until 3pm to check in. And then of course at 3pm, bus load full of tourists arrived with their giant bags and large groups causing massive line ups and delays. The room was fine. Everyone says it's really small on travel advisor but it's New York. It really doesn't get much bigger than this. I thought the size of the room (i think i stayed in a fabulous room) was ample for two people although yes, the bathroom is a little tight. I found the room to be clean, modern and comfortable to stay in. The rooms do get all the street noise (I was on the 28th floor) but again, it's right at the heart of times square, it's expected and it's really not the hotel's fault. The staff at this W was great. My hair dryer was not working and when I called to have a replacement, there was someone at the door within 3 minutes which was impressive because the hotel was at max. occupancy this weekend. The concierge and everyone else from the door staff to maintenance staff were all wonderful. Everyone always held the elevator door open for you, they always said hello, the door staff were always more than willing to carry your bag and hail a cab for you. It was very pleasant to interact with everyone who works there. My true review is really a 3.5. But the staff really makes it a 4 I guess. Although modern, the hotel is starting to look a little tired... especially the bathroom (the lobby bathroom and the room bathrooms), also I thought the bar was really not all that great but the drinks were very over priced. (also the bottle of water in the room was 9 dollars). I think that for the same price, you can probably stay at a better boutique hotel. If you like modern boutique hotels, there are so many other options at a better price.

The one thing I hate about this hotel, which I assume is the reason many people choose it, is the location. You walk out the front door and you are immediately in the middle of the the awful mess they call Times Square. It is loud, bright, smelly and everything about the US that I hate. Commercialism run afoul. You walk ten steps from the front door of the hotel and who knows what you might find...a hooker doing business, a transient begging for a smoke from you, or god knows what else or who else.

I needed a cab to the airport and first the bellman tried to get me to take a limousine. I declined after hearing the cost and insisted on getting a yellow cab. The bellman kept letting other cabbies go until a certain cabbie that knew him came by. The cabbie shook his hand and clearly gave him cash. That does not bother me. What bothers me is that when I got to LaGuardia, the cabbie asked me for $45. I asked to see the meter and it was just on $45 but not on. He insisted that it was a flat fee to LaGuardia. I know better as I grew up in Harlem and now as an attorney, travel to NYC all the time. I told him as much and he insisted I was wrong. Only when I told him that I was getting a police officer did he rush me out of the cab, accepting $30. I notified the W because clearly the bellman was in cahoots with this cabbie and an incident, like this one, sullies the W's reputation as the collusion was blatantly obvious. Within an hour I had a response from Patrick Armano at the W. He apologized for my experience and noting that I would be returning for another full week later in the month offered to upgrade the room to a suite. I told him that my wife would be traveling with me for the first few days. When I arrived at the W, we had been upgraded to a gorgeous suite and there was a bottle of champagne in the room for us.

We had been given a gift certificate and we decided on the Times Square W because of the location. We arrived at 3:30 on Friday and were told that our room was not ready even though it said that check-in was at 3:00. The receptionist told us that they would call us on our cell phone when the room was ready. I asked if it would be 15 minutes or 2 hours. She said she did not know. We proceeded outside even though the temperature was 101 in NYC. Finally after not hearing anything we returned to the hotel at 5:10 and were told that the room was ready and had been. We never had received a phonecall to alert us and they were sorry about that. When I had made the reservation I was advised to ask for a room on a lower floor since we had upgraded to a \"cool corner\" room. We were given room 3401...EECK. Once you exited the elevator bank our room was 3 feet straight ahead. The room was lovely and the view down to Times Square was nice if you leaned way over the counter. We left at 6:00 for a dinner engagment and returned at 11:30 after a show. When we returned there was a cheese tray and white wine in the room. The wine was in warm water and the cheese obviously had been sitting there for HOURS!!! All night long we heard everyone that got on and off the elevator. Finally I got up and asked a group of people to please move. That was at 3:30 am. Since I was up all night I decided to confront them at the front desk about the entire experience: not being alerted our room was ready and having us outside for that duration, the cheese and wine and the floor that we had not wanted. The front desk was very apologetic and knew the person that had not alerted us and assigned us the wrong room. I requested that the cheese and wine NOT be charged to our children who had sent it to us . It was suppose to be in our room when we checked in at 3:00 but it had in fact arrived sometime after 6:00 and sat there. We were given Starwood points to make up for all the inconvenience and I really did think that was considerate of them. I told them that we would try to return another time so that we could eliminate this bad experience from our mind. We had never stayed at a Westin before and would not have hurried to return based on our initial experience. The attached restaurant served a fabulous breakfast.

Bathroom is one of the weirdest things I have ever seen. Separated from the room by a sliding 'plastic' type door. Whole thing is like a giant plastic cube. Our daughter just LOVED it - great view, great ambiance (for a youngster like her,) but hubby and I agreed, we're happier at the Doubletree where it feels like home.

I also requested that craft paper be taped to the glass bathroom walls and doors (at their suggestion, after reading reviews on TripAdvisor about this weird, unappealing design) to insure our privacy.

Upon arrival, the front desk clerk was extremely abrupt and rude. I asked a couple of questions about the hotel but she was clearly not interested in answering them. When we got to our room, there were no chocolate-covered strawberries, no extra towels, and no craft paper on the bathroom walls. After 30 minutes of waiting, I finally called the Concierge and inquired about the chocolate-covered strawberries - my daughter heard the whole conversation, which completely ruined the surprise. I was told that there was no request for any \"amenities\" on my reservation. I informed the Concierge that I was holding all of my e-mail correspondence with hotel management which clearly stated my requests, their responses, and management confirmations. About 15 minutes later, the strawberries finally arrived. The lining of the bath robe that was supplied in the room was completely torn and, no surprise, when we arrived back at our room at 11pm that evening, no turn down service or extra towels. I called the Whatever/Whenever desk to complain (again) and was told (again) that there was no indication of any \"special requests\" on my reservation. I repeated that I was holding a printed confirmation with my reservation information and the special requests were clearly there. The craft paper was finally installed on the bathroom walls while we were gone. The hotel lightening is very dark, so much so that it is difficult to see the buttons in the elevator.

After this stay, I wished I had booked the cheaper Tuscany or Courtyard, because unfortunately this W is just a disappointment. Check-in was where the disappointment began, with the typical 100mph New York whirlwind. Staff were in such a rush to get onto other things and other customers, there was no personal touch. We were given a room on the 34th floor and told we had been \"upgraded\". The room was poor. Considering the amount this W costs a night, it was dingy, tired and small. We immediately returned to the reception to have the room changed. At this point we were told that we hadn't been upgraded and that another \"upgraded\" room was given to us. This was a corner room on the 43rd floor (4301). This was a better room, but considering, again, the cost of these rooms it still wasn't \"wow\". We asked the concierge during our stay for some help with which gate to use at Port Authority bus terminal for a trip to Six Flags Great Adventure. Utterly useless. We knew more than she did. Having taken the bus before we explained that we knew the bus went from Port Authority and it was a NJ Transit bus. She simply didn't listen to what we were saying because moments later she said the bus went from Penn Station and was a Grey-something bus. We explained again this wasn't the case, at which point she gave up. Not very \"whatever/whenever\" is it? She was far too eager to get rid of us than help and this unfortunately was the impression we got from all the staff. We had some billing issues, with the incidental card being charged for the room, despite explicit instructions not to do so. Paying in travellers cheques also seemed to be a fight. Staff need to not pull a grimace when someone doesn't wish to pay by credit card. We visit New York a lot for British travellers and despite my loyalty to the Starwood group (Westin, W, Aloft etc.), I won't stay at this particular W again.

I didn't like the semi-private glass enclosed bathrooms, so unless you're comfortable with seeing the silhouette of your rooming partner taking a shower, or going to the bathroom - this could be an awkward moment for the both of you! Upon checkout our hotel room was charged an extra $9.18 for incidental charges that upon further inquiry was for the snacks located in the hotel room. The problem was though, that we never took anything! I promptly called the hotel who said they would refund the charge, but this was completely unnecessary. We didn't even open it up to look inside - yet we were charged. Strange. On our last morning at the hotel as well, they appeared to be doing construction or repairs either on our floor or quite near to it as we were awoken numerous times in the morning from the noises of power tools and banging which was quite unpleasant. This was not disclosed to us though at all. As a Travel Agent, I would likely not recommend this property to many until they focus more on their guest experience approach.

We have been lucky enough to have visited New York on a few occassions and I can advise that the rooms are generously sized by NYC standards and that the beds offered a great nights sleep. We were located on the 56th floor in one of the 'Spectacular Rooms' which is quite a height up from the the chaos of Times Square and with the exception of the occassional siren during the night we could hear little of the noise below. Our room was spotless (with one little issue that I'll get to later) and modernly fitted out. The bathroom was well apportioned and while the shower was not overly powerful it provided a more than adequate level of water pressure. The Bliss bathroom products are a very nice touch. As our flight home was late evening, and having made the most of the beautiful NY sunshine, we were looking to freshen up before departing and reception kindly organised access to the fitness suite on the 10th Floor where we managed to shower and change before transferring to the airport. A couple of very minor points on the rooms - while storage in the rooms is pretty good a couple of extra drawers would help enormously. Secondly we did find a piece of a previous occupants underwear under the chaise longue, but as this was the evening prior to checking out we did not mention it.

Molly made planning our trip easy and effortless with her friendly and fun personality. She went above and beyond our expectations by having a bottle of sparkling cider (since I'm newly pregnant) and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us in our room upon arrival. She also had some baby gifts for me in a beautifully wrapped package on the bed. We were blown away by her attention to detail and her gracious generosity. The rest of the team was fantastic and they always made us feel welcome and accommodated any request or questions we had. Two other concierges, Amber and Jarrod, were especially helpful. We were located on a corner room on the 42nd floor overlooking the Hudson and a small street. I found the location to be ideal as it was very quiet and peaceful versus a room facing Broadway. We saw housekeeping several times as we were leaving our room and they were always very kind and professional. The room was adequate size and we had no issues with the frosted bathroom doors being too opaque.

After years at the Marriott Marquis monolith, a smaller place with personality seemed like a nice break. But the personality is not a pleasant one. First impression is at the curb. There are a number of doorpeople \"working\" but in 6 days, I never once saw one open a door for a guest, whether the guest had luggage, bags or other impediments. In fact one morning they laughed as a guest caught a rolling bag in the revolving door. The lack of smiles, or helpfulness, was remarkable, even for New York. The entry way is stylish, with a glass ceiling and water tumbling onto it, dance/electronica playing in the entry/elevator/7th floor and clean lines and moody lighting. The 7th floor had the pretentiously named \"living room\", with dramatic styling (chairs made of logs and fabric sculptures, as well as the front desk to the left and the bar to the right. Registration went smoothly. The elevator is dark, and to go to any floor you have to use a keycard. Needless to say, on most trips, there was some poor schmoe having to fumble for the key card. And from the time you get out of the elevator, your world turns dark and colorless. I get the idea that shades of dark gray, silver and black is high style and stark, sharp angles are (literally) edgy. But the same color scheme is used in prisons, and after a short time, you get the same effect. The most notable aspect is the Formica-like boxes that are used as cabinets. Laminated pressed wood isn't what I expect in an supposedly upscale hotel (I know it was laminated pressed wood because the door on one drawer was missing a hand-sized chuck of laminate.) The rooms are gloomy, and dark, and the shades are totally light blocking, so if you want privacy you also get gloom. The desk area has random wires and jacks, but it looks like somebody swiped the electronics. Although they apparently expect you to bring a laptop, they also gauge you for wifi, at 15 bucks a day. Oh, and bring a cellphone since all the calls are $2 to $3 (local or calls to 800#s). And maybe bring a chair. The one at the desk is a vinyl chair like you'd find in a cafeteria -- no ability to adjust it, armrest or wheels...most places are springing for aeron chairs or similar. The other seating option is a vinyl \"fainting couch\" by the window. Housekeeping is also pretty sketchy... the $9 Fiji water, when I picked it up, shot water out of a puncture at the top. It was an odd defect, like somebody jabbed a hypodermic in it. Staff was good about replacing it but that was strange. Stranger still was the swiffer broom that was left in my room one morning! I put it in the hallway around 6 p.m. and it was still in the hall the next morning. Another day, the bed cover was left on the fainting chair instead of on the bed. I would probably not be writing this review, but mysterious minibar charges seem to be added to everyone's bill. At least two other people at check out were complaining about extra expenses on the minibar, and I had an unexplained $17 charge on mine. The $13.07 for a Corona was correct, although when I called to ask how much the beer was (I had no price list in my room) I was told $10. After seeing the charge on the bill that was slipped under the door, I called and the staff person told me it would be removed. BUT when I go to the front desk, I have to raise the issue all over again. So, bottom line, next year I'm going someplace else and I'd urge you to do the same.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWhat's your Wish\u201d", "Author": "SashaLuna", "ReviewID": "UR100527837", "Content": "W in Times Square is by far the best hotel anyone can stay in while a visit in NYC.

One thing the hotel should add to the room is nespresso machines. TV and radio worked awesome. The hotel room also has a DVD player. The W New York in Times Square has a great bar on the 7th floor. This is the perfect place to get a drink after a long day. Just watch out for the working girls hanging around. I thought I would only see this in Las Vegas. I don't understand why the on the Hotel management allows hookers to hang around the bar and lobby area. Hotel wireless worked really well!! Also try Blue fin restaurant. Yummy!!

Its about that location! We enjoy walking to the theater each night and taking our time doing it. And we enjoy the easy access to the Subway for our daily excursions and then getting back in time for a change of clothes, a cocktail or three in our room, and sometimes even a quick nap before the 8PM showtime. And we enjoy splurging once or twice a year for this location and booking a top floor room where we enjoy wonderful views of the City, day and night. We enjoy extremely easy on line booking using the SPG Program. The 2 dbl bed room with top floor location will probably set you back $700.00/ night during the low season, and add about $55.00/ night for valet parking, so be prepared for sticker shock, but for a best of the best location in New York City's Times Square Region we think it a worthwhile splurge. To summarize- Likes- Location- The best of the best ; Room size- the on-line information will mention 288 to 365 sq ft This size is complimented by the W's incredible room design and deft use of chrome, glass and mirrors and an entire wall of window that opens just enough for fresh air to infiltrate. It is roomy for 2 adults and easily on a par with any other hotel at this location and price point; Elevator service- the W features express elevator service to your floor, secured using your room's key card. We have stayed at the W Times Square 6 times now and each time the elevator service has been flawless; Bathroom- great light, great ventilation, adequate toilet location (tough on lefties, though), decent water pressure and hot water supply (shower late or very early if you want to enjoy the rain shower). Our room came equipped with a bathtub/shower combination and a convenient shelf for bath stuff; Room amenities- nice size flat screen TV with free HBO, in room frig loaded with temptations, very comfy bedding; Valet parking- as mentioned, pricey but extremely convenient. For us, this expense is a big part of our splurge. General ambience- the W has an appeal that is elegant yet not uncomfortably so. The staff add to this feeling. Everyone that I have encountered, from bellhops to check-in clerks to valets have been friendly and a joy to chat with. This is always a sign that management has been successful in hospitality training. Dislikes- ok, nobody is perfect! Here are some of the dislikes from our last stay: only 1 drawer in the room; only 1 bathrobe in the closet; no grab bars in the shower/bathtub (an accident waiting to happen); room temperature- we like to sleep at 68 degrees but we couldn't get the temp below 75 in January, even with the windows opened the full 1/4 inch!; no coffeemaker (how hard could it be to add one of those 5 cup percolators to a room?); in room safe is not big enough to store a standard size laptop computer in the locked position- it was a disappointment to us that our room did not have this; envelope for the housekeeping staff- and why not allow tips to be added to the room (you can add a tip for your waiter to your bill at the Blue Fin Restaurant and add that to your room bill so why not be able to tip the housekeeping staff and add that to your room bill?); We do not take advantage of room service when we stay at the W. A big part of our vacation is to seek out new breakfast, lunch and dinner destinations and we enjoy the adventure involved in trying restaurants that are off the beaten path. The room service menu looked to have plenty of variety and is provided by the kitchens of the popular and beautiful Blue Fin Restaurant which has a great breakfast menu and a wonderful ambiance all its own. Get there early for prime window seats to the show that is Times Square. Sure it is pricey but it is located in Times Square, remember! There were 816 reviews about the W New York Times Square when I prepared this. The hotel had a ranking on Trip Advisor of 99 of 429 hotels in New York City. What the f does that mean? I don't understand the rankings business. I just know that we still shop around before selecting a hotel for our 3 or 4 night get away vacations in New York City every year and we always decide to go back to this W.

In a connecting room, we could hear quiet conversations through the wall, let alone drunk screaming women arriving back at their room at 2am after a night on the town. The hotel generally seemed to be filled with groups of tweens from other states (is the W discounting heavily?) and there were sizable queues for virtually every facility - the lifts, the front desk, the bar.

You could barely move around in the room, it was so small. All I kept asking was what are we being charged 350 a night for???? There are no bath tubs (shower only), unless you opt for a room with two doubles and even then this tub is tiny. I should also mention that our room was called \"spectacular king\", which was supposed to be an upgraded room, but instead it looked more like a dorm room. My husband said that he's stayed in youth hostels that were bigger than where we were staying. Our room was also adjascent to another family's room and we could hear their screaming children (because the rooms are connected by a door that stays locked, and the walls are obviously thin). You can also hear all the street traffic and nothing is included in the nightly price (only free internet is in the lounge and if you want internet from your room its $14.95/day).

Now the prices are really really steep, so beware particularly when ordering drinks that you're looking at at least $10 per drink. We were horrified when we were billed $130 for an average bottle of red and 2 cups of tea at the bar!! Yikes. One of the real plus points was free wireless broadband, particularly as the snow storm hit while we were there. When we found we couldn't fly out to our next destination they checked us back in to another room without hesitation. This time we were on the 23rd floor and the room was identical to the original but sold at around $100 per night less - the view was amazing from the 57th and great from the 23rd but, if you want a view go for a lower level room and get yourself up a novelty skyscraper. Times Square is literally on your doorstep so if that's your thing this is a great place to stay, just bear in mind that you will pay over the odds in most transactions in this area.

On entering the elevator, one is hit with techno party music, which increases in volume on entering the 7th floor reception lobby. The bar is also on this floor, which admittedly is extraordinarily hip with lots of beautiful people. On my checking in, the clerk asked me how many keys I wanted. I said one, at which point he gave me two. He noticed my puzzled look, and said \"well that's in case you get lucky at the bar\". I politely handed the key back. Single-y types or scandalous types might think this is cool, I didn't particularly as I am married w/kids and wear my ring. So - the room is pretty nicely appointed, nice tv, good bed, there was this sort of \"love-lounge\" piece of furniture by the window. Speaking of the window, pretty good view of part of times square, although of course that means flashing lights coming into your room - not a big deal with the curtains closed. No robe, no coffeemaker (and the lack of a coffeemaker always bugs me). You can hear the noise from Times Square even from 25 floors up, which is a bit of a bummer. The bathroom had two big issues -- a) the door to the actual bathroom is frosted sliding glass. Being by myself, I didn't have privacy issues - but the door wasn't cleaned (there were spotlets of I what I presume was water over it). And b) there were some slight brown stains in one part of the shower floor. Ick. I didn't notice until the morning (I arrived late), so nothing I could do about it. BTW, showerhead is great. The \"whatever whenever\" theme is a little too cheeky for me (they actually say that). The W is, however, most of what you would expect it to be - it is a pretty cool place - but it's just a wee bit overdone for my taste. If the volume was just slightly lower, the overall theme just a fraction less garish, I think it would be perfect for what it is trying to do. If not for the bathrooms I'd consider bringing my wife to this hotel for a getaway. I moved to the Omni Berkshire the next day (which I really like and was much happier there). While eminently less cool, the Omni is a first rate property.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel! Was even better the second time around!\u201d", "Author": "xtos", "ReviewID": "UR88833639", "Content": "Just spent two nights at this swank Times Square Hotel Thanksgiving weekend and loved it again! The front desk check in was smooth and they were able to find me a room with a great view of the Hudson and part of Times Square. I should also note that this side of the hotel was defintely quieter than the other side I stayed on last time I was here. I hardly heard any noise and slept soundly through the night. The room was even nicer than the last time I stayed here, appears to have been renovated. The bathroom was very cool, with very modern features. I also loved the shower, so sleek and spacious. The Bliss bath products were also great, and you get plenty of them. From a cute little bar soap to moisturizer, shampoo, conditioner, and bath gel. Great stuff! The bed was also super comfortable and the room itslef was very clean. There's a cool little ipod dock on one of the night stands that charges your ipod while playing your music and the sound quality of the system was surprisingly excellent for a hotel room. I had to be careful not to turn it up to loud, but if I wanted I could have had a little party in this place. :) I remembered from my last visit that they had a DVD player in the room, so this time I brough several DVD's to enjoy. This really enhanced my visit, but if you don't remember to bring DVD's, no worries as they have an extensive DVD library available. There's also a minibar full of beer, wine, and sodas, and plenty of gifts you can purchase right from the room, as well as other necessities that might come in handy. The bar scene on the lobby level is really cozy and super cool, as it was before. It seemed to draw in the street crowd as well as hotel guests, which really makes this hotel feel like a destination itself. In my original review, I commented about the complicated lobby and elevator system, but this time I was full aware that the lobby is on the 7th floor and that the fitness center is in the middle elevator bank (on the 10th floor) and I knew which floors are serviced by which elevators, etc. So this time around it was much easier to navigate. Once you get that understanding down, it's a piece of cake. In hindsight, with all the floors in this hotel, I now realize it's actually more efficient to break the elevators up like this, that way you don't have 20 people waiting to get into one elevator. I also took a nice long walk through Central Park and to the MET museum on Sunday. It's only about a 15 or 20 minute walk to the entrance of Central Park, and about a 45 minute leisurely walk to the MET. The location really couldn't be better. You also have very easy access to subways, trains, and buses. I came in from Boston with the Bolt Bus (which was only $38 round trip!) and it dropped me off right at 34th St, so this hotel was just a short walk from there. A couple notes: They do have WiFi, but it isn't free. I believe it's $10 per day. It would be nice if they offered this for free in the future. They could also do with a bit more drawer space for your clothes, and the bathroom is only segmented off with frosted glass, and while this is very hip and cool it lacks a much needed sense of privacy, which is very important with bathrooms, so keep this in mind when planning to share the room with someone. Overall a really great place to stay when visiting New York, especially if you plan to see a Broadway Show and definitely one of the best places to stay in Times Square!", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFor better or worse, it's right on Times Square\u201d", "Author": "AstroJunq", "ReviewID": "UR88781074", "Content": "Being on Times Square is the main strength of this hotel, but also the main weakness. For travellers who want to be right in the middle of the action, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great place, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I voted 5 in location. But the action may be too much as the area around it is ridiculously overcrowded, to a point when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to walk on the streets. Much worse is the constant noise, mainly coming from cars honking like there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no tomorrow and the non-stop ambulances/firefighters/police frenzy. To be clear, I was up on the 32nd floor and all this can be heard from up there (especially at night), even though the windows seem to have very good sound insulation. That aside, the hotel is all you would expect from a W. The reception area has constant loud music, lots of people at the bar and uncomfortable seating, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all part of the W package, I guess. The front desk being on the 7th floor is a little odd, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect the experience badly. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say anything about the restaurant downstairs as I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try it. The room was very comfortable and decent sized, and also spotlessly clean. The mattress was new, the LCD TV worked well and the shower was good. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little tricky to figure out how to make the water work on the sink, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get it after 2 minutes of poking around. The internet on the room was very pricey, but the great news is that it was free on the lobby, so Kudos for the W on offering that option at least. And I must say, it worked pretty well for the when I needed it. There was also a Mac available for people to use. Finally, the service was professional and pleasant all around. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything out of the ordinary, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mess anything either. And that is a lot more than I can say about several other hotels. In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel if a) you know that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the style of hotel you want, and b) you really want to stay in Times Square.

When we first stayed at the W Time Square it was the hippest and most happening hotel. This time around it just seemed average. With the other boutique hotels popping up around, the W has kept to its status quo instead of changing. The rooms are tiny and the beds are mediocre. If you're going to be sharing a room with your colleague, I would not recommend this hotel. The bathrooms have frosted glass doors - all the way around. It's okay with your signficant other; it's awkward with your colleagues or co-workers. The bathroom amenities are nice with the Bliss products. However with the kind of money you're paying for the hotel, it would have been nice if they would have supplied a hair dryer that wasn't incredibly tiny. We stayed on the 53rd floor which had a great view of ....another hotel. This is expected in NYC though so we weren't surprised. It was quiet on our floor and we were able to get a good night's rest. The bar downstairs serves awesome martinis. Our favorite was the Pineapple martini. It's also a good place to meet up with colleagues and clients. We didn't partake in the room service. When we saw $22.00 for an omlette we decided to pass and try to find somewhere else more reasonable. The best part about the hotel is the staff. From the luggage handlers to the front desk to the fellows downstairs handling taxis, the staff is just wonderful. For the money that we paid for 2 nights at this hotel ($1,500.00), we probably should have tried another hotel. For the next business trip I think we will.

It was my first stay at a W and I am confident that I will return. Booking was made through AMEX FHR so there were a few perks such as late checkout, free breakfast, upgrade upon availability. You enter on a ground floor, go up to the 7th floor and then there are lifts to the rooms. Separate lifts for floors 34 and above so there isn't that annoying floor by floor stopping on the way down. I was greeted by extremely friendly and efficient staff at check-in, all front end staff at the hotel were in their 20's or 30's. This complements the modern feel. Lifts smell great as do all communal areas. There is free WIFI in the lobby [7th floor]. I was upgraded from a corner room to a 'fantastic suite' which was as the name suggests - fantastic. Like 2 rooms stuck together on the Times Sq side on the 52nd floor. The views were breathtaking, the room was modern and stylish and most importantly new. The products were Bliss branded, I got quite hooked on the products so of course had to buy some from the Bliss shop on Lexington! The Location was so convenient for shows and tour buses, more importantly the central location ensured the ability to get a mid day shower after hours of walking. I went to the bar on lobby level a couple of times and was impressed that it appeared to attract people from outside the hotel too - but not too many that it would get annoying, just a comfortable number of people that would let you get a drink. The restaurant on the ground floor is called the Blue Fin which has great Sushi - you should go there if you want to have a nice meal pre or post show. It is a rated place to eat and has an upstairs level which you wont be aware of if you are simply passing through. Breakfast for me was a continental one, delivered to the room.

Don't plan on using the Acura car service - it was never there when we tried and you can't reserve it. The view from our room was excellent and the room was plenty large enough for 4 people with a separate living and sleeping area with doors that closed between the two. Two separate bathrooms as well. Much has been made of the \"see through\" frosted bathrooms. I know in the master bath in the suite, the issue was easily remedied by pulling the sliding closet door over the glass (this works, we did it and it may be intended). All nice Bliss bath products, very comfortable bedding and very clean. No real complaints. Very modern feel and great for singles, and families with teens, but this is not a place I would have been comfortable bringing younger kids - too trendy, upscale and dark. The bar in the lobby is awesome, and when our room was not ready immediately at check in time, they gave us two free drinks (and considering how expensive the drinks are, this is saying something!) and the bartender gave us a complimentary soda for the kids! Also lots of cozy nooks to sit it and have the drink. All the people working there were young, hip and very nice. You could tell they were use to working with people with high expectations. I am a fairly seasoned traveler and have stayed at a wide range of properties, from 5 star resorts to little beach dives, and I feel the W was a great experience that lived up to my high expectations.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "grainne1980", "ReviewID": "UR83034664", "Content": "I stayed in the W times square for 3 nights, really liked the hotel and the views were fantastic !

There was no separate room for toilet, after asking it appears most rooms are designed this way. Even though I was with my husband, neither one of us wanted to be witnessed using the bathroom. So we had to turn off the lights just to go! That didn't solve the issue, only made us dark shadows sitting on a toilet. Not to mention there was only room for one in the bathroom and no counter space for toiletries, make-up, etc. No mirror in room so it made for getting ready very uncomfortable & inconvenient. Negatives with ROOM: ~NO privacy in using toilet ~Small room (to be expected in NYC) ~One small drawer for clothing ~No charging port for phones, etc. (we had this in the other W hotels) ~No place to put make-up & toiletries, no mirror to get ready in ~The shaving/make up mirror they install in bathroom was counter height so we had to bend down to look into it ~Walls are paper thin, we were awoken every morning by our neighbors conversations. You could actually hear what they were saying and they weren't yelling. This we found is a commonplace with every W we've stayed in. Negatives with HOTEL: ~$60 per day parking at hotel!! ~No personalized service. Not one employee knew our name, no one greeted us walking in or out. ~Employees standing outside did not hail cabs for us!! Only once on our last night did an employee hail a cab & then he had to tell another employee to get the door for us. ~Employees outside did not help or offer to help load our bags into car upon departure. ~Overall, we experienced no customer service. Very disappointing. ~No coffee & tea available in mornings! Our options were to either walk across the street to starbucks or pay $30 for in room service for a SMALL pot of coffee. You would think for $400 (plus parking) a night you could get a complimentary coffee. Even Days Inn have coffee makers in room. ~The gym was apparently converted from two rooms. Instead of removing the adjoining wall, you had two entrances for different equipment. There was no using free weights and machines in the same room.

However, at 15 bucks a day for the web, and a pricetag on even the bottled water ($8 bucks for a Fiji) PLUS having paid nearly $300 a night to get in the joint, it just seemed that I was paying a lot to look at things that I dare not touch, lest there be a touching fee! The room was gorgeous, and my room on the 30th floor was fitted with a spectacular view. I would not trade this for the world. All the accessories, toiletries and anything I had to touch were all sensual and made me feel special for being there. Here are the tough parts to digest: 1. The toilet cover did not fit the toilet. WHAA?? How is this OK? 2. So many long black stringy hairs all over the shower WALLS as well as behind the sink and other unexpected places. Since my hair is less than a millimeter long, I could not help but be grossed out by this. 3. The cordless phone and the DVD player needed connection help. While tech difficulties are to be expected when there are so many tech devices in the room, it seems that a tech-check should be as routine as housekeeping so that I shouldn't have the coverall guys in my room 2-3 times during 3 day visit. 4. The relationships between the hotels and vacation planning carriers should really benefit the customer. When I called to confirm my reservation and ask details about the hotel, the phone operator (not at the hotel) became very distant and almost nasty when she realized that I had booked third party. Traveling cross country required me to book the hotel and flight together, but it was as though my money and my business were no good to the W since I had booked outside their website. REALLY? Does the W parent company not get the money I pay to stay at their hotel? Do my incidental charges not get tallied? Since they do, then I should get all the few measly points due me for my stay. Thankfully the desk agents fixed the problem upon my check out. Bottom Line: The convenient location and the multiple perks of the W Times Square make it the perfect place to be in order to enjoy the perfect tourist's New York Vacation. The cool living room lounge had sexy folks in it almost 24/7, and although the Blue Fin restaurant is expensive, the food is phenomenal. My bed, the shower (even with the hair) and everything else in the room made life oh so Wonderful, even though i was paying through the nose for every minute. To the folks at W, take a page from the folks at ANDAZ - the little things that made you famous are now getting other properties bookings. I'll be loyal, but I'll also be comparing!

Well even though this hotel is a category 6 I have stayed at better SPG properties at a lower category than this hotel. The rooms were just ok nothing to take pictures of or to brag. I was really excited about coming to this hotel but was quickly disappointed once I got my room. Inside the room the room didn't look as \"clean\" as I thought it would be we had to call to have new pillowcases because there was a stain on one of the pillows, fixtures on the wall would fall of if you touched it. The view is just ok you have to luck out to get a room with a view not looking into the marriott hotel across the street. The rooms are VERY small! I mean I was really surprised this hotel was a category 6 REALLY! The best part of the room was the bathroom sink and shower light! The bathroom is small but that looked way better than the rest of the room. When I stay at exclusive hotels I don't feel like I have to worry about dirty linen, here I was extremely worried, once I saw the stain on the pillow I was grossed out! Then when I was about to take a shower I looked on the floor and saw hair! So that tells me they didn't really clean the room as well as they probably should have. I read some comments before I came here and there were some that mentioned the torn carpet etc., that was also the case in my room. I just don't think I will be booking any more stays here, I can't seem to find a nice hotel in the city unless it is the Ritz Carlton! The staff was nice however I didn't get the warm fuzzy feeling when I asked about an upgrade or even the fact that it was supposed to be a romantic evening.

NYC was HOT and the air con in one of the rooms didn't work. The good bits - it's very stylish, rooms are good quality, beds v comfortable, public areas of the hotel, lounge area and 7th floor bar area very good. Not so good bits - the service was slow. Sometimes very slow. Every morning they weren't set up to cater for 5 despite there being numerous large families there every time we dined. Breakfast on the first day was ridiculously slow, it took 35 minutes to get a cup of ordinary coffee and a pot of hot water. The breakfast food was good when it eventually arrived. Breakfast service got faster over the 4 days but they never had a table ready. Maid service was barely adequate. The rooms were not cleaned til post 4 pm most days, the first day the carpet wasn't even hoovered. Trays from room service left outside rooms were left there all day, eventually we complained when one tray was still outside the room from 8 am til gone 10 pm. That really isn't acceptable in a hotel at this level. The breakfast offer we had through our travel operator was $5 per person per day. That was confirmed when we checked in but at breakfast I was given a $95 bill. WHen I queried that with the front desk they said they had never heard of the $5 offer but that our room was on an offer for $38 per person with a max of 2 people per room and it would be credited to our rooms when we checked out. Since we were 5 people in 2 rooms that meant $152 per day for all of us - more than enough. When we came to check out, every breakfast bill was on there in full. It took more than 30 mins to sort out with front desk staff who said they had never heard of the $38 per person offer but took my word for it. Because front desk staff couldn't understand the offer, no it was per person, no it only covered 4 people b/c we only had 2 room, no it was per day, it took a long time to sort out and I had to be very persistent (not to mention patient) Not really sure about some of their doormen who seemed to be in league with the limo drivers who will rip you off as soon as look at you. When we told the concierge what their doorman had told us about recommending the limo, she was pretty horrified. They need to keep an eye on what's going on out there. Overall the service (apart from housekeeping) was pretty good. The hotel is very central which has good and bad parts, the bad being the noise from the sirens even from the 30th floor.

Even though the teenagers were mature enough to deal the moans and groans of love making from next door, it was unacceptable for the family to hear all that we did. Honestly it was so loud it was like the couple was in our room. After a night full of plastering pillows to our ears, we were tired beyond belief. We all took showers in the very public frost glass bathroom. When we were leaving, we walked down the hallway only to hear more moans and groans of people. After waiting for the elevator with the moans of couples in the background the teenagers of course were laughing. Even the adults were laughing. I have never experienced such lack of privacy in a hotel. What a waste of money. We always stay at Starwood hotels, however the next time we stay in Times Square we will save some money and actually get some sleep in the Marriott Marquis, a hotel we have stayed in before and liked.

It has a great location in Times Square that's adjacent to dozens of tourist attractions, but it was really just an unpleasant experience. First, the ground floor lobby has a beautiful water feature, but it smells musty and stale. After the first few trips through the lobby the novelty of it wears off and all you can do is hold your nose as you run to the doors. The elevators are tiny - the only one that wasn't cramped was the far left which I can only assume is the service elevator. Judging by the smell it hasn't been cleaned in a while. I've worked in kitchens whose grease traps smelled better than that elevator. When you're relieved by the smell of NYC streets you know there's something wrong with your hotel. Additionally, hotel guests are required to switch elevators at the 7th floor to get to their rooms. Again, a great security feature, but it really gets annoying after the twelfth time you have to wait for the second elevator and cram in with guests and their bags again - just to get to your room or the ground floor. The entire hotel is decorated and lit like a night club - which would be fabulous if it wasn't also so cramped and tiny. I know NYC isn't the place to be looking for wide open, spacious expanses, but if the hallways on each floor rival the tight quarters of my upstairs bathroom hallway shouldn't you attempt to open it up with light colors? These hallways are painted dark gray with minimal lighting. I felt like I was going spelunking every time I went back to my room. The rooms themselves are about the size of postage stamp. I was staying at the W with my sister and brother-in-law and let's just say we got to know each other really well. The room has few amenities - no refrigerator (unless you crack open the Fort Knox that is the mini bar), no coffee, no tea. Essentially the amenities are capped off by the ice bucket sitting next to the $10 bottle of Fiji water. Another word to the wise, if you're staying there with someone who isn't your spouse beware of the glass enclosed bathroom. Sure it's frosted, but who really wants to see a silhouette of someone doing their business first thing in the morning? Combined with the toilet that would start running in the middle of the night so loudly that I had to get up three times the last night to fix it (removing the lid and working with the internal floating mechanism), the sliding bathroom door that should come with your own personal Hulk arms to close it (and sounds like screeching nails on a chalkboard when sliding), and the shower that lost most of its water before it got to rinsing your head by pouring out the bottom of the showerhead like a bucket (with a lovely and relaxing tone reminiscent of a pressure washer to perk you right up) - well, let's just say I won't ever be staying at this, or any other, W hotel in the future. I will point out that one person was great, though. Julian at the front desk was a doll and really helped me out of a few jams when we first arrived. He's an asset and they'd do well to retain him for as long as they can. I think he's actually the only person that saved this trip from being an entire wash. He gave great recommendations for local spots to eat and grab a drink, too. The other guy, whose name I can't remember but starts with an N, was polite but ultimately useless at getting my problem taken care of. The Acura Experience driver, however, is temperamental. So much for using this amenity to see a new part of town. He'd just gotten back from being stuck in traffic so he \"didn't feel like taking that drive again,\" but he'd be happy to take us about fifteen blocks - of a 45 block trip. No thanks, buddy - I'll take the subway. Lucky for him he wasn't so tired and petulant the next day and actually was willing to take us down to Soho. Too bad we'd already been. I wouldn't have taken that guy up on the offer anyways, but I might want to apply for his job.

Pulling up at the hotel downstairs, we were greeted nicely by the bellboys and they helped us with all our luggage, which is standard/expected of a \"5 star\" hotel. We were shown the lift and advised where to proceed to check-in etc. All good so far. There was one guy working at the check-in counter, very casually dressed and very \"laid back\". He finished serving the guest in front of us and welcomed us to the hotel. Then simply asked for my ID and credit card, then within about 30 seconds I had my room key and was told my room number and that was it. No mention of my Gold status, which while nothing special, every other SPG branded hotel at least mention it and say \"thank you for staying with us again\" No mention of a room upgrade or anything extra either, granted we were staying in the Fantastic Suite, so there are no upgrades possible, but at least spend a bit of time explaining the hotel! Also given we were spending 5 nights here I would have expected a little bit more effort. That being said, we were tired and just wanting to get to the room and warm up, so I didn't ask anything and we went up to the room. Baggage, was up within a few mins with no problems there. The room we assigned, at first glance was lovely. Then once we started looking around we realized we had been allocated a disabled/accessible room (more on that later). Added to that we were only on the 30th (roughly) floor and not anywhere near the top of the hotel. The view was blocked by a \"lovely\" concrete ledge, so we could JUST see times square if we were standing in the corner of the bedroom. It was probably one of the worst Fantastic Suites available, as no other room type like this had the ledge blocking the view towards Times Square. So back downstairs I went, and asked about a room change, of course the standard \"Sorry, there are no other rooms available tonight, you can check back tomorrow and see if anything comes up, as someone SHOULD be checking out\" Of course, before going down I had checked availability and there were at least 9 Fantastic Suites available as they were bookable. According to the bell boys the hotel wasn't even 50% full, as I did ask that when arriving out of interest. After pushing him with my information, he said all he can do it put a note in the system for a \"room change\", come back tomorrow after 3pm and we would have another room. He denied knowing that he was assigning me an accessible room with no view, so of course, he didn't say sorry. I then watched him check-in an older couple and he was just as fast and rude to them as well and they were left standing around wondering where to go next after getting their room key.... So I left it at that and headed out to get something quick for dinner. More on the room - The accessible room, had two bathrooms which was nice, the standard small bathroom, and then the accessible bathroom, which had an ugly seat in the shower, no shower curtain/door, no bench space near the sink. In the end we should have stayed in this room, as the 2nd room was in fact worse... Yes the beds were nice and the rooms were designed in a modern feel. Yes they were dark, and probably not good if you are over 45 years old, that did not concern us at all. What really lets this hotel down is the cheap renovation they did and it sure does show. Basically all the old cracking/peeling/damaged walls simply were painted over, and painted poorly. So you can see all the old paint/wallpaper/peeling and all the damage underneath it. There is probably a reason why they like the rooms being so dark. Lots of small maintenance issues as well, like the shower taps falling off, lights not working, weird noises from the air conditioning and just a lack of maintenance. The air conditioning panel in the living room of the suite, was falling off as was the air con panel in the bedroom. As a result the panels would rattle and make lots of weird noises throughout the night. Also the huge gap around them meant a large dark hole leading up into the air conditioning black hole. We did expect to see a rat in there at some stage, but we missed out on that. Basically the hotel has had a cheap and poor renovation combined with no maintenance really doesn't help. This hotel only around 12 months ago, and already it's falling apart. How they expect to get another 6-7 years out of this hotel I really don't know. They can't make the rooms any darker... Okay, so the next day after 3pm, I went down and asked about the room change, given that our room had not been serviced it must have been noted in the system. The girl who helped me was lovely this time, she said yes there is a request but it wouldn't let her allocate a new room. She went and spoke to the Manager, and we were given a new room only a few stories from the top floor, which was what I expected when we checked it. The girl said she would send up a bellboy to help with luggage and move us to the new room in about 10 mins and I went back to our old room. After a few mins the bellboy arrived, and I informed him we weren't ready yet, he was not happy about this and grumbled about having to wait around. I offered to call down when I was ready and he gumbled about already being upstairs and waiting.. So I said I'll be about 5-10 mins and he grumbled again. I then offered to take the new room key off him and move the luggage myself. He said that was not possible, so then I simply said I'll be 5-10 mins and shut the door on him. I am not interested in New York attitude when I am staying in the 2nd highest room category and I am changing rooms because of the incompetence of the hotel/staff. After a few mins I went to the door and he was around the corner on her phone sending messages or something, and simply said \"You ready yet?\" I said yes and he got our luggage and said he'd meet us on the new floor. We got to the new room and walked in and the view was perfect, he put all the luggage where we requested and was a bit friendlier at this stage. We tipped him well, and that was that. Okay, this room... Had the one normal bathroom and another 1/2 bathroom (toilet and basin) and a much better un-obstructed view over Times Square. Again the room had maintenance issues which we never bothered to report as no doubt the whole hotel has bits and pieces broken/not working. Firstly the nice little blue mood light in the shower just below knee level was not there, it was covered over with an old tile. The light switch in the bathroom was still there for it, but of course it didn't do anything. No biggie but you don't have those poorly repaired items in a \"5 star hotel\". The more annoying bit was that the air conditioning unit in the bedroom didn't work in this room. As mentioned above, the suites have an air con unit in the living room and also one in the bedroom. This was annoying as not much air makes it way to the bedroom and we like to have the bedroom cooler and the living room warmer. Again, we didn't report this as there was no point. In the 1/2 bathroom, the tap was broken, meaning it was hard to wash your hands, again we just let it go. This hotel was in the middle of a long USA trip involving lots of SPG hotels. After staying here I was very tempted to cancel the other 16 nights in SPG managed hotels, but I decided to let the other hotels have their chance and ignore the W brand. However, I won't be staying at the W New York - Times Square ever again. For those that don't read all the above a Summary - Poorly and cheaply renovated and maintained hotel. Mostly rude staff. Rooms have various bits and pieces falling off and not repaired correctly. Location is great, and the gym was nice. Rooms are dark, so if you over 45 you may not like it. On the surface the rooms appear great, but it is simply a cheap, fast and nasty renovation that was done. Considering this hotel will be operating for another 5-8 years before the next renovation cycle, I hate to see how the rooms are in a few years.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "schplinky", "Title": "\u201cExceeeded our high expectations\u201d", "Author": "schplinky", "ReviewID": "UR61344510", "Content": "Truly, this was a textbook hotel stay.

In the middle of the night some people thought it was the right moment to start a talk in the corridor which was also very easy to follow. So, you can't call the place 'soundproof'.

The only thing that didn't work was the iPod docking station, but as I didn't spend lots of time in my room it was not a big deal for me.

All my experiences trying to contact the hotel staff have been bad, real bad. I had booked a colleague and myself in online for a three-night stay in two singles in December 2009. A month-and-a-half in advance of arrival, New York in December is a busy place. We wanted a central location and the hotel seemed to provide that. I received a confirmation for one room, on my name, from their automated reply service. I replied and got another confirmation, again for one room and this time for my colleague. I thought ok but decided to phone three days prior to arrival just to make sure we had two rooms, and a good thing I did because there was still just one room reserved. I confirmed two rooms and asked whether I could have a smoking room for myself. No problem, I would just be on a lower floor which was just fine with me. Fast forward to arrival. Taxi had to drop us two blocks away due to Times Square driving restrictions. Ok, this is Times Square. We look for receptions and apparently we are supposed to know they are by lift 8 flights up (doormen busy trying to fix taxis for giggling teenage MTV North Shore wannabes). We arrive at the claustrofobic reception with lounge bar pretensions from the 90's. After a half-hour wait we are told curtly: we have two rooms but both non-smoking. A discussion ensues, there is no record of my phone call. Grudgingly, I am allocated a smoking one and do not feel welcome at all. We spend three nights at the hotel and enjoyed the proximity to many of the locations for our business meetings. But not for one moment was I allowed to forget that the hotel was cool and I just had to accept that I needed to pay for the slightest semblance for service. I know this is true anywhere but to be reminded of it incessantly is a bomber. I guess this is their \"Real Whatever/Whenever Experience\", then.

Big mistake. Doormen are nowhere to be found, either on arrival or departure. There are plenty of guys hanging around the door but they all seem to be car valets. Be prepared to lug your own luggage and find your own cabs. On arriving upstairs in the \"living room\" you are assaulted by the techno beat of european dance music. All that kept running through my head was an 80's tune \"I'm too sexy for my car, too sexy for...\" and I kept expecting Zoolander to appear. Free wifi in this area but be prepared to pay $17 in your room. Check in was done by a young man in a rumpled shirt who was single handedly trying to cope with a line of more than 10 people. On the upside, our room was ready. On the downside, when we got up there, we had to manuver luggage around a housekeeping cart which was parked outside our door. It was there throughout our stay, covered with a case, so I assume that's where it's kept. The room itself, a corner king was - comical. The designers were clearly trying so very hard to capture the vibe of luxe modern European hotels, and failed miserably. They got the miniscule size right but everything else was form over function. It's a hotel, not an upscale boutique. One drawer, barely large enough to fit undies and accessories for one person, was the entirety of the storage provided other than a standard sized closet. Fortunatety, a luggage rack is provided so that you can live out of your suitcase. Low built-ins ran the perimeter of the room but all were sealed. Wall decor consisted of a rack of magazines featuring emaciated models. The other art consisted of two large abstracts in puce on grey which we dubbed \"amniotic fluids\". The walls are a dark grey/brown with hot pink acrylic nightstands. And then, there's the bathroom. It's glass enclosed, grey of course. Even with the frosting, if the light is on inside, it's just TMI. NOT recommended for friends traveling together. If you're with your sig other, hope you're really, really comfortable with each other. Also, no bathrobes and the towels are tiny. Views are great, provided you don't mind making eye contact with the guys in the office building across the street. There are no privacy shades, just a black out shade. So, it's either keep the shades closed (claustrophophic given the size and color of the room) or share. And, no, using the bathroom is not an option with the shades up, unless you do it in the dark. Check out - check your bill for errors, we had them. Also, leave yourself a LOT of time. There is no desk for preferred guests. In fact, the young man manning the desk, again, the only person there, didn't even know what SPG was. You get to wait on line with all the tourists, many of whom had lengthy questions. Billing errors seemed to top the list. The check-out kiosk - not working. TV check out available at almost every other hotel on this planet which provides a tv - not available. I guess this is all about expectations. I expected W level service/amenities. This W did not meet the standards. It was appalling. The location can't be beat for tourists or if you have meetings at Morgan Stanley, across the street. You also can't go wrong with this hotel if you want ammo for the next time you're in a \"can you top this\" competiton about awful hotels at some cocktail party. However, there are at least a half dozen hotels within a four block radius.

The room was recently refurbished and was very cool! Beautiful interior design! The best hotel room we have ever stayed in! Great location for your first time to new York. Close to the art galleries, 5th Avenue shops, Times Square (obviously), Central Park, Broadway and various other attractions. The Fantastic Suite has 2 main rooms- a bedroom, and a separate living room, and 2 bathrooms -one with a shower, toilet, basin, hairdryer etc, and the other bathroom is just a toilet, mirror and basin. The larger bathroom had cool lighting, a nice shower with adjustable head (different settings) and a very cool tap/ basin. Plenty of space to store stuff. There was a chaise lounge in the bedroom. 2 flatscreen tvs- one in the bedroom and one in the living area. There was a lounge suite with a chaise lounge and also a desk in the living area. We had a great view of Times Square from both rooms. We had no noise issues at all from other rooms, and you could not hear noise from Times Square either. The rooms were a good size- bigger than what I expected for New York. The bed was very comfy! The only thing that let down our stay was the service. I had contacted the hotel in advance to let them know that my boyfriend's birthday was during our stay and they said that they could offer him a complimentary piece of cake for his birthday. However the cake was never delivered to the room on his birthday which was disappointing as I thought that it would be a nice surprise. So we went through a long involved process to get it the next day. However we did get 2 drink vouchers left for us in the room before his birthday. The ice machine on our floor wasn't working, and we told reception who said it would be fixed, and it was never fixed in our whole stay. We found the doormen to be very lazy and unhelpful. They just seemed to be standing around talking. They didn't offer to help us get out of the taxi when we arrived at the hotel (our first time to New York), or get our bags, and laughed when I struggled with the taxi door instead of helping. Other days sometimes they would open the doors for us, but frequently they didn't. We got a very good rate on the room - a special suite deal $299 + tax a night which is a great rate even for a normal room rather than a suite. Great for New York prices! I used the phone to make a couple of international calls and was mortified to get a bill for several hundred dollars!!! It was the most expensive phone bill I've had in my life! It almost ruined our stay completely. If I knew that it would be even half that amount I would not have used it! Don't use the phone! The internet is very expensive too- they have a computer room but charge a fortune. They never told us there was free wifi in the lobby area and also there is a mac computer with complimentary internet access in the lobby area too (it's kind of hidden away). This would have helped us enormously if we knew this at the beginning of our stay as we were trying to keep in touch with friends, and needed to get information etc, and wasted a lot of time trying to find cheaper internet access around town.

We booked the second night half off promo and chose the cheapest room, so we got a Wonderful room for around $200 night. We thought that was a great deal for Times Square. I arrived at the hotel at 8:45am after a red eye from California. I was able to check in, was upgraded, and was in a Spectacular room on the 52nd floor before 9am. Looking out the window we could see a little bit of Times Square to the left, and the Hudson River and what seemed like half of New Jersey to the right. The room was great. We had two double beds, which were so comfortable. I had two issues with the room. First there was only one drawer in the entire room. There was a decent sized closet with about 12 hangers, but no other storage space. It was fine for two nights, but if I was there a week, I would have hated the lack of storage space. Second, the \"frosted\" glass door and wall to the bathroom. I really thought the previous reviews were over-exaggerating the see through glass, but they were not. I was there with my best friend, so we would just announce, 'I'm going into the bathroom, don't look' before we walked in. One thing to keep in mind, if the lights are on in the room, you can keep the bathroom light off, you'll still have plenty of light, but the glass won't be nearly as transparent. We went to the bar in the lobby, The Living Room, quite a few times in three days. We had wine and mixed drinks, all in the $10-12 range. Which I didn't think was overly expensive, especially for a New York hotel bar. We saw Rock of Ages at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, which is only half a block down 47th. It was really convenient, which was good since it was raining that night. We weren't able to use the Acura Experience. The few times we wanted to use it, the car was already out. But it does run every day from 12 to 8. The staff was fantastic. Everyone at the front desk was friendly and polite. Among other things, the concierge made a dinner reservation for us, and after making the reservation, he printed and signed a letter informing us of our reservation. The bartenders were friendly and attentive, especially Jonathan. The only problem we had with the staff was that it took about 10 minutes to store our luggage after we checked out Monday morning. But when we got back that afternoon, it took less than a minute to pick up our luggage. The doormen were fabulous as well, and welcomed us back every time we walked into the hotel. All in all it was a fantastic trip. I thought the room was a good size for NYC, and loved that it had two double beds. There were a few small chips in the bathroom floor, but for the price I didn't mind. If I had paid $300+ for the room, I may have had an issue with them. One additional thing, the bathroom sink is interesting. It was the cutest sink I have ever seen, but not very practical. I washed my face one night and the water splashed all over the counter. Also, at least in room 5205, we could only get hot or cold water in the sink, not warm. The shower was fine, but every time we washed our hands we had to choose between scalding hot or icy cold water. Oh, and there is a charge for internet in the room, but you can get free wi-fi in the lobby and bar.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern US", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful first stay at a W hotel\u201d", "Author": "swimmy4", "ReviewID": "UR53443805", "Content": "My husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary at the W New York in Times Square.

We were told by the Whatever, Whenever service that this was no problem. Nothing came. The next night, we called down again and were put on hold by Jared, who was very friendly but seemed to forget us, as we were on hold for 30 minutes before giving up. Trying again an hour later, Jared offered to send some up right away. A few minutes later, the phone rang again. It was Jared. He called back by accident. OK Jared. Eventually, a bag ambassador, or something to that effect, handed over two more down pillows and no duvet. However, as he was busy texting, we decided to call again, since he didn't seem to know what was going on. The man came back up the next night and crossed the living room into the bedroom to hold up the pillows and insist that they were in fact, hypoallergenic, going to far as to insist we feel the difference. So never mind. Down pillows it is. Asking for taxis, too, is pointless. The door ambassador, as they are called, stands around looking friendly. Ask for a taxi and he will stand on the side of the street looking perplexed. One of us points out a free taxi. Another says, no, it's off-duty.

We stayed over Thanksgiving 2009 and had mixed views about the hotel. On the positive side, it has a great location. If only they hadn't moved the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade route (certainly not the W's fault) we would have been looking right out B'way at it from our room. Even so, a very very short walk to the parade so that was fine. The decor and vibe is of course designed to be \"hip.\" That is the W's thing. But I think some of the staff are a bit too impressed with just how hip and cool they are, and have lost all warmth and caring. What on earth is the point of having 3 folks at the front door if 3/4 of the time they ignore you when you come and go? In most hotels where there is a doorman, someone opens the door and greets you or welcomes you back. Here that was only done occasionally. The room was designed to be nice; with a \"living room\" that had a pull out bed and a very nice bedroom area. The bed was among the most comfortable I've been in. But, what first class hotel actually has a door missing between the two rooms? And, when I questioned it, nothing happened for 2 days. Then, when someone called to find out if we were satisfied with the service, they tried to explain the lack of a door (there are two doorways to the bedroom area; one door was there, one was not), they tried to explain that as on purpose and a part of the remodeling program. Please people: the hinges were still there.. there was supposed to be a door there, and my wife and I would have prefered the privacy that imparted as the rest of our family was in the outer room. I did not mention to them that a plate or cover was also missing in the shower, but you'd think they would find that by themselves. Also in the poor service department, we had asked for an additional roll-away bed. It never showed up; but our daughter decided the couch was ok so we let that pass. The 2 TVs in the room were both nice; the one in the living room area had a blue line that showed up intermittently; they were unable to fix that, apparently. The fixture in the baths were pretty cool; the room had 1-1/2 baths, I think they really ought to line up the water connections the same way so that hot /cold is in the same direction for both faucets; it wasn't a problem for us, but someday could lead someone to get a scalding if they think the water temp goes the other way because of the other sink's connections. I usually grade hotels not just on is it wonderful, but based on the value and what it purports to be: a fabulous Motel 6 may have no amenities, but if its clean, well located, and well maintained etc. its going to get a very high grade. Here, this is a hotel that purports to be first class and charges as if it were. I would go to the Sofitel rather than here on a return trip, as this just wasn't in the class that it purports to be.

My experience differed, however, from that of those who give it favorable reviews. The hotel entry area and 8th floor lobby are very sleek and trendy but the rest of the hotel -- most notably our guestroom -- was very dark and needed some updating. The paint on the ceiling in the bathroom was peeling away, the furniture looked extremely worn and I found the art and color scheme in the room a little depressing. The room was cramped and offered no good storage space for our clothes and other articles. That resulted in a lot of clutter for the length of our stay. The TV kept switching on its own from whatever we were watching to the annoying hotel channel on which pay per view movies are advertised. I was in NYC for the marathon and had looked forward to soaking in a bath after the race. Unfortunately, the room offered only a shower. Room service was too overpriced (e.g., about $50.00 for a small breakfast, most of which was concealed in fine print delivery fees, service charges and tax) to order anything and the lobby bar was pretty much the same (we paid $33 for two simple drinks). At $75 bucks for our four night stay, we elected not to spring for internet service. At $400+ a night, I think the W could provide WiFi for free. The best part of the W was the bed. It was cozy and comfortable, but that's pretty much it. In a nutshell, I think the W times Square is way overrated.

As far as the room is concerned, I agree with the other reviewers that it's more suited to romantic partners than family. We stayed in a spectacular room on the 54th floor overlooking Times Square. You could see Central Park in the distance and the Hudson off to the West. The room was very clean, no issues at all there, very sexy, the frosted walls surrounding the bathroom were very cool (and a big reason why it's not such a great place for families) and there was an immense smoky mirror on the wall above the headboard. Lighting was also very cool and so was the furniture. The waterfall sink in the bath was really neat (hard to pour water in the iron but the rain shower has a stream setting), and the shower was more than roomy enough for two with cool blue lighting. When we entered our room they had covered the bed and entrance with rose petals (as per my request), but they had forgotten the 6 chocolate strawberries I had requested. When I called down not only did they have them up in 10 minutes, but they removed the charges for both the petals and the strawberries from my account. When we noticed there was only one bathrobe they had someone up in 5 minutes with another one. My wife needed a dress pressed prior to us heading out to 21 for dinner, and even though she was past the deadline for having a garment pressed and returned same day, they whisked it away and it was waiting for us in the closet when we got back from a few hours of strolling around CP. The Bar downstairs is also very neat, and hopping at night, wish we would have gone there instead of wasting $40 on two drinks at Gilt. The room service was DELISH.

The elevators ran smoothly not an issue of waiting to get to our rooms. I like the idea of using the room card in the elevators as a security measure as the Lobby bar....(the Livingroom ) is open to the general public.

We stayed there for 4 nights at the end of our honeymoon and it was a disaster from start to finish. We had booked a \"Spectacular Room\" but I assure you that it was anything but spectacular. The toilet had not been cleaned properly and every surface had dust and grime from the previous guests. They agreed to move us to a different room. As with the previous room the new room wasn't very clean. All the fixtures and fittings were also badly finished, and rather than feling classy and contemporary, the room felt very flatpack. There were sharp corners everywhere, wires and leads coming out of everything and gimmicky lamps that were difficult to turn on and off and did not light the room sufficiently. The hotel is marketed as being trendy and cool. It fails miserably in this respect. On arrival we were told that as it was our honeymoon, they would like to give us a bottle of champagne on the house much to our delight. However, it did not arrive. We enquired when the complimentary champagne would arrive but it still did not come. At this stage it became a matter of principle and after 6 embarrassing attempts over the 4 days we finally received a $5 bottle of sparkling wine when we returned to our room late on our last night there. A cheap bottle of sparkling wine in a hotel that charged us $24 for 2 vodkas and diet coke was a bit cheap. The staff were incompetent, ranging from the check in clerk to the door staff to the bar staff. The concierge was to his credit, at least appeared to be helpful despite the fact that he was unable to have a bottle of champagne delivered from the bar to our room in under 4 days. The straw to break the camels back came on departure when our luggage was being taken into storage for a few hours before we departed for the airport. Our ruck sacks and suitcases were simply left unattended in the lobby for 3 hours and not taken into storage as promised. Anybody could have taken all of our belongings. The hotel was staffed with people more concerned with acting cool and making you feel like you should be serving them than the other way around.

Everyone we came in contact with at the hotel were very accommodating and we felt like they genuinely cared about the quality of our stay. There was one staff member in particular who helped to make our stay extra memorable. Gil (I think one of the security staff?) was especially helpful and went out of his way to make our stay more special. We felt like VIPs in the hotel and also that we had a friend who would take care of us. We've stayed in many W's over the years now and the service in general is very good, but the service at this location was outstanding!

I will also say that he is a road warrior and is top tier on most hotel chains. Times Square is the last place that I would choose to stay because it is just ground zero for tourists at all times of the day and night. I personally don't like walking outside to a sea of people. Murray Hill is more residential and worlds aways from this chaos so that is where I am coming from. As soon as we arrived at the W, we were greeted outside by very friendly staff. You enter and then go up the elevator to the reception area. In the same area is a bar with lounge music and lots of people. Ok so not really quiet, but honestly it was not annoying. Front desk people were great and were extremely helpful. Our room was a corner one and had a great view of Times Square below. Noise was very minimal. I loved the grey/taupe walls and the cool colors used to accent. room was quite striking and not jarring (in other words very easy on the eye). The bed was super comfortable with ample pillows.Very cool and comfy I wish I had a bed like this at home. I really could have just taken my favorite books and spent the entire time in bed reading. There was an Ipod doc/stereo for your Ipod. How great is that! Lots of room for laptops and other electronic devices. I was most impressed with the W's security as my room key somehow stopped working. The room was in my husband's name and so security went up with me. I must say that I was very impressed that they were careful to make sure I was who I said I was. The security man they sent up with me was extremely professional and courteous. He did his job! When we checked out I saw the same officer and he remembered me by name. I actually would stay here again, yes someone who did not want to stay in Times Square.

However, on this occasion I think I might issue a warning. After a full day and half a night of travelling to get to NY, bartering with a receptionist was near enough the last thing we wanted to do. How disappointing it was to arrive at the hotel at 10.30 in the evening (3.30 am London time) only to be told that our room, which my boyfriend paid extra for, had been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiven away\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to an overflow customer who had originally booked another hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what warranted the priority of this other customer, apparently booking and paying for a room in advance does not ensure that you can actually stay in it. Instead we were told to stay in a downgraded room for the first night and that we would be moved to our proper room during the following day. However, this might have been an issue which I could have come to terms with if there was a degree of remorse shown by the receptionist and perhaps a refund of the difference, maybe even an upgraded room, sadly it was not to be. After suggesting that we were not particularly happy with these arrangements we were offered credit for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBlue Fin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 restaurant. This we declined as we were not certain that we would eat there. Next he offered us a complimentary drink each at the bar. After bumping this up to 4 complimentary drinks, we settled. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a shame we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the apology. Some might think me prude, but when it comes to bathrooms, I might be inclined to favour comfort over style or at least a goodly amount of both. When contentment in the bathroom is forsaken for a glass wall, I would suggest that the design was perhaps not as well thought out as it could have been. I can see how some might see it as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but mostly I found it off-putting. However, it is not this to discredit what otherwise was a good hotel.

When we got to hotel there were no door staff to help with bags or point us in right direction. We quickly found check in on the 7th floor.

The size of the room was fine, but the wardrobe was tiny and there was just no draws to put anything. There was plenty of space where storage could have gone, but the room was too trendy for its own good. We phoned down to say we were not happy and very quickly the service manager arrived. She admitted that although the rooms had just been renovated, it had not been done particularly well and most people do complain about lack of storage. She said most rooms would be like this but she would upgrade us to a suite if we liked. We did. We had to go back to reception and get new rooms keys. When we found our new room the service manger arrived with a bag of gifts and a hand written note congratulating us on our future arrival. A nice touch. The suite was great, very large, 2 big wardrobes and 1.5 bathrooms. The main bathroom was tiny though. The living area toilet was big but had no where to hang a towel. Overall a good room but needed more lights. Far to dark at night time. In summing up the rooms they look great but they are not designed for someone to use them. The free breakfast had to be taken in the room and on the sixth day was starting to get boring. I used the gym most days and although it is small it has very modern equipment and was always quiet. Because we stayed 6 nights we had 2 $85 credits at the blue fin. We used one for a set menu meal which was very good and the other for Friday night cocktails which was better.

Further the bathroom has been so much overdesigned that they forgot to fit enough lamps. For my wife it has been impossible to do make-up, for me shaving has been a problem. So, since I've got a Platinum SPG card, I called and complained. The y promissed a bigger Suite for the next day, okay, fine. When returning from restaurant we saw that they forgot the \"turn-down-service\" (which you can expect at approx. US$ 400/night). We've been informed that the W isn't star rated and therefore we can't expect 5 star service. \"Turn-down\" they perform only on special request and automatically when you're Platinum SPG member (which I am - but still they forgot). The next day we were moved to a nice Suite. But again, the thing has been so much overdesigned that they forgot the light switches. So for switching on/off the light you have to go to each and every lamp to switch it on/off... And again, the light in the bathroom has been too little, everything too dark! Breakfast (in-room) has been included in our package, that's maybe why the croissants always had been from the previous day... But the juice (freshly squeezed) has been perfect! Another positive feature of the W is free-WiFi at the bar/lounge (which is quite crowded and noisy) - but who cares, it's free - while in the room you have to pay. The problem started the last (3rd) day. Again they forgot \"turn-down-service\" and in the morning they even didn't bring new shampoo... So I called and the lady insisted that they performed turn-down-service, that she had been present in person, that they exchanged towels and put chocolate. I informed her that neither there're fresh towels or shampoo nor chocolate. But she insisted. Anyway, after a while, she told me that we'll get shampoo in a moment. So I waited 15 minutes before I called again. She said \"immediately\" and I waited another 10 minutes, sitting on the sofa at the entrance door. Then I called again and she informed me that the person had been there, knocked - but I didn't open. I told her that I'm sitting by the door, no TV, no radio, no iPod, no drugs, asked her if she has a wrong room number. She confirmed the right number and told me she'll call back. 5 minutes later she called and told me that the shampoo is now standing in front of the door. I opened - and guess what - no shampoo. 5 minutes later really somebody came, knocked and gave me a shampoo... More than 30 minutes waiting, wasting, for shampoo!

(Very) Comfy bed, clean, clean, clean. Love the toiletries. Great (24 hour for those with jetlag early wakening) gym. 2 minutes to Times Square subway and a panoply of subway lines to the rest of Manhattan. Handy indeed. And very close to the E line at 50th St straight out to the JFK airtrain if you want to avoid that big cab fare to the airport or touring umpteen hotels to pick up fellow passengers. That costs, and the costs are about average for the size of room we had in Times Square. You want cheap? You'll be walking a lot further. So, a great looking hotel in a brilliant location. BUT If you want a bath (not just a shower) make sure you ask for a room with one when you book (and online booking may not tell you). After a long day in the snow and minus 5 a shower doesn't always do the job. And you'll be living out of your suitcase. One clothes drawer and one shelf in the cupboard. We travel pretty light, but 2 people for 5 days with very variable weather means SOME luggage. And there's nowhere to put it. Ignore the \"table reserved\" signs in the lobby bar. They all are, and it's just to keep interlopers at bay. Don't expect rapid service in the bar either. Overall: a good hotel, which is a little up itself, but if you want facilities and location it ticks all those boxes.

For the hustle and bustle that is Times Square NY, the hotel property itself was very pleasant, clean, and modern. There were a few issues that I have yet to get over, even though three weeks have passed since our stay. W Hotel touts itself as a trendy, and dare I say sexy, contemporary resort. For me it was far from that. The purpose of my stay was a romantic pre-Christmas stay with my girlfriend prior to the family fun and chaos that Christmas brings. Upon arrival we checked in to the hotel and went to our room. The room was clean, trendy, and simple. We booked with our Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) points and paid an extra amount of points for an upgraded room. For an upgraded room, it was not worth the investment. (Not the first strike, but worth noting) We asked for a better view room to overlook Times Square which was available but they wanted $50 more for the night to move 4 rooms over. The hotel was rather empty and as a SPG who paid an upgrade points already, I would have hoped they would upgrade for no fee. Not the case so we declined. (Strike 1) After a hectic morning of travel, we just needed to take a rest before we hit the town and fell asleep immediately. Within 40 minutes or so of falling asleep, we were woken up by a loud knock on the door. Upon answering, we met a gentleman asking to change lighbulbs. Yes, woken up about an hour after checking in to change lightbulbs! For a hotel that claims to focus on comfort and the guest, this was not a good start. (Strike 2) We then went to the concierge for advice on broadway plays. Although polite and friendly he was not well informed. In fact, he mis-informed us about the showtimes for the play we wanted to see and we missed the deadline for the reduced price tickets and had to skip dinner to make the earlier showtime. A high end trendy hotel with a misinformed concierge? (Strike three) Then, after a wonderful night on the town, late into the evening, we had a wonderful nights sleep in a very comfortable bed. Then, it got worse. We were eager to sleep in and enjoy the serenity of the pleasant room and cozy bed, however, at about 8:30 am there was another knock on the door to wake us up (again). Half asleep I went to the door and found the staff member chose to wake us up and let us know there was a newspaper at the foot of the door. Waking guests up at 8:30am to tell you about a newspaper....Absurd! (Strike 4) The fifth and final strike was the worst. It was about 10am that same day. There was a brief knock at the door and then immediately the door flung wide open. This time, a staff member, who never waited for us to answer the door, rudely and ignorantly barged in the room and interrupted \"an intimate moment\" between me and my girlfriend. Extremely embarassing. We still have no idea why he just barged in the room. We remain shocked, embarassed, and angered by the experience. My girlfriend was extremely embarassed and ran to the bathroom crying. I did call the manager immediately and she was very polite and apologized. My SPG points were also refunded. Three weeks have passed and I am still disappointed in the stay, the staff, and the embarassing experience and this is why I chose to write this review. 5 strikes in one 24 hour period for a property of this caliber is simply unacceptable. This hotels claim of being trendy and sexy is true but the staff is poorly trained and inexperienced which can lead to missing a broadway play , scalping expensive tickets, missing dinner plans, and a crying girlfriend in the bathroom the day before Christmas. My recommendation is to consider the few other major hotels (i.e., Mariott or Double Tree) within a block of the W in Times Square and avoid this property until the staff can be suitably trained on guest relations.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cExcellent night stay\u201d", "Author": "charck", "ReviewID": "UR23359156", "Content": "I stayed at the W Times Square for one night on December 17, 2008 and was very happy with the experience. Valet was easy at the entrance on 47th St. (It is $65 (large car/suv) per 24 hours no in/out). Check - in was very quick and we were upgraded to a suite with Times Square views. It had two bathrooms, a wet bar, pull out couch and separate king size bedroom. The mattress was very comfortable as was the room overall. It had dual climate control zones and two enormous LCD tvs. We called housekeeping twice for pillows, etc. and they were brought up in minutes. Our room was on the 20th floor and did not have any problem with road noise - honking cars, etc. So many other reviews mentioned this, but it was not an issue for us. Also, in the lobby there was not loud music playing and it actually had a calm vibe to it during the day. When we returned late that night there were definitely people at the lobby lounge/bar but it still seemed pretty low key. We had an excellent breakfast in the hotel restaurant. The pumpkin ginger pancakes and smoked salmon platter were both great. All of the hotel employees that we encountered were pleasant and helpful - from the valet attendant, to housekeeping, to check-in, to restaurant staff (especially at the restaurant - it was very busy when we came in for breakfast (it was filled primarily with what looked like local businessmen and a few hotel guests), but the restaurant manager (seeing we were hotel guests) was very attentive and made space for us after a few minutes wait) As we were leaving we did notice that they have something called the Acura Experience or something like that. It's hotel sponsored program that provides free rides around the city in an Acura SUV, I think. We definitely would have made use of this if we had known of it. Also, at check in the hotel receptionist knew the pull-out couch would be used, but this must not have been communicated to housekeeping because the pull-out was not set up at turn-down. We had to call for extra blankets and pillows. I know this is minor, but it's so nice when these things are remembered by staff and I'm pleasantly surprised.

There was only one concierge and two bell hops for the entire hotel.

I brought back some pizza from my hotel room and called the Whatever/Whenever desk to get a microwave. They said they did not have them available to put in guests rooms, but the young lady said that she could connect me to room service and the could heat it for me. But when I spoke to room service, they said that they do not reheat outside food because it is a health hazard. She said that they will only reheat it if the food came from the hotel. When I asked if they would reheat food cooked by the hotel even if the guest had eaten from it, she said yes. That part threw me off... it's a health hazard if it was prepared outside the hotel and untouched, but not if the hotel prepared it and you've EATEN off of it???

I suspect they are not using the most durable materials, but this would be expected in an ultra contemporary decor that will probably look outdated and need to be remodeled again in 3-4 years.

This is usually police or fire sirens. I work in a NYC highrise, and the noise level is no worse in the hotel. Please understand this is Times Square, so if you are looking for a quiet hotel, this is not it. The staff were attentive and friendly.

Certainly, your welcome experience bears this out - the beautiful water feature as you enter, the stunning lounge area on the 7th floor and the genuine easy going and friendly welcome from the staff (who are, of course, way better dressed than you are.) Beyond the lobby, others have noted that the decor veers toward the dark and the industrial. The corridors in particular are like peculiar black holes; mildly off-putting, but the general calming effect does make some sense - and it's unlikely you'll spend much more than a few seconds in those areas as you're passing through. First impressions of the room itself were positive - if you can get over the fact that the room itself was disappointingly small for the price, but overall, the 'cool' vibe carries through - flatscreen HDTV, glass desk, views over Time Square, mood lighting and so on. The bathroom is well appointed with a great shower and refreshingly, a good set of toiletries, including a decent face wash to clear off all that New York grime. The bed was simply one of the best I've had in a hotel - and it needs to be, with the hustle and bustle of Times Square outside doing their best to keep you awake. Alas, after a short while of being in the room you begin to notice that the shine and gloss wears thin quite rapidly and it's clearly evident that the rooms are in dire need of a major facelift. Wallpaper peels from the corners of walls, dust is collecting on the skirting board, the air vents haven't been cleaned in months. The taps in the bathroom are dull and tarnished; the sink has cracks from years of use. The lamps are yellowing, the cover of your complimentary 'soothing' CD looks like it was found at the bottom of the bargain bin of the Virgin Megastore across the street.

They are equiped with shower, great Bliss tolietries (which are one of the reasons my wife loved the hotel - she has been dedicated to their products ever since), coffee machine and probably the best in-house movie system I have come across.

As other reviewers have said the lobby area does become a bit of a club/bar at night but this is part of the appeal of the hotel. You have to use the elevator to reach reception and the lobby bar is basically in an open-plan area by reception. There are no windows to the outside so you may feel that you are drinking at 1am when actually it is only 10pm outside. The waitresses are HOT! It is not cheap but not outrageously priced either. The gym is quite small but functional. We ate in the sushi bar on the groundfloor and it was excellent, the bar at the front of the hotel does an excellent seafood platter and combine this with a nice bottle of Sauvignon-Blanc or two and your afternoon is just about full, (as are you).

At no point did I feel obliged to tip, to be honest it was a pleasure to do so. The elevators are operated by key-card so security is good. I am one of those people who has to have a window open at night, New York is noisy so if this is you be prepared. If the window was closed the noise was negligent. The hotel is on Times Square which is bright but the blinds on the windows are good. As you would expect there is a good selection of bars and restaurants in the area but the best we tried was Budda Bar in the Meat-Packing District, (take a taxi), it was unbelievable. We also had a great meal in Grand Central Station, I'm sorry but I can't remember the name of the place - its looking over the main concourse. Overall, if you are looking for place to stay as a tourist then I would recommend the hotel. If you are looking for a hotel with large public areas then you may want to try one of the Grand-Dame NYC hotels but you may pay a high price. I would certainly recommend the W Hotel and hope to go back some day.", "Date": "May 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat classy place\u201d", "Author": "RedRaider05", "ReviewID": "UR16035604", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon for 5 nights and absolutely loved the W.

Other than that, there are problems... This was my second stay at this property, but the first since 2004. The entry to the hotel is on 47th street, and is only an elevator lobby that takes you up to 7 which is the main lobby (or Living Room) as W likes to say. During the daytime, the lobby is a nice enough space with check in located off in an alcove. At night, the lobby turns into a nightclub. A source of revenue for the hotel - but very limiting to the paying guests who have no public area within the hotel to gather or relax outside of the room. There is also the Whiskey Bar separate from the Lobby on street level (part of Blue Fin Restaurant, I think), but the W feels they also need to turn the lobby into a nightclub as well. It seeems to work for them as it was packed and loud every night. For the hotel guests, it was annoying. The rooms are small and with exception of those ending in 10 or 11, have very limited views (facing either Marriott Marquis or an office building). Rooms ending in 10 & 11 face Broadway north toward Central Park, and if you are on a higher floor, you may even have a Park view. Actually, the rooms ending in 11 seem to have a larger floorplan with a sitting area. There are only 10 rooms per floors with 57 being the highest floor. What I noticed on this visit was how the rooms have aged - not very well. I didn't find them to be dirty, as I had read in previous reviews. Everything was nice & clean. But they did seem very dated. The W is marketed as a trendy, boutique hotel. And they also try to sell a luxury image. I found this hotel failing both categories. The furnishings in the room were pretty beaten up, and just seemed cheap. The 'chair' they use is a white leather-like cube with no arms. Basically, it's an ottoman sitting in the corner with absolutely no function as a chair for lounging. You can physically sit on it, but not for long as it is just not comfortable. Which leaves the bed as the only place in the room to sit. If this were a less expensive property, that would be one thing. But the prices are quite high and this hotel participates in several luxury hotel collections (Amex Fine Hotels being one), which indicates a certain level of luxury and services. With that in mind, I have rated this property with only 3 stars. I'll list a few positives and negatives that stood out: The Good (in addition to location): + Bell Staff were very attentive and seemed genuinely interested in guest service + Nice flat panel TV's with nice range of channels (though only a very few were HD) + A good deli next door, which proved necessary as the Blue Fin restaurant only opened for limited hours. It had good selection of food and reasonable pricing + Comfortable Bed The Bad: - Rooms were small & furnishings were greatly lacking - Very small bathrooms - Lots of noise coming from hallways into the room (seemed like much of it was hotel staff servicing rooms during the day) - No climate control in the rooms (Forget the thermostat on the wall) - Limited usable public space and restaurant choice SUMMARY - Great location for theater and a nice, comfortable bed for sleeping.

The negatives first: This hotel tries SO HARD to be hip that it's almost laughable. However, I don't think people who are really hip would ever actually stay in a Times Square hotel. Much less a hotel that is only moderate to high priced by NYC standards. Browsing the gift shop is kind of a giveaway too. Pretty low-end merchandise. The room we had was quite small and the bath room was tiny. The bathroom had a sliding door with a frosted glass panel. It served a dual purpose of seeming hip, while helping to mitigate the tightness of the bathroom. Supposedly our room was an upgrade (and it was a corner room) so the regular rooms must be even smaller. The room was nicely furnished except for some random, cheap-looking throw pillows. Almost all the surfaces in the public areas are black or charcoal gray. This color scheme, combined with the cheesy mood lighting makes it difficult to see. It's annoying, but the W in Murray Hill is even worse as far as that goes (and not as nice in other ways, too). I agree with the other reviewer who said that the bathroom wasn't as maintained as it should have been. If I'm going to have a room that small I want it to be a jewel box. The lobby is an elevator ride up from the front entrance. Then you go to a separate elevator bank to get up to your room. The floors are mislabeled, so that it seems as though you are on a higher floor than you really are. This is only a minor inconvenience. The positives: We had a pretty nice view. The Bliss products that they stock the room with are nice. There is a restaurant right off the front entrance area that is supposed to be pretty fun. There was a pretty long line at check-in and it was handled really, really well. It went quite quickly and the desk staff was friendly and efficient. The bellhops were terrific. Friendly and fast. The concierge was nice, but not all that helpful. He didn't have knowledge of our requests so it was frustrating to watch him surf the internet slower than I could have. However, our requests were probably not standard and we were in a rush, so I can't really fault him. He did the best he could. Housekeeping was also very friendly. Quiet in the halls and they would immediately push the elevator button for you if they saw you coming. A little thing, but evidence of training. Overall, it was a small, dark hotel with trendy decor that only partially distracts from it's shortcomings (lipstick on a pig). But it has a surprisingly nice and professional staff.

First of all, the bathroom was not all that clean, especially on the floor, around the tub, and in all the corners. When you're going to have a white bathroom, it better be clean. We also didn't like the design of the bathroom, which was walled off by white, plastic translucent walls that are far from light- or sound-proof, which creates a lack of privacy as well as a problem if someone is trying to use the bathroom while others are sleeping. I think they were going for some kind of modern look, but I'd far prefer standard, sound-proofed walls! In the sleeping area, many things seemed grimy, dusty, or sticky, including the phones, tables, remote controls and radio. I don't think any of these items had been wiped down for quite some time. The room was quite small, but I would expect that in Times Square. I booked on hotels.com, and paid extra to be put on a higher floor, but didn't get that. The front desk said I needed proof that I had paid extra and hotel.com's receipt is suspicously vague on details, so I had no recourse on this matter. Traffic noise is definitely a problem unless you are on one of the top floors. As to the amenities outside of the room. There is only one lounge area, and it is basically a bar. Not family friendly, and not comfortable if you want to hang out or wait for someone.

If you suffer from poor vision, looking for a family hotel or are just plain old, you should probably give this a miss. Luckily my wife and I have excellent vision and are under 40, and we had a great time. The W is achingly hip and makes no apologies for it. The main lobby has a huge stylish bar filled with the young and beautiful of New York which made it quite noisy on the Friday eve we arrived, but I prefer to think of it as full of life. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. We were booked into the 'Wonderful' Room which is their smallest, but they put us into a corner room with great views, and provided complementary cheeseboard and wine. The room was quite small, but in the middle of New York I had no other expectations, neither was it particularly noisy even with the window open. Seriously, I don't understand people who complain about outdoor noise and lights. You are in Times Square, for crying out loud. You don't like noise, stay out of the city, it's as simple as that. I would point out that clothes hooks in the bathroom were seriously lacking, and the bathrooms could do with a touch-up, but nothing deal-breaking. The location is unbeatable, the metro is right across the street and the half-price theatre ticket booth is just around the corner. The concierges are friendly and informative, pointing us toward the best restaurants and bars in the area. There are 2 convenience stores within a 5-second walk of the front door so you can stock up on treats and drinks, rather than the high-price minibar goods. BTW the tapwater is perfectly drinkable, for all those bottled water snobs out there. Later during the stay we moved up to one of the suites on the 53rd floor, fantastic views from here, nothing rivals the Manhattan skyline at sunrise from a King-size bed! We had breakfast at the Blue Fin restaurant twice and it was excellent both times. Much pricier than the nearby deli, but you get what you pay for. We paid about \u00c2\u00a3175 per night and I would definitely check in here again, in fact I'm very keen on checking out other W hotels in the future. Special thanks go to Walter at the front desk for his good cheer and top-class service, and Dana in the Spa for a great massage.

We are frequent travelers who prefer upscale hotels with excellent amenities. Having stayed at several W Hotels before (including another W Hotel in New York), we were excited about our upcoming stay. Our rate was approximately $400 per night but included a bonus third night free. The hotel is in an excellent location in the heart of Times Square. The check-in service was quick, though it can be a bit like trying to order a drink in a crowded club (the desk is located just across from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very active bar). You also begin to notice how dark everything is, including the lobbies and the elevators; if you are a person who craves sunlight, your time here will not be pleasant. Once in the room I found it to be an acceptable size (based on NYC standards) and nicely finished. The furniture is contemporary and sleek with a touch of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 factor. The bathroom is well done but lacks privacy. Only a thin plastic wall and matching door separate it from the rest of the room, offering little barrier to light and sounds. Also, the bed used is a far cry from the Heavenly Bed used in other Starwood offerings, offering a surface far below most pillow top mattresses. One item that came to be an issue during my stay was the temperature and ventilation control for the room. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read other mentions of problems here on the site and it seems to not be an isolated issue. You may have no problems at all in your room, or you may find yourself in a mini-sauna for the durations of your visit\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gamble. Another issue this hotel does it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to deal with (and gets mixed results for) is the noise level. Double-pane windows keep much of the city noise out, but thin doors mean that you will hear the neighbors as they come and go. Mixed reviews also have to go to the hotel staff. Nice touches abound (such as cupcakes and hot chocolate at the front desk) but a lack of willingness/ helpfulness in addressing problems result in low overall marks for service. After staying in some excellent W Hotel/Starwood properties, as well as some other good NYC hotels, I can only recommend the W Times Square to those who wish for easy access to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on-site nightlife.

Every time I go, it is like the first time I have ever been there as far as they are concerned. 3. Don't bother with the Whiskey, downstairs, which is ten years past its prime.

Not so much for the sheets & duvet -- which are good but nothing exceptional -- but for the firm mattress.

Trendites everywhere. We had two different rooms, as due to flight changes, they couldn't add another night onto our original eight-night booking. We had to have separate bookings - & a separate room, which we found a little ridiculous with today's technology! The promised 'personal transfer' of our baggage after the first night into the new room never occured. By 4pm, no move, no new room etc. After shaking them up, we were eventually moved to another room nearby on the same floor. The elevators and corridors (as per other comments), are certainly very dim. Our corridor (37th floor) always smelled badly of old kitchen/garbage smells. On a positive note, the beds and pillows are fabulous and very comfy. On the negative side, our room was extremely stuffy and the aircon had one temp. \"Hot and Stuffy\"!. We complained several times but it was never fixed, or perhaps could not be. Therefore, we had bad nights' sleep as it was so warm, but to open the window (which we did often) was extremely noisy with the traffic and continual sirens from the street below. Also, in our 8 nights in this room, three bulbs went, bedside and two in the bathroom. We had to continually ask for them to be replaced, one in the bathroom was never replaced and it is so dim in there it made it even dimmer! Also, there is very little place in the bathroom or the room for that matter to place your goodies. Shelfless, modern, grey, clutter free design I suppose. No sofa or comfy chair to sit on - only your bed. As I noted above, your experience here would be luck of the draw as a girlfriend who travelled with us had the opposite problem with her aircon in her room, 10 floors above. It was blowy and cold!

The concierges were helpful and friendly, though you have often to wait 10-15 minutes. However, that's about all the praise for this hotel. Now for the bad part: The walls are really really thin, so if your neighbour is coughing, you'll check if he might be standing in your room. 3907 is right next to the ice-machine and the ice-machine-room-door is not closing properly, so you'll hear quite some banging. The bathroom is tiny and hasn't been properly cleaned in ages (water stains everywhere). The TV-sideboard has a 5-inch-gap between the drawers and the mini-bar - that gap was probably the dirtiest place I have seen in any hotel in the past few years. The glass-table was also as dirty as one could imagine it to be; the fingerprints that were there upon arrival were still there upon departure. Many people bring pizzas or coffee from the neighbourhood into the hotel, so don't be surprised to see all the fast-food junk in the corridor (and don't let me even mention the smell). W makes a big deal about its design - don't let it fool you. Design translates here into minimalism in all aspects, not into quality. I believe that there are better hotels at much better rates, even considering the W's prime location. And, lest I forget: We've left our luggage for storage (our flight home was only in the early evening) and had to learn that they were unable to retrieve it.

The lobby is located on the 7th floor in a multicolor bar on the right and the 4 check-in desks on the left. My SPG status scored me a corner room on the 48th floor which a separate rows of speedy elevators brings me there in an ear-popping instance. The elevator and hallway is club-level lighting using spot lights, good for eyesights training. Unfortunately, in the her speedy time to get off the clock, the check-in lady has given me the wrong key to the wrong room. Another speedy ride down the lobby took care of it. My WOW Fabulous room or whatever it is called is well as hip as the entrance. The dark spa-like tone is accented with some trendy touch here and there (white reading couch and red fluffy pillow). The room is larger than the usual NY room but just by a tiny bit. The two large windows flanking each corner provides good daylight to fill the room. The business desk gives a partial direct view down to Broadway (and the building in front) on one side and a great view to the Hudson river on the other (my favorite view). The windows can also be opened (limited) to remove stale air if needed. The room is equipped with a clock-CD alarm and a nice 32\" LG LCD screen with more HD programming than I have seen elsewhere. On the bad side, the wall is paper-thin and when you have noisy neighbor, the street sound is next to nothing. The W bed is fabulous, it tied with the Westin Heavenly Bed as my favorite. Turn-down service is performed every day around 6-7PM and the \"Not Now\" sign is observed. The bathroom is either an exercises of industrial coolness or just trying too hard to be different. I feels that it is more on the former, the attention to the details are not there: the sink is cracked, the shower leaks, screws are exposed. This is not the level of a $600/night room should look like even if it is in the middle of NY. The saving grace is the bath amenities, the Bliss products are superb. A warning for bathtub lovers, there is only standing showers. On the service side, after check-in in, I was thirsty and found that the VOSS water bottle seal has been broken but the bottle is full. I think the previous guess decided that the $4/bottle was too expensive after using it. I called down to the guest service twice but no-one answered, so much for the whenever-whatever service. I let the check-in desk know the next day and by the time that I left, the same water bottle is still there. On my third day, the ice-machine next to my door broke down and spill water all over the front of my door. A call downstairs and a noisy fan was put in to dry it up. The only thing is that they did not shut it off and I had to come out around 11PM to pull the cord so that I can go to sleep. The Blue Fin restaurant serves decent food. I once forgot my wallet on the table while going to my room to get my phone and my waiter noticed it and hide it for me, nice service here. Location wise, it is one of the hot properties in Times Square but getting a cab in rush hour can be a killer. In short, if you want a hip weekend stay, this may be the place for you.

Unfortunately, even with these factors working for it, W New York - Times Square tries too hard to be trendy and ends up pulling off a forced style that's neither cutting-edge nor inviting. The hotel's futuristic \"living room\" felt more like a nightclub than a lobby, and the pulsating techno music and light show blasting on the suspended pillars only added to this effect. Another thing that hit us as soon as we walked in was the floral air-freshener scent permeating the entire building. This might have been pleasant were it not so overwhelming. After discovering that our room wasn't ready at check-in, we left our bags with a polite concierge and walked around Times Square. The desk associate said she would call me when my room was ready, but after 3 hours and no call we headed back, ready to take whatever room they had. A high-speed elevator sped us to the 44th floor and discharged us into a dark, spaceship-like hallway with black walls and extremely low lighting. It was like walking into a laser tag building. I was hoping our room would be more inviting than the hallways, but the steel-gray color scheme and cold metallic accoutrements made the already tiny space feel closed and uninviting. One of our pillows was stained and dirty, and the chipped paint and worn fixtures throughout hinted to frequent use, infrequent maintenance or both. All services inside and outside the room will cost you a pretty penny on top of the mint you've already paid for the room itself. Even the bottled water, which is free in most of the lower-tier Sheraton hotels, was $6 a bottle. Yikes! For a hotel rated so high by Starwood I expected much more. On the bright side our \"spectacular room\" view lived up to its billing, and the shower was great. The location is superb, but for the price there is better to be had in midtown Manhattan.

I have to say, that despite some of the reviews on here, I found it an absolutely fabulous stay and none of us wanted to come home! The maid service, concierge assistance, decor, quality of the rooms and the staff in general were all absolutely fantastic. The only down sides I can think of where when we received a phone call on around the 7th day to ask if anybody had been smoking in the room as the smoke detectors had been activated. We mentioned that none of us had smoked or ever smoked in our lives, they still proceeded to charge \u00c2\u00a3200 to the account. We realised this under the 'account review' facility on the television in the room and we quickly alerted this to their attention and they quickly removed it. However, they had put it under the subject of 'restaurant charge' which I thought was rather sneaky, so make sure you check your account quite reguarly and make sure your stay is totalled up correctly. Also on the last day the toilets blocked in both of our rooms but the maid service was quick and it was fixed within the hour, so that wasn't a problem. On regard to the room, the showers also slightly overflowed in both rooms, but only slightly and bath mats are provided. It was my mother's and my birthday whilst we was there, and we received a teddy bear, a bottle of champage, balloons and two slices of cake which was very generous of them. I think this may have something to do with the fact that my father had had a lot of contact with one of the staff prior to arrival asking questions about New York in general as it was our first visit. Her name was Lydia Chaperone and she was incredibly helpful and made our trip perfect for us. She is definitely a credit to the hotel, so I would always ask for her assistance. Kelly on the concierge desk also got us into some great restaurants and shows during our stay and gave us some great advice which would benefit us financially instead of simply thinking about the hotel's income from ticket brokers etc. The location of the hotel is fantastic - right in the centre of Times Square and a couple of blocks away from Broadway. I can't really comment on the value of the hotel, as my father and mother paid for a suite and then from the points earnt at starwood hotels, they paid for our room with those. I personally think you get value for money as the rooms are quite big for a city and the staff were absolutely brilliant. However, my father suggested that next time if we were to come again, we may rent an apartment as it would most likely work out cheaper, but for first time New Yorkers, it's a great way to get a feel for the city and they guide you along the way with the best things to see and do. Manhattan is an absolutely fantastic place to be. It is the ultimate city in my opinion and I have visited many. Central Park provides a calm from the hectic city life and places such as Soho and Greenwich Village are not too busy as the main areas too and are great for a coffee and a walk to get a feel for New York. The people were very friendly too. All in all a great break and such a refreshing taste of life. If not a little crazy!

The first and best thing I have to say about the hotel is that the staff is so friendly and very accomodating. I had Michael at the concierge desk helping me, and together we planned the entire trip and he took care of arrangements for everything - even VIP seating at Yankees Stadium! Even an odd request for a restaurant that has white truffle macaroni & cheese didn't phase them, they had a list for me the next day. The maids and front desk clerks are all very polite and professional as well. Two different nights they sent us bottles of champagne with chocolate-covered strawberries, on the house, and they also had a great doggy nanny service (yes, they take pets!) The rooms are small (we got an upgraded room but it was still tiny), but we knew NYC hotel rooms are tiny going in and the way they have the rooms decorated, they feel a lot bigger than they are. We had huge windows overlooking Times Square, and the room has block light walls and mirrors all over to give it an open feeling. The room (and the hotel) are decorated beautifully ... very modern and trendy, yet somehow classic as well. They were working on their lobby/living room but even through construction it is a stunning space. And the rumors are true - the best beds EVER, you are surrounded by down and the sheets were divine. Very soft, after a long day in the sun walking it was nice to slip into those cool sheets! Now to the (minor) negative things that prevented me from giving a 5-star rating - our air conditioning went down to 65 the first night, but after that it would stop running if we turned it below 69. We like quite a chilly room (especially with the heavy comforters on the bed) and the AC didn't really seem to keep up all the time. Another complaint is we saw a silverfish in the bathroom, it ran under a barely see-able crack in the floor before we could kill it but that was the only one we saw. Surprised us because the room and hotel look immaculate otherwise. Our only other complaint would be the noise - we were given a room right across from the maid's closet and in the mornings all we could hear were them constantly opening and closing the doors, getting stuff out, talking, vaccuuming, etc. There wasn't a lot keeping hallway noise out of the room. Also, you can hear the traffic from the street below. It never kept either of us from sleeping, but very light sleepers may want to be aware you will faintly hear honking and sirens all night long.

After we got settled into our room, that same young woman came up with a balloon and package of free souveniers for a graduation present, along with a handwritten card! It really made my trip. The room had a sort of modern art theme, and had two rooms (since we booked the large suite.) The view was magnificent. The beds were very comfortable. The art and setup of the room was unlike anything I've ever seen before. Even the minifridge was neat; it had all different types of snacks, products, even a tshirt and teddy bear! I admit they were expensive, but if you're the type to splurge every once in a while, it's for you. The furniture is both comfortable and creative. The room overall is just incredible. The lounge had a bar, and a bunch of cozy areas to sit and chat. In the evenings it's very busy (which is good if you want to meet people), but during the day and before 6:00 it's a quiet area to relax in. You could just sit there and look at the cosmopolitan modern decorations and furniture for hours and never get bored. It also has free internet acess, whereas in the room there's a fee. The lounge and lobby is on the second level; the first level is an entrance with water on the roof and walls (very worth seeing!) The room service, and everything else about this hotel was excellent!

The hotel is perfectly located in Times sqaure and the entrance to the hotel is very impressive...... like being in a waterfall. Our check in was fine and the receptionist was very pleasant.

It seemed to be a problem for them to change travellers cheques and they imposed a $200 limit per room per day (which doesn't go far in Manhattan).

They did change their mind however when I persisted as it was our last day and we needed the cash for a taxi to the airport.

My wife and I stayed 4 nights (Thursday to Monday in mid-May, 2007). First of all, I booked through the Starwood hotel chain website, which seemed to make sense after poking around for endless hours looking at various hotel and booking options. The comparatively reasonable cancellation policy on their website appealed to me, and (prepare to contain yourself) you can redirect your Starwood points, or whatever they are, to certain other loyalty programs like Aeroplan. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure I saved two percent on the whole deal, and all those hours of travel surfing were not in vain. Note that to do this, you have to sign up in advance for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preferred guest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd card that they mail out to you, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free to sign up. Anyway, for what was ostensibly a better than average room (i.e., corner room on 38th floor looking west across the Hudson river) we forked out $429 a night (plus taxes made it around $490 a night). Having never been to NY before we had no idea if this represented a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value proposition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when compared to other similarly pricey hotels. The hotel is newish, though the odd sign of wear is now visible. The staff did their jobs well on the few occasions we had to actually interact with them (ee.gg., at check in, to get a cab, breakfast servers in restaurant downstairs, send up a guy with replacement room key when ours did not work, leave bags behind for the day on our day of departure, buying stuff in the trendy hotel shop). The room was clean, large enough not to bump into things, the tap water was quite drinkable, the shower had good water pressure, there were lots of towels (some of which can be sacrificed to keep the shower from soaking the whole bathroom floor), the king bed was comfortable, the flat screen TV hanging on the wall had numerous channels and a DVD player (who stays in to watch videos whilst in NY, anyway?), there was a little el cheapo CD player, two nice comfy robes, and also an astonishing array of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd brand crap that you can buy, laid out right there in the room like so many bags of chips. And, of course, an over-priced mini bar. We really did enjoy coming back to the room after pounding the NY pavement all day and falling onto the big plush bed, though I appreciate this sounds cheesy. Note that you will need top quality ear plugs at this hotel. The north end of Times Square is right below you, very brightly lit, full of much honking and many all-night sirens, and as a bonus the clowns down the hall on Saturday night will try to drain the ice machine (at least I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they were doing), shout at each other, and then lock themselves out of their room, in which room there may be a roommate, but there is only one way to find out if they are in there. Mind you, once you block out all the noise you can really appreciate the nice bed. We had the feather pillows, and they were a touch squishy, good for stomach sleepers, but I think next time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask for foam. Basically it is a good hotel, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite get who the target market is. I am assuming the hotel is probably too expensive for most youthful lounge-and-club hipsters at whom the incessant sound track in the common areas seems to be aimed. The lighting in the elevators is so dim I actually had to bend over to read the numbers on the buttons (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brail on them, though, so I had that to fall back on). The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is ideal for catching Broadway shows nearby, and quite central for most of the top 10 touristy things. Most people there looked as I imagine we did \u00e2\u20ac\u201c vaguely annoyed with day 3 of the whole tangerine wheatgrass cool-as-zen \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scene, but also happy to be in NY and able to afford a good bed and good ear plugs. Other things in NY that warrant special mention: the Staten Island ferry (seems to depart on the hour and half hour, great views, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free, but they make you get off and then on again at the Staten Island end before coming back to Manhattan); the view from the top of the Rockefeller centre (a swift $17.50 each plus tax; maybe go at odd hours so as not to line up; good shopping nearby); and in the far-from-free category, attending the Metropolitan Opera (buy your tickets way in advance from the Met website for box office pick-up, and then phone to make a 6 p.m. reservation at the very nice Gran Tier restaurant that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also in the opera house (note that the restaurant crowd is dressier than average NY opera attendee) and then before finishing your very nice dinner, be sure to arrange for your waiter to pre-order your intermission chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9 (we found the house champagne was quite doable with it) and then go back to your table at intermission and enjoy it while the mob lines up at the bar.

They had promised a conference room with a T1 line where we could do post-production work. But when we got there, there was no internet line at all, and what they ultimately hooked up was no better than bad dial-up. The person arranging the room did not have a clue about internet connections, which would be fine in 1997, but not in 2007. And then, they lost the video deck that had been delivered to the hotel for us, so we were at a standstill for four hours. They did apologize but in an utterly lackluster way, like they were used to screwing up. The best they could do was offer some free food, which wasn't much comfort given that we had to stay up until 3 p.m. to make up for their mistake. And when all was said and done, they tried to charge us for \"package handling\" for the equipment they lost.

The location is great to get out & about from, there are a few subway stops nearby & cabs right outside plus Times Square is just around the corner. I would say that most of the money has been spent on the communal areas & the room we had left a lot to be desired. The entrance is very impressive with the waterfall that cascades over the glass ceiling is cool. The darker than dark lifts and bar area are uber cool too. We had a quick dance in the lifts inbetween each floor, on our own of course! It was all very Sex in the City stylee with a price tag to match. Your looking at around $12 a drink, which soon stacks up if you are thirsty & want more than a glass of ice. We have stayed in NYC before & are aware that space is at a premium so I wasn't expecting a big room. I was however hopeful of heating in the winter & also a quiet room at night. There was a massive aircon unit in the corridor outside out room that clanked & clunked all night long. The room itself was a little bit tired, considering this is referred to as 5 star, it isn't. There was a stain on the quilt, the bathroom had bits of mould on some of the grout & was freezing to step out of the shower into. The bliss toiletries were nice & were replenished every day. The gym has an assortment of free weights & a couple of cardio machines, there are no showers/sauna or steam. I had a deep tissue massage while we stayed here & felt the benefit the next day, in fact I'm still feeling it now after 7 weeks. I would recommend a trip to Michael if your back/shoulders are knotted, he put me through pain but it was worth it! They have heated massage beds, which was a first for me but v.nice. The restaurant has a good menu & is worth a visit if you can't be bothered to venture too far. As someone else has mentioned, there is a deli about 2 doors up the road (going away from Times Square) and I would highly recommend it for coffee & breakfast, cold drinks to put in the mini bar (the mini bar is a rip-off $12 for bottled water) and the selection of hot food etc is fantastic. If I had a deli like that in London I would stop shopping/cooking. If you carry on walking in the same direction across a couple of blocks you will end up at Hells Kitchen, there are loads of places to eat round here we tried the Chelsea Grill which had a nice vibe.

As with other Ws, the Bliss bathroom products are some of the best I have seen. As guests of the hotel, we didn't have to pay the $20 cover charge at the Whiskey club downstairs which was a nice extra (even though the club was on the cheesy side playing mainstream hip hop for a suburban looking crowd). So why 4 rather than 5 stars? Mostly it is an issue of price. The $450 price tag for a nice room - while OK for NYC these days - does not feel like great value.

We liked certain things about it such as the cool waterfall effect as you walk in, the bed was comfortable, the large HDTV was great, the elevators were good, and the staff and service was attentive. Check-in and check-out were done very expeditiously. The room was clean, and plenty of plush towels were provided. We asked for a wakeup call and received it on time. We ordered breakfast to be delivered to the room at 8 AM, and our order arrived a few minutes early and was perfect. The food was quite good. What I did not like was that this hotel seemed to be designed for the business traveler, and I thought the room was not female friendly. We were there to attend a big family party. I was rather taken aback to find that, although the bathroom was rather large, there was a lot of wasted space in it. It needed more hooks and shelves. The thing that bothered me the most was that the sink had almost no room to spread out my makeup items for application, there was a makeup mirror but it was mounted way too high for a woman who is, like me, average height (5'4\"), and the lighting in the bathroom was way too dim to see what I was doing! They provide nice, plush bathrobes, found in the closet, but there was no hook to hang it up in the bathroom. (The bathroom had a pocket door instead of a regular door.) The room itself had several lights, but all of the lights were dim. We find that to be very annoying. The room was very small, hardly larger than the king-sized bed, with decor that was kind of austere and high-tech, not at all comfortable or homey. There were 2 chairs in the room, but neither one was comfortable. Our room was obviously designed for very short stays! We never would have wanted to stay in that room for more than the one night. The decor gave us an uneasy, edgy feel instead of the relaxing effect we had been needing & hoping for. We heard a LOT of noise from the hallways late at night. A drawerful of snacks is in the room; I had to stop my husband from taking any because he did not realize that we would be charged for them....he thought they were included in the price of the room! No way! A plus is that right next door there is a nice deli with all kinds of food, snacks, sandwiches and drinks available. I had a roast beef sandwich from that deli and it was great!

Everything looked very new and had a modern flair. This is the nicest place I have stayed in New York (I have also stayed at the Renaissance Times Square.) The size of the room was quite adequate- we had space to move around. I was able to request a room with a view- we had a view of Broadway below. I was also able to request a room with a bathtub- most of the rooms here only have showers. There was only one chair in the room- at the desk. This presented a small problem when we ordered room service because one of us had to sit on the bed and the other in the chair and eat at the table provided with the room service. We were in a bit of a hurry but I am sure they would have provided a chair if we had time to request one. The rooms were elegant and a soft cd is playing when you walk in, and plays constantly throughout your stay (there is a cd player.) The hotel also hosts a restaurant- the blue fin- which was also impressive. The atmosphere was like a los angeles scene but also very relaxing. The food was incredible. I ordered the filet mignon, medium well. It came out perfect. I often have problems with medium well steaks in even five star restaurants, but not here. Every portion of the meal was wonderful- down to the dessert. Much thought went into the preparation and creation of each course. The Whiskey Nite Club is also in the hotel. Even on Sunday, this place was a place to be. It has a unique atmosphere and a vip section one can reserve for parties. The music is basically top 40 dance music, with not much variation. It was worth checking out. There are not many seats there, so be prepared to stand. There is a coat check for $2 per coat. As for some other things about the hotel- it is in a great location. The valet parking was worth it, but was expensive- $62 per night. It goes on a 24 hour basis- so if you arrive before check in, you can still check your car and have until the same time the next day to get it back. However, there are no in-out privileges with the car. The room-service breakfast was good quality as well. It was expensive- we paid close to $100 for breakfast, and each only had one basic meal with only one extra juice and one extra order of bacon. That included the tip. We had a slight problem with the bill- we were charged for an umbrella from the mini-bar that we didn't take. A short call to the hotel remedied this immediately. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in New York. You can't beat the accommodations, the staff, the luxury, the location, and the atmosphere.

I don't have exceptionally high standards when it comes to beds, but this was just rock hard. The room was OK, stained carpet, torn furniture, etc. It was clean, and it had everything you needed, so if you don't mind those little things, then no big deal.

You're right there, in the middle of it all, and I'd recommend it for young couples/singles, but I wouldn't recommend it for families. Check-in/reception is actually on Level 7 - You take the elevators up to Level 7 (every time), and from there you take your designated elevator to your floor. Food was good, but certainly not worth the expense, and well, you're in NYC - get out there and hit one of the many, MANY fabulous restaurants. I would recommend any of my single friends to stay, but I've actually stayed at The Time, a couple of years ago, and I would recommend that first. It's also in the mix (just off Times Sq), and is quiet, well appointed, and friendly. Speaking with Concierge, and Reception is extremely difficult as afternoon turns to evening. They're right in-front of the bar, in an wide-open hard-walled area.

The room was in dire need of decoration, drab and small. The bathroom was mouldy and had a strange smell.

We reported this twice as the carpet outside our room was drenched.

We come up several times a year for both business and pleasure and are quite at home here. Was a little concerned about staying right in the heart of Times Square (touristy, crowded) as we usually stay down in Soho. But we got a great deal through Starwood so decided to check it out. I'm glad we did. From the moment we arrived, great, great service. The bell staff was attentive and polite the whole stay. The front desk was wonderful, even with a busy lobby of people checking out all at once. We arrived 6 hours before official check-in simply hoping to stow our luggage. They asked us to wait in the Living Room where we surfed the free wi-fi while they coordinated with the cleaning staff to have our room ready as quickly as possible. We couldn't believe it when they came to get us in less than an hour. The room was definitely NYC small. Almost too small. And the bathroom was a tight fit. But the furnishings were chic and the beds incredibly, incredibly comfy, the amenties top notch and the view spectacular. The hallways were a bit dim but never a serious problem. Someone had mentioned earlier about the confusion over the elevators. I'm not sure why since it only took one time for the staff to show us the details and even when coming in late at night with a few cocktails under our belts, we zipped up to our rooms without getting lost. The Living Room in the p.m. was a blast. Lot of people and good music. We ended up talking to a group of people at the bar who turned out to be a favorite band of ours. Small world. Drinks are a bit pricey but no surprise in NYC. Bar service started out great but by the end of the evening the bartenders were obviously just phoning it in and preferred to chat amongst themselves rather than take drink orders or ring up tabs. Whether you stay here or not, you MUST eat at the Blue Fin in the hotel. EXCELLENT seafood and sushi-very fresh. (We are from a coastal area and are very picky about our seafood.) Service was fantastic and the scene was great for people watching. We had a dinner and two lunches there and were never disappointed. Don't miss it. Maid service was efficient. They came a bit early one morning though in their defense we forgot our do not disturb sign. Once we put that up we weren't bothered at all. And our room was clean when we returned from shopping later that day. The Club downstairs was ok-crowded, music not to our liking but we really didn't spend much time there. Make sure you have a full wallet. A round of shots can set you back serious money. Check out was slower than check-in. The guy seemed new and made several mistakes. But as always, attentive, professional and very nice and very genuine. We never got an attitude from anyone there except a little from the bartender that one late nite. In a nutshell, we'd go back again due to the great service, the incredible beds and the Blue Fin. Weaknesses would have to be the location and the tight room.

While we were in NY for business, we wanted to stay in a location where we could take in being \"tourists\" in the evenings after work. It took us several weeks trying to find the right hotel (since there are SO MANY in NY and can be overwhelming to choose), and this one came recommended. Our first impression of the hotel was cool, hip & trendy. We're in our 30's and, being in the fashion industry, we felt this was a very unique hotel and felt right at home....UNTIL......we realized that the hotel is all \"hype\", and no substance! The rooms were small, but that's expected being that it's NY. But what really got to us was the PAPER THIN WALLS...even the walls WITHIN the room (ie. walls / doors to the bathroom). The door to the bathroom is like one of those japanese paper-made sliding doors that doesn't even close all the way so you literally have no privacy whatsoever. We could hear EVERYTHING that was going on next door on both sides of our room. Conversations (at normal talking level..in other words, they weren't talking loud or yelling), TV, the water running...even VERY PERSONAL situations if you know what I mean. It was very difficult to sleep at night! Other frustrating things about this hotel: the hallways are pitch black w/ these funky blue lights or some other dim color lights; You have to take 2 elevators to get to your room; We needed assistance from the bellman 4 times during our stay, and each time (and I'm not exxagerating), we had to wait at least 10 minutes to get someone to help us; and when they did finally come to help us, they acted like we were bothering them! One of us in our group even tried to get one of the bellman's attention and the bellman walked away to a room and slammed the door on our face!! Lastly, the guys outside helping you to get cabs NEVER greeted us unless there was a door they could open or some way they could get a tip from us.... It was disgusting. Positive point: the staff that worked at the check-in counter were all extremely helpful & courteous! Whenever we needed help with our room key, or with Fed Ex mail, or even needing an umbrella (it started pouring outside on 1 day)...they went out of their way to assist us promptly. So kudos to them! They made our stay bearable. But overall, what I initially thought was a cool, friendly & service-oriented hotel, turned out to be so not what I expected! The W / Times Square Hotel just comes in a \"pretty package\" w/ great marketing...but the service overall is not acceptable and the quality of the hotel is mediocre. Frankly, I think they try WAY too hard to be trendy....that they forget that all their guests want is to be comfortable, feel pampered....& feel right at home.

Yes the place was very modern and dark. It is by not means a traditional hotel but we enjoyed it. Our room size was fine the bed was very comfy (maybe a little bit short for US standards) especially the pillows and since back home I shall buy one from their website (as I do miss it it was sooo comfy). We were on the 36th floor so not very high and had a view of another hotel but if you looked sideways you could see times square and on the other side the sea. We arrived in the early hours and in the room a light was on for us and also the cd was playing music. On arrival at the hotel you walk passed the concierge desk on the right with the restaurant on the left. It has the water running on the ceiling and looked very impressive. You take the lift to the 7th floor where the main reception desk is together with the lounge area and shop. You then take another lift to your room. We did not see the whisky club or the spa area as we were out sight seeing all day. The bliss collection they supplied to use in the bathroom were fantastic and you could buy them to take home from the hotel's shop which certainly did have some unusual items. I would have liked to have seen a few womans personal items in the bathroom but never mind. The sink and tap had seen better days but I feel that perhaps the quality of the make let them down unlike the shower which had a good well known company name and this worked wonderful and could copy with the constant use. The food in the hotel was good but very expensive. I did have one complaint as one morning after being seated in the restaurant we waited for 15 mins until I got up to ask for the menu. He said he would bring it over which he did. We then waited another 5 mins without being served and a woman came in and was seen to straight away. We then walked out and complained to the Manager. The concierge, Gilmar, was wonderful. He was so nice and helpful and told us everything we needed to know giving us leaflets with vouchers in for free gifts and money off items. I did find the lounge area to be a bit intimidating as in the evenings it was full of people and very noisy. However, one evening we went in there for a drink and found it fine. I would come to this hotel again if it was just my husband and I. I would not feel it is the right hotel to bring my daughter. While we were there (Mon-Sat) it was mainly business people.

We were advised that the hotel was full, so there was no chance of changing (probably as we were on a discounted rate). Our room was beautiful and trendy, however it was very dark, as there were only wall lights - useless for make up application.

My sheets and duvet cover had rips/holes in them. Blue Fin was a great place to eat with very good food - athmosphere was great - modern with excellent lighting. Late in the evening we went to the club downstairs - THE WHISKEY. We had been there earlier at around 5pm just to go in and check it out. As soon as we walked down the stairs there was an overwhelming smell of TOILET BOWL in the place. It smelled like the bathroom at the port authority - it was bad - we were going to have a drink but we told the bartender about it and just let - it was BAD. Later that night we returned, curious to check it out and see if they did something about the doo-doo smell - and they did - it was fine.

We booked a Urban Suite for about $550/night! The hotel is very minimalistically designed, and very hip. The bar in the lobby is uber-trendy and the cocktails are great, however service wasn't very good. On weekends the bar pumps, particularly on Saturday nights. If you don't mind coming back to the hotel from your night out, and walking into a \"Nightclub-esque\" scene, this is for you. If you want a relaxed, non-intimidating stay, I recommend you stay elsewhere. This hotel is aimed at the 20-somethings. When we went to our room we were VERY DISSAPOINTED. The whole room looks extremely cheapely built. The partitions seem to be made of the cheapest, thinnest wood available. The sliding doors on the bathrooms aren't attached properly. Our shower door was missing. When we asked them whether the showers were supposed to have doors or not we were told \"some do, some don't\". (i.e. If it came off, we didn't bother to put it back!). There isn't a bath, so all you can do is shower, in the door-less shower, and have water spray everywhere, resulting in you having to creep into the corner of the shower in order to not make a mess. Highly irritating. The basins in the bathrooms are simply \"floating\" basins with no room on the sides for the soap or anything. This also results in splashing on the floor. The lighting in the both bathrooms was terrible. On a more positive note, the bath products provided are VERY nice, from the salon \"Bliss\". The bed was very comfortable. The location of the hotel is perfect if you're from out of town and want to be in the centre of the action. However, I would recommend staying somewhere a bit more quiet, and don't want to be in the \"theme-park\" part of New York. For first timers, this hotel's location is perfect, for the veteren traveller, perhaps Soho would be better. The best part of the hotel were the concierges, particularly Jonathan. Very friendly and a star at an otherwise average hotel. Extremely helpful, made all out restaurant reservations for our entire stay and managed to get us into some jam-packed places that normally require a month-in-advance reservation, such as Tao, which I highly recommend to anyone seeking an awesome vibey night out with great food and great music! In conclusion, if you are young, flashy, trendy, don't have particularly high hotel standards, and have a LOT of money to throw around, this hotel is for you. The only reason I would want to stay here is because it's so trendy, but it's not a good hotel, you have been warned! If you are a bit older and require a more relaxed and luxurious hotel, stay elsewhere. I found this hotel to be terribly overpriced and felt ripped off.

Not a big deal but just wanted to point them out. The bathrooms are tiny, no seperation between the toilet and the shower. So very little privacy. The shower door sucked and every time we took a shower the bathroom got water everywhere. Our main complaint was the rudeness of the bartender in the main bar. The gal kept making our drinks wrong according to the drink menu and when we finally brought it to her attention she became even ruder. At $12.50 a pop, we were not very happy. We had to get the bar manager involved who offered very little except to remake our last drink (we spent $300 at the bar over 3 days which isnt a ton considering the drink prices) The next day i spoke to the hotel manager who was very apolgetic and credited our drinks from the previous night.

The rooms even above the 42nd floor were noisy. The heater system was on and did not convert to A/C. This means you had to open your window to the noise of Times Square. The rooms and hallways are dark and are painted gray which gives the place a modern club feel if this is your bag. One of the concierge gentlemen was very helpful, the other needed therapy for his poor attitude. The other staff people were excellent. Towels deliverd to the room were quick. The lobby, as most hotels in times square, is small and crowded. You have to transfer elevators twice to get to your room, check in and the bar is on 7th. The decor of the hotel I would call modern with an edge of tacky, but clean. Most rap stars would consider it classsy. When checking hotel rooms ask for the size of the room by sqare footage, the Hilton Times Square, the Ritz at Battery Park and some of the newer hotels have larger rooms. Stay at central park, upper east side it is much much nicer and you can get to times square if you want to catch a show.

We arrived at 11:30 am and asked to be placed on a priority check in since we knew we might not be able to check in that early and I informed them we had a 5:30 dinner reservation. ( Check in is 3:00 pm ). I had reserved a non smoking room with 2 double beds 2 months out. The check in clerk said \" your room will not be ready until around 2:00pm. We have you in a king size bed \"smoking\" room. I informed him I had asked for 2 double beds and a non smoking room. He said \" Do you have your confirmation that shows proof you had asked for a non-smoking room with 2 double beds ?\" I produced my copy of the \"W\" 's email and it did not state smoking or non-smoking. He said well if you \"had\" reserved a non-smoking room it would have said so. He said we can move you to a non smoking room tomorrow but you will have to stay in a smoking room tonite. I have never had a desk clerk \"question\" my integrity and insinutated that I was trying to deceive him !!! This is customer service ? We then spent the next 30 minutes trying to locate a luggage check, since they dont check it for you at the desk. I approached the one person that I saw manning the luggage cart and issuing claim tickets and she said, \" Im sorry you will have to wait until I return\". She returned 20 minutes later and was mobbed by all the other people waiting in the lobby! Why should it take almost an hour to check your bag? We lfinally checked our bags and went out on the city to have lunch and returned to the hotel at 3:00 pm to find our room not ready. The lobby was filled with about 70 -80 other guests \"waiting\" for their rooms also. Techno -new wave music blasts 24-7 in the lobby and elevators so much so its very difficult to even hear the check in clerk or concierge. The lobby is one small dark very very loud bar. At 4:15 pm our room was still not ready so I asked to speak to the manager. (It seems they hate when you ask that.) The desk clerk disappeared for about 10 minutes and returned with a reservation for a cheaper room than what I had reserved. I took it. She said that it was a non smoking with 2 double beds and was $289. So at 4:30 pm I finally was able to check in and get dressed for a 5:30 pm dinner reservation. No one offered to show us to our room which is not easy to find given that the corridors walls and ceilings are painted black making it very hard to see where you are going and the room numbers. All weekend we smelled cigarette smoke coming through the adjacent room door and bathroom exhaust. The closet was no more than 2 feet wide ( and this included the ironing bd ) The room was equally small and very dimly lit with no where to open your suit case except the floor. The walls and doors are poor construction. You can hear everything being said in the adjacent room and hallways. The beds are great but what good is that if you cant sleep due to the noise and smell of cigarette smoke ? At check out, they charged me $309 for my room instead of the $289 they had written on my check in card. This is the worst property I have ever stayed in and will never stay in a W hotel anywhere. If this is indicative of the Starwood Properties then I will avoid those too. There are much better and cheaper places in New York that have real \"cool\" appeal.

I totally DISAGREE with all of the negative comments about the hotel. I am originally from Manhattan so I am very familar with what goes on in the Big Apple. Now for starters, if you are a person who is somewhat LAID-BACK, New York City is not the place for you. Perhaps you should consider staying at one of the Sheraton Hotels located a few blocks up on 7th Avenue. Those hotels are very laid-back and cater to the people on business trips or someone wanting a more quiet atmosphere. We previously stated at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers and we were BORED. It was just too quiet for us. The W Times Square is located in the heart of Times Square which is visited by thousands of tourist daily. There are so many people everywhere and a lot of energy. Me and my hubby are party people so we enjoyed the energy. We have stayed at several Starwood Hotels and I found the W Times Square to be more elegant and full of ENERGY. The staff is very nice and very attentive to the guest. I loved the decor of hotel as well as the room. I was impressed by the decor in the room as soon as I opened the door. The room has unique decor with beveled mirrors and a kingsize bed with comfortable pillows and a goosedown comforter. We slept so good after dinner and a show at Caroline's Comedy Club. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who loves the party scene. We will definitely return to this hotel.", "Date": "September 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cTargets the >35 Crowd\u201d", "Author": "PhoenixWorldTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR2528298", "Content": "Crystal chandeliers, polished marble floors, and heavy draperies do not exist here.

Modest-sized rooms, typical of New York, feel more spacious at this hotel thanks to a mirrored wall behind the bed in each room. As for the \"open\" shower, mine was actually enclosed by thick glass doors. What sets this hotel apart from many are the youthful amenities in the rooms. My room had a DVD player AND a VHS as well as a cd player with jazz collection. Silver pencils, compact pens, and sticky notes with a \"W\" punched out could be found on the glass and steel desk. Besides the typical minibar, a full drawer was stocked with everything from a W umbrella and camera to W thongs and a variety of munchies. Perhaps the best thing about this hotel was its \"newness\" with none of that typical stuffy odor so frequently found at hotels.

Trendy to say the least. There must have been a rap or def jam award ceremony or concert or something there, because the hotel was full of guys with lots of gold jewelry with their pants down to their knees and lots of pimped out cars and trucks. Not the hotel's fault, but when you go for trendy - be prepared. We went for the \"Spectacular\" room and both laughed when we saw the room, because we couldn't figure out what was so spectacular! NOT WORTH THE $ for the UPGRADE. There was NO ROOM to even walk around. The breakfast we ordered arrived on a table that wouldn't even fit past the entryway! We had to improvise a place to eat on the bed (one item at a time). There is no place in the bathroom to put anything, so be prepared to get dressed and put on your make-up in the room - somewhere - good luck. The lighting is so dim, and the walls are so dark that its hard to see anything. A few positive things: I can say is that the bedding was incredible. The feather bed, down comfortor and pillows made for a sound, restful sleep. The aveda products in the bathroom are nice. The service was great. I however, would not choose this hotel again.

Given what is pictured on their website, I had higher expectations. Of course, it is safe to assume that they feature their nicest rooms online. At this particular W, there were HUGE bubbles of paint pulling away from the wall in the bathroom, I would assume this may be due to not having any sort of fan to rid the closet, posing as a bathroom, of steam. Lets just say that you don't have any privacy, as the bathroom walls are constructed of what seems to be a fogged PVC plastic, and if this is your first travel experience with a boyfriend/girlfriend...well you figure the rest out. And, though rooms are typically small in NYC hotels, this was bigger than most for a deluxe room. I do agree that they didn't use the space very well, in that you don't really have adequate space for a closet or any room to place anything anywhere else in the room because of the bulkiness of the low dresser which holds the tv. I thought the decor was terrible, and bordering on motel. The beds were comfortable as to be expected, however the decorative pillows on the bed were sort of scary, in that they appeared to be badly stained by who knows what. The lobby level was very nice/funky (which I dig); however, the halls are beyond dark, and good luck if you have the slightest vision impairment, black hallways with dim light doesn't mesh well.

Most locations were a 20 minute cab ride away and for longer trips, it was easy to take the subway - since all the major subways have stops at Times Square. The drawback however is that times square is beseiged by tourists night and day. Also, if you occupy one of the middle floors and draw your blinds, animated graphics and neon pelt you at every turn. The lobby bar was stylish but uninviting. Room Service was courteous, reliable, and the cuisine was tasty.

I lived in NY for 2 years, and have visited maybe 50 times in the past 15 years or so (staying in most Sheratons, Westins, St-Regis, Best Westerns, Days Hotel, W Hotels, Howard Johnson, Hilton etc). So as a visitor and resident, I think I know NY better than the average bear. The location in Times Sq is good - however it can be TOO close and in-your-face at times. The hotel was expensive, and I expected something special - unfortunately what I got was much, much less. The room was very small (that's not just NY - I expect it there - but for the price I expected a hell of a lot more), and the soundproofing terrible. That is probably my main gripe. The gap under the doors (main and particularly adjoining doors) is large, and allows complete transmission of noise. Imagine you have just flown into NY from Sydney, HK or London, and you want to sleep. Well no way, because each voice, TV channel etc. is so clearly audible that you can join in the conversations. And I mean, you can hear EVERY single word clearly. This includes conversations outside as people wait for the elevator, walk past the room, or the staff use their mobile phones (they mustn't be able to use them elsewhere except when away from managements prying eyes). I did complain - and they were well aware of the door gap / poor materials and noise problems and said that a renovation was overdue. This is a fairly new hotel - just what were they thinking ? Also, the reception area is also a bar - which might as well be Grand Central Station or Times Square inside your lobby. Seriously, there are hundreds (no exaggeration) of noisy drinkers there in the evening all crowded in. You have to shout at the reception staff to be understood. In a nutshell, never again. It may be trendy, but I think W Hotels really take the mickey out of you - charge you heaps and underdeliver. Don't be deceived in thinking you are trendy. By all means visit the bars downstairs at street level, but leave the hotel lobby bar and the hotel itself alone.
