It was about $75/night for a double (actually 2 singles, though that's not what we requested). Unfortunately, in Dubai & Abu Dhabi, all the medium-priced (3 star) hotels are being refurbished & made into 5 star hotels. So finding a room at a reasonable cost is getting more & more difficult.

The bathroom was disgusting, mould growing from the shower curtain, no hot or cold water, merely tepid, though slightly warmer from the cold tap. To have a shower you needed to get into the bath. The bath did not feel secure as I sank into it once standing. The carpet was stained badly as were the walls outside the room. I had the \"pleasure\" of being in the night club i.e. trying to sleep at 2a.m. with the vibrating music below. The breakfast was eaten in the nightclub area. I do not expect to have milk offered for tea and coffee out of a tin. Or to have bread coming out of a plastic bag, like the Tesco cheap range. Very distasteful.

Upon arrival i was highly disappointed as the recption area was full of men looking fairly sleazy. Not a pleasant sight for a woman travelling alone. As i checked in i was told that they would hold onto my passport until checking out. On the way to my room without any assistance there were at least 4 men watching my every move. I hoped my room would be better and lift my spirits- well think again! The room smelt of damp, the floor was wet near the bathroom, the bathroom door would not open fully or even close fully, the room was dark, the sheets appeared to be unwashed. To think they claim in their brochure they have just remodernished the hotel. It was so bad i slept fully clothed. I hoped the following morning things would improve and i was finding faults because i was just tired. I went down to breakfast as it was included in the booking. To my dismay it was jst as bad as the room! No continental breakfast, the milk tasted off and the only thing edible was a slice of toast. The surrounding tables were uncleared due to the previous diners and the only other remaing diners were men. All 12 of them!! So upset i left the breakfast room that was a disco by night i waldked along the corridor faced with a barrage of matresses and building work going on. To make it worst ,as i am a non muslim, it was Ramadan so i couldn't even eat out. I had enough and checked out immediately only then to be told i couldn't used my credit card. They didn't want to pay the charges for the credit card machines. Not a good start to my business trip. Well i'm glad to say to my next hotel, of my choice, was a lot better and safer!

What kind of service is that? The rooms are dingy and not cleaned properly - I moved rooms every single night of my 3 night stay there! The TV reception is rubbish, so there are very few channels that you can actually watch. Breakfast is served in the gloomy windowless room that serves as the nightclub at night. I was never informed about the free shuttle service - instead the reception staff were more keen to sell me tours, even at 12 midnight when I have just arrived after a long tiring flight! The rooms were NOT value for money. Even 2 star hotels in UK have better service than that rubbish place in Dubai. And the travel agent that I booked the hotel through (Air Travel Corporation aka TravelDubai.co.uk among other names) refuse to give me any compensation.
