The staff cannot do enough for you - all you need to do is ask. The health club and pool are fantastic with views across the city and river. Everything you need to ensure you leave the hotel feeling, looking and smelling great are provided. Our room was (20th floor) over looking the city and watching the sun rise was just as brilliant as seeing all the lights start to twinkle during the evening (electric drapes!). The bathroom weighing scales kept me informed of my daily weight gain! the lighting was great for makeup/contant lens and the towels, robes, slippers and toiletries all added to the feeling of luxury. If you don't fancy going out, the kitchenette was equiped with everything you need. And every appliance/tool looked brand new from the kitchen utensils to the hairdryer. The 16th floor terrace area is still closed being out of season, as the weather was unseasonably hot last week, being out there would have been an experience. The hotels location is right on the river and being so tall you never get lost or need the full address for taxis - as we found out when we left the airport and my husband asked me what the address was (I didn't have it!). Overall the hotel facilities and staff are excellent - I would definately recommend it.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "southeast", "Title": "\u201cIf \"Go Big or Go Home\" is your Motto. .Then..

I am still staying at the hotel, here with my family (to young girls under the age of 10) for a mini spring break trip. We have a two room suite, with a pull out queen size bed in the living room, 2 bathrooms and a fully stocked kitchen. (kids have a bed, and parents have a separate room.) While a treat, it is worth the investment. We have stayed at Ritz Carlton in the past with kids in different cities. . But the Donald does it better. Upon check in, the kids were immediately greeted with cotton candy (bell man asked for permission) and matching pink Trump Tower hats. In the rooms, the kids were provided \"Trump Kids\" robes and slippers. They were left personalized notes as well. Upon returning to the room from dinner the first night, the hotel had left two candy trays with names written in chocolate. For a hotel with a hoity toity reputation if by price alone, they have gone beyond the call of duty to make them feel welcomed. My wife is at the spa; and I am confident her experience is great. I will not suggest that the Trump experience is for the weak of heart for your wallet, but if you want to create a memorable, relaxing and comfortable experience (which is not easy when traveling with kids) I highly recommend the Trump. I know my wife is already scheduling her next girl's trip to the hotel, and my kids will always ask with any future trips whether we are staying at the Trump Towers. As I have not seen a normal room, i do not feel comfortable addressing the accommodations specifically. But the hotel is beautiful, the staff warm (the bell man upon my families return from American Girl responded \"That is not bad, it only took you five hours!\") and the views and location are hard to beat..", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cExceptional St. Patrick's Day stay!\u201d", "Author": "A M", "ReviewID": "UR126347428", "Content": "Our family decided to have a stay-cation in downtown Chicago over the St. Patrick's Day weekend. Keep in mind that we already had several things going against a relaxing weekend...our two-year old son, the unusual warm weather in Chicago this past weekend (large crowds of people everywhere), and the drunken debauchery that one would expect during such a celebration. We arrived at the hotel at about 10am, expecting simply to park at the hotel and then return later in order to check in at 3pm. As soon as we told the valet attendants that we would be checking to the hotel, they immediately helped to get us situated with our luggage. When we checked in, we decided to upgrade from our deluxe room to the executive suite on the 25th floor--this was a great choice. The best thing about it was that we could check in right away...we didn't have to wait! We had the city, lake and river view. We were also at eye-level with the clock atop the Wrigley building...not to mention the fact that we watched as the boat crews were coloring the river green! We had the best view from our room! The room was great...it was decorated nicely, the bed was comfortable, the kitchen area had everything we needed, including a refrigerator that was large and an ice-box with an ice-maker. I will agree with other reviews that it is a little odd that the bathroom door does not close all the way...it leaves about an inch and a half gap due to the placement of the door. We overlooked that feature quickly and were able to enjoy all of the other great features of the room...primarily the floor to ceiling windows...that in and of itself entertained our two year old to no end...it was great. Aside from the amenities (pool area and exercise rooms are nice and complementary to all guests)...what was most important to us were the noise level at night and the staff. It was important that our son could sleep at night without being disturbed...we didn't hear a sound ...it was great! Also, the great, friendly staff made our stay absolutely enjoyable. Anything that we requested or inquired about was immediately addressed. This hotel is probably one of the nicest we have stayed at, and the staff was the most professional and courteous that we have experienced. Also, as far as hotel food is concerned, we ate at the hotel's restaurant twice...it is pricey, but the quality was exquisite. No complaints on any of it... All and all, if you can afford it, I would highly recommend dishing out the money for this hotel. We had a lovely time and will certainly choose the Trump hotels in Chicago and other cities as well.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "morgantown WV", "Title": "\u201cWorth the 5 stars\u201d", "Author": "3ddesigns", "ReviewID": "UR126342246", "Content": "We stayed at the Trump for 3 nights in early March.

The girls and I (two 16 year old\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) booked this hotel in early January for a train trip to Chicago while the boys in the family went to Florida to watch spring training baseball. The service was great, front desk, bellman, spa attendants, attache service, house keeping, maintenance (TV issues) were all impeccable. The room felt spacious and rich. Oh, the bed I could live in forever. The restaurant recommended for dinner was perfect. The arriving chocolates were some of the best I've enjoyed. There were little cakes when they turned the room down for the girls, in celebration of their recent birthdays. Housekeeping was invisible, which means they did an excellent job. I cannot make a single complaint about the property. OK, two small things, the bathroom frosted sliding door did not close completely (room 2216 in case your interested, Donald) we had all girls, not an issue. Second room service forgot the Chantilly cream for the Wimbledon fruit bowl and the syrup for the french toast. A quick call and all fixed. Away from the property review the other guests were rude and we felt like country bumpkins. A polite hello on the elevator was met with...........nothing. I know a lot of foreign guests stay at this hotel and may not understand, not the case here. Most of the rudeness came from guests/residents that were black clad from head to pointy toe, honest to goodness english speaking folks. They spoke, just not to us, in response to a spoken courtesy. We got glances that were not kind. The girls were in the dark, except during one of their trips to the spa. That was when I felt bad for choosing this hotel. I chose this hotel, like we chose Chicago. We spent a long weekend, Friday through Monday, spent 1000's of dollars in your city. The Trump Towers courted us with a reduced booking reservation.

Pulling up in a taxi to the arrival area, I was met by a doorman with a charming British accent who greeted me graciously and directed me to the hotel side. The lobby is divided in half, with a residents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lobby on one side and the hotel lobby on the other. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small in comparison to other area luxury hotels whose massive lobbies take up an entire floor, but adequate for small groups who are waiting or checking in. The interior design is in perfect unity with the exterior look\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u0153posh contemporary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sums it up nicely. The color palette of all interior spaces in the Trump Tower is the same as with many Trump properties, favoring the cooler shades of grey, violet and blue with few exceptions. Tactilely, the furnishings such as couches and chairs are soft and velvety. ROOMS The rooms range from studio suites with approximately 600 square feet of living space to three-bedroom suites averaging about 1,000 square feet. All have either a small kitchenette or a fully-functional and equipped kitchen. The quality of the furnishings in even the smallest rooms is remarkable. Trump didn't cut corners\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe mattresses are comfortable and the technology is up-to-date. I especially enjoyed the TV in the bathroom mirror. It was helpful for morning multi-tasking\u00e2\u20ac\u201di.e. catching up on the news while applying makeup. Electronically controlled drapes and the availablity of various levels of ambient lighting also met a high standard. I found the personal touch of framed photos of Chicago landmarks set around the room to be both charming and a fantastic idea, especially as this was my first visit to the city. It was my floor to ceiling view of the stunning city of Chicago, though, that made the room. SPA ROOMS A unique feature to the Trump Tower is the availability of their Spa Rooms, which invite guests to immerse themselves in the spa experience. These rooms have easy access to the spa via an earmarked staircase, making the trek in a bathrobe less of an issue and providing convenient access. The spa can also be brought to guests in Spa Rooms where a private yoga lesson can be arranged or many of the treatments can be done in-room. The Spa itself is quite minimalist, with the focus on treatment rather than overly ornate surroundings. LOCATION The location to shopping and entertainment is phenomenal. I opted for a taxi due to the cool, rainy weather, but the Trump Tower is within an easy walking distance from the famed Miracle Mile and Navy Pier. There is also a restaurant (Sixteen) and a lounge (Rebar, named for the building materials used) in-house. Both are busy and lively in the evenings. I ordered a delicious crushed berry drink at a premium price while enjoying the perfect view of a fireworks display over the river. RECOMMENDATION As a final note, the service at the Trump International Hotel and Tower is as sophisticated as the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. From the bellmen to the servers to the front desk staff and every other staff member I encountered during my visit, I was shown the best in professional hospitality. I made note of it in my observations of their interactions with other guests, as well. In conclusion, the Trump comes highly personally recommended for the ambiance as much as the location. The Trump Tower truly fits my definition of luxury.

It seems a small detail, but the hair dryers are actual high-end hair dryers...not the anemic ones usually supplied. The small wet bar area was well-appointed. The property had a marvelous spa, workout facility, and pool. The floor-to-ceiling windows are just as described and are stunning. The spa had many small touches I've rarely seen in hotel spas. Every detail at this hotel seemed to be well-considered. We had brunch at the main restaurant on Sunday. We hadn't done any research, but anticipated a pricey but simple breakfast. We didn't anticipate a 70$ per person meal...but my husband was seduced, so we indulged. The food/quality/service was excellent, but what put it over the top was the view. Amazing! Was it worth the steep price for what amounted to breakfast? Probably not, however it was an indulgent end to a lovely weekend. Location perfect...easy access to Miracle Mile.

What a wonderful experience from the moment we stepped onto the property. The lobby was emaculate and the host at the front desk was so very pleasent and helpful. Checking in was a breeze on the Friday afternoon before Superbowl Sunday if you can imagine that. The entire staff was very warm and polished...not everyplace in town, no matter how highly rated can boast of that; someone has spent time and resources making sure staff \"gets it\" The room was even nicer than the photos on the website... and talk about clean throughout; not a scratch or blemish anywhere. It seemed like the room as well as the entire hotel just finished final inspection and was set for a photo shoot for a travel magazine. I have to say throughout the room as well as the entire hotel was a very faint scent of what seemed to be a very light lavender or aromatheropy type smell...nothing overpowering in any way, just a great smell everywhere. Possibly all these details are a requirement expected by the Trump family as they set expectations for the managers of the property?? You sort of felt like maybe Mr.Trump or his daughter might show up at any moment for a little property inspection and everyone on duty was ready....no kidding. The food at 16 was second to none and the view of the historic Wrigley Clock Tower while dining was sureal as it felt like it was 50 feet away and quite large. The gym has teriffic views as you work out and it was nice to have a full gym that included a substantial amount of free weights as well as private studios for your stretching, yoga and alternative fitness needs.

Glitz & glam - high ceilings, views, gadgets, sleek grey and lots of black granite, glass etc. The espresso maker is wonderful, the t.v. is set to a fish tank, the curtains work on an automatic switch, all lights can be on and off on panels, the bathroom looks like it is from a water works catalog with a t.v. in the mirror. The towels are plentiful, the bed is comfortable, the city noises are far away and the location is wonderful. There is a fridge and microwave and sink so it is easy to have snacks. The sitting area makes it easy to relax after some touring. All that is really a reason to stay if the budget allows. The restaurant is good - expensive - the exercise room is really as nice as some clubs - and it is not subterranean - and that is saying something. Hotels notoriously have one or two creaky bikes and an all in one weight machine crammed in a dreary basement dungeon. What I would say bothers me is the front desk staff and the bellmen/welcome staff (the concierge desk is great and efficient and the doormen is as well). They are irritating. It's as if they went into training with the emphasis on perky and it can be exhausting. The staff do not seem to perceive a guest in a rush or register a guest might not want to get into a discussion of his or her plans etc. Most guests will ask if they want a recommendation and will make a comment about their trip which would indicate they are interested in striking up some discussion. My husband has been four other times and he has the same complaint. We have devised strategies, though what worked pretty well was a blunt but politely and kindly said, \"we are not feeling talkative\". My other complaint is the amenities. We forgot a brush. When we asked for a comb we were directed to the store where brushes were $10.00 to $35.00 and the ten dollar one was worse quality than Goody brand at CVS. I think a hotel charging this price should provide a free comb and any other small incidentals. It felt cheap. At a minimum they should have reasonable quality at a good value. We would have walked to a pharmacy but we were running late. I have not stayed in another hotel in Chicago - so I cannot compare it.

While they agreed to switch us to a river view room, that meant that we did not get our goodies for quite some time (we finally had to request the Wii as it was still apparently in our old room). Also, we left the hotel at 6:30PM and returned at 9:30PM and there was no turn down service during this time (maybe they went to the other room?). Had to call for that as well. The hotel and staff are amazing.

I asked for a river view, which was wonderful. Also my request for a room as high as possible was fullfilled. A colleague who had the same room lower down said the higher view was even better. The room was described as an Executive King suite - although I couldn't see this exact description on their website. Anway, it was spacious and very comfortable. Unlike another reviewer, I really didn't find the lifts satisfactory. In fact, this would almost make me think of going back to the Peninsula, where I've never waited more than a few moments for a lift. I can't conceive how anyone could have made such an error when designing the hotel. However, everything else is so good, I guess I'll probably put up with the wait to get up to the room.

We were met by friendly doormen and checked in by a warm and welcoming staff member (I think his name was England, I may be wrong but I'm certain that was his name) we felt relaxed and welcomed right away. Little touches like the hot towel presented to you on a slate with an orchid are just a step above what you expect. Despite arriving at 10am we were checked in quickly and told we had been upgraded to a river view room, we had requested a high floor for the view and we werent disappointed with being located on the 26th floor. The hotel only goes to 27 floors of this magnificent building so we couldnt ask for much more. (we had emailed them and asked if we could drop off our luggage as we expected to arrive too early to check in, we really didnt expect to be able to get into our room this early) Our room was just fabulous, entered from a quiet corridor and decorated in a simple sophisticated style which added to the air of luxury. We had a kitchen complete with hob, dishwasher, fridge containing mini bar but with plenty of room for your own items and microwave. Cupboards contained glassware, crockery, a toaster and kettle. There was a Nespresso machine and pods and a tray of snack items available for purchase. The mini bar was well stocked with soft drinks, wines, champagne and spirits. Compared with mini bars in less luxurious hotels this was actually all really well priced and not expensive at all. The room had an awesome view down Wabash, South Michigan Ave and dwon to Navy Pier. Comfortable seating was provided in the window so you could sit and watch the world go by below. The bed was MASSIVE and the most comfortable ever! We had selected speciality pillows from the in room pillow menu which were provided daily. The bathroom was a great size, with the walk in shower and bath behind a glass screen. All immaculate and put together in the same luxurious style. The TV in the bathroom mirror was a novelty, I guess we are just not that addicted to TV to see it's neccessity but I see how it goes with the luxury setting. The housekeeping service in this hotel was second to none, these unseen staff members do one of the most important jobs in the hotel. Our room was kept beautifully clean and each evening when we returned to our room we had fresh towells, toiletries topped up and even a little foot mat placed by the bed with trump slippers placed on it! A nice personal touch was a note informing you of the next day's weather forecast with your housekeepers name on it. On our first evening we returned and found a bottle of champagne and a cake with sweet messages wishing us congratulations on our marriage and for my birthday. For a hotel to acknowledge one special occassion is good but to make an effort to make us feel special for both occassions was just unexpected. We didnt eat at the hotel but we did have cocktails in Rebar, a plush bar located on a mezzanine level off reception, understated glamour and smooth service here too. We were seated in a window seat, brought a dish of olives and spiced nuts. Our drinks were prepared and brought to us by friendly waiting staff. Drinks were different to the norm on cocktail menus and clearly showed the quality of ingredients and thought put into thier creation. We truly loved every single minute at this hotel, the extra special touches made our stay but even without these the hotel would rank as the best we have stayed in. Every single member of staff displayed professionalism whilst being friendly, we never felt the staff were aloof. Some other guests may have looked down thier noses at us the day we were on our way out in wet weather clothing but who cares?! We would return here with no hesitation.

Well worth it since we planned on staying in the hotel for our entire stay. Living in the suburbs, we've done the Michigan avenue shopping, dined at the great surrounding restaurants, so this was all inclusive stay for us. We dined at 16, the hotel's signature restaurant and were not disappointed. Excellent service from start to end. The meals we ordered were presented to us like we were the Trumps.... Being waited on to be sure we were happy with our dining experience.... We returned to our room and marveled at the night time view from our room, watched some tv and it is true, there is another small tv embedded in the bathroom mirror...so cool. There were a total of three tvs in our room, and not to be snobby, but one review mentioned with black tv countertops, you do see dust, which is hard to maintain dust free at all times. Great mattress for sleeping. We ate breakfast as well at 16 in the morning and service was excellent. The spa and exercise area is wonderful with a view of the city where ever you choose to work out. Very open and airy. Our only minor complaint, if any and it was annoying and we heard some others complaining was the elevator. The hotel is huge and it seemed to have very limited elevators running ..getting from floor to floor for dinner took a while and when we departed our elevator made stops almost every two floors going down, and because people on floors were waiting a while, when we stopped they would get on and our elevator was overfilled with guests,because they didn't want to wait any longer.

I've wanted to stay at Trump for the longest time. When it first opened in 2008 I tried to stay here but couldn't. After that it was either sold out or something, I just was never able to come here. So my review could be a bit biased cause: 1. I was eagerly anticipating the visit; 2. Some of the meetings on my trip this time got shifted around so I actually had time to check out the amenities. So here's the list: 1. Staff are friendly & courteous & professional and eager to help. I got a super nice room on high floor facing the lake. Such a treat. Especially this trip I actually had some time to spend in the room instead of just crashing. Concierge can print your boarding passes for you. Super nice & convenient. 2. Pets & children friendly - I've seen staff walking a super super cute bull dog, and couples pushing strollers around. 3. Room decor & lobby are contemporary. The entire hotel feels very new since it only opened in 2008. It has a residence attached. There's a TV in the middle of the bathroom mirror, which is pretty cool. 4. The spa is AWESOME. I didn't do the menu thing, I just chilled out at the gym and spa area. You've gotta try that funky shower that has like 10 shower heads and with music & almost a light show. Although, to be honest, with so many shower heads spraying water at you, good luck keeping your eyes open to seeing the lights changing color. I suggest stepping back & look at it & take it all in before taking the shower. It's a very spacious shower stall. In the locker room there's a steam room & a sauna. You can really relax in there. There's also a lap pool - so bring your practice suit & googles... I did a yoga class as well, there are 2 studio rooms in the gym. Very nice. Yoga class is $30 per class. I didn't bring gym clothes and the staff at the spa loaned me some even though they don't normally provide such service. Really helpful. 5. Location is at the southern tip of Michigan Ave. It's a bit tucked away comparing to the Ritz & the Four Seasons. But I didn't care so much for shopping. Within 5 blocks of walking distance there are tons of restaurants & shops. Also close to the L - 5min walk to the orange line if you need to go to Midway to avoid rush hour traffic, same with blue line to O'Hare. Also there's a Dunkin Donuts right across the street & a McDonald's around the corner if you don't want to order room service for breakfast. 6. I also checked out the business center even though I have my own laptop. It has 2 terminals & printer & fax machine. THe hotel offers free internet. 7. I didn't have a car so I don't know about parking. Funny that whenever I think of Mr. Trump I think of that hair flip & the little fish mouth saying \"I'm the best. The Best, the Best, the Best...\" I've met him in person & he's exactly as on TV. So I tried very hard to try to find something negative but it wasn't easy. I have to say he does hold himself to a very high standard. If I have to pick a bone, the negatives are: 1. lighting in the room are low, same with bathroom. The lighting is too low to do makeup. 2. TV program system is SUPER annoying. But I'm not a big TV watcher so it's OK. Basically the response to the remote is very slow, and the TV guide is always wrong. 3. Room is a bit dusty. Highly visible on the black marble counter top. Overall it was an extremely pleasant experience. I'll only stay here if I come to Chicago again. It definitely beats the out-dated Ritz & the Four Seasons.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLuxury Night at The Trump\u201d", "Author": "DT_10London", "ReviewID": "UR120012702", "Content": "My wife and I spent a night at The Trump in February 2010, and we got engaged that night.

We actually had three different hotel reservations as we were concerned about location, getting to the start, and cost. We decided to cancel the other reservations and splurge. (I had stayed one night before at this hotel so knew it to be very nice.) The preceding week, I had been contacted by the staff at the Hotel asking if there was anything they could do for us. I expressed my concern at that time about getting to the start of the race and was connected with the Concierge staff who explained the \"el\" train stops. She also mentioned that last year they had run a free shuttle, but she was not sure if they were doing it again. She took my email address and said they would contact me when they knew about the shuttle. A few days later, I received an email confirming that the shuttle would be run! The service at this hotel is flawless, in my opinion. We have stayed at many wonderful hotels all over the world, and this is one of the best. The location is fantastic. Ask the concierge for directions out the back of the bldg to get to Michigan Ave. in a flash. (There is a McDonalds right out the back tucked away for easy convenience if you are in a hurry or do not want to spend $35/person for breakfast, although you should definitely try their breakfasts.) Upon check-in we were upgraded to a suite with two bathrooms and separate bedroom. Everything was absolutely first-class. Turn-down service was wonderful. If we called for something, I was greeted by name and up it came immediately. The food at the restaurants was fantastic, with very excellent, but not stuffy, service. It is amazing what a difference a genuine smile makes when being greeted or waited on. The mgmt of this hotel must be doing something right because I know it cannot be easy to hire employees with such qualities. The Saturday night before the race we went to The Terrace (outside) for a drink. We had a bit of wait, but it was worth it because it was very warm, very lovely with the landscaped prairie grasses blowing and the view of the Chicago landmarks. As a bonus, we had a perfect view of the lake through the buildings, and there was a spectacular firework show from Navy Pier (better than the Fourth of July!) Yes, it is pricy up there, but you get what you pay for. I will NEVER forget sitting up there in that setting. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the Michelin-starred restaurant the night of the race. The service again was excellent, although the kitchen got a bit behind. Not sure about the Michelin star as I have eaten at other Michelin-starred restaurants, and this was just a bit off that night. Maybe they were having a bad night... The only weird thing about it was the couple sitting catty-corner from us was an obvious young \"escort\" and a man my husband's age making kissing face. After a few glasses of wine, he couldn't keep that up though, and they left before we did. During our stay, my daughter also was treated with special race menu options, epsom salts, and race day snacks and water and gatorade.

It appeared that many Europeans have a residence there as I heard a lot of foreign tongues. It added an air of a World Class Hotel to the environment. Check in was very nice, very professional and I was greeted by first and last name. We had the Brunch at Sixteen on Sunday and the food was very good and the service was excellent. The following day, breakfast was also at Sixteen and that was very good also. The service was excellent, the training at the hotel appears to be excellent as the level of service in the Spa, Sixteen and check-in reflected a level of service that one would expect at a 4-5* Hotel.My room was on the 13th floor and overlooked the Chcago river, Navy Pier and Michigan Ave which was beautiful day and night, so much so I slept with the drapes undrawn as a result. Little touches I noticed that set the hotel apart; 1. Warm towels upon check and cold water 2. Umbrella's for use when raining, at the front desk and in the room. 3. You never touch a door, the doorman always open the door for you. 4. Sentences for service end with, \" at your pleasure\". Now the location of the Hotel is off of the start of the 'Miracle Mile\" so all of the stores on Michigan Ave or Rush street are North of the hotel. Nordstorms is the closest and is 1 1/2 blocks away. There is a little street that connects the hotel with Michigan Ave and sometimes a little Riff Raff hang out there asking if you would like a shoe shine? However, I noticed that the hotel had security camera's and a few seconds after our shoe shine solictation, a security person from the hotel passed us and appeared to be looking for that person. Once in the hotel and in the front of the hotel, security and safety took over. I have stayed at the Pennisula in Chicago and I have to admit that it is a fine hotel, however I feel that Trump Chicago is a much better value.

I don't really enjoy corporate advertising, but the kids enjoyed the goodies. On both visits (one with kids, one without), we stayed in a suite. I don't recall the floors but the rooms were high enough to have great views of the Chicago River and a partial view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier. Floor to ceiling windows maximize the view. The beds are phenomenal. I've stayed in many high end hotels and these beds and pillows were top of the line! I never wanted to leave that bed. The bathroom is granite throughout and quite nice. In the smaller suite, the tub was contained within the shower. In the larger fireplace suite (fireplace wasn't real), it was separate. My kids enjoyed the TV screen that was contained within the mirror. I thought it was an inconvenient location and made it difficult to see in the mirror. My biggest disappointment with the rooms were the towels, robes and toiletries. I really would have expected higher end from Trump Tower. The towels weren't that large, nor were they very plush. The toiletries seemed like something generic with the Trump name on them. The toiletries are something I look forward to trying at higher end hotels, so this was a big disappointment. I did enjoy the kitchenette feature in both rooms. Very convenient. You have to access the pool through the spa (which smells wonderful!). It was a bit on the small side. Having cold water with lemon slices available was a nice touch though. The concierge couldn't have been better. The staff goes out of their way to make families with kids feel comfortable, but I didn't want to take my three kids to the hotel restaurant on a Saturday night. Although they are well-behaved, I never want to take the chance of disturbing other diners at a high end establishment on a Saturday night. The concierge was helpful with recommending a more kid-appropriate, non-chain restaurant with food and drinks that the adults could still enjoy. On our visit without kids, my husband and I really enjoyed the hotel bar (blanking on the name). The martinis, while a bit overpriced, were fabulous and the views made up for the price! We did try the hotel restaurant for breakfast with the kids and I have to say, we did not like it at all. We really appreciate well prepared food and this was not it.

Plus it gave such easy access to everything to do in Chicago. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The beds were great as well. The TV in the bathroom mirror came in handy for watching TV while relaxing with a hot bath. Other than that, it's just kind of a novelty item. I was kind of.....surprised by the furniture choices. All of the furniture (TV stand, night stand, coffee table, etc) were basically Ikea furniture, but with glass tops stuck on top to give it a slight upgrade. Nothing wrong with Ikea; I own plenty of it, just kind of surprising that they went that route. No one really uses that type of furniture, so it's really irrelavent.

Before we went there I needed to make a choice from many excellent 5 star hotels in Chicago and finally I choos Trump. Why? Because The Trump Hotel made me the best impression as an hotel where childeren are welcome (I was travelling with my daughter). I have been in many hotels from 3 to 5 stars and most of the time the hotels are not very comfortable with childeren. As Trump International Hotel and Tower made the best impression to me I choose them altough we European are always a bit afraid of too much gold & and trumpness :-). But what a suprise! We arrived on a Saturday for a 5-day stay and the first suprise was that we got an upgrade from our booked Spa Suite to a Suite on the 20th floor with a magnificent view. When we arrived there was a special bathrobe, matching slippers and milk and cookies for my daughters which is a great welcome after 16 hours of travelling for an 7 year old! The Suite was around 140 m2 big and had a separate sleeping room, 2 bathrooms (one with bath) a kitchen and a big living room with a fire place. The Trump Hotel and Tower is situated near to the Wrigley building and the Magnificent mile so great for shopping an see all the high lights from Chicago. Instead of kitschy gold (which we Europeans often think when we hear the name Trump) the whole hotel was nicely decorated in a chique and modern way. The dining room has a impressive chrystal chandelier. Unfortunately the weather was not good enough to sit on the terrace but if you can, you will experience a wonderfull view which we could only see from Restaurant 16 indoors. Anyway it was still impressive. We went for dinner in Restaurant 16 and where impressed by it's amazing wine card. The people from doorman to chamber maid are friendly and interested. They are willing to help you out (from hairdresser, thank you christopher, and shop). Just ask! And they will tell you the inside tips from Chicago you do not read in the Travel books. All the people where very friendly to my daughter and she even got al little bit spoiled with candy ;-). So summerized: if you are looking for a high class 5 star hotel in Chicago on a perfect place and is child friendly, I can recommend this hotel wholeheartedly. Also for dinner the Restaurant 16 is great. The only tiny thing I can suggest is a bit more variety is the breakfast. The breakfast was very well but sometimes you just wanted to eat brown bread with chees (but that might be a Swiss/Dutch thing ;-) .", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe BEST in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "BrightonBelleUK", "ReviewID": "UR118555894", "Content": "Can not fault the Trump, service amazing, staff attentive, rooms spacious and well kept.

No man living under my roof would be allowed outside with a hamster pelt glued to his scalp. So I was not pleased when My Dearest booked us into the Trump International Hotel & Tower for a Chicago business trip. Still someone must be the supportive spouse in this marriage, so along I went! Our arrival was not auspicious. The doorperson did not seem to grasp that, as arriving guests, we had luggage in the trunk of the taxi and that it was his job to unload our luggage and get it into the hotel without fuss. Instead, confusion reigned, and I wasted several minutes explaining to the doorman his job and supervising to make sure our luggage was not gifted to another guest. Minutes from my life that I will never get back! Where was Mr. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Fired when I needed him? The hotel reception area is a cramped space that also serves as the main entrance to one of the noisy hotel bars. The stupidity of this set-up was breathtaking. When we arrived the lobby was swarming with ill-dressed bar patrons and we had to battle our way through them in order to reach the reception desk. (Chicago people: Mr. Trump thinks himself an important man, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show up at his fancy hotel dressed like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dropping by the neighborhood sports bar.) Circumstances improved when we reached the reception desk and were greeted with hot scented towels and efficiently checked in. Our room was spacious and furnished in a masculine style with chunky modern monochromatic furniture done in shades of black and dark gray. However, everything was comfortable and the room had lots of nice features: plenty of storage space, lots of power outlets, good lighting, nice mirrors, and a Nespresso coffee/espresso maker. The view was pleasant enough, although Chicago looks much better from a distance than it does up close. People, is it too much to ask for you to tear down some of those ugly buildings from the 1950s? The bathroom was large and well equipped with heaps of towels and bracing water pressure in the shower. I liked the separate his and hers sinks and the enormous mirror. The room was clearly designed to massage a Master of the Universe ego, so there was nothing cozy or charming about it. The toilet ran endlessly. I was hoping that housekeeping would notice this when cleaning the room and call maintenance to fix it. My hopes were in vain. The room had a designer water bar featuring bottles of uber water ranging from $10 to $20. Mr. Trump, do you think your guests are idiots? City of Chicago water is not appealing, but, if you think I am paying $20 for a bottle of water, another thought is on your way and will, after it burrows through the hamster pelt, arrive in your cranial cavity soon. There was a pillow menu that I could not be bothered to read. People, please!! Just put quality pillows on the bed, and if I have an issue with them you will be the first to know. My Dearest needed technical help with his laptop, and guest services responded quickly and effectively. Kudos to them! I liked the room service menu. There were all the usual dishes designed to appeal to beefy businessmen choosing food without female supervision: steaks and hamburgers on steroids, mountains of fries, etc. But there was also an appealing selection of salads with a wide range of fresh ingredients. I (and My Dearest!) enjoyed these very much. Even better, they put the dressing on the side without being asked. A nice touch: the man who delivered room service wore white gloves! While the reception desk was efficient, there were several lapses in service. I used up all the tissues and housekeeping did not replenish them. Our good night, sweet dreams letter one evening was addressed to another guest. And the toilet continued to run. This is an upscale businessperson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my style, but a stay here is hardly hardship duty. They need to focus less on non-essential frills and get the basics of good hotel service right.

The location of the hotel was ideal for sightseeing too.

The room and hotel is absolutely pristine and the bathrooms are luscious. The rooms are spaticious and the closets are large. We stayed in a room overlooking the river; with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the river and Chicago's hallmark architectural buildings was a delight, particularly at night with all the lights. If staying, you must head to the restaurant 16 (on the 16th floor) and take pictures on the terrace. You'll get such great views of the river, lake and city. My husband worked out regularly during our stay and the gym is unique because it wraps around the perimeter of the building, thus affording luxurious views of the city while treadmill running. Didn't try the spa - prices were steep but I'm sure their diamond massage is exactly as luxurious as it sounds, with a pricetag attached to match. I think it's commendable that this hotel appeals to vacationers, business minded travellers and familes with children. Everyone is welcome. The location is excellent - walking distance to the pier, Michigan mile and Mellinium park and endless restaurants and water taxi's. The concierge is informative and follow through with requests PROMPTLY, without repeat reminders. Turn-down service at night leaves you feeling a little more at bliss...they leave slippers by your bedside, bottles of water, turn on jazz and leave the TV on an aquarium channel. I won't ruin the total experience, you just have to walk through those glass doors to experience everything for yourself. It's just really really nice to be away from home and have a stress-free mini get-away; even if it's a 'workcation', it still feels stress-free than actually being behind your desk!

I booked directly on the hotel website and found a 20% off of a two night stay special and reserved a city view suite (room 2326, 23rd floor).

The room was very clean and well furnished! The fridge was stocked with drinks, and also had a Nespresso machine. The master bathroom was phenomenal. I'm very picky when it comes to hotel rooms and the room exceeded my expectations. The service was very good, the staff was obviously trained how to properly treat guests. Each staff member I encountered was polite and very eager to help. The only negative comment I have with regard to service is that Trump Attach\u00c3\u00a9 did not deliver the pillows I ordered from the pillow menu (even though they confirmed the order via email). This wasn't a big deal to me, I'm sure if I had called they would have rectified the issue but I did not give them a chance, mistakes happen. We didn't have a chance to visit Sixteen but we did order in-room breakfast twice during the stay and it was very good. The staff didn't just deliver the food they arranged it on the table with a fresh cut flower! The hotel is in a prime location, we walked to Millennium Park, Navy Pier, Willis Tower. Michigan avenue is a block away and has tons of shopping/dining too. We didn't touch the car until it was time to leave, parking is a nightmare anyway. I would recommend letting them valet your car, I was going to do self parking but quickly changed my mind, the garage is very narrow and steep!

It was a little nippy so we looked for indoor things to do such as the theatre and the aquarium and some jazz at night. Great dining and great service. We know we have to return during the Spring or Summer to explore the outdoor venues and shopping, as well as the architecture. Look up and it's a visual feast! I'm so glad that we spent the three nights at the Trump Tower. I have so many positive things to say about this property. I'm really particular about things and The Trump Tower raised the bar in all areas for me.The views are spectacular and the decor is snazzy and at the same time really comfortable. The staff is trained with one thing in mind - don't just meet the guests' expectations, exceed them. To this end, they succeeded! We spent a lovely afternoon lazing about by the pool and the next morning we enjoyed one of the most delicious and relaxing Brunches of my life. At one point, looking out at the skyscrapers, from the massive bank of windows alongside our table, I casually remarked to the waiter that it was too bad they didn't have a foldout map of the skyline view so that you were able to identify the various buildings. His eyes actually lit up and he was so excited to tell me that such a fold out map existed and he would go and get one for me. His genuine pleasure in doing this for me as a guest was one of the memorable moments from this trip. It's not just about training the staff right. It's about hiring the right staff. The amount of pleasure that this person gave me was only matched by the pleasure he took in doing his job so well. I think that there are a lot of really nice hotels in the city of Chicago. However, the property is only as good as the service found within those walls. I really believe that the level of service is set from the top down. We encountered an issue with a noisy dog in the suite next to us during the second day of our stay. Due to circumstances beyond the staff's control, the solution became tricky and with a bit of prompting a very happy resolution was found, in the end. The managing director, Mr. O'Callaghan, was not present on that particular day and upon my return home, I sent him a very detailed letter regarding the incident, which he decided to follow up with a phone call and a letter, assuring me that the incident had provided an opportunity for staff training. Very generous compensation was offered at the time of our stay and additional compensation was offered at the end of our conversation. Mr. O'Callaghan was an attentive and discerning listener. His concern was genuine and his response was more than fair. During the last several months, I have recommended this hotel to anyone who is considering a trip to Chicago.

We dined in Sixteen (on the 16th floor) and chose the blind taste dinner ($150/person). The chef picks all the meals. We believe that there were 12 gourmet courses. The meal was started by a complimentary Seafood Ceviche. Then a beet dish with 3 different preparations. Then a scallop dish with what tasted like Fois Gras. Then a Ravioli dish for me and an egg plant parmigiana for my husband. After the halibut course, we found out that we still had two beef courses followed by the cheese course, then two desert courses. Each course was beautifully composed on the various plate shapes. For each course, we had a different set of silverware. The dinner rolls were tasty, especially the orange white chocolate dinner roll (you have to tell them not to bring you any more). The service and the dining experience is something that we will never forget. We have eaten at Louis XV in Monte Carlo for $700 (no drinks) and the chef at Sixteen is better! A few years ago, we stayed at the Four Season Hotel in Chicago, and the dining experience was not good. You will be delighted with 16. We worked out in their fitness center and it is well equipped. It is good, but not as good as the Four Seasons in Maui at Wailea. They do have fitness classes for $30/person. I didn't take any because the times didn't fit, plus it seemed that it should be included like at the Four Season (more offerings). Some hotel fitness rooms are just another empty small hotel room with no view. The view from the Trump fitness room was floor to ceiling glass of the Chicago city landscape. Awesome! Each bike, treadmill, and eliptical machine was equipped with a tv monitor and you could plug in your ear phones. At the very end of the of the room is the free weight room. One negative...the self parking is very limited. If they are busy, it is very possible that you will not find a spot. This hotel while definitely frequented by business travelers also will meet the needs of the luxury seeking vacation traveler.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and subtle luxury\u201d", "Author": "krisgia", "ReviewID": "UR115913366", "Content": "The location of this hotel cannot be beat.

High ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, great view of the skyline and the river, excellent bathroom and quality linens. We both found the bed to be too soft, but that is, of course, a personal preference. For the most part, the service was good but not a cut above as I was expecting. The staff takes pride in learning the names of their guests, and is a nice touch when executed correctly, but I was twice referred to as \"Mr. Gordon\", which isn't my name. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it was a little awkward. The facilities in the spa are excellent, although the massage i received wasn't particularly memorable. The \"Deluge Shower\" they have in the locker room is awesome. It has nine jets and the water hits you from all angles. You can control the temperature and the tempo of the water and change the color of the lights in the shower. I've never experienced anything like it and highly recommend it. The location is hard to beat. You have easy access to Michigan Ave and Millenium Park and restaurants galore are within walking distance. Once we learned our way around the area it became obvious just how good the location is. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxury hotel in Chicago.

The room itself was extremely nice. Great views and nicely laid out. The balance of our experience was disappointing. We had no turn down service and when the service staff arranged the pullout bed for our granddaughter, they did not provide a pillow or adequate blankets. The second bathroom only was provided with shampoo. No conditioner, no shower mat, nothing other than shampoo. The tub drain did not work properly while the shower drain clogged. The drapes that reveal the view we pay extra for, are electric and operate by a switch. Half of the drapes in the master bedroom did not open in the morning. When our granddaughter received her candy gift, not only did they spell her name wrong, they used a male name (isn't that what Trump fires people for!). We had to ask the service staff for towels when we called for the turn down service. We did not eat dinner there, but the lunches were expensive and not exceptional for the price. Bottom line, it became humorous for the price we paid. This is an annual event for us and we stay at the Fine Hotels in Chicago for this. This was by far the most expensive and most disappointing of all the hotels. They really do not accomodate children like the other Fine Hotels in Chicago (this comes from my granddaughter). I'm assuming we had a bad experience that occasionally happens. The worst part of all was how the manager handled this at checkout. She asked about the experience and obviously knew of the turn down mistake. When I briefly explained it got worse, she apologized and offered to cover the $25 balance of our breakfast. The breakfast we had would have cost $20 at an expensive breakfast restaraunt. The actual bill was $75 since we had a $50 credit coming as part of our Amex package. With this offer she only added insult to the the experience. Our total bill was over $1,000 for one night. I'm assuming other hotels would have handled this much differently. I'm assuming that the high ratings this hotel receives are probably warranted as most of the staff does seem to try hard. Mechanical issues like our blinds will occur.

Also, the cookies were a nice touch, but he couldn't - and didn't - eat them (his big brother enjoyed them instead).

Mind you, it doesn't come cheap; although they were very willing to provide group rates for the rooms (and the group rate was excellent), any service or meal you have within the hotel is super high end. But...you get what you pay for. It is as luxurious a stay as anything you could ever ask for. In fact...we all liked it so much, we're going back for a second shot at it! If you're looking for some pampering, this is definitely the place to go (and to also get some of the best high views of the city!).", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOne word: superb\u201d", "Author": "CyberguyPR", "ReviewID": "UR113246557", "Content": "Stayed at the property in June 2011 for my 10th wedding anniversary. This is truly a wonderful hotel. If there is better service than this I would love to see it. During check-in someone quickly provided pink cotton candy and a Trump Kids hat to my daughter. Everyone addresses you by name and make sure you have everything you need. I took advantage of the complimentary shoe shine service and when they asked when I wanted them returned I said anytime would be fine as I was planning to be in the room all day. To my surprise they came back 20 minute later. I also asked for a blanket for my daughter and it was in my hands no later than 5 minutes after I called. The room is very modern and spacious. Open the motorized drapes, grab a copy of Robb Report or Luxe Source from the magazine rack and relax in the comfortable sectional sofa. The kitchen is great, featuring Sub-Zero and Miele appliances. For coffee lovers there is a Nespresso machine in the kitchen with 5 or 6 pods (bold, regular and decaf). You will also find the fridge has a wide variety of beverages ($$$) including beer, water, juice and a wide array of spirits. I ordered a small cake (4-6 people) which was exquisite and was surprised to see it show up along with 4 gigantic chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne which were comped by the hotel due to our anniversary celebration. Bravo on free wi-fi. Even though it was rather slow I appreciate the fact that is is free. this should be standard everywhere. Another small detail that caught my eye was the elegant charcoal gray, Chinese collar uniform that females wore at the front desk. Loved it! I am not deducting stars but had the following issues to point out: 1. Front desk Asian lady had such a thick accent and spoke so softly that it was very hard to hear/understand what she was saying. 2. The elevator has a voice announcing \"going up, going down\" that was very annoying. We were in and out the hotel a lot and just got annoyed every time we heard the voice.

The bathroom was also extremely spacious and had a very unique shower/bath tub layout with top-of-the-line fixtures.

Feeling very irritated, I asked them to correct my entree and send it to my room since I had been waiting a while. They delivered the food promptly but it was only ok. I've eaten in many fine dining restaurants and was not impressed by this one. I had my shoes shined using the complementary shoe shine service and requested the morning paper of my choice. I had a fabulous night's sleep in the very comfortable bed, and used the fitness center in the morning. The fitness center, hands down, was the best equipped hotel gym I've ever used. They had plenty of hand weights and a Smith press machine which I used for pull-ups. It was great! My room was impeccably clean expect for right next to the toilet paper dispenser.

Each time we visit Chicago, I like to try a different hotel. Trump International had a special rate for a three-night stay and that's what convinced me to give it a try. We arrived in the evening, escorted to our room by a bellman who showed us the details of our room. When he opened the curtains (electronic, by the way), the view took our breath away. Little touches -- bottled water, a small card with a featured quote, slippers by the bed, a small box of fabulous chocolates -- all examples of Trump's attention to detail. I fell in love with the single-cup coffee maker and the coffee (choice of three varieties) was generously replaced, even in the evening. Hotel staff exceeded my expectations in regard to attentiveness and courtesy. I was concerned I might feel out of place since the hotel is higher than my budget normally allows, but from the front desk to the bellman to the cleaning staff, we felt welcomed and valued. The bed and robes are heavenly and if you need to get ready when your favorite show is on, simply turn on the TV that appears in the bathroom mirror. Speaking of TV, check out the Trump Channel and watch the Discovery Channel Show \"Build it Big\" which features the construction of the Trump Tower. Highly entertaining and informative! The only negative that comes to mind is counter space in the bathroom for make-up, etc. (especially when you're sharing it with your 20-something daughter). I like the fact that you have to use your room card to operate the elevators - made us feel safe and a little more special. Also, the room is so quiet, we never heard neighbors' doors opening and shutting like you do in most hotels. Another plus: free internet that works - something every hotel should provide. The pool is fabulous (even though we forgot our swimsuits) and was stocked with plush towels, refreshing cucumber water, and of course, Trump bottled water. I have stayed in close to 10 different Chicago hotels and this is the best by far. If you have a special trip planned to Chicago, splurge and stay at the Trump International Hotel and Tower. One last thing - today I received an e-mail from \"Mr. Donald Trump\" (okay, I know it's not from him personally), that asked for my opinion about my visit.

The suite had a guest bathroom ( complete with a TV in the mirror) a full service kitchen, fully stocked with numerous bottles of champagne, snacks, and other alcoholic beverages, a full living room and dining room, and master suite. The master suite had floor to ceiling windows with an AMAZING city view. The master bathroom had a huge double vanity, separate room for toilet, and full jacuzzi tub and separate shower. There was a separate \"powder room\" and of course, there were already robes and slippers laid out on the huge California King. The suite was also wired with surround sound, three plasma TVs and two ipod docks. I was beyond amazed at this room, and I was able to have a fabulous birthday. The Trump truly is about living a life of luxury. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who is interested in seeing Chicago in style. I have been to both bars at The Trump, on this occasion, as well as others. The drinks are phenomenal and are all hand crafted, but quite pricey. The only negative thing I would have to say is that I was quite astounded at the amount they charged for incidentals. On a $750 room, there were over $350 in incidentals, which was insane.

Never did figure out how to turn on or off the bathroom lights. The phone only worked as a speaker phone. Curtains open with buttons. A heavy, frosted sliding glass door to the bathroom that didn't shut completely. But back to the service - turndown was perfect, leaving popcorn, root beer and water.

While we only skimmed the surface of the available services, the personal touches were terrific. We stayed in the city-view study and it was quite spacious. The bed was terrific and it was a treat having a kitchen in the suite. There are no true complaints about the place. Three very minor observations: 1. Not enough creamer in the cupboard. There was a fantastic coffee maker (Le Cube) maker with six pleasing options for coffee with plenty of sweetener, but only two creamers. I am certain that if I'd requested more, I would have gotten it. But, it would have been nice to have it stocked better. 2. The lighting in the bathroom could have been brighter, even with the lit makeup mirror. My wife needed to put her makeup on in the main room as she wasn't happy with the lighting in the bathroom. I thought it was fine, though admittedly on the dark side. No, there weren't any obvious lights out and, yes, I had all available lights on. Didn't complain to anyone about this, either. 3. The fancy mirror-based TV was neat, but only ran ads about the Trump construction and available services. Despite thinking I am at least as bright as the average bear, I couldn't get the darn channel to change beyond the aquarium (neat touch) and the three Trump channels. Again, didn't care enough to call the desk, but would have liked to have watched football in there. In short, an amazing stay in a setting that provided everything we wanted. Oh yeah, the breakfast was great. Definitely recommend getting the 'simple luxury' add-on.

The lobby, while small, is intimate and comfortable, and it is an easy place to rendezvous with people. The one glitch in the hotel was the extremely slow, painfully slow, aggravatingly slow elevators. There are only three elevators in the elevator bank that serves all the hotel rooms, and they often took forever -- well, more literally, 5-10 minutes, which is a really long time to wait for an elevator on a consistent basis! I stayed at the hotel for four nights, and after a while, I had to build an extra 10 minutes into my plans to get anywhere in the city, just to account for the elevator wait time -- to make sure I wouldn't be late. Kind of ridiculous. It wasn't enough of a problem for me to lower my rating, but it was close -- if there were half stars, I would give the hotel 4 1/2 stars out of 5, as a result of the poor elevator planning.

After reading some great reviews both on TA and in some magazines, I thought we'd give it a try. To be clear, I had high expectations going in which never helps. My main issues were as follows: I am a very light sleeper and the mini bar is see through and lit up and in the room we had it was also facing the bed. It was very annoying and at one point I had to get up and cover it with a towel which still didn't help (nearly broke a coffee cup in the process). Also, the electric curtains do not black out the room. Especially not in the end room we had with the huge floor to ceiling windows (which are nice to look out). Next, the pillows are about the worst I have had yet in a high end 5* hotel. The oddest thing is the cool pillow menu they have which was very exciting BUT they either have super soft pillows or super thick firm pillows. Nothing in between! I found this to be very odd. Suggestion - add some medium thickness pillows, very easy. The airstream pillow was interesting, but not for me. Picky, yes, but oh well. That's I why go for high end hotels. I could not find a comfy pillow. Last main issue was the constant banging on my window on Saturday morning. Never experienced anything like that in a hotel. At first I called down and asked if they were washing the windows and they said yes! But it turned out to be the wind. Still odd. Worst two nights of sleep I ever had in a 5* hotel. Another negative was that the classes in the gym are extra $$, unlike the Peninsula. Now, on the brighter side, the service was very good. When I complained about the mini bar light after the first night they had it disabled. When I said that I could not sleep in that room after the 2nd night with the banging on the window, they were nice enough to move to us to another room on the other side of the hotel which also also a nicer room. But as you can imagine at that point, I was disenchanted and very tired. Then, the air conditioner in that room didn't work, but it was quickly fixed. Also, the lighting panel next to the bed was out of sorts and I couldn't turn off a couple of the lights properly. I'm just being honest here. Overall the rooms are nice and modern and clean. The kitchen in the suite was very cool along with the mock fireplace. Bathrooms are great, especially the tub in the spa rooms, but I don't understand why there are no speakers in the ceiling and why they went through all that trouble to put in electric curtains and then didn't put a control panel next to the beds. But you'd only notice that if you'd stayed in a Peninsula or MO in Asia where they have that. Otherwise, you'll like it. It really seemed like the people there have been trained very well, but there still the feeling of newness rather than a seasoned staff.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "detroit", "Title": "\u201cBravo!

It was not spectacular, it was MORE than spectacular. It was not fabulous and luxurious, it was MORE than fabulous and luxurious.

This only enhanced my anticipation for a great stay! The attentive valets were there on a moments notice, opening the car door, opening the entrance door, making me feel totally welcome. Then on to the polite desk staff, who even wished me a happy birthday, (I had noted it on my guest profile, but not mentioned it to anyone, great attention to details!) Then the golden moment....the crowning glory....the room! They had graciously upgraded me to a one bedroom suite! I was speechless! Two bathrooms, kitchen with island and granite counter tops, (with a individual birthday cake waiting for me!) stainless steel appliances, beautiful plush living room with fireplace, beautiful bedroom with soft music playing, and those windows! All this for me!? And when I opened those drapes, (which you push a button and they open themselves) and saw the view, I actually screamed! I had to put my hand over my mouth! The city of Chicago was at my fingertips! I could see everything! Michigan Avenue, the river, the tourist boats going back and forth, I could see all the way out across Lake Michigan, the view was infinite! I could see Navy Pier, the Wrigley clock was within my reach, and at night, oh my.....the ferris wheel, lit up and blinking, the city lights, the street lights going so far up Wabash, it was never ending. I had to decide, did I want to go out? Did I want to leave all this, walk around, go shopping? or did I want to stay in this crazy wonderful room? Could I tear myself away from this view? Alas, I did go out for a short time, and with a spring in my step, knowing what I had waiting for me when I returned! You must stay at this hotel.

My girlfriend and I are college students working to pay our way through school. Naturally, we don't have a lot of money, but we decided to splurge on our trip to Chicago. We originally planned to stay at the Holiday Inn Express just down the road from Trump, but changed our minds due to the great reviews about Trump. And WOW, we were more than happy when we arrived. Prior to our stay, I emailed attache to notify them that I was planning to propose to my girlfriend on our trip. I wanted to gather any helpful advice and information about services they could offer to make the experience more special. I was very impressed at the quick response (it was within the same hour that the message was sent). I was told that the there would be a notification on my reservation stating it was a \"special proposal stay.\" Upon checking in, the receptionist told us that we had a complimentary upgrade from the Superior King room to a Spa Suite (that's about a $200 upgrade)! *Note: the front desk/entrance personal are extremely friendly and helpful. I figured that our young age would cause them to not take us seriously, but it was exactly the opposite - we felt so comfortable, like family. Being a 5-star hotel, one would assume the staff would be snobby, but trust me, the Trump staff is quite the opposite. I wish I could remember the names of the two nice ladies who helped us check in, because they were two of the most polite, kind people in the world. We got our key and headed up to our special upgraded room. We were both speechless when we opened the door. The hotel had given us a room with a river view, which overlooked the Wrigley building, and Lake Michigan was visible. Not to mention, the room was MASSIVE. The bed was HUGE and so comfortable. Personally, I like to sleep in late (I work a second shift job, so I'm not usually required to wake up until about 11am each day), but after sleeping in that bed I was wide awake and well-rested at 7am. The sunshine pouring through the giant 10-foot floor-to-ceiling windows was a great way to wake up. Within the first hour of being checked in, there was a knock on our door. Who was it? room service with a VERY special amenity completely free-of-charge. The deliverer told us that it was a gift from the hotel because of the special occasion. Bottom line - my girlfriend and I felt like royalty the entire time. We've never before had anyone treat us like the most important people in the world, but the Trump staff managed to do so. In the future, I will never visit Chicago without staying at the Trump Hotel. Once you stay here, you'll never stay elsewhere. I've already began recommending my friends and family to this hotel, and I would encourage anyone reading this review to do the same; it is well worth the little bit of extra money.

We were quite nervous about traveling without all of our things at home, but the Trump Kids program was just great for travelers with infants. I haven't seen many focus on these amenities, so I will highlight. In summary, a great trip and we would visit again. Luxury, helpful staff and a worry free vacation. The basics: They provided us with diapers, wipes, a diaper pail, desitin, shampoo and a rubber ducky! The cribs were great and the backpack had some coloring books and crayons. The robes and slipper were far too big for our young ones, but a nice idea. The lights are all on dimmers, perfect for nap time. The full refrigerator allowed us to stock the basics for the infants (a full grocery store was a 5 minute walk). We even cooked some minor meals on the electric stove and microwave oven for the kids. The cleaning service was always doing a great job cleaning up the little crumbs left by the boys. We stayed using the Amex FHR program and were upgraded to a 1BR suite. Wow! 1,200 sq ft, two rooms which allowed the parents to watch tv while the kids slept. Plenty of space in either room for both cribs and for playtime and burning off some energy. Nice furniture, tvs and a cool bathroom tv built into the mirror. Shaving took a while longer. We had a $100 spa credit, and blew through that, not cheap but good services. The spa and gym were huge, the 8-jet shower was a delight in the spa, the pool was okay, but not designed for infants (3 ft deep at the shallow end, and divided into three lanes). They had a few water toys and rafts for the kiddos, which was a nice touch. We only ate breakfast in the hotel, and it was quite expensive though delicious. $8 for a bowl of cereal, $12 for three pastries, $8 for two slices of toast. Plus, $4 delivery fee and 18% tip added for room service. I would recommend the heart healthy pancakes, french toast and belgium waffles ($18 each). Service was great for the most part. Needed a hand with luggage, no problem, just call. Needed a tide-to-go stick for the stains on the shirt, it was delivered in 5 minutes. Needed batteries for the kids toys, delivered in 10 minutes. Excellent! However, at check out we called down to get help with luggage and a taxi (van, because all of the luggage and stroller). A bellhop came immediately to help us with the luggage, but 15 minutes later there was still no taxi van. They said \"we haven't seen one yet\" Come on! I have a flight to catch and you left it to chance that one would drive by as opposed to calling. That is not fitting with the rest of the excellent customer service. Also, the valet that loaded the luggage into the van put the bag in upside down, and at the airport we were rudely greeted by a wet bag full of leaking baby formula. I know he didn't realize what was in the bag, but there was room to put it right-side up as opposed to upside down and he snapped when I went back to help load it (again, I am sure good intentions to allow me to relax and get seated with the family, but not the best communication). The Concierge staff was mixed (good job David on your recommendations, Gwen you made dinner plans for the wrong night). They were able to arrange through Sitter Studio babysitting ($20/hr, 4 hr min) so we could have dinner together without the kids. Previous reviewers commented on the lobby and open areas not being very large, and this is true but who cares. There is plenty of space in The Spa on the 14th floor to relax, sit and read, but the hotel layout is designed for privacy and serenity, and I like not having 50 people in the lobby staring at you when you come and go. Free wireless internet was also a plus along with a great location that was walking distance to most things, or a $10 cab ride to museums. I would visit again and rate this among my best hotel experiences. This was even better to me than my stays at the Four Seasons in Chicago because it seemed less pretentious and more kid friendly.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLovely room - lovely touches for kids - overall lovely but not blown away!\u201d", "Author": "conors-kangaroo", "ReviewID": "UR70721219", "Content": "I have never written a hotel review on here before but I read and value the reviews all the time when booking hotels myself so I thought it was about time that I contributed. Stayed here last December for a short last minute trip for my birthday. After considering New York we realised we could stay at this hotel for far cheaper than an average hotel in New York. What a good decision we made as Chicago is a delight and we will definitely be back. Everything was so convenient and we found people to be so helpful and friendly. Now for the hotel, First impression was great. Lots of staff, no line. Beautiful Christmas tree. Lobby area a bit on the small side and not much seating. I had booked the hotel under my maiden name as my email address and passport are still under same and have learnt from past experience its easier to have booking and email in the same name but they kept addressing my husband with my maiden name it was funny the first time so I let it go but by the third time I had to tell the girl at reception that that was my name and not his!!...Poor girl was very embarrassed but we thought it was funny and took it in good spirits. They immediately gave my 6 year old at the time a little Trump kids back pack with lots of goodies inside like crayons, colouring book, a little cuddly cow (who he named Donald!), little business cards with his name on it -handy in case he got lost we stuck one always in his pocket with our mobile phone number on it just in case he strayed from us. It was all a big hit with him. We were very swiftly taken to our room. I had asked for a room on a high floor which they had honoured. What hit me immediately was the sense of space and how clean the room was and the HUGE bed. Think it was the high ceilings and the huge floor to ceiling windows that gave the sense of space. The bed was gigantic and full of plush cushions and pillows. I was dying to dive on it! They had left a cookie and milk out for my son which was also a nice touch. Great to see a hotel like this catering so well for kids. Room had a kitchenette which we didnt use except for the fridge which was fully stocked but still left room for us to put our water in. Big wardrobe with light! Lovely bathroom with tv in mirror which was a novel touch. Bath and shower were a funny set up. Behind a glass screen was the shower which was next to the bath also behind the glass screen. Loved the bath products but once you got your hands wet they were the most non-user friendly bottles I have ever experienced in any hotel. I know its only a little thing but I am so surprised no one has mentioned it. It was like a comedy scene every time I went to use the shower. If your hands are wet at all (which most peoples are in showers) when the bottles are upside down to empty the products out they exploded out of your hands....not once! not twice! but many times! So shampoo and conditioner and shower gel were going all over the place except into my hands. Its the pyramid shape of the bottle. It doesnt work upside down guys!!!...Its only a small thing but my husband had the same problem. Lovely bathrobes and slippers. My husband is a very tall man so I phoned down and asked for a larger one for him, I had noted from their website that they supply play stations and robes and slippers for kids also so requested both for my son because I knew we would be using the pool. The playstation was in our room along with my husbands robe (it was brand new in a packet) when we arrived back but unfortunately my sons robe and slippers never arrived! I didnt bother to follow it up but it kind of irked me when I saw other kids in theirs at the poolside. The day of my birthday, when we came back to our room that evening they had left me a small chocolate dessert and a note wishing me a happy birthday which was a nice touch and delicious but it was miniscule when divided by three so I let my son eat it. Think you could be a little more generous than that Trump but I dont mean to sound ungrateful. It was a nice thought. Thank you! The swimming pool was lovely and there was no one there initially. It soon filled up. Seperate lane for those who want to do lengths. Plenty of comfortable chairs poolside with plenty of clean towels available for pool users. Some pool toys too. The most spotlessly clean and well stocked ladies changing room I have ever been in. Robes left in every locker. We had a look in the gym on our way to the pool and it was very busy, lots of water and fruit to refresh those pumping iron. We looked in again on our way back to our hotel room after our swim and it was practically empty so for those gym using people timing is everything! We wanted to eat in a diner for breakfast. Unfortunately there is none nearby. Dunkin donuts was across the street which was fine for a cup of coffee. So husband was sent over every morning to get a coffee for us and cereal for my son and we then got up at our leisure and sauntered down for brunch to Tempo diner recommended by the concierge which was about a 10-15 walk away, which ironically is right beside Sofitel hotel which was my alternative (and cheaper option) hotel if I hadnt stayed at Trump but we decided to splurge a bit because it was my birthday. Hmm!... I took a peek in the Sofitel and they had a bigger foyet and a restaurant and bar on the ground floor which I thought might be more family friendly for our next stay in Chicago! Back to Trump - Concierge was very helpful recommending things to do and restaurants nearby. Ate at Grand Cafe Lux on his recommendation. I think its owned by the Cheesecake Factory definitely same style but much nearer the hotel. Family friendly. Didnt eat in the hotel or visit the bar as we had a child with us. Pity there wasnt more seating in the foyet area because would have been nice to have a glass of wine there to relax after the very busy days out sightseeing and shopping. I felt we were confined to our room once we came back to the hotel. Another thing to note was how well stocked and restocked the room was as we were using it with bath products and towels. We commented on the fact that not once did we see a hotel trolley or maid cleaning rooms but thats something you would expect from a 5 star hotel. They were very discreet. Also, we had a plumbing issue at one stage that was sorted very promptly by the hotel and the guy that came to the room was very efficient and very friendly. One other little niggly thing though was every night they converted the sofa to a sofa bed for my son which was great except it left the room quite cramped and twice I hurt my leg from the edges of the sofa bed. So much so that we used to convert it back to a sofa and my son slept in the bed with us. It was so gigantic and comfy a family of five could have fitted in it! But as we were confined to our room I felt we needed the space more and was fed up being bruised by the iron bars from the sofa bed.. All in all, very nice hotel, tad on the expensive side for Chicago but worth it for a special occassion. Much cheaper than New York. Check your bill as they tried to charge us for a the brand new robe they sent to our room for my husband! Immediately sorted and taken off our bill but some people might not check. For a 5 star hotel I think I would expect more communal lounge areas. Would have been nice to relax in the evening and people watch! Maybe thats just a European thing we like to do. Definitely loved all the extras they gave my son and from that aspect very family friendly if they could just sort out the public seating areas it would tick all our boxes. Would have loved to have been able to visit the top of the building to see the views but the whole top half of the building are Trump private residences and condos so not possible which is a pity. Anyway, definitely a lovely hotel but I think I may try the Sofitel next as might suit our needs better. Stayed in the Sofitel in Munich before and was blown away by it so have a leaning towards the Sofitel. I am aware Trump International, Chicago has won some awards lately but dont get complacent Trump. I have stayed in some equally impressive and some even more luxurious hotels, Sofitel Munich being one of them. Next time we come to Chicago will definitely check Trumps rates but I reckon we will end up in the Sofitel due to its proximity to family friendly restaurants and diners and of course shopping!", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect experience-\u201d", "Author": "travelclassygal", "ReviewID": "UR69829537", "Content": "Splurged and stay at the Trump and it was worth every penny,no nickel and diming for water or extra towels or sheets or use of gym or pool.Classy place-The best view in Chicago!

Over the course of the past thirty years of my business career, I have stayed in many of the top US hotels and many of the world's great hotels, from London's Connaught, to Geneva's Hotel des Bergues, to HK's Mandarin and Peninsula, and Tokyo's Seiyo Ginza. The Trump Chicago is definitely in the same league as these great international hotels, yet it also retains a distinctly American flavor: friendly service, modern design, and leading edge technology. From the moment you arrive, the service is impeccable and achieves the elusive ideal balance between professionalism and friendliness. The staff are efficient, attractive, well groomed, courteous, and extremely helpful. Moreover you never, ever have the feeling that anyone is expecting any kind of a gratutity, which can be so offputting in certain American cities. Here, you truly get the feeling that you are a valued guest and that whatever can be done to make you comfortable and happy is cheerfully offered. From the reception staff to the room staff to the restaurant and spa staff, everyone did a superlative job. Our room was magnificent: 900 square feet with a superb view of the lake, a fully equipped kitchen area (including Nespresso coffee machine) an enormous and delightfully comfortable bed, and a very complete and efficient bathroom. The design was modern, but not oppressively so. The high ceilings reinforced the feeling of space. The electrically controlled drapes opened onto magnificent floor to ceiling windows, the soaking tub in the bathroom allowed for a bit of indulgence. This was truly one of the best rooms I have experienced in 30 years... The location was ideal for anyone having business in the downtown/loop area and there were always taxis a doorman's whistle away, despite a busy convention (which had the hotel 100% full) as well as regular summer thundershowers. As for food and wine, we spent our first evening at Rebar, having quickly changed after an arrival from the West Coast, and found the cocktails to be delicious, the Sushi/Sashimi remarkably good, and the ambiance lively and young. We were in fact surprised when the lights were raised shortly before 1am to indicate that closing time was approaching. We had been having such fun that time truly flew by. We did not dine at the in-house restaurant so I can not comment on that. The exercise facilities were state of the art, in pristine condition, had spectacular views and contained everything one could possibly want. We did not use the spa facilities so this is something else I can not comment on. In summary: a truly outstanding experience. I would definitely stay there on my next trip to Chicago. And while this hotel clearly charges five star prices, they unquestionnably deliver five star service; so even if one was not travelling on business, I can think of no better place to treat oneself to real luxury. And I left thinking what a pleasure it was to see an American hotel earning a place among the unique establishments of the world.

It was supposed to be ready at 3 and I was not interested in the drink coupons to be used at the bar, so \"another\" room was found for us. I was told it was not an upgrade, but I could not have been happier when shown our room. It was 2701 and had spectacular views of the Chicago river, the Wrigley building and more - could not have been better. The furnishings were understated and luxurious, the room itself was very spacious as was the bathroom. We LOVED the bedding, the terry robes, the slippers and the TV \"in\" the bathroom mirror - truly wonderful. The pillows were scrumptious, and the pillow \"menu\" of complimentary upgrades was a nice touch. We had a drink on the LOVEY terrace on the 16th floor and each ordered a $20+ salad. You are absolutely paying for the view, because my salad was inedible and I ended up sending it back for another that was very over-dressed. My husband's salad was forgettable. So, my advice is skip the food and just enjoy a cocktail and the view. Another tip is the terrace has no heaters and gets brisk quickly as the sun sets.

Wonderful stay.\u201d", "Author": "kaunismatka", "ReviewID": "UR65070593", "Content": "The Trump in Chicago is absolutely beautiful. From the outside of the building, to the lobby, to the room, to the health club, everything about it is gorgeous and luxurious. We stayed at the Trump for 3 nights. We reserved a Superior King room on a 3-night seasonal offer. It worked out to be three nights for the price of two. From what I can tell, the Superior King is the same room as the Deluxe King room, but is only called a Superior King room when you book a multi-night stay. The room was large and had beautiful, up-to-date furnishings. It had floor-to-ceiling windows the length of the room, and we even had a beautiful view of the river. There was free wireless internet, a large (42\", I think) flat screen TV, a comfortable chaise lounge, a couch, a wonderfully comfortable bed, and a Bose sound system with an iPod dock. Oh, and a large closet. The number of TV channels was sufficient, although I wouldn't call it a lot of channels. There was no Food Network or HGTV for me, although there were multiple ESPN channels for my husband. There was a full kitchen with refrigerator, dishwasher, sink, two-burner stove, toaster, Nespresso machine, electric teapot, dishes, cookware, and silverware. The Nespresso and tea were complimentary. I really loved the Nespresso coffee, although the Nespresso pods were not refilled on our last day. Disappointing. :( The refrigerator was stocked with honor bar items, but there was room to put a few of our own things in there, and we were not charged for moving the honor bar items, as you might be elsewhere. The bathroom was large and beautiful, with a large glass shower and deep soaking tub. I used the tub more than once! The Trump-branded toiletries have a lovely, fresh scent, & I loved them. Are they truly made for Trump, or are they another brand with Trump's label on them? I guess I'll never know. :) There is a \"Do not disturb\" light that can be turned on at the door. We really appreciated this, since this meant there was no unwanted knocking by housekeeping. There is nightly turndown service that is supposed to come between 5 and 9 p.m. Our first night, it was 9:15 and they hadn't come. I was tired and wanted to take a bath, so I turned our \"Do not disturb\" light on. They left a note saying they had stopped by, but our light was on, and if we still wished to have them come that we should call. The second night, they were in our room when we returned for the evening, between 9 and 10 pm. We took a little walk around the hotel while they finished. They brought bottles of water for each of us, turned down the lights, and put quiet music on. The third night, we returned to our room around 9:30 pm, and the turndown had not been done. We waited to get undressed, assuming they would come soon. Finally, at 10:15, we were exhausted from our day and turned on our \"Do not disturb\" light. Fifteen minutes later, I checked our door and they had left the note saying they had stopped by. It felt, to us, that they were waiting for us to turn our light on, to avoid having to turn down our room. In my opinion, if the service is supposed to be done between 5 and 9, then it should be done within that window, not at 10:15 at night. Perhaps this would be okay with people who are out later than we were, but I am pregnant and needed to go to sleep. We did not go to the restaurants or bar, so I can't comment on those, but we did use the health club, and it's beautiful. It's huge, with many machines, and has a wonderful view of the city. Each machine has a bottle of water and a towel on it. Each machine has its own tv, and there are headphones available for you to use. The locker rooms are gorgeous. Each locker has a robe, slippers, and towel inside it, and a combination lock for you to set your own code. We were always treated well by every employee we encountered. We were greeted with a smile, and they were always very polite. It should be noted that the hotel puts a $200/night incidental hold on your credit card. We were not warned about this. When my husband noticed it on his credit card account, we inquired what it was for, and were told it would be released upon our departure if we didn't incur any additional charges. It was fine with us, and it was released several business days after we left Chicago. But I think it's worth mentioning, as someone else might be taken off guard by it. The hotel, as a whole, is pristine. I didn't see so much as a piece of lint on the floor. I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel; their housekeeping staff must be amazing! All in all, we had a wonderful experience at the Trump. We felt pampered and taken care of.

I've been fortunate to have stayed at some wonderful hotels, but very rarely am I driven to write such a glowing review. I'm still here as part of an extended business trip with my wife, but wanted to write this review while everything is fresh in my mind. This is the nicest hotel I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. The hotel rooms themselves are beautiful. Starting with the bathroom, with a glassed off shower/step in tub area, an electric mirror with built-in TV (cool for a gadget guy like me), fully automated/dimmable lighting, etc. The room (at least that I'm in) also has a mini-fridge, 2-burner flat surface stove top, microwave and is fully stocked with plates, glasses, cutlery and the like. While it's doubtful that you'd actually cook anything during your stay, the kitchen amenities come in handy if you visit Giordano's for a stuffed crust pizza, which really needs to be eaten with a knife and fork. There's also an espresso maker, but we haven't needed it given the coffee available throughout the hotel. Rounding out the room amenities are switch operated drapes (room can be pitch black in midday), Bose wave system, lit closet, flatscreen tv system, and an incredibly comfortable bed. But, as nice as the room is, as my review title says, I think the service really sets this hotel apart. The room has robes, slippers, and numerous other little touches, including and an umbrella for free use, The hotel has a health club and pool on the 14th floor. It has a locker room, with electronic lockers stocked with robes and towels. These are lockable with digital key codes for guests. Go into the health club, and every machine has a bottle of water and towel on it. In the pool area, towels are on every chair, there's water, apples, newspapers and a water punch available. There's also coffee available in the morning outside the locker rooms, and separate wet and dry saunas in them. Service. Just one example. We asked the concierge for directions to a local camera store, because we forgot to bring our camera's battery charger. Instead, they checked their back area and, found that they had a fully compatible charger. They then took our camera upstairs, plugged in the battery to charge while we went out for a walk down Michigan Ave. But this is just a reflection of the continuous service excellence. Housekeeping is spectacular, loading and running the dishwasher every morning in the course of cleaning the room, assembling the numerous pillows, including specially spa pillows, during turndown service in the evening, welcome greetings from virtually every staff member you encounter on your walk into the hotel, and full-on smiles from everyone. The location right on the Chicago river is awesome for walks down the newly developed Riverwalk and access to the numerous river tours and water taxis. To be balanced, I do take away a rating point for location since the hotel is somewhat isolated and it takes a minute to walk from the hotel doors to anywhere meaningful - but that is a little nit-picky. There's lots more to add, which I might do later, but for now, wanted to express my thoughts on this wonderful hotel.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cSecond time at the Trump...I'll be back a third time for Lollapalooza in August.\u201d", "Author": "andergtr", "ReviewID": "UR61996647", "Content": "This is a follow-up to an earlier review.

I never quite figured out how they all worked (you'll know what I mean). * Also disliked the elevators because you need your key card to get up to the room which I find a hassle, but I suppose its necessary for security. * Hotel bar/restaurant is decent, if way overpriced. We had appetizers and a few drinks when first arrived and the tab was well over $200 for the three of us.

From the doorman like MK and Casete (sorry about the spelling) to the housekeeping staff who kept the room spotless, the Trump staff went above and beyond in their efforts to make our stay memorable.

I asked for a tour of two different suites (just so that I'd know my options when I go back)and was accommodated right away. Also, the pool was great and the locker room was probably even better!!! The locker room had everything you needed - including a contraption to ring out your wet bathing suit, a steam shower, and a shower with lights and music!!! Crazy, but fun.

My husband had not even checked-in yet and some guy was trying to take our bags. The warmed wet, scented wash cloths for our tired hands was a nice-surprise. The location of the hotel is prime. If you want to enjoy a stay at this fabulous address I suggest you take advantage of the four-night stay for $209 like we did. Save money on dining and get bigger servings of food by trying the Corner Bakery up the street or the South Water Kitchen for Zagat-rated dining at half the price of the breakfast at the Trump restaurant. Remember there is room-service and it is lovely, but know this: the prices match the service. In other words, be prepared to pay a lot for it. There is a $4 delivery charge plus additional rates that apply. The room was lovely with in-room kitchen, fridge, safe, stove and utensils, but for what we needed the Spa was enough. The bathroom had a nice shower and tub, but the Spa outdid the inroom tub and shower. The narrow lay out of the room and the view from our room was somewhat dissatisfying since I would have preferred being up highter, and I kept whacking my knee on the bench at the foot of the bed facing the dresser and TV. We didn't use the pillow menu at all since I counted at least 6 pillows on our California King bed. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and the clock radio was a nice one. The DVD player on our TV was not connected but my husband checked behind the TV and plugged the DVD player in so I could watch George Clinton's Funkadelic Video we bought for 11 bucks (along with a lot more great CD's and DVD's at the nearby F.Y.E. Store.) Each day you get an inspirational card by your bed, and free bottles of Trump Water. There is a complimentary turn-down at night that may or may not be annoying to some who are trying to dress to go out at night. There is free tea, and a variety of free espresso for the machine in your room. As for the kitchen, I must say the fridge and countertops are somewhat cluttered with foodstuffs and treats they are trying to sell you. It was a struggle to put a piece of pizza in the fridge with all the bottles of booze and drinks in them. Note; Ice is not free. This hotel room could be an apartment you can cook in if you want. I was worried throughout my stay that Trump International would not make it since there are so few customers visible, just staff. Perhaps it is a slow time in Chicago, but I hope that the staff and services continue and the hotel can make it in these times. \\ We were the only two patrons at breakfast in Sixteen on Saturday morning. What I found irritating was a man in a suit who came to our table, did not introduce himself but started asking us questions. Here is what we want. Leave us alone, unless you tell us who you are and what it is you want. If you think we want to meet you, think again. In spite of strangers interrupting us in mouthfuls of food, the restaurent was ok, but very, very expensive. A glass of orange juice is 7 dollars, eggs are 8 dollars. The menu is limited and the servings are really small, but the coffee is good. Trump hires a lot of immigrants and this is the nature of city-dwellers. Nevertheless, take our advice, lay off the questions and leave us alone is the motto of utter discretion. While I know this guy, whoever he was, was trying to be friendly, we are on vacation and do not want to have to make nice, especially to strangers. The staff could do with more training. The lady at the front-desk didn't know whether there was a breakfast menu or buffet served in the mornings at the restaurent, nor did she know how the in-room fast check out on the TV menu worked. She eventually found out the answers to my questions but did not know things off the top of her head! 8 things to do in Chicago: Go to the Museum of Science and Industry, Visit Macy's = the old Marshall Fields men store, on State. Go to a Broadway show in the Theatre District, Go to Lincoln Park Zoo, and Conservatory. Visit the Chicago Institute of Art. Go to the Millenium Park.

The bellhops at the door are nice, but it doesn't seem like there is a real system they have developed for getting in and out of the hotel lobby, i.e. opening doors and unpacking luggage for guests. There were some moments where they ran to open the door for us, and other times where we just did it ourselves. Not a big deal, just something I noticed. The lobby is nice, but small. You have to scan your room key in the elevator to get up to your room, which some may think is inconvienant, however I think its a great extra security feature. Our suite on the 27th floor was fantastic. The room was spacious, roomy, all modern appliances in the kitchenette, and was very lush. It was everything I would have thought a Trump room would be like, and then some. The bathroom was awesome, double sinks, hair dryer in the drawer, dim lighting, TV in the mirror, all very cool and romantic. When we arrived the maid was still servicing the room (which i thought was odd for a 5:30pm check in), however she was pretty much done and said she'd come back because we told her we were just dropping our stuff off and leaving for dinner anyway. I was reviewing the menu for room service and WOW is it expensive. A little bit too expensive in my opinion. You can change out the pillows in your room, as they have a \"pillow menu\"... which I thought was really cool. Overall, we had a very nice experience, and this hotel has lived up to its hype.

No real negatives. They probably could have had a whirlpool bath and bigger shower instead of three full baths in our condo.

When I was checked into this room no one showed me how to work the complicated lights which were nice on dimmers and all but I had to call maintenence to come and put bulbs in some that were burned out and explain how to work them at all, costing me precious time. Long after midnight when I could no longer tolerate the conversations through the adjoing door situation, with it's surprisingly little sound barrier, service quickly responded to move me to another room. I moved into this second Spa Suite room and found the air machine as loud as I would expect to find at an interstate hightway motel but I was told that was due to it being some sort of purification system- which the hotel doesn't seem to need anyway. Maintenence was able to turn the loud air system off from remote, but again that took time for me to secure having first to allow a maintenence worker in the room, etc... On top of that desk staff explained to me that they leave the Bose Wave Radios on in unoccupied rooms so that staff will know if the room is unoccupied. All night long I could feel the thump of the bass and hear the music right through the wall which was so annoying! So many things seemed overly complicated at the hotel, from a shower in the health spa requiring reading glasses to program the computer running it, to tv's so high tech it took forever to change channels, to espresso makers that while nice did require a read up in the manual to figure out. The restaurant is very beautiful, but like the whole hotel, pretty cool to cold, spare, elegant decor. Service was great, food very good. The health spa is also pretty nice, and you could lift heavy weights or do cardio on alot of equipment if you were so inclined. The health club and pool have nice views, and are super clean and nice. The massage I had was extremely excellent but the manicure/pedicure was about the worst I have ever had and I re-did myself the next day. I stayed at the hotel in part because I was shopping for a residence in Chicago, and even scheduling to look at the residences in the building was more complicated than it needed to be. There is no lobby life at the Trump. Just a small sofa and chairs, not a social place at all. The lounge, Rebar, upstairs is the socializing area when it is open in the evenings and while it is posh like the rest of the place, it does not seem to offer much of a sense of friendliness to the solo traveller as I was. In total, Trump like the man comes off as complicated, egotistical, sophisticated, high tech, striving for greatness. Perhaps the best thing about staying in hotels that aim to be the best as Trump is obviously trying to do is that they do really care about your experience and will work to make it right as they did for me at Trump.

Trump is truly a five-star experience. All good hotels have decent beds, edible food, clean rooms. To me the mark of a five-star establishment is the service and attention to detail, and Trump excelled. Our welcome from valet, belstaff and front desk was very cordial -- we were upgraded to a room with the best view of the city I had ever seen, and I live here. On the 22nd story, we looked out out the river to the lake. Bridges, Wrigley Building, tour boats, traffic, pedestrians -- I liked it because it was high enough to not be too loud but low enough to be interesting. And the room was very quiet. You enter into a long hall that gives the room a sense of privacy and being set back. Beautiful, restful colors, greys and browns, contemporary without feeling harsh. Kitchenette with all high-end appliances and finishes, as you would expect. Disregard minibar! Bose sound system playing softly when we arrived. Bellman very friendly and informative. We had in-room dining the first night and the server set up four chairs for us and our guests. Only a 30-minute wait on a Friday night, and the food was outstanding. The room service person called up to make sure everything was ok, which we appreciated. I never sleep well in hotels, but the bed was very comfortable, as others have indicated. Check out the \"pillow menu\"! All-marble, spa-like bathroom with nice lighting. We breakfasted in the restaurant and the service, again, could not have been more solicitous. A nice feature is the \"juice of the day\" -- on this day, some kind of berry. Tasted very natural. Yum. Another observation we had: it doesn't feel snooty or faux-Continental.

The photos on the website do not do this suite justice. The overall effect of the high ceilings, huge space, floor-to-ceiling windows and incredible view was just stunning.

Like many hotels in Chicago, the hotel is split up with a small lobby at ground level, restaurant and spa on 12 and 14, with rooms above these floors. This arrangement may bother some guests as the hotel has no real center or focal area, but this set up is a matter of personal taste. For us it was not really a problem. However, the lobby is small and the front desk was too close to the elevator lobby. The weekend we were at the hotel, it was very busy and getting around the front desk line was annoying and not what you want to see at a nice hotel. Compounding the problem was one of the three elevators to the guest rooms, spa, restaurant, and ballrooms was not working during most of our stay. Even with all three working, expect to wait sometimes. Our room was number 2304 and we would highly recommended the 04 line if you can get it. The view from this room was outstanding with the Wrigley building clock tower to the left, a straight on view out to the lake with no buildings in the way, and a great view of the Chicago River, as it bends right in front of you. All can be seen through floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows. The room was just over 900 square feet, including a long hallway. It is set up as a studio with a full kitchen that is really part of the bedroom. The overall look of the room is elegant and modern with muted colors. The large marble bathroom is very nice with separate shower and tub but no separate water closet. The TV in the bathroom mirror is very cool. There is a very nice large pool with a wall of windows overlooking the city and water. The gym also has great views and is a true gym so that a complete workout can be achieved. The locker room was very nice with steam and sauna but we felt it looked more like the locker room at a nice gym than at a five star hotel. We did not eat at the hotel, but there is a very cool looking restaurant and a nice outdoor bar area with a great view of the water and the city skyline. The location of the hotel is perfect. The loop area is just over the river, and the magnificent mile starts one block away. You are basically right in the middle of the main part of the city with almost every tourist site within walking distance. Overall this hotel is a good choice in a city with many great hotels.

The hotel is squeezed on floors 14-25 between a bunch of empty floors (office spaces?) and a bunch of empty condo units above. Because of the downturn in the economy the property offers very very competitive rates for being a 5 Star hotel. The rooms are oversized and you'll want to request one on the river side. Understated and stunning interior design. Almost all the lighting is on dimmers and most can be controlled from a panel bedside. Complimentary WiFi in the rooms. The fabrics and choice of woods are really top notch. One thing that surprised me was the bathroom amenities. While oversized, they are rather generic in cheaper plastic bottles and private labeled with Trump. I left them. Normally if they were anything good, such as Bulgari, L'Occitane from the Peninsula or Ritz Carlton, they would have all gone home with me. Not here. They weren't bad amenities, just rather plain and generic. Here's the service gaffs, which I'll blame on the housekeeper. The bathroom scale didn't work. Why? The battery was dead. The small tv built into the bathroom mirror was inoperable. Why? The tv hadn't been scanned to set up the channels. The light on the desk didn't work. Why? The lamp was defective and they had to change it out. Who knows maybe I was the first guest ever in the room, but had the chambe maid done a simple check these things could have been worked out before a guest arrival. Oh well. It's a stunning hotel. The gym and spa occupies an entire floor. I have been in some of the nicest hotels in the world and the gym here is one of the nicest I have encountered. I did not use the spa. Extraordinary rates and I wasn't going to pop for the cost without seeing some reviews of their services. The food service was good, not great, certainly at the top of the Chicago market. I would encourage people to eat elsewhere. Chicago is known for its famous restaurants such as NOMI, Alinea, Charlie Trotter's etc. There's no reason to pay Michelin style prices for common food. Get out in the city and enjoy the food. The bedding and pillows are amazing. One of the nicest beds ever, they really do it right and if you're looking for a great nights sleep this is it. The room also had a semi stocks kitchen almost like a little time share with a two burner cooktop, sub zero refridgerator, crystal barware, etc. The had a large well stocked mini bar complete with Trump chocolate bars. You'll also find Ivanka's jewelry line hawked in a magazine and postcards in the desk. It's an interesting experience.

Note: these wouldn't be such a big deal if not for Trump's endless windbaggery about how he does things \"The Best\", \"The Greatest\", \"The Be All and End All\". When you make those kinds of boasts, Mr. Trump, that's what I expect of your organization. I am a low-key guest who doesn't demand much. When a hotel can't even deliver on the basics? They're FIRED. First the good things: - Rooms are enormous w/fantastic views - I only paid $199 for the room ($399 seems a bit of a stretch for the location, but the property is new, clean, pristine & a value at $199) Now for the less-than-good things. For $199, they're fine. For being a purported 5-star property? They are a joke. - No one told us that you needed to use your room key in order to operate the elevator, so we stood around looking like village idiots for several minutes, punching the buttons & wondering what the malfunction was until another guest explained them to us. - No internet in the room! I called the concierge about this & was told this was an issue they have w/AT&T, specifically. Aren't they the largest wireless network in the U.S?. So surfing for local attractions on my iphone wasn't possible w/o heading for the business center three floors down (no thanks). - The pretentious \"Water Menu\" in the room. I can't figure out if Trump & Co. were serious about this, or if it was put there for comic relief. Truly, it was one of the most pretentious and faux-classy (or \"klassy\") things I've ever seen. Evian or Fiji is just fine, Mr. Trump. We don't need to guzzle, \"a truly brilliant water whose time has come.\" (Seriously, that's an actual quote. We were dying!) - Large TV in room was perfect for late night tv watching, although the In-House programming menu didn't match what was actually playing. It might say that a certain movie was playing on HBO at 10:00 PM, but when you turned to that channel, it was something completely different. After channel surfing a bit, we decided to give it up turn in early. - As we were drifting off to sleep at around 11:30 PM, the phone rang. In a pitch black hotel room with 3 phones, you can imagine how disconcerting - and LOUD - that would be. I groped around for the phone (which was on the other side of the bed), trying not to wake my 13 year old niece, but then the ringing stopped. Ok - whew. That must have been a fluke, right? I went back to bed, heart still racing a bit from the shock. 10 minutes later, right as I was beginning to relax, it rang again! This time i was concerned. I don't even get late-night phone calls at home, much less when I'm at a hotel for the night. Something must be wrong. So, I turned on the light, woke up my niece, answered the phone & heard, \"Yeah - I'd like to order a small pizza.\" Shocked & dazed, I told the caller he had the wrong #. \"Is this [--]?\" he asked Why, yes - it was. Apparently he had dialed the main switchboard # and been put through to OUR ROOM at 11:45 PM. Lovely. Furious, I called the switchboard & asked them to hold all calls for our room until 7:00 AM the following morning. - When I mentioned this at checkout, I could tell by the look on the woman's face that she was mortified. She admitted that it was essentially the hotel's fault, as there were a lot of people @ the hotel w/my last name & the call probably got passed through to us accidentally. This upset me. What kind of ineptitude managed that feat 2x in a row? We had only one expense while we were @ the hotel: A $31 breakfast (for coffee & a bagel w/lox). I would have thought that she would have comped us for our trouble. Nope! Instead she apologized and then smiled and asked, \"But you got enough sleep, right?\" Uh, that's not the point. The inmates @ San Quentin probably get enough sleep every night, too. I could have slept more peacefully at home. And, next time I will, or else I'll spend the extra $150 and head for the Peninsula or IV Seasons, where I know their promises of \"World Class\" service are more than just hot air & $25 bottles of drinking water.

We both came away from our stay with mixed emotions. On the plus side, the hotel has a great location as it's situated on the river and only a short walk to the Mag Mile, Millennium Park, etc. Our room was aesthetically appealing and quite comfortable, particularly the bathroom, which had a large shower and bath area. In addition, we were very satisfied with our spa service (Soul to Soul), though it was a tad bit expensive. While the hotel has a lot going for it, there were too many minor irritations that left us with a negative impression. I'll start with the $50/night valet parking that others have mentioned in their reviews. This seems outrageous to me. Classic two part pricing where you get focused on the cost of the room and you end up paying a lot more because of other services. It's probably worth the inconvenience to park across the street! On the topic of getting nicked for other services, we were erroneously charged for mini bar items that we never consumed (they did remove this fee at check out). Also, while this is probably unique to our stay and not likely replicated by you, a maintenance person barged into our room soon after we had arrived looking for a video game, or some such nonsense, that he thought someone had left behind (turns out he was wrong). He rang the bell once and was in the room rummaging around. Good thing we had just arrived and were checking out the room, otherwise it could have been really awkward! Doesn't anybody knock anymore. As I mentioned at the onset, we were staying at the hotel celebrating a birthday. The staff sent a bottle of champaign, which was a very nice touch, but the card wished us well on our wedding anniversary. While the message was a bit off, we drank the bottle of champaign anyway, thank you very much. Finally, our neighbors decided to crank up their stereo at 3:00am on the last night of our stay. Maybe those Bose systems with the Ipod adapter are not such a great idea after all. Decide for yourselves, but for my money, I'll take Four Seasons any day of the week.

My wife and I were on our honeymoon and this was a fantastic final hotel in our 4-week US road trip honeymoon. They upgraded us two levels and we had a gigantic (I think 800+ sq ft) room with a Lake view. It had a kitchenette (the only thing missing was a oven) which was perfect since I have food allergies and prefer to eat food I cook since I can be positive what it did and did not contain or come in contact with. Finally, the bathroom was amazing. A giant soaking tub that fit two, a great shower and a bathroom mirror that had a TV in it. The trump is right next to the South end of the Magnificent Mile of shops on Michigan Avenue. My wife and I walked that one afternoon on the way to a Cubs game at Wrigley. And with that said, the concierge was able to get us great seats at a reasonable price to a sold out Sunday afternoon game. I was not sure we would get the tickets, but not only did he find some, they were in the fifth row down the third base line. Perfect! The only downside to the hotel was the ridiculous charges for room service and valet parking. A six-pack of Sam Adams beer was $30 not including the room service delivery charge of $4. Seriously, it is a $8 six-pack of beer, and $4 to deliver to the room, WTF? And the valet parking was ~$50/night. That is not a typo $50/night! Yet at the same time, it was our honeymoon, so the cost didn't really matter, even if they were annoying. The Trump is over the top and exactly what one would expect for the $400+/night the rooms cost. Yet even though expensive, I think it was worth it since the rooms were more than twice the size of rooms we were in prior hotels on our trip.

The view from the gym is worth going there alone but when I did pretend to work out my treadmill had its own fan and iPod docking station. Simple idea but something that is not in very many gyms. Of course it was spotless and appeared to have equipment for a serious workout or a guy like me just going through the motions. When we ate breakfast at 16 (the restaurant within the hotel) we received personlized attention and exceptional service from our server (he showed us where the best views were in the foyer so that we could take better pictures of the Chicago skyline for our family to see).

Having the kitchenette in the room is good too (but read the negative) - housekeeping washed up the cup/saucer/bowl/measuring-cup I left out. They also supply an electric kettle as well as the nespresso machine. Negative points: housekeeping is a bit random, on the one evening I was in the room they came round to do the turndown service at about 9pm. It would be better if they could ask for a preferred time and schedule to those times. Also I bought some milk+cereal to have a simple breakfast in the room. Housekeeping disposed of the milk on my second to last night. Maybe I left it out, but it would have been nice to have a note at the very least about why they removed it. The fridge is also full of the usual overpriced minibar junk. I'd recommend making a specific point of confirming with housekeeping they aren't going to throw anything away.

We had a Deluxe King City View room on the 26th floor. We booked through the hotel and got a special rate of $199 a night. The regular rate is $399 a night. PROS: The hotel is in a great location. My family was able to walk to all of the local attractions. Plenty of restaurants close by. Hotel staff were very courteous when we arrived. The room was nice. We had a great view of the sunset. Plenty of room for four people. Stocked mini-bar but it was expensive. There was a 7/11 about a block away so we bought our snacks there. Also a Dunkin Donuts right across the street. Bathroom was excellent. Kids loved the TV in the mirror. The bathrobes were super soft. They even had robes for the kids. Beds were comfortable. About an hour after we checked in they brought up cookies and milk for the kids. Kids loved the pool but said the water was cold. CONS: When we made our reservations we requested for our room to be ready at 2:00 pm. When we arrived they said the room was cleaned but a supervisor needed to check it first. We ended up having to wait in the lobby for an hour until they finally checked us in. When we made our reservations they asked for our kids ages and names so they could have a \"goodie pack\" ready for them. When we checked in they didn't give us anything. After dinner we called the front desk and asked about the kids pack. They sent up a small mesh backpack with crayons and a coloring book. On their website they promise a lot more than that. Maybe because it was Memorial Day weekend they didn't have the time. The only complaints I had with the room was the sliding bathroom door. I would have preferred a bathroom door that gives you a little more privacy. The sliding glass door, with no lock, doesn't work for me. We never did have enough towels. The first morning we took our showers we noticed we only had two bath towels and a bigger towel that was probably a pool towel. We told the front desk when we went out that day we needed at least four bath towels. The maid came and did the room and still only left two bath towels. We had to call maintenance because the TV wouldn't turn on. The maintenance guy came right away. Turns out the maid knocked the power cord loose when she was dusting. The day we checked out the valet brought the wrong car from the parking lot. We had to wait 15 minutes for them to get the right car. They did give us some bottles of water while we waited. OVERALL: I would go back to the Trump if I got the promotion rate of 199 a night. I wouldn't pay the normal rate though. For that price I would expect everything to be flawless.

We recognized the bell captain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Emanuel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from his days at The Sofitel where he took good care of us. Our bellman, Shawn, was friendly, polite and very knowledgeable.

One may access the floorplans in advance of the stay at: www.trumpchicagohotel.com/Accommodations/interactive_floor_plans.asp The request was accommodated and Shawn showed us to our room and explained everything from the pushbutton \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign to the espresso machine (which makes really awful espresso, I must say). He took his time and made us feel like VIP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Our suite was spacious and comfortable, decorated in muted grays and the furniture is some kind of dark wood. The view was mostly north along Wabash with a small view of Lake Michigan and the Hancock as well. It was nice to have two flat-panel HD televisions in the suite with a DVD player for each. It was also nice to have two full baths! The linens were crisp and comfortable. My wife though the bed was a bit soft, but it was fine for me. Our pillow menu requests were honored accurately and promptly, even though we had requested a different room upon check-in. This turned out to be the one thing that housekeeping got right. After getting settled, we went straight to the pool, which has a commanding view east down the Chicago River to Lake Michigan. Unfortunately, there was no telephone in the pool for us to order a cocktail, so I had to walk out to the spa area to do so. It took a half-hour to deliver the drinks which, we found later, was the exception rather than the rule. The server had also bought the milk and cookies amenity for our boys and wondered if we would prefer that he deliver to our room instead. We did prefer that, and he took care of it. It was really a nice touch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c each boy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name was written on the plate in chocolate and they told us later \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was the best cookie they ever had!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We used in-room dining for one breakfast and a dinner. I was impressed that Trump stocks Spiegelau crystal in the kitchen. The full complement of plates, silver and kitchen tools were most welcome. In-room delivery time was accurate to the minute on both occasions. The graciousness and competency of the server was most welcome and the quality of the food simply marvelous. Trump clearly has its room-service down. My wife forgot to include a bottle of wine with the dinner and it was delivered within :05 minutes of our order. It was wonderful to have a refrigerator in the room, and we brought a bottle of bubbly for us, sodas and juices for the kids and had a place to stow our deep-dish pizza leftovers! Chef concierge Joseph Coston was helpful with CTA bus information and dining options and concierge Kathleen Zubroski had scored excellent Mary Poppins tickets for us in advance of our arrival. The Trump Concierge staff is the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in Chicago and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at all of the luxury hotels with the exception of the Park Hyatt. My spa treatment was, in a word, transformational. I can highly recommend therapist Jon Meltzer. The amenities in the spa are first-class and the locker/shower facilities are the finest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. It was neat to be able to choose an aromatherapy for the steam room from a tray of three options. The Kohler multi-head shower with music and lighting in the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s locker room is especially wonderful. Chilled, bottled water was in abundance as were towels and grooming materials. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the Sauna. This would have been a perfect stay had it not been for ongoing issues with Housekeeping: #1) I asked Housekeeping for a larger bathrobe and slippers as the standard robe and slippers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit me. I was told they would be delivered promptly, but they were not. I ended up having to get a larger robber from the Spa locker room and never did find slippers that fit. #2) On our first night in the room, the turn-down staff showed up at 5pm, just after we had returned from the pool. We informed the person that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want any turn-down service during our stay until 6:30pm at the earliest. At 6:00 pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c turn-down comes to the door again! We send them away again. At 6:30, when we are leaving for Mary Poppins, they arrive for service. We ask them to be sure to leave extra pillows and blankets for the boys on the sofabed. We arrive back from the show at 10:30 pm to find one pillow and one blanket on the sofabed. To their credit, within :10 minutes we had the extras we had requested. #3) On our second night, turn-down shows up AGAIN at 5pm and we tell them AGAIN no service earlier than 6:30pm. AGAIN, another knock on the door at 6pm. We ask them to come back at 6:30 when we plan to leave and make clear that the extra pillow and blanket we had saved from the previous night is to be used AGAIN. We arrive back at the hotel from dinner at 8:30pm to find one pillow and one blanket on the sofabed. AGAIN we must call for additional pillow and blanket. #4) On our third and final evening in the hotel, we were tired from a day of Lincoln Park Zoo and shopping so we went to our room at 3:45 to find the housekeeping staff just starting to service the room. OK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we decided to go to Rebar for a drink, and enjoyed another nice view of the river. They served us a small tray of nibbling items including my fave - pitted kalamata olives. The sushi menu looked good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we only wanted a drink and the view. We returned to our room at 4:30 and were disappointed to find housekeeping still there. This time, we remained in our room to ensure that an extra pillow and blanket were delivered and the sofabed was made up. And guess what \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 5pm turn-down knocked on the door AGAIN. This is a five-star hotel for crying out loud. They are supposed to note these kinds of things after being told once. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 get a chance to register any complaint with the management before we checked out because we had a schedule to keep. However, I was able to note the issues on the follow up guest survey I received via email the day after checkout. Bottom line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we would stay at the Trump again as 95% of the stay was really great.

We stay at hotels a lot. And every time I've stayed at a luxury hotel in the past, I've been disappointed. The Trump changed all that. At $199 a night on a special Travelzoo deal, I decided to give the Trump a try and indulge a little for a Mother's Day stay with my kids. I was impressed from the moment we arrived. We valet parked and our bags were brought inside for a smooth check in - every staff member addressed us by name. Kids were given backpacks with cotton candy and coloring books. Bellman brought us to our room; as we got off the elevator, I could tell we were headed to the river side of the property. I was so surprised & pleased to see we had been upgraded to a larger, partial river view room. The room was kind of wedge shaped so the panoramic views from the floor to ceiling windows were amazing. Furnishings were in a muted purple with taupes and grays and looked just like the pictures on the website. I had ordered some amenities (gourmet popcorn, candy jar and chocolate covered strawberries) ahead of time to surprise my kids, and all were in the room just like I had requested. A few minutes after we arrived at our room, the bellman returned with little stuffed animals (pink and blue cows with a Trump Kids logo) for each of the kids - told me they had inadvertantly been left out of their backpacks at check in ( I was later told that the kids names and ages hadn't been updated into my profile- we only booked one day prior.) I asked about robes and slippers for the kids, and housekeeping brought them a few minutes later. We opted to relax and order a room service lunch - kids had a burger & fries and grilled cheese with tomato soup. I got prosciutto di parma with buffalo mozzarella on grilled baguette. Food was amazing and presented with real silverware and a fresh orchid. The server asked if we would be dining at Sixteen later; I told him I thought the experience would likely be lost on the kids, but he mentioned that anything on the kids room service menu could be ordered at the restaurant - I'll keep this in mind for next time. As it stood, we kept out reservations at Harry Caray's - an easy 2 block walk from the hotel. After lunch, we checked out the pool. You have to sign in at the spa on the 14th floor to use the pool, but the staff was very helpful and personally escorted us to the locker rooms. Kids enjoyed a nice swim while I relaxed and enjoyed the views of the Chicago River & Lake Michigan. Headed back to our room to get ready for dinner and found housekeeping was already there to turn down the bed. They don't leave wrapped chocolates on the pillow, rather a lovely glass tray of assorted chocolates and a gumdrop my kids fought over. Before swimming, we had asked for a game console, and we found a Playstation 3 and a few games had been delivered while we were out. Kids had a little trouble with the controllers, but maintenance came up quickly and brought the connection cable we were missing. Kids enjoyed a Wall-e game while I got ready. When we came back from dinner, we found the sofa bed had been made up just like we requested at check-in. What we did not find were cookies for this kids, which I thought were part of the Trump Kids amenities. A quick phone call to the front desk, and a few minutes later, in room dining brought up 2 large chocolate chunk cookies with glasses of milk. Kids couldn't even finish them. After the kids fell asleep, I took a bath - the bathroom is lovely, with a TV in the mirror as well as an adjoining tub and shower. Tub was deep and long with a waterfall faucet and I was able to indulge and enjoy a long bath - I am 5' 10\" and the tub was quite comfortable - this is rare for me. The shower has a rainfall head as well as a separate handheld shower massage. Robes for adults were in the bathroom and a digital scale and hair dryer were available as well. Bath amenities were very ample size - much larger than most hotels. Bed was so comfy - I loved the pillows but there was a pillow menu if you wanted something different. Kids couldn't wait to wake me up and open the curtains - all controlled with convenient wall switches. The view was even more impressive than the day before. We ordered room service for breakfast - my breakfast would have served all 3 of us if my kids weren't so picky. I ordered a \"Heart Healthy\" combination for $27 which included choice of juices (from orange to cherry pomegranate,) a blueberry muffin with assorted jams & honey, a large fruit plate with 4 kinds of berries, cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple and oranges, a huge bowl of Swiss Mueslix with pecan halves, slivered almonds, chopped apple and dried apricot, and coffee, tea or skim milk. I didn't eat half of it - just so much food. Kids pancakes and french toast were $9 each but served with more fresh berries. We had time for another swim before checking out and wished we had booked more than one night. It was such an enjoyable stay. Had a few glitches at check out - our breakfast charges weren't on the bill and the website had promised business cards for the kids with their names printed on them. We had lunch and shopping planned so we agreed to store our bags and come back later to get the kids' cards and my corrected bill. Was so pleased to find out the valet would keep our car until 5PM, included in the $52 daily rate from when we checked in - we took full advantage. I was handed an envelope when we got back - they recognized us. I just assumed the envelope had the cards for the kids and my bill, but once home found only the cards. I'm sure they sorted the bill out and if I don't get a copy in the mail, I'll give them a call and ask. Our stay was not seamless; but whenever things didn't go quite right, staff went above and beyond to rectify matters, and were always apologetic and cordial. What I loved most about the Trump was the lack of pretentiousness. As far as I could see, all the guests were treated well and addressed by name. Even bell staff in the elevator greeted us and asked us how we were enjoying our stay. I felt like we were being welcomed back rather than staying there for the first time. It was really a delightful experience. This is what a luxury hotel should be - friendly, professional staff, gorgeous rooms, great food and perfect location.

We live in the suburbs of Chicago but enjoy overnighting in the city about 3 times a year. My children and cousin accompanied us just to check out the rooms but they were not staying overnight. Arrival: serivce was excellent. We valet parked the car, our bags were taken by the bellman, and our names were obviously placed into the computer system because less than a minute later, when we were checking in, the front desk staff called me by name. We were provided four lavender scented hot towels, and though my children would not be staying, *(and I told the front desk this,) the staff, nevertheless, gave my two children each a backpack containing cotton candy, a stuffed animal and crayons/coloring book. So very nice! Room: Our bellman took us to our room on the 17th floor. Each room has a doorbell and a light as its \"do not disturb\" system. We stayed in a standard King and got an unbelievable $199 deal. Our room was the largest standard room I'd ever been in (and we've stayed at luxury five star Ritz, Four seasons, etc..); this room was about 600 sq. feet. Regular rate for this room is $475. The room was done in muted mauve and earth tones. It was lovely and modern/tasteful. It had a velvet sofa, table, chair desk; not in any way cramped. Closet space was ample with a comp. umbrella. extra shopping bags as necessary. The bathroom located next to the front door contained a wet area for shower/soaker tub and a tv was built into the mirror. Back in the hall: along one very long wall was a high end galley kitchen with 2 burner meile cooktop, microwave, diswasher, fully stocked, euro cabinets with granite, a large minibar and a espresso maker which makes espresso by inserting small packets of coffee (I can't recall the name for this type of system). Used it in the am. Great coffee and easy to use! Room had two bathrobes, two sets of slippers, all toiletries necesssary (just like Ritz, etc.). This was the most beautiful and comfortable bed I've slept in. I wanted to take it home. High end frette sheets, pillow menu (including herb scented, if you wanted). Bose music system with ipod dock and free wireless internet. Turndown service was lovely and our floor was absolutely silent overnight even though there were a lot of kids staying at the hotel this weekend. Things one doesn't often think about are easily available here: 24 hour room service with extensive menus (even overnight) and extensive ability to serve dinner in the room or hold a catered cocktail party. (all for a high price, of course) as well as all of the concierge service, personal shopper service, etc.. you would expect of a 5 star hotel. We did not eat here, but the bar and hotel resturant, 16, get good reviews elsewhere. Spa The healthclub and spa are connected. Tea/coffee/comp juice, water, etc.. all toiletries, towels, etc.. are available in the locker room. Steam room and sauna are located in both men's locker room and women's locker room. The only SLIGHTLY disappointing aspect of this hotel is the small size of the pool. It was not particularly large and max depth is 4'6\" w/ no outdoor space. All indoors, nicely appointed comfy furniture, and nice floor to ceiling windows. Overall: Ive never stayed anywhere nicer. I don't think I ever opened any door myself other than the door to my room! The level of service was astounding down to the valet leaving bottled water in our car for our trip home. Cant wait to find an excuse to stay here again. The level of service was amazing and the staff EXCEPTIONALLY professional and pleasant whether you appeared to be wealthy or middle class.

I requested a quiet room and chocolate covered strawberries for my mother's day getaway. The front desk was more than polite. The front desk person personally escorted me to my room. She showed my the amenties and if I had any other questions to let them know. Shortly thereafter the bellman showed up with my luggage. The room was very big for hotel standards. over 600 sq ft. The bathroom had a deep soaking tub- heaven! Large shower head with a handheld shower as well. TV was in the mirror. Fluffy very comfortable thick spa like robes. 2 items lacking: -Lack of towel bars to hang towels - speaker system for music in the bathroom- they have this at other hotels. would have been nice to play music and enjoy a bath. Kitchenette- had all the essentials- dishwasher, sink, stovetop, dishes, silverware.mini fridge, microwave items lacking: soap, dishwashing soap and towels and washcloths.- There is an awesome espresso machine. Easy to use, very good espresso. Bedding: most comfortable bed I have slept on ....you certainly get more than enough pillows. I had 8 in all! Bose clock radio and ipod docking station- wonderful 40 inch LCD tv with DVD below in cabinet. -excellent. Figuring out the DVD was tricky since you had to go thru the main menu- if you have problems ask the front desk. Wireless- free and fast! Drapes: push of a button and they automatically close. Lightning: all lightning in the suite is on dimmers... wonderful! Overall the service is wonderful. Room was amazing. Hotel lives up to it's expectations. I even had chocolate strawberries at no charge. Parking is expensive- but that is to be expected. You are in downtown Chicago- every hotel and even the public parking garages are pricey. Don't expect cheap parking in the city. You are better off taking cabs, buses or the L. The hotel is more than accomodating to your needs and wants. Hotel restaurant although very snobby and chic- service and attention is wonderful. Breakfast very overpriced, but that comes with the territory. High end hotel, high end prices.

The bedroom part of the suite was huge and included an enormous dressing area just outside of the master bathroom. This hotel clearly anticipates guests needs and delivers - in most high end hotels, you have to request what you need for a bath (salts, oils, sponge, etc.) - Trump includes all of this with the room. In the kitchen, we had a very nice selection of high end teas and an espresso machine. The Sub-Zero refrigerator was stocked with all sorts of alcoholic and soft drinks. In fact, the suite was so nice that we canceled our dinner reservations at a nearby restaurant, visited a local grocery store and made dinner in the suite! The staff at Trump delivered a bottle of chilled champagne and a tray of chocolate-covered strawberries to our suite as we were arriving - we enjoyed these treats as we prepared dinner. I should mention that our suite had very high ceilings - the drapes were so long that they opened/closed electronically, by pressing buttons on the wall. The huge expanse of ceiling to floor windows overlooked the Chicago river and nearby buildings - very urban - we felt like we were downtown Chicago residents. All of the lights in the suite were on dimmers so that we could create some very romantic conditions throughout the suite in the evening. I could go on and on - but, I'll wrap up by saying that Sunday brunch at Sixteen was awesome - especially the dessert selections. And, the pool area/fitness center was in line with a 5-star resort - very impressive. Finally, I loved the staff - everyone who we encountered went over the top to make sure that we had everything that we needed and wanted right when we requested it - from simple things like a DVD to watch on Saturday night to stocking my favorite green tea in the suite - no request went unanswered - and every request was handled professionally and timely.

I have stayed at Trump three times now. The first two times were phenomenal! My family and I have always stayed in the \u00e2\u20ac\u015346 type\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room between the 19-23 floors. We love the view of the Wrigley Building and the magnificent Chicago lake front and river. The rooms were always flawless, the service was great and there was not much more that we could ask for. Upon arrival our favorite doorman, MK, greeted us by name, said he was so glad that we were back and helped us to check in as usual. It was a great start to what should have been a fabulous stay. Then things started going downhill, first of all, we had to wait a good 5 minutes before anyone came to the front desk. Where was all the staff? One of the male concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s came over and started chatting with us; he was charismatic and let us know that if there was anything he could do for us, to please let him know. Well, there is something he could have done, he could have either checked us in or got someone to check us in. Instead of doing either of those things he went back to his desk and started chatting with one of his coworkers. When someone finally did check us in they were very nice. She acknowledged that we were return guests and said she was glad that we had come back to stay at Trump. Then she gave us our keys. I need to stop here for a second. The last two times I have stayed at this hotel not only was I not handed my keys, I had someone take my family up to the room, show us where things were and of course open the door for us. As I took the key, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think too much of it, but after everything that happened during our stay I can now see how our stay was destined for disaster from the get go. When we got to our room, everything was beautiful as usual, our youngest daughter called down to attach\u00c3\u00a9 to see if she could get an XBOX, and they obliged, two hours later it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in our room and when we called down to inquire we found out that they had left for the night. In previous stays we had always called the attach\u00c3\u00a9 desk as late as 11:00pm with someone there to grant our wishes and now at 9:00pm no one was there? It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a holiday. Before heading out for some shopping my husband and I decided we wanted to stop by the concierge desk to see our favorite concierge Alexzandra. To our dismay we found out that she was recently transferred to another property. When we did ask the concierge questions the girl either didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the answer or was robotic. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask that much of a concierge, but when I want to go to a fine dining option that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as mainstream as Charlie Trotters I expect the concierge to deliver, and she did not. As a family we heavily rely on a concierge. We like to be able to throw out an idea and have the concierge make it happen, and on this trip things just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the same. We decided to go to restaurants we had already been to since the two concierges we spoke to could not come up with anything that we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already been to. My oldest daughter is a fashion forward 16 year old who loves exploring Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indie neighborhoods. Normally the concierge would come up with a detailed plan of attack for her stay, but no one seemed interested in providing a level of service that actually required some thought. Needless to say we were disappointed and she was bored. I think the most disappointing service issue we had was that there was an overall lack of attention given to my family. The only person who called my family by name was MK, all of the other staff members didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even make an effort to address us by name. No one was particularly rude, but at the five star level I want extraordinary and that is what I used to get at the Trump, and it is a shame that that is no longer the case. During our first two trips to the Trump, service seemed to be of the utmost importance to this hotel, they had staff everywhere. They had great staff. Now, it seems like they are cutting back on their most valuable asset and forgetting why their customers stay there. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay at a hotel to be left alone; I stay at a hotel to be pampered! I want somebody to open the door for me, I want the concierge to know my name and I want to be escorted to my room. When I am paying thousands of dollars a night, I expect the best, and Trump did not deliver. Mr. Trump, you have a lot invested in this property, I advise you to go and stay there. I think you should see what your hard earned money has bought you. This hotel is slipping, I have quite honestly received better service at Holiday Inn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then I did on my last stay at your hotel. We used to LOVE your hotel, my daughters begged me to bring them back here, but after the service (lack of) we received on our most recent visit we will be going back to the Peninsula, as they have continually met our needs without a bat of the eye. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a refund for my stay, I want my time back and that is far more valuable than any monetary sum this hotel could refund me.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "woodland hills, ca", "Title": "\u201cA disappointing experience\u201d", "Author": "pamshusband", "ReviewID": "UR23086524", "Content": "Ours was a disappointing experience.

No one showed us to our rooms--\"\"heres the keys and use them to go up in the elevator\". Thats all. No one accompanied us as other writers have noted. The next morning problems began. There was inadequate water pressure and the water temperature was tepid. My sons, in their rooms, experienced the same. I, of course complained and was assured that it would be rectified.

The next day I discovered that the water pressure and the temperature was not fixed and I had to use the gym to have a hot shower. Now I was really upset. The hotel then sent 2 engineers who spent 2 hours sharing our room trying to fix it. Their 1st effort failed but eventually they got it right. The doormen were hit and miss--some times they opened the doors and other times. they didn't. The concierge desk usually, but not always, was manned. Although we were there for 3 nights, I only saw a \"clefs d'or\" once and then only for a brief period. The bar has a drink menu and prices. Yet, they charged more. When questioned, we were told the menu was wrong. When told they can't so that, the waitress threw down the bill. They also closed the bar early. Not once did I ever see a manager. Not once did anyone with any level of authority ask about our stay. I was told that the managers are on the 2d floor and therefore didn't interact with the guests.

Good color pallate, too - very relaxing. The \"fireplace\" in the room was purely for show, though (no heat - just the appearance of a fireplace with red lights to simulate the fire). The king bed was very comfortable and the \"pillow menu\" allows you to specify the number and type of pillows you'd like to have for the room (my wife and daughters each had their own body pillow in addition to the standard pillow and I had one of the contour pillows that supports your head better than a standard pillow). My only issue is that the sofabed is somewhere between a full and queen in size - not quite big enough for my two daughters (9 and 7), so we ended up sharing the king bed, too. Nice in-room amenities including fridge, microwave, cooktop, sink, and dishware to cook/reheat your food (if you bring in or have them cook in the room for you - too pricey for us). The Nepresso (sp?) espresso maker was also much appreciated.

We reviewed several hotels, some we had frequented in the past, others were new - but we decided to visit the Trump Chicago, and it was well worth every penny spent. The Trump provides a true five-star experience. The check-in process is easy, and the folks behind the desk are very courteous. They actually show you to your room and demonstrate how to use all of the features in the room. Our room was on the spa floor and had great views of the city and Chicago river. The room was larger than other hotel rooms in the downtown area and exuded a sense of calm. All materials used in construction were top-notch, and the earth tone paint was a calming counter to the bustling cityscape below. Everything on the Magnificent Mile and State Street (Streeterville) was a short walk from the Trump. The bar at Trump (ReBar) was very cosmopolitan, and featured a selection of high-end sake. The spa was an example of absolutely superb service in and of itself. The host at the spa was absolutely amazing - he was truly involved, and Trump could not have found a better person for the job. The ambiance was incredibly calming, from the superb teas to a knockout massage - it was all there. Most importantly, the spa felt exclusive. There were no crowds of people waiting for services in robes, etc. However, not everything was \"perfect\" in paradise. If you buy a package which provides extra spa services or incentives, bring your confirmation and know what you are getting. The spa computer systems are not linked to your package, so you need to ask for the package credit upon departure. Parking was not part of the hotel stay - plan on around $20.00/day for public parking at the hotel, more for valet service. One last concern is that the adult TV movies and titles are visible by default - we were not concerned, but a family with kids may very well be.

Shortly after explaining that I was expecting and needed to get situated so that we could go to dinner, our room was ready. The room was absolutely gorgeous--we had a panoramic view from ceiling to floor of Navy Pier (which later benefitted us as we watched the weekend fireworks show from our chase lounge at 10pm).

The living room and bedroom both have large flat screen TVs. Each area in the room can be individually temperature controlled.

God I love that city! We stayed at the new Trump International Towers perfectly located at the south end of N Michigan Avenue at the river. The hotel has only been open for a few months and it has a few minor wrinkles to iron out, but all in all it was a lovely experience. Our hotel of choice is usually The Peninsula, and while The Trump is not equal to our venerable favorite, it did come close in many ways. We had a very large room with a large sitting area and a kitchenette with a fabulous view of the river and Lake Michigan from the 23rd floor. The suite was decorated in muted shades of grey with dark furniture and mohair upholstered pieces. The bathroom was very big with a lovely deep porcelain soaker tub and a separate glassed shower. Despite the generous size of the bathroom, it was curious that the vanity only had one sink, rather than two. Also of note was that in a hotel of this caliber, the kleenex and toilet paper were cheap, one ply products. Also, surprisingly, there wasn't a full length mirror in the suite! Amenities were excellent and top quality, as were the linens, furnishings and electronics. High speed wireless Internet access was fast and free. They had serious elevator problems which they were trying to deal with throughout our visit. Service was ahem, uneven. On Saturday at 3:00 p.m. housekeeping had not visited our room, despite our early 8:30 a.m. departure. The service in Rebar (great name for a bar and a bar with a great river view) was horrible and required frequent gesticulations to enquire about our appetizers (they'd been forgotten), or a second drink, or the requested glass of ice. The service at breakfast was equally abysmal. We were only one of three occupied tables but the blase waitress made mistakes on all of our orders, forgetting items, or getting details incorrect. No coffee or water refills were offered either. The concierges also varied in skill. One woman didn't have a clue about anything we asked her (and she even gave us incorrect directions - turn left which should have been right), but thankfully a young man came to her rescue and saved the day with a fantastic lunch recommendation. The door and front desk staff and all the staff we encountered in the hallways as well as housekeeping, (other than on Saturday) were terrific. Would we return? Yes, we would.

The hotel interiors are high quality, using modern material and contemprary furniture and fittings. The colour schemes were generally in the taupe/cream/beige/brown (crisp white bed linen) neutral range with zebra wood and steel used as accents throughout. Limestone bathrooms had perfect grouting and mastic lines - this project was really well managed to get that level of detailed finish. The overall impression was high quality reserved modern rather than bling. The sound proofing between the living room and the bedroom was excellent. The suite has two bathrooms - which speeds up the morning rituals, especially when travelling with girls! Our whole experience of the hotel was excellent. Other reviews have noted the high end kitchen fitting, bathroom fittings and audio visual equipment - so no more has to be said on that front. The airconditioning was very quiet, coming from a county that does not use A/C generally - it is helpful to have a very quiet system when one is trying to sleep. Any time we went to the pool - we had it to ourselves and maybe one other person. The pool has no real deep end which would suit small children who do not like diving. The view from the pool area is down the river to the lake and also towards the Loop. I did feel that the exposed surface finish on the pool area ceiling was very like fire-safeing used on steel work, and could have been upgraded to a more decorative finish. The changing room was high quality with all the accessories one would need. Signage between the pool/exercise area and the changing rooms might need to be upgraded because when I was waiting for my small daughter to finish her shower, out came an unclad man from the sauna - who tried to convince me that we were in the mens room - luckly I noticed the womens products on the counter top previously so I knew we were in the right room! I drew his attention to that fact and he left and she was none the wiser. Check-in & out were really quick. The staff were always so helpful and friendly. Housekeeping was a bit slow on a couple of occassions in that the room has not been made up by mid afternoon, even though we would have been out of the room since early in the morning. The construction work didn't really affect our stay. We did notice the noise of the lift when we went back to our room mid afternoon. There was no noise after 5pm. There is scaffolding at ground level but there still are clear walkways to the varoius streets.

I am originally from Chicago, and we wanted to visit our family who live further north, on Lake Shore Drive. We got a river view suite, and I think it was about $500.00 a night. I have to say the hotel is STUNNING!!!!!! Our initial room was great, but noisy (there is still ongoing construction). The front desk at the Trump obliged in giving us a new room, and it was breathtaking. Everything is very modern and new (and in keeping with the sleek modernity that you would see at hotels like the Mercer in NYC--sleek, but not overwhelming or intimidating). The room had the BEST Chicago view--Navy Pier and the Chicago River and it was mostly unobstructed and endless. And a real bonus was that the windows open just a bit--we are sticklers for fresh air. That allowed just enough air in without there being a hazard for those of you with small children. The room (one bedroom apartment?) was clean, and roomy and had everything you could want (we had a suite that had two full baths with absolute top of the line fixtures--amenities like a television in the mirror (I want that for home!), marble showers AND separate baths. There was a full kitchen with top of the line appliances (Miele dishwasher, for example, and also free Nespresso), which would be a real bonus for families for children. Speaking of children, when we notified the hotel that we would have a baby visiting us for the day, they immediately put not only a great crib in our room, but a high chair, a diaper genie and soap and lotion, etc. for the baby. We really appreciated that gesture. The swimming pool is also great for kids, and they are very friendly there and will provide swimming noodles and amenities for those with small children. Adjacent to the swimming pool (btw with a breathtaking view), the Spa/Fitness room is absolutely top of the line--brand new and plentiful equipment, Pilates classes, and fresh water (fruit infused and bottled. The last day we were there they replaced the bottled water with Trump Ice water, which had a picture of Donald Trump on it. We thought it very funny!). It is so neat to exercise in a great location (high up overlooking all of Chicago). The restaurant, however, is a work in progress. The staff was not yet fully trained, the water tasted like chlorine (and they kept trying to fill my glass with it, even though we had bottled water), and the menu was HORRIBLY expensive ($50.00 for an entree), but not inspired. We actually had a hard time trying to figure out what to order, because nothing sounded interesting enough to pay for. Before we were finished, it was clear they wanted us to leave, and started to fold linens in our vicinity, which seems strange when you are paying $400.00 for dinner. But the view is great. However, the fact that I liked the hotel as much as I did makes me sad to continue this review and end up only giving this hotel 3 stars. The first incident that blew our minds was what will be known in our family as the \"racist doorman incident\". On the early afternoon of Friday, June 20th, it began to rain, just as my family stopped by to pick us up for lunch. Earlier in the day, I had gone out and it had rained, and I asked for an umbrella at the first counter where the doorpersons are stationed. They happily obliged (one person was a nice older African American woman with braids). I returned the umbrella as we came in, and thought nothing of it. At about 1p.m., however, when I asked for two umbrellas (we were now a motley group of 4 toddlers, and 6 adults without an umbrella amongst us), the same woman manning the door attempted to go behind the desk and retrieve them, but the man behind the counter, looked at us, stopped her, and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are all out of umbrellas. If you need an umbrella, you will have to go up to your room to get one.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fair enough. We understood that if it was raining, umbrellas may be in limited supply. My husband went upstairs to get an umbrella. But in the meantime, the same man behind the counter took out all these new umbrellas and started unwrapping them! They were there all along! What was more HUMILIATING was that he came from behind the counter, and gave an umbrella each to two white women who hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even left the lobby, and HADN'T EVEN ASKED FOR THEM YET! I was shocked, but I was actually more humiliated. Both my 4 year old daughter and my 65 year old mother asked me why the man said there were no more umbrellas, when clearly there were. How could I tell my daughter there were no more umbrellas for people like us?! Did he not like us because we were the wrong color, or because he didn't think we were worthy of the hotel? I have my suspicions, but don't you think that was awful??!? At least the African American co-worker, who was clearly embarrassed, then proceeded to go behind the counter and give us all umbrellas. But he really ruined my day and I felt really low. I thought about why he would do such a thing in front of my family all day. That same day, at 8:30 I went down to ReBar, their signature bar (that they tout as serving exotic cocktails) for a quick cocktail with my sister. I felt we were both dressed well (she was in a summer dress and I was in a pucci dress). When we sat down, a waitress came to us and said, \"I'm sorry, but this table is bottle service only after 9:00pm). My sister responded that it was only 8:30. The waitress served us, but you could tell she wasn't happy about it. I can tell you that we looked like everyone else in the bar (the bar, btw, skews middle-aged and distinctly suburban; I definitely was one of the younger people there). My sister, who already had the \"umbrella\" incident, started talking about how she felt uncomfortable being there, and so as soon as the drink came, we took it upstairs. But the kicker is that my husband and myself came back an hour and half later, and guess what? The couple now sitting in the same seats we had earlier occupied was just drinking simple cocktails!!!! Where was the bottle service?!?!? Beats me. Initially, I was willing to believe that these two incidents were an aberration and that there is no pattern. No one wants to accuse a hotel of something like casual racism in this day and age. But after speaking with the manager, I am not so sure. They say all behaviors emanate from the top, and if this is the case, I have to say the manager could do a better job at dispelling my suspicions. When I wrote the manager about this, both he (T. Colm O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Callaghan) and his assistant manager (Jerome) tried repeatedly to contact me. I assumed that they were contacting me to apologize, but what actually ended up happening is that Mr. O'Callaghan at first apologized, and then tried to intimate that I had misread the situation. He kept trying to tell me that what happened didn't happen!!!! He said they simply ran out of umbrellas! HELLO??!! I was there!!! They NEVER ran out of umbrellas, the guy just didn't want to give us the umbrellas he had! He kept trying to spin it as a misunderstanding, but this guy just didn't want to waste his dwindling resources (umbrellas) on the likes of us. As for the bar incident, he said that certain areas have bottle service after a certain hour. But when I told him that hour hadn't been reached (she didn't want to serve us at 8:30pm because she said bottle service starts at 9), and when I came back an hour and half later, the people now sitting at the same seats were just having cocktails, he didn't want to talk about it. Weird. Instead of diffusing the situation, he made me feel as if he didn't want to hear what really happened, and that he thought I was a silly deluded person. So in the end, this hotel gets 3 stars: 5 stars for the hotel, amenities (spa/swimming pool/fitness center), view and most of the staff, and one or none for the racist doorman, waitress (?), and pretty insensitive manager.

We were told that we would be contacted by the \"Director of Front Office\" the following morning and he was in a postion to resolve this matter. We waited most of the next morning to be contacted by Paul \"S\", and after leaving 3 messages for him we were informed by security that he was \"too busy to deal with this situation\".

I especially liked the high end ktichenette with a microwave, SubZero fridge, Meile stove, etc. There are even cooking utensils, pans, and dishes! Now, the not so good. Even though the room is large and luxurious, I found it a bit sterile. The slate color scheme should be brightened up a bit with a dash of red roses or something else to break up the slate monotony. The duvet on the bed was very thick and the a/c didn't seem to work so well so it was a bit stuffy. I took a tour of the spa and fitness center, but didn't partake of any service or activity. I had no meals at the hotel either. The one downside of my stay was the construction noise that started early in the morning. I know that I paid a soft opening rate of $347 because of the construction, but I had hoped that there would be a minimal amount of noise. Not so -- they were pumping concrete up to the 90th floor and there was a 5 second interval pounding in the core of the hotel that did not stop. When I checked out, I told the front desk person about this, and she apologized. I actually checked out early because the pounding was so annoying.
