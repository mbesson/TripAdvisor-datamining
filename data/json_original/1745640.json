Very comfortable and looks great very clean. was a bit shocked when we walked in and seen the shower in the corner of the bed room. Few problems when next door was using the shower it sounded like someone was trying to saw threw the walls it was a good job we came with them. AC was not good at all. Also we went for a hen party we wasn't loud but when we arrived at midnight we had to be quiet. Lift was very scary but in all they r beautiful rooms x", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and quiet too...\u201d", "Author": "JandPBirmingham_UK", "ReviewID": "UR119640794", "Content": "We stayed in the Gongora apartment on Calle de Atocha, near to Anton Martin metro station, which was very convenient for Plaza Major, Plaza Santa Ana and Puerto del Sol. The apartment itself was spacious, well equipped with a large leather sofa, induction hob, coffee maker and juicer. The shower and basin was more in suite than en suite, but allowed us to chat whilst getting ready. The agent let us drop our bags off earlier than the check-in time and come back once the flat had been cleaned. Contrary to their website, they did not charge an extra 2% for paying by credit card nor took a deposit. You can also pay in advance by bank transfer. What suprised me most was how quiet the apartment was, considering how many people are out on the streets late a night, the number of taxis passing and the proximity of the adjacent flat. We overslept more than once!", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turin, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Great Hospitality - Great Serviced Apartment\u201d", "Author": "chipalkatti", "ReviewID": "UR114858941", "Content": "As part of our closing school seminar in Madrid, we rented Six Rooms at Calle de Relatores, 3 and were warmly welcomed by Nacho. He spoke decent English and was extremely friendly and willing to help us in any way possible. The location is probably the best in all of Madrid - walking distance to Plaza de Jacinto Benevente, Puerta del Sol, Reina Sofia Museum, Botamical Gardens, Plaza Mayor, Plaza Sant'Anna and very close to Anton Martin Metro station. Our apartment was large with 2 bedrooms (one with a double bed and the other with two single beds) and a bathroom, living room with a 32\" plasma TV (good working condition and good reception) and a kitchen with all the amenities. Overall, the house was recently done with a modern look to it and aesthetically done. The phone signals weren't much clear here since it's away from the roads and closer to the central veranda that most apartment buildings have, but this was a small issue. The internet was fine with good speeds though. All we needed or asked was delivered by Nacho, who's office was the door just in front of us. I would definitely want to stay here again for a no hassle stay and plenty of living space around.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cYou better bring your own toilet paper\u201d", "Author": "ei123", "ReviewID": "UR93959145", "Content": "We stayed in the green room - it might be that the other rooms are nicer but I cannot give more then 2 points considering the price we paid. The rooms in general have potential but definitely need to be improved! We stayed there for three days in the colder Madrid winter. Unfortunately there was only a small AC which was not able to heat up the room to a decent temperature. The equipment of the apartment was ok (kitchenette, bed) but what was one of the biggest negative points is the simple curten which seperates the bed from the \"bathroom\". You drop out of the bed and you are in there. The rooms are not cleaned so we run out of toilet paper after the first day. Poor.... The bathroom just contained a bathtub and it was impossible not to flood the floor while taking a shower. You do not have a hook where you can fix the shower so it is really uncomfortable to handle soap & water at the same time. The bathtub is absolutely unnecessary and the walls already show water stains. The hooks for the towel were loose and it's kind of noisy especially when the guests next door take a shower. No good noise isolation. We were received by a young guy which guided us to the room and immediately left. No map, no information. Just a sheet of paper with the W-Lan connection (hard to identify and the connection itself was very poor...). A big plus is of course the location. Close to a metro station and just a walk from the big touristic spots. We stayed in a very nice place with a similar concept in Rom but this rooms were a big disappointment. I would not recommend it but suggest rather paying some EUR for a nicer hotel.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Six Rooms Apartments Madrid", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1745640-Reviews-Six_Rooms_Apartments_Madrid-Madrid.html", "Price": "$73 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Atocha, 32 -30, 01</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Centro</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1745640", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/6b/c9/6bc95dd04cd175427c257efd0e12afc72large.jpg"}}
