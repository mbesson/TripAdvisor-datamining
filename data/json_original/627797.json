There is always staff at hand so that was great. They were super nice and friendly. Only thing was the building next door was having construction done on it so it did get a little loud- no fault of the hotel. It was also in walking distance of the Metro so it was really central.

The room was large and had a decent-sized bathroom for Paris. Everything was clean and simple with a welcoming family-run feel. Excellent location, Montparnasse is lively and central, but not a tourist trap. Paid around 80 euros/night for me and my boyfriend; much nicer than a hostel! We got a discount for staying on the main floor (still decent courtyard view from window) and 12 euros off for the third night. The concierge recommended a nice bistro, though the neighbourhood is filled with restuarants, cafes, bars, creperies, and bakeries of good quality - they aren't just filled with tourists.

The room I got was on the ground floor, just beside the entrance and the (very little) lobby and reception desk. Despite being right in front of the lobby, it was not as noisy as I was afraid of at first. The room was clean and it actually felt nice to be awaken by the noises coming from the kitchen where they were preparing the breakfast. The only down side of my room was the incredibly small bathroom, with a tiny shower and an even smaller sink. There are three points, however, where hotel Agenor stands out: the owner is very very friendly and he loves to chat with his guests, give suggestions on what to visit and where to go (and where not to go too). Coming from US, where everything is so anonymous, I found that point charming and refreshing. The second point is the price... the hotel itself is not luxurious, but it is a real bargain. The third point is location: being close to rue Daguerre (which is very picturesque), there are restaurants and shops where you can have a nice lunch/dinner for relatively modest prices, which in Paris is something really remarkable.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "Bostongirl15", "ReviewID": "UR116769337", "Content": "After weeks of researching possible places to stay for first trip to Paris, stumbled upon a review for the Hotel Agenor. It was far cheaper than a lot of grungier looking hotels in less ideal neighborhoods. The room was small, but that is to be expected for Paris and the bathroom was surprisingly spacious. It was extremely clean and well kept. The staff were very friendly and helpful and it was a great place to come back to after long days trekking through the city. There are also a lot of great restaurants and several metro stations nearby. Also for history buffs, the Cimitiiere Montparnasse is right around the corner.

No air conditioning, so summery may be warm. Breakfast only, but very good.

Aside from some mildew in the shower, the room was clean and comfortable. The staff were all cordial and helpful. All spoke either great or passable english. I for one appreciated the modest breakfast on mornings I wanted to get going quickly. When I got back late at night, a beer from the back fridge (2 euros) and using the WiFi were welcome amenities to wind down. The surrounding area while not really picturesque, was a great Parisian neighborhood with a nice mix of locals and tourists. A nice array of shops, bars and restaurants within a few blocks (not to mention the splendid Montparnasse Cemetery around the corner). I'll try to mention this under \"nearby restaurants\" but I must offer a rousing recommendation for \"PlanB\", a little cafe a couple blocks away (89 Rue Daguerre). Best food and staff on this visit.

We booked the hotel on parisinfo.com. We flew into Paris early in the morning. We took the RER in from the airport and got off at the Denfert Rochereau station, which is only about a 10 minute walk to the hotel. We arrived before noon, but the staff quickly got our room ready and let us in as soon as they could. The next morning, when jet-lag had slammed us pretty hard, we didn't get up until after 11am. It was a nice treat to not have a maid banging on the door like you might experience at other hotels. The staff were aware that we were still there and waited until we went out before cleaning the room. The room was a little on the smaller side, as expected, but very clean. The breakfast each morning consisted of croissants, bread, yoghurt, juice and coffee. And the staff all speak very fluent English and were all very helpful and offered suggestions on how to get around Paris. The hotel is situated on a quiet side street in the Montparnasse area. You are just a minute or so away from a busy, vibrant area with lots of restaurants. The Gaite Metro is just a 2 minute walk away and the Montparnasse Train Station is a less than 10 minute walk away. The hotel is quiet. The location is convenient to lot of things.
