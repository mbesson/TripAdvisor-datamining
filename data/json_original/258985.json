On arrival, the night porter told us that our room was no longer available. We were dumbfounded and after some protestation he made a telephone call to a sister hotel where there was a room available. We were then instructed to walk to the sister hotel in the snow. We considered this treatment to be unreasonable and a taxi was arranged. Although we were assured the sister hotel was of the same rating we found ourselves in a far less desireable area of Rome- tramps, prostitutes etc. We would not recommend this hotel as we would not want anyone else to experience the same treatment.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cService??\u201d", "Author": "Parkholt", "ReviewID": "UR119585056", "Content": "We have just at Hotel Galles for 4 days and in many ways enjoyed our stay.

We chose it because of the proximity to Termini station and to a Metro station. It was clean and quiet, the beds were comfortable, there was air conditioning--what more could you want? Ah, the staff... Our first morning, we had to get to a meeting point for a tour very early and needed to leave the hotel before breakfast was served. Since the food was already out, they very kindly allowed us to go down and have breakfast early. At the end of our visit in Rome, the airport transportation we had arranged failed to show up at the appointed time--2:00 a.m. The night concierge tried calling the emergency number for us, and when no one answered and it was evident our ride was not going to show up, he called a taxi for us. We appreciate very much the friendly and accommodating staff! The only inconvenience was that the water in the room was not potable. But it's not the first time I've had to brush my teeth with bottled water, and we managed just fine.

We had forgotten to write down an address for a tour we'd booked so we asked the receptionist we could get the code for the internet/computer in the lobby. She handed us a prepaid card with a scratcher on it that was already scratched out. When asked about it she said it should still work. Taking her word for it we tried to log on to the computer. It wouldn't work, so we asked her about it and her response was \"sorry that's only for laptops\" when we asked her for a refund and she said it was impossible and we'd have to buy another card for the computer in the lobby. Any other time we needed anything from the desk, the answer was always \"sorry we can't do that\" or \"my collegue will take care of it\" and it was never taken care of, even something as simple as telling us where we can get water (the water was unpotable in the rooms.) The rooms were decent, the bathrooms were small. The breakfast was TERRIBLE! The food had been left out overnight and the coffee was disgusting.

We (2 adults, 2 children) stayed in a quad room. The hotel was only a block away from a Metro stop, and was a few blocks from Termini station (easily walk-able with some luggage). We had plenty of space, with 2 fold-out beds downstairs and a queen bed in an upstairs loft. The room was clean and everything was in working order. The bathroom was a bit cramped for American standards, but nice compared to other Italian baths we had seen. The management and staff were all friendly, and the front desk clerk spoke good English and was helpful. Breakfast was nothing special, but was typical Italian morning fare. The only problem that we encountered here was that the water was not potable (small sign on the bathroom mirror), so we were sure to keep bottled water on hand.

The room I was given was very spacious but with a dated decor and smelt of damp. The bathroom was huge but didn't have a bath tub just a shower. Curiously there was no gel shower supplied to guests along with the shampoo and towels. The room was clean, with wooden floor throughout, twin beds with a mattress softer than a waterbed which was very uncomfortable. The bed was mounted on large castors (wheels) and was moving as one turned in bed. The main problem was the old air-conditioning system which was working but very noisily indeed, which resulted in 2 consecutive sleepless nights. The hotel is located just by the metropolitana station (\"Castro Pretorio\") and therefore very convenient. Breakfast offered had a decent selection of danish pastry (brioches, croissants, cakes, etc.) as well as ham and cheese or fruit salad straight out of the tin. Reception staff can be so-so, some are welcoming while others are just unco-operative. Don't be surprised to find the non-English-speaking maid doing your room as you come back up to your room after breakfast either! You'll have to wait if you may want to brush your teeth... ;-) My conclusion: May just be OK for one night! But you still won't want to come back for more later.

Booked there by CHA travel, a student travel group that also has adult tours. We were an adult tour. None of the smoke detectors were in working condition on any of the floors that I visited. All of the smoke detectors had their \"guts\" removed. When we complained to the management, we were told that it was o.k. because Italy didn't have a smoke detector law. I am not sure about that, but it didn't make our stay any safer. I would not allow my child to stay there, and we would not have stayed there if we had any other option. We did not receive our hotel itinerary until shortly before the start of the tour in the U.S.. The hotel looked good on its web site. Problems from the beginning. When we checked in there were not enough singles for our group. We had a number of single adults traveling with us. We were told that CHA was aware of the problem, but simply told the hotel to book anyone with the same last name into the doubles. That didn't solve the problem. The night manager in charge on one of the nights we were there was very obviously intoxicated, and smoking as well ( remember there were no noticeable working smoke detectors). When one of our group shouted at him to put the cigarette out, he put it out on the computer keyboard. Many complained about the lack of security. Many doors were found to be open when we returned from out day tour. One of the group complained that her mini-bar had been opened and all of the contents removed. She complained to the manager that she would not pay for the contents. After some discussion , he agreed. Many were charged for phone calls thay didn't make. We didn't find out about the charges until we were ready to leave for the airport when we checked out of the rooms at 4:00 a.m.. Our tour guide, who was excellent, told us just to leave the hotel as he did not want us to miss our plane. A person who was with another group was arguing with the manager about phone calls he said he did not make. I don't know how his problem ended as we left for the airport. Phones not all in working order. Some people did not receive wake up calls. It was especially bad on the morning that we left for the airport. Message light were on, but no messages. Breakfast good.
