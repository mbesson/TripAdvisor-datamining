Although the reservations were paid for in advance, they still insisted on scanning our card for \"incidentals\" and charged us after we left for two nights at full price. That would help to explain why they refused to give us a bill upon check-out after charging our card over $500 more. For the entire stay, we NEVER had a key to our room and was inconvenienced to have to wait for someone to let us in every time we left the room. Not ONCE was there enough food for any breakfast to be had. And the nasty swimming pool (the size of a small private pool) as they call it was off limits because we didn't have a key. The building itself is nice because it's only 7 years old, but no security in the $26 per day parking lot across the street allows the drunks and homeless to wonder about freely without any resistance. The location is good for the money, but a one night stay beforehand at Holiday Inn Express was more convenient and has more amenities. When asking about a key for the room, we were mislead and lied to repeatedly.

First let me start off by saying we needed way more time. The staybridge is located in a perfect location close to the riverfront and close to the trolley line and close to Harrahs Casino. Emeralds resturant is about 4 blocks down. Mothers resturant across the street I didn't think the food was that great and kind of pricey for what you got. So location is perfect and bring some good walking shoes becuase your going to need them. Only used a cab twice once from the airport and once back to the airport. You can walk every where even to the French Quarter!! Our reservation was for a single room but when we got their they upgraded us to a two room suite !!! The staff is great and very helpful it most be thaT whole southern thing. We had ate breakfeast their every am they had ceral and eggs begal toast and fruit. We went to the pool one afternoon it's small but it did the trick. The beds where great and the rooms very clean and well taken care of. We are going back in March for a longer stay. One other side note pay 5 bucks and ride the trolley add day you get to see the city and it's just a great experience it's worth the 5 bucks and the time! One last thing go to the French Quarter Police Department and buy a shirt they sell them to support their police orgzation. You buy the shirts out of a vending machien they run between $15-20 buys. it's a neat suvenior and your also helping them out to. I want to send a shout out to the New Orleans PD great bunch of folks and to the trolley driver that also acted as our unoffical tour guide gave us more oral history about the city and trolley's they use then any book or museum .", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNot the best but far from the worst\u201d", "Author": "Barbara28970", "ReviewID": "UR120460671", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel twice; once for one month while on business, and again in August for six days, also on business.

The kitchen was a plus: dishwasher, full refrigerator, microwave, two-burner stove top, cabinets with dishes, pots and pans and utensils. However, the television was outdated, the carpeting had seen better days, and the sofa was small, not very comfortable, and probably should have been replaced. Bathroom and closets were fine. I did have some issues with the toilet and then the television and when I reported the problems, it took a while to be resolved due to an apparent disconnect with the front desk. There was also a mix-up with the room cleaning schedule and my sheets were not changed on time. I had to ask three times before it was handled. I have a feeling that this is not the norm for this hotel, but I did have issues with the service. The laundry room (I think there are two rooms with two washers and two dryers) are complementary, which is nice, however, I experienced problems several times with at least one of the appliances. The gym is very small. A weight set, two tread mills and a ellipitical. Location was not bad. It is situated close to the art galleries (warehouse district) as well as to the French Quarter, but not too close, so it was probably quieter than places in the quarter.

You basically have 6 spots to chose from if you have a large vehicle. Three in the front as you drive in or drive through the covered area to reach the other outside 3 spots.

The free breakfast downstairs is above average as far as free breakfast goes. From Tuesday thru Thursday, Sundowner receptions in the afternoon with free food and drinks are a great amenity if you are staying mid-week. Business travelers getting per diem can really stretch their $ here. Tip: There are no icemakers in the hotel. Instead, each room has a fridge with an icemaker in it. Remember to flip the little lever in the freezer to turn the icemaker on as soon as you check in your room. Otherwise you will be waiting an hour for ice when you really need it!

It is located right across the street from \"Mother's\" and you won't want to miss out on some authentic New Orleans cuisine there, including the baked ham. The surrounding streets are funky eclectic, and safe. You can easily walk to the World War II museum.

I still have the confirmation in my inbox (66355521) at the special conference rate of $109.99. The night before our departure, I called to confirm our stay only to find out they cancel my reservation in April. When asked why, their response was, \"Because we tried to charge your credit card last month and it was declined.\" Firstly, why would a hotel try to charge a client's credit card one month before the reservation. Secondly, of course my credit card was declined. The credit card I used in November 2010 expired in February 2011 so I have a new card with the same credit card number, but with a new expiry date. Pretty simple. When I asked them why they didn't call me, they told me they called my cell. I find this odd because I didn't receive a voice mail or text or anything. They never tried to email me either even though they successfully emailed my confirmation to me. Odd. This was only one incident of many within my group. Staybridge canceled another couple's room and increased the price for others. What clearly happened here is that Staybridge realized their $109.99 price was too low after they discovered there were Rotarians coming in from all over the world so they increased prices and canceled people's rooms so they could sell them at a much higher rate. I'd like to know if Staybridge has any Rotarians on staff in their senior management team.

They do have a small pool, we didn't use it, but the little kids seemed to enjoy it very much! Since my husband had to work while we were there, I had the day to sightsee and was very glad we were near the French Quarter. I was able to walk to all the sights that I was interested in. I was alone during the day and never felt unsafe during my time there. In the evening my husband and I would go out to dinner and came back to the hotel around 10pm. Again we never felt like we were in a bad or unsafe area. On the 18th, I used the laundry area, since we were on the 18th floor, we used the laundry area on the 16th floor--they also have washer/dryers on 2 other floors. The use of the washer and dryers is free, they do sell detergent and softeners in the lobby at their mini-market. We normally travel with the Purex sheets that have detergent, softener and dryer sheet in one, made it very convenient to do the laundry. My only complaint would be that the laundry room on the 16th floor doesn't circulate air very well, so if both dryers are running, it's a sauna in there. The bed in the room was very comfortable, the couch was large enough for us to sit and plan our evenings, and the free WiFi was nice. The only odd thing was where the TV was located, yeah you could pull it out and angle it towards the bed or the couch, but really, we didn't mind. The noise level outside wasn't bad till a group of young adults (there was a HUGE church convention with young adults from various states in town) seemed to mob the area and the cops had to use their sirens to keep them moving and not block the intersection. Honestly, it wasn't bad, but know when there are large conventions in town, you might hear more street noise than normal.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alabama", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay with teenagers\u201d", "Author": "aubiegirl", "ReviewID": "UR71679153", "Content": "I booked this hotel in New Orleans because I was traveling with 2 teenage boys and I needed a suite.

We had to go to the front desk to ask if they were going to service our room and they told us yes but it never happened. Several times durning our stay we had to ask for towels. There was a homeless man sleeping on the bench by the entrance to the hotel at night and was still there in the morning. There was also unsavory people hanging around the front desk@night visiting the employee on duty you could tell they weren't staying @ that hotel.People by the elevators that didn't belong@that hotel asking for handouts. No safe in the room so when asked if I could keep my valuables in the front desk safe they told me it was not available now and they didn't know when it would be available so when packing to check out a necklace was left in the drawer of the nightstand and a few hours later called back to the hotel the front desk told me no one has checked in to that room the only person that has been in that room was the cleaning lady and they couldn't find my necklace. I had them investigate but they told me that they have never had any complaints of this matter on this hotel so they don't feel like that their staff did anything wrong. It was white gold with diamonds and the lady told me that even if it was platinum they weren't have taken it . I know I forgot the necklace but if she believes that her employee didn't take it I have a levee I want to sell her. I wouldn't have gone to New Orleans but that is where my daughter wanted to get married The carpet in the room was sticky and dirty made my white socks turn black. When we were walking in the hotel from the front desk to our room we didn't feel safe at all.You had to park across the street in a open parking lot and pay approx $40.00 a day what a Rip Off. I will never stay in another Staybridge or it goes without saying never step foot in New Orleans again. After Katrina that city hasn't even tried to fix their city back to even where it was before they are waiting for a handout from Everybody Else. I really shouldn't be Surprised it is a Very Unsafe City and Unsavory Town.

Thus began a whirlwind search to find suitable accommodation for the four days I was going to be in the Big Easy, no easy feat given that Jazz Fest was also taking place during the course of my visit. My main criteria in choosing a hotel was location as I needed to be reasonably close to the Convention Center. Safety, price, and comfort also factored into my decision. After reading a number of reviews of area hotels, some of which were down right scary, I settled on Staybridge Suites. I was not disappointed. The hotel is located on the fine line that exists between the French Quarter and the Warehouse District. It's an easy ten minute walk to get to the Convention Center. Yes, it's slightly further than the Hilton or one of the other hotels on Convention Center Boulevard, but I really didn't find this to be a problem. Actually, watching all of the conventioneers stream out of the Hilton every morning reminded me of a cattle call. I was glad to have a little more breathing room. My suite, a standard studio consisting of two beds, bathroom, couch, and kitchen (refrigerator, microwave, sink, dishwasher, electric burners) was on the 2nd Floor of the hotel facing Poydras Street. I initially thought the street noise, and the proximity to the elevator, was going to be a problem but this ended up not being an issue. The room itself was comfortable and fairly spacious. It was probably more than I really needed, but it was nice to spread out and have the option of staying in and whipping something up as opposed to going out for dinner all the time. You definitely get your money's worth where the amenities are concerned. The WiFi access is free and there is no additional charge to use the fitness room or the pool. Best of all, there is a breakfast buffet with hot AND cold selections every morning. I absolutely loved this as I need a good breakfast to give me a jump start in the morning and you can't always rely on continental breakfast being provided at a convention. I always left for the day feeling well fed and was able to take fruit and/ or yogurt with me for later on in the day. The hotel also offers food (tacos, BBQ, etc.) on certain nights (currently Tues. thru Thurs.) as part of their Sunset Receptions. I never went to any of these, but it was nice to have the option. The hotel does not have a dedicated restaurant. As far as area dinning is concerned, I recommend U.S. Prime, a nice little place just a few feet down the street from the hotel, Gordon-Biersch (on Poydras Street close to Convention Center Boulevard), and either Poppy's Time Out or the Crazy Lobster at Riverwalk. Mother's is also right across the street from the hotel, but I didn't go there. The hotel doesn't have it's own dedicated airport shuttle, but Airport Shuttle, Inc. picks up and drops off at the downtown hotels. I HIGHLY recommend this as an alternative to a taxi to and from the airport as the cab fare is expensive. My colleague paid $42 (in cash -- credit cards weren't accepted) for her trip from the airport to the Hilton. The airport shuttle is $38 round trip. You can buy your ticket for the shuttle at the airport near Baggage Claim. The transportation was definitely reliable -- I was picked up at the hotel at the time stated on my return ticket. I am extremely satisfied with my experience at Staybridge Suites. The location was perfect and I felt safe and comfortable. Also, I think the staff made a concerted effort to make sure that guests had a good experience.

Comfortable, spacious rooms with clean kitchen area and full-size refrigerator. We happened to stay during the Essence Festival and the hotel really only seemed crowded at breakfast time. Super-small swimming pool (didn't use it, though). Room service was a bit sluggish from day to day; often they couldn't come up until early afternoon (during naptime) or 4-5:00 in the evening. Parking is free but HORRENDOUS!! There is an underground lot housing about 15 cars, then two levels above housing about 6 cars each. Spots were extremely narrow and we squeezed our SUV in each time.

To go paper bags available to on the run. Popcorn in the afternoon one day, light dinner from Tuesday to Thursday. We had beef stew, chips, salsa, salad, beer, wine, soda, etc. one night, the other night was BBQ. We loved the hotel, we loved our room, it gets serviced only if you stay more than a week, otherwise, you get your bed made, not changed, extra towels, some days, and soap and shampoo only if you ask the maids, if they see you have leftovers in your shower you don't get extra. Hotel is next to Harrah's Casino and across the street from Mother's. We had their Ferdi special, was not impressed. Tasteless, our Thanksgiving ham was better tasting. Went to Harrah's for their $10 lunch, variety, had jambalaya, rice and beans, catfish, gumbo, fried chicken, plus all the other types of food typical of casino buffets. Walking distance to the French Quarter, Jackson Square, and all three Streetcars. Main streets to walk down to is Canal Street, this is the street where you can begin your walk all around the French Quarter. Three main streets you must walk down is Bourbon Street, especially at night, to hear Jazz spilling out of the bars. Try a Hurricane at Pat O'briens, they charge you $3 for the glass so take it home with you. Royal Street for antiques and quiet during the day, and Decatur Street will lead you straight to Jackson Square and Cafe du Monde. Decatur Street has a lot of the tourist type stuff to look at and buy. We bought the 5 day VisiTour pass for $20 at Unique Grocery on Bourbon Street, but probably only needed the 3 day pass for a 5 day stay. Most of your time will be spent walking around the areas close to the hotel. You probably could just get a day pass for $5 if you are planning to go to the Garden District and you can do a walking tour by yourself, just go to Frommer's online to get the walking tour information. Just pay the $1.25 fare each way and save yourself alot of money, instead of taking a tour with a tour company. Ate at Commander's Palace, spent around $130 with tips, since, I am from NY, I was not impressed, but by NOLA standards, decent. Strong Bloody Mary's there. We had an 11:30 Jazz Brunch reservation and did the 11/2 hour leisurely Garden District self - walking tour before that. Cemetary is closed on Sundays. Ate at Casemento's on Napolean and was the best and freshiest oysters a NYC person has ever ate, they have their own oyster leases, and the restaurant doesn't look like anything special, and portions are not big, but crab claws are also a must, get the large portion, our small portion left us wanting more. Take St.Charles(green)Street car to both of these restaurants. Angelo Brocato on the Canal Street Street car (red) was not impressive, and was rated #1 by tripadvisor, if you do not live in a big city, then go try their gelato and pastries, baba rum had artifical rum extract flavoring, not the real stuff. The Riverfront street car rides paralled to Decatur street up to the French Market, French Market had nothing impressive, one small fruit stand, the rest souveniers. Central Grocery was about the only thing we were impressed with. Brought three muffulettas from them, 1 we ate while in NOLA, and 2 to take back to NY uncut, just to impress our children with the shape and size of the sandwich. $14 for a sandwich that looked like a big hamburger to my little one, it is Italian cold cuts with a mixed olive salad spread. The olive salad, can get alittle overwhelming after awhile. Brought Pralines on Decature from Southern Candy Makers, still too sweet for us. If you like to walk, don't really need to buy VisiTour, but for us a day pass or 3 Day Visitour pass would be enough, next time we go back to NOLA, but not sure if we will go back, I think we covered everything we needed to see on this trip. We liked using our VisiTour pass because we could hop on hop off when it was late at night or when our feet started to hurt. Car is not recommended, expensive to park. Airport buhs for $2 each way was fine for us. Easy to catch E-2 airport bus to the French Quarter, give yourself 1 hour once you are on the bus to get to your hotel, and give yourself 2 hours from time of checkout from hotel to get to airport to go home. Get an E-2 bus schedule online or when you get on it from airport to hotel. Don't be afraid to ride with the locals, and save yourself $33 for 2 people for a taxi or airport shuttle, use that money for food and drinks. If time is a concern then take the taxi. Acme Oyster house, char-grilled oysters only, the fried stuff was way too salty and the batter was almost breadcrumb like.

The rooms are a very good size, with a full-sized fridge, a small stove (two burners), microwave, sink, dishwasher and even dining/cookware. The two beds were not exactly twin size nor were they full size. I think they fit one comfortably and would be a little cramped if there were to be two full sized adults.

There are juices, coffee, milk (chocolate and regular), plus sodas and iced teas. Make your own waffle station, breads, scrambled eggs and meat, plus fresh fruit, yogurt and dried cereals. You could also take it to go if you were in a hurry, or eat back in your room as the diningroom does fill up fast.

The limited service is more than compensated by the other offers of the hotel: the suites instead of rooms as I told before, there is a FREE laundry (actually there are 3 of them, on 5th, 10th and 15th floor or so), the free breakfast is great and includes fresh fruits and \"make your own waffle\" ... and last but not least, the \"sundowner\", actually free food and drinks on weekday evenings. Maybe NO offers some hotel experiences in special places that you do not find anywhere else, and the staybridge is quite \"standard\" but it is worth every $ you pay.

I actually had to leave a note in my room at one point that read \"Please Vacumn\". To top this off, one Sunday afternoon I happened to be in my room when the staff came through and the young lady actually stepped into my room and asked for a tip!

My top priorities are a quiet room and a smoke-free room. For the most part, the hotel was quiet. The rooms are suites, which are generally quieter than standard rooms with connecting doors to the next guest's room. My only complaint on the quiet front was the doors from hallway into the rooms. They SLAM! They also do not block sounds from the hallway, so if anybody is talking within 75 feet of your door, you will hear the entire conversation. As for \"smoke-free,\" the first room I was assigned smelled very much like the nearby casino. It reeked. The second room had just a hint of old tobacco, but it was tolerable and I didn't want to risk trying a third room after my experience with the first room! One of the housekeepers told me the lower floors are more smoke free than the upper, and it is true that my second room was on a lower floor than my first. A couple of small hassles -- washrags were scarce. I didn't see one until my 4th day! Also, the scrambled eggs at the complimentary breakfast were consistently the worst I've ever eaten, which is ironic because the rest of the breakfast was decent, especially considering that most of the hotels in the area do not provide free breakfast. In fact, during the week, the hotel also provides a small supper meal, complete with free drinks, for those who may not have time or funds to eat in style every evening.

We were in town for the BCS Title Game. GEAUX TIGERS!! Location: Good safe location on the corner of Tchoupitoulas and Poydras. Hotel is 8 blocks from the Superdome. 2 blocks from the Riverwalk. 1 block from Harrah's. 6 blocks from Bourbon. 5 blocks from the Convention Center. 8 blocks from Jackson Sqaure. Approx. 10 blocks from the French Market. (You get the picture - you can pretty much walk anywhere in about 10-15 minutes.) Rooms: We had a 1 room studio (1 and 2 bedroom suites are also available). Room was typical mid-class hotel fare however because Staybridge is an extended stay hotel, the room also had a small kitchen (fridge, dishwasher, sink, coffee pot, stove, etc.). Our room (713) had a nice view of Piazza d'Italia, Lowe's hotel, the W, Harrah's, etc. I found our king bed to very comfortable. A/C was central and very quiet (no window units here). Food: The hotel has a small pantry with snacks, frozen entrees, and drinks. It's open 24 hours a day (very convenient after a late night on Bourbon!). During the daytime, there are many convenients eating options nearby. Mother's is directly across the street. Harrah's Casino has a small food court, a buffett, and a couple of nicer restaurants. If you're looking for something nice, Tommy's Cuisine (NOLA/Italian mix) is located 3 blocks into the Warehouse District on Tchoupitoulas. Pros: The location is superb. If you plan to spend all of your time in downtown NOLA, the location can't be beat. I also found the front desk staff to be very friendly and helpful. Cons: Shower pressure was very weak. Housekeeping is only available during weekends on a by request basis (there's a cart parked near the elevator - we just replenished our towels ourselves on Saturday and Sunday). ALSO, the hotel currently has no guest parking. If you bring a car, you are on your own. There's a lot directly across the street but the meter in the lot only lets you buy a couple of days at a time (meaning if you stay longer, you will have to return to feed the meter again). We had no problems with this setup, but this could be really inconvenient for anyone who needs in/out privledges or doesn't have time to worry about parking meters.

The night we were there they had hamburgers and hot dogs, perfect for us since we had our 3 kids with us. They also offered wine and beer, all free of charge. * Breakfast also included in your rate. * Appliances in all the suites. We had a full size refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker and a small (2 burner) range. * We had a studio with 2 double beds and a pull out couch, it was big enough for all of us. * Ironing board/iron/hair dryer all in the room * Room was clean (except for the towel- see below) * Goody bag upon check in, which included a handy map of the city. Con's *No vallet parking. We parked across the street, for about $25/day. *There was no one to help with the bags, which was quite challenging when you are dealing with 3 small kids plus bags. * Signs of wear on the carpet, definitely needs replacing. * A dirty towel still hanging in the bathroom. We called and asked for clean towels, since we weren't sure about the ones who were in the room. Not a problem. There is a pool at the hotel, just 5 ft deep. It's on a courtyard, so the water was very cold. Not a bad thing on a hot summer day, unless you want a big pool.
