I have rated it excellent because it does what I expected of it and does it really well. Of course there are more expensive and more lavish hotels around but if you are after a cheap hotel in a good location in the centre of Barcelona then this ticks all the boxes for me. Its modern, clean, comfortable and in a pretty decent area which is a good location in terms of being close to the metro and the city centre etc. Nearest Metro is Encants which is a couple of minutes away and one stop away from the Sagrada Familia which is one of the main tourist places to check out. One stop the other way is Clot station which is on the mainline and you can get trains to and from the airport here which I would recommend. The hotel is actually walkable from Clot station too. I booked our stay pretty much last minute through late rooms so you are always slightly apprehensive when doing it last minute but as I have said above it did exactly what we needed. Room was nice and clean, had a tv, hairdryer, air con etc. Staff were really friendly and helpful and we even got a complimentary bottle of red wine on our arrival which was a nice touch. We didnt pay for Breakfast in advance but you can simply add it to your bill if you decide to have it, think it was about 7 euros each and is a nice little buffet with the usual fruit, pastries, bread, cheese, meats, cereal, fruit juice and also some Spanish style egg, bacon and sausages - plenty to fill you up for a day of sightseeing.

(Madrid properties are 4 star and above.) It was recommended to me by my travel agent. Overall I was very satisfied by the property: the size of both the room and the bathroom were good and it was very clean, if a little tired. Shower pressure was excellent. I found all the staff on reception to be very courteous and friendly, with the exception of one of the night staff, who may actually have been a manager. The breakfast was a standard buffet breakfast in a Spanish hotel and the waiting staff were attentive. A nice feature was \"help yourself\" coffee at the breakfast bar. As other reviews have pointed out, the hotel is in a residential area and a bit far removed from the city centre, but the Metro is close, fast, reliable and safe. (Always use the exit C/Arago from the platform on Line 1; other exits will be a much longer walk back to the hotel.) My only minor complaint about the hotel is with the \"snack bar\". They do not have a full service restaurant but seem to pride themselves on their snack bar. I found that it had closed early two nights running. I only wanted a drink, nothing to eat, and was told this was absolutely impossible. I was referred to the high priced mini bar in my room. Not a satisfactory alternative. There is a PC in the lobby area where one can pay (2 euros for 10 minutes minimum) to access the internet and send/receive emails. More and more hotels are offering this welcome service. Unfortunately it was broken my last night there and precluded me from on-line check-in for my return flight, a disappointment, but not the end of the world. Re: Travel to and from the airport -- please note that the train to and from the airport (Linea C2) stops at El Clot - Arago. The journey takes just under 30 mins and the station is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. You can use one of the T10 tickets (metro, bus, train). The train to and from the airport arrives at Terminal 2. British Airways uses Terminal 1, so a short transfer by shuttle bus is necessary. I highly recommend the Hop on/Hop Off Tourist Bus. I also highly recommend a visit during the annual end of summer fesitival \"Merce\" or \"Merced\" at the end of September. There are events all day and into the night for 4 days running.

We had a fantastic long weekend in the city and stayed here. Secondly, this hotel is nothing like a hostel as per the review further down!?!?! We found this hotel to be absolutely fine and perfect for a city break in Barcelona. The Catalonia Albeniz hotel itself is slightly on the out skirts of the city in a more residential area but dont let that you you off. The taxi driver who picked us up from the bus station hadn't heard of the hotel so if you experience any confusion in your taxi, just ask for Aragon as this is right next door. Alternatively, if you are catching the tube to the hotel from the bus station, walk to the Arc Triumph tube station (near the but station), get on the red line north and then get off at \"Clot\". The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the \"Clot\" red-line tube station. (From the hotel, turn left outside the front doors, walk to the traffic lights then cross over the road). The tube in Barcelona is definitely the easiest, cheapest and quickest way of getting round the city. Just hop on the red line, go south and get off at Universitat and you are near the Gothic Quarter, Ramblas and the tourist part of the city. It takes about 10-15 minutes on the tube. Tickets are purchased from the machines in the tube station and are cheap. There were young, middle and older aged people on the tube all day and night. We never felt at risk or unsafe. Back to the hotel. The rooms are perfectly adequate and spacious. Our room was on the third floor and was lovely and clean as was the bathroom. The room was cleaned daily. No coffee/tea making facilities on the room but there was a TV (with UK Sky News) and a mini bar. No bar in the hotel but there are local yocal bars surrounding the hotel. Our room soon warmed up once we turned the heating on (Barcelona is freezing in November!!!!) All of the staff were great. Very pleasant and happy to talk to us non Spanish speaking Brits. They spoke excellent English and they were all very helpful. The buffet breakfast is fine. The Spanish sausage isn't that great but there was bacon and eggs and a nice selection of fruit, muffins, cakes and juices. The hotel is a 15 minute walk from the Gaudi's Sagrada Familia. Turn right out of the hotel... walk straight for about 15 minutes then turn right and you should be able to see it. There are quite a few cheap bars and cafes near by. Further to the left there is a shopping precinct consisting of mostly clothes shops and this and that. In summary, this is a great hotel for a stay of a few days in Barcelona. We would definitely go back here. For the price as well it was a bargain. Also, if you are flying with Ryanair from the UK to Girona, be prepared for a one hour bus journey to Barcelona.

Taxi from the airport cost about \u20ac20. A little disappointed upon our arrival. The reception and breakfast area are all in one room! There is no bar in this hotel. The breakfast was very disapppointing. On offer - peach juice, tea, coffee, cereals, cakes and pastries. Sounds ok when you write it down, but was all looking very sad and stale. They seemed to have run out of spoons most mornings. The room photos on the internet are very misleading. The room itself (a double) was the smallest, most cramped hotel room we have ever been in. When asked to upgrade to a bigger room, was told by the receptionist that the hotel was full, and the other rooms were of a similar size anyway. Wardrobe suitable for one persons belongings only. Nowhere to keep suitcase (if you kept it on the floor then that was all the available floor space taken!). The room had little natural daylight, as the shutter outside the window was broken, and couldn't be raised more than a quarter of the height of the window. Nothing to see outside anyway except a brick wall! We were at the back of the hotel, so our room was lovely and quiet to sleep in, with no noise from passing traffic etc. We had asked for a non smoking room, but the stale smell and ashtrays in the room suggested otherwise. The hotel info strongly advises that you use the room safe for valuables, but they do charge you to do this, and ask for a \u20ac50 deposit! The bathroom was shockingly small. So much so that you couldn't actually open the door to get in there, as the toilet was behind it. You could stand in the shower, clean your teeth over the sink, and flush the loo all at the same time! Was clean, but bathroom fittings a little dated. The hotel is within walking distance from the Segrada Familia. For all other sightseeing, Metro station Clot was just across the road from the hotel. It's easy to get a taxi from outside the hotel, we never waited more than a couple of minutes. This was our first time in Barcelona, so we asked the receptionist where to go for food on our first night. She recommended us to Port Olympico area. Very pretty as this was the marina, but sadly touts stand outside every single restaurant, and you cannot stroll without being accosted every 30 seconds. Not for us, so we left with empty stomachs and headed for the (less touristy!) Gothic Quarter, which had some great tapas restaurants.
