I booked a room with sea view and balcony at Daisy Hotel to have a special week-end with my girlfriend for her birthday 2 months in advance. Arrived there, there was no room for us. The guy from Daisy Hotel claimed they made a mistake with the reservation. Well, -- happens. The guy from Daisy Hotel brought us to an alternative hotel in the vicinity, which was Sunrise Hotel. The guy showed us the alternative room: small, with no balcony and without sea view (There is no sea view at Sunrise Hotel except on the tiny terrace and except if you bend out the window in room 108. Be aware if they claim something different in their homepage). We arranged with the guy from Daisy Hotel a discount on the price for the inconvenience and due to no sea view and to smaller room, 165 Euro instead of 195 Euro for 3 nights. Daisy had then to pay the difference of the price to Sunrise in case of such. At this point the guy from Daisy left us and people at Sunrise \"took care\" of us. They were very rude with us and we had to wait 20 minutes to be able to check-in. Eventually we could check-in. The room was horrible. It was very dirty and there were brownish-red incrustations on the sheet. Besides, the WC didn't work. We went down at the reception and they say they will clean the room and fix the problem with the WC. At this point we went out for lunch and we get back after at least 1 h. The room was still dirty, there was a lot of dust and sole spots on the floor and the WC still didn't work. They didn't change the sheet on the bed, they simply put a fresh one on the top of it. That was too much for us, we decided to leave and wanted to get the money back. We had to discuss 10 minutes with them in order to get it. They claimed we already checked-in and we should pay the first night (55 Euro) even if it was 2 pm. I was also concerned about the recipe they gave us - more a sheet of paper than an official recipe - and I was worried they claimed we didn't pay yet. At the end we could get all the money back.This is a family-owned hotel and is very difficult to talk with a manager or to complain for the service. They were totally rude with us and absolutely not professional. The only good point is the central position of the hotel, and I suspect they only rely on this positive point. Most of the client are tourist and most probably won't get back to Istanbul very soon, and the hotel is very aware of this. I strongly suggest you avoid this place if you don't want to get bad surprises. I hope to be of any help for future travelers.

Here is the story: Having just taken a 14-hour train ride to Istanbul, we arrived at the hotel and were immediately told that there was a problem with our reservation. The concierge reassured us that they had another place for us so I figured they had another location in the city and we were simply being moved there for our 2-night stay. How wrong I was. We were picked up by 2 sketchy, overly cologned men in a random car and driven 5 minutes away to a youth hostel that had absolutely no association with the Sunrise Hotel. We had booked a twin room with private ensuite at the Sunrise, and while we were given the same at this youth hostel, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly what we were expecting. The sheets were dirty (we could actually see marks on them), there was unidentified trash under no bed, toilet paper was nowhere to be found, and there was actually a hair on the soap provided! We went to bed fearing for out health and safety. We ended up checking out after one night and moving to a friends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hostel (for a lot cheaper and nicer environment!). They tried to charge us the same amount as the Sunrise but luckily we were able to barter $20 off the price (we were still clearly robbed). While Istanbul was absolutely gorgeous and one of the most amazing places I have ever seen, the lack of professionalism from the Sunrise was very disappointing. If there was a problem with our booking, they should have written back so we could have booked somewhere else instead of shipping us off to some creepy, unsanitary hostel. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at the Sunrise, I might advise calling ahead to make sure they have a room for you, lest you end up in the same ill-fated situation that I encountered.
