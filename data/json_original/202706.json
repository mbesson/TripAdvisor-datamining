I couldn't wait to put my review on here! I've read some negative reviews about it and was a little wary as for some silly reason I believe the negative above the positive and all I can say is IGNORE THE SILLY NEGATIVE REVIEWS! Myself and partner flew with Jet 2 holidays and they were superb, easy check in with efficient friendly staff and the same with the cabin crew. Upon arriving in Venice we opted for the water bus, NOT WATER TAXI! It will cost you 25e for a return trip, better than 100e for a one way ride on a water taxi! The only down side is the water bus does take over an hour. Upon arriving at San Marco water stop you turned left, walked over a bridge and the hotel is there, literally less than 5 mins walk. The location is amazing. Check in was quick and friendly greetings by staff. We were told we had been given a free upgrade to a canal view (room 134) the room was spotless, lovely comfortable bed and canal view and a very modern bathroom with good shower. Keeping with the hotel, we were bed & breakfast. I'm not one for continental breakfast and suppose I'm a typical Brit with bacon and egg! I've got to say that I've never had such wonderful breakfasts. Plenty of cold meats to choose from, cheese, cereal, boiled eggs and croissants. (I've never had croissants so tasty!) the coffee was also excellent and plenty of it. I've no idea why people moaned about the breakfast here. I can agree that the dining room is small and if u go for breakfast anytime after 9am, u may have to wait a very short time for a table and it does get crowded around the serving/seating area, but it's certainly nothing to moan about! The staff are very efficient and keep you topped up with coffee and juices. Some people have moaned about 'a heavy key fob!' yes it is heavy but why the hell are you carrying it around with you??? Leave it at reception when you go out and collect it when u return like we did! Your room is safe and noones going to go in, if your worried then use the room safe! The staff were friendly, not over friendly but would more say polite. The only issue I had was that a lot of Italians were extremely rude when out and about and would simply shove you out of the way to get past, along with a lot of very rude French people we encountered! The location of this hotel is superb and I would definitely go back to Venice and wouldn't hesitate staying at the Kette Hotel again. It's superb location and value for money made it an amazing trip! In relation to Venice itself, I loved it. Yeah it will cost you \u00c2\u00a328 for 2 coffees in St Marks square but u expect that, also, when u sit at a table in the square, you will be charged 5.70e each for when the orchestra plays!!! This is before you even place your order! Venice I expensive but not as bad as I expected. All in all, a superb 4 day break and loved every minute of it. Enjoy your stay and feel free to message me if u want any tips or advice!", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, lovely rooms, helpful staff!\u201d", "Author": "Mrs_Ramjam", "ReviewID": "UR126408761", "Content": "I spent a long weekend here with my mum and my husband in March 2012 and we loved the hotel! All the staff were helpful, professional and attentive, they spoke good English (sadly our Italian wasn't up to much!). The foyer looked very grand and the rooms were lovely, clean and decorated in a lovely venetian style with grand light fittings and lovely mirrors and pictures. We requested a canal view and it was lovely to open the windows every morning to see boats going past (and hear the gondeliers singing!) The location was fab. 3 mins away from the Vaporetti stop, next to St Mark's Square and in the heart of San Marco. Don't expect a big fancy breakfast though! I'm not a big breakfast eater so I was happy with a bowl of cereal and a piece of fruit however my Mum and Husband were slightly disappointed with the choice and quality of the continental breakfast. There was lots there, eggs, meat, cheese, pastries, fruit, jams, yogurts, cereal etc but a few things including the coffee didn't taste very nice! As it was included in the cost of the hotel though you can't really complain and they definitely didn't go hungry! The breakfast room is also tiny considering the size of the hotel so it's generally best to get down to breakfast by 8am. We turned up at 9.15 on the last day and had to wait in a 5-10 minute queue. The staff were working flat out to get everyone in and out quickly though and the service was excellent. You can purchase wifi at the hotel which worked well and there is a PC with printer that you can use for printing boarding passes if you pay 2 euros to use it for 30 mins.

The staff is very helpful and they speak several languages (I heard French, English and Italian). We skipped the 20E per person breakfast and took a walk to find some less expensive cappuccino and croissants. The breakfast room (aka the bar) is very small and cramped. I don't know why they don't switch the computer/reading room with the breakfast room...it would make a big difference. The WiFi was 5E for 2 hours and I had to stand in hallway near my room to use it (but at least it worked!). The rooms are small, but comfortable and the bathroom was the nicest of our 2 week trip.

We moved over to Mestre (on the mainland) for our last night and it was easy to take a pre-reserved taxi to the Marco Polo Airport (35E) that was only 15 minutes away. We took the train to Mestre from the main Venice train terminal because ALL trains stop in Mestre! We paid 2.40E for two people to take the 7 minute train ride to Mestre (which is a lovely little town) and stayed at the Best Western Bologna right next to the train station.

Just to let you know building work has just started in front of the Hotel and is likely to go on for over a year according to the information posted about the renovations. We asked could we have a quiet room, as we did not want to listen to the building noise, and the hotel kindly obliged us. We were shown to a room at the back overlooking the canal, Room 302, however this was very drab and small, so we asked for another room , and we were moved to 212, the same dull decor but the room was a lot bigger. Our room now faced the building work. No problem we would just keep the windows closed and put the air conditioning on . Wrong !! air conditioning is not allowed in the Hotel till June . To have the air conditioning on any earlier than that, is apparently at the management's discretion. I am recovering from Cancer and struggling with some health issues, and I found the stifling room absolutely unbearable. I was really upset at the situation and spoke to reception but there was nothing they could do, this is supposed to be a 4 star Hotel and they can't even afford to run the air conditioning . Perhaps the hotel could take notice and have some electric fans available for guests who need a cooler room during the non air conditioning season.. Breakfast is nothing special very basic ,meats, cereal, tinned fruit and some cakes etc. The public areas are nice. The bar is open till 11.30 pm if you are lucky. We wanted a nightcap in the bar at 11.15 pm and were made to feel as though we were a nuisance for ordering drinks so late. The staff are a strange mix, some very friendly and helpful others not.

It was very spacious, well-appointed and charming (even a chandelier over the bed!). We were on the 4th floor at the rear and our two shuttered windows overlooked a canal and a little bridge which was a treat to watch the gondolas and other watercraft make their way up and down. The room was divided into bedroom and living and the bathroom was off a short hallway with the wardrobe at the end. The room was beautifully decorated and very quiet. My only criticism was with the bathroom. The shower struggled to supply enough hot water for two people to shower consecutively. The shower was over the bath, but didn't have sufficient screening to prevent water flooding the floor. The \"worm\" hairdryer was pitiful. It got so hot to hold that I had to wrap a towel around it to use but the air blowing out of it was barely warm so therefore it didn't do a great job. The reception areas, the bar and sitting rooms of the Kette were all lovely. The breakfast room though small, still managed and provided a great breakfast with plenty of variety and good quality. It also gave guests the opportunity to mingle with each other. The service was fantastic at the Kette Hotel! They even offered a free water-taxi for transporting guests to Murano Island to see the glass making (you have to arrange your own transport back to Venice though). The location of the Kette is great. It's close to Piazza San Marco and it's not that far from the Rialto Bridge. There's a great little restaurant behind the Kette over the little bridge called \"VinoVino\". It offers reasonable food at reasonable prices and the service is great! Venice can be expensive for eating if you don't look around .. as our tour guide said about one restaurant in Piazza San Marco, \"they even charge for the air you breathe!\" Actually, the two hour walking tour is highly recommended! One thing I wouldn't recommend, is the pre-booked \"Gondola Serenade Tour\" that starts from Campo Santa Maria del Giglio. It cost $142 and was disappointing. No romantic ride here (not sharing a gondola with 3 others and not sitting next to your partner) and having a gondolier who chain-smoked and wouldn't wear his hat despite repeatedly being asked to. Travelling in a fleet of 4 gondolas huddled together with a singer and accordianist in one of the four), it was not what you'd expect a romantic gondola serenade to be. I would still take a gondola ride but just like with restaurants, look around for a better deal (80 euros seemed to be the going rate) and seek out a nicer gondolier.

I was not sure what to expect from Venice, but I really loved it. Weather was great. We chose Hotel Kette, as it was in Venice city itself, rather then say in Mestre (which is on the Italian mainland and no doubt cheaper option). If you stay in Mestre, you have to commute in to Venice everyday (which at my guess would take 2hours to get in). Since, it takes 45mins by boat to get to San Marco from the train or bus station. For us to stay in Venice city, was the right decision, because I could get to San Marco in 5mins and a great way to avoid the crowds in the morning (before 10am) when most tourist have not arrived and evenings (after 8pm) when most tourists have to take the boat back to the mainland. The water buses stop by 11pm, so it even gets quieter then. You can walk from the bus or railway station to San Marco, but that is about 2 to 3hours walk. So water bus is a good idea. If you decide against staying at Hotel Kette, avoid the hotels near the train station, as the is a lot more populated with fumes from the bus station, busy and hectic. ARRIVING FROM AIRPORT (Venice Marco Polo): best way to get to Hotel Kette and in style, is via the Water bus from the airport (costs about 15 Euros). You can take a Water taxi (100 Euros), but it is a lot less fun, as they are going by speed boat, but the water bus is more relaxed and a nice way to approach Venice. (See hotel web site for instructions). When you arrive at San Marco, you will need to wheel your luggage to the Hotel and along the way there are bridge/steps, so not appropriate for elderly. However, there are men with hand trolleys and they can carry the luggage for your to the hotel. Not sure the price. But I recommend it if it cheap enough. It will save the wheels on your luggage. Although, it is only 5mins, it took us nearly 20mins, as I had to look at the map. The guide onm Hotel Kette's web site is very good, except we missed the 'alley' for the hotel. After you take the steps up and down the bridge, look out for the persian carpet store, next to is the passeway you need to take (look out for the blue mosaic tiles on the ground pointing to Martinez night club). HOTEL: The Hotel is over several floors, but it is a smaller hotel. The Rooms are nice and clean. We got a nice breeze when we opened the window. Our room had a narrow glimpse of the canal. Wi-fi is extra. A bit annoyed that there is a daily safe hire charge extra, which is annoying as my travel insurance is invalid, unless valuable are kept in the safe!. The room had double glazed windows and shutters too. BREAKFAST: The breakfast was good. The breakfast room is small. GONDOLA RIDES: These cost 80 Euros for 40mins and at nighttime even more!. It costs more to go on the grand canal, but I think the water is more choppy there, so I prefer the small lanes. FOOD: Food in Venice is disappointing. They are never going to see you again, so there is no incentive to impress. However, food at Zucca is good (vegetarian), but a little out of the way. Also, Rialto market is an excellent place to pick up ready made fruit salad. In Italy, starters plates are the size as mains. Lots of restaurants offer tourist menus consisting of Spagetti and Pizza. It may have been invented in Italy, but Pizza Pasta is available all over the world. I ended up eating at Chinese restaurants, which was not a bad decision, as the Chinese has a slight Italian influence. I found one near San Marco and also another near the train station. (I always try to eat local foods, but not in Venice). You can get Pizza slices for 2.50 Euros. Water bottles at 2Euros. Main meals can be around 20 Euros per person. Toilets are tricky to find, so yoru best bet is to go to a bar, pay 1 Euro for an expresso and use the toilet for the entire family. Much cheaper then paying 1 Euro for a public toilet. HOW LONG TO STAY: We stayed 4 nights, but I think this was not enough. As the first and last day are wasted on checking in and checking out. There are a couple of neighbouring islands to explore. SIGHTSEEING: We ended up walking quite a lot in Venice. Almost 8-9 hours per day. So get comfortable shoes is a must. It is the only way, I suppose. You could take the water bus, but they only go up and down the grand canal. You have to plan your day well.

This was to be a trip to remember so we booked their transfer. Imagine then the disappointment when the car that met us at the terminal drove 21kms, all the way into Venice and then put us in a water taxi for the the last km to Kette Hotel ! Imagine also then how it felt when I had the temerity to complain to the staff and offered to pay 100 Euros (the normal rate for a boat all the way from the airport, which we didn't get anyway) instead of 140 Euros, and ended-up with all the staff one by one coming and ganging-up in me, finally being pursued through the lobby by one particularly large doorman shouting at me and chiding me for being so miserly over \"only 40 Euros\".

Hotel Kette was the most expensive of the three hotels (2 in Venice and 1 in Rome) we stayed in, and also the most disappointing. We arrived in Venice expecting a four star hotel, and we were a little baffled as to how the hotel had earned it's rating really. In general the service from the gentlemen at the front desk was generally dismissive and on one occasion downright rude, which was a real shame. On the plus side, the porter is a real gem! On arriving, however, we weren't given any information about the location of the hotel or even the facilities and services available other than to be told very quickly where breakfast would be served and at what time. The room we booked was a double superior room, so I kind of don't like to think what a standard room would have been like. It was very dark, at the front of the hotel and had a lovely view of a building site. Having said that, there was never any noise from it, though it was not the most attractive view! I appreciate that this aspect is out of the control of the hotel, and so it was OK really - just be aware it's what you could be looking at. The bed was averagely comfortable, though the pillows were very thin and hard. We asked for extra pillows as there were none in the room and these, to their credit, were supplied very promptly. The bathroom however, was very very small and cramped and the loo made a constant noise which you could always hear in the background. It was also disappointingly supplied with toiletries so if you are going to stay, make sure you take your own. There was nothing in the way of a bathrobe and the light on the vanity mirror did not work. The bathroom was also equipped with one of those useless hairdryer tube thingies, so if good hair is important to you, take your own! The room itself was nicely decorated, though the furniture was a bit shabby. At night however it was quiet and peaceful due to the hotel being located down a quiet street, so there was no disturbance from external noise. On the plus side, the room and the bedlinen was very clean so no complaints there. The 'public' areas of the hotel were very beautiful. However be warned that if you are a 'light' person, there isn't any natural light once you go in through the door. However it's beautifully decorated with marble, brass and dark wood, and the rooms contain lovely furniture and pictures. There are also a number of English magazines lying around on the tables which is a nice touch if you are waiting for something or just wanting to switch off for a few moments. The bar is quite expensive, but about average for the prices you pay in Venice in general. A lot of people mention the breakfast as being disappointing! We didn't think the breakfast itself was too bad at all. Nice, strong coffee and a selection of cereal, yoghurt, bread, cold-meats, boiled eggs and yes! Tinned fruit salad. There was also a selection of fresh fruit, biscuits and pastries. All the food served was very fresh, though they could have done with filling up the platters a bit more often... However, the breakfast room itself is terrible. Dimly lit, cramped and very stuffy. Also, due to the number of people staying in the hotel, it's very hectic in there - not a particularly relaxing start to the day. You needed to get out into the fresh air afterwards as the room was very hot and claustrophobic. The main thing going for this hotel is it's location. Situated on a quiet street about 5 minutes stroll from St Mark's square. Fantastic for seeing the sights and also for lovely shopping. There are also some really good restaurants and cafes around - though it is worth going a bit further away from St. Mark's square to find less expensive places to eat. Don't be fooled though Venice is not cheap and it costs you 2-3 euros to just sit at a table before you even order anything. I have to say that I wouldn't necessarily recommend this hotel to a friend as we also stayed at a different hotel which we preferred.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "Ayaclio", "ReviewID": "UR80460353", "Content": "Great location.

The decor of the rooms would n't appeal to all tastes as they are not 'corporate image' looking bedrooms and I expect some would find them to be dated.. The location is really great.

They did not respond to our prior e-mail request for walking directions and it would have been difficult locating the hotel had we not arrived by water taxi. We had reserved a room for three nights but our stay was extended by five nights due to the volcano in Iceland. The hotel did accomodate us and we were grateful for that, though it appeared that they had more cancellations than extended stays. What we were most disturbed about is that they raised the rate for the last five nights, not honoring the rate at which we had originally reserved. And there was no expression of concern or sympathy for our predicament, nor offers to go out of their way to assist us. Our room would have been fine but the view from our window was of scaffolding and workmen. It was warm, there is no AC in April, and if we opened the windows and shutters during the day we were eye to eye with the workers. At night things were pretty quiet, fortunately. The breakfast buffet was okay but not outstanding in any way. It was almost exactly the same each day. The fruit was tinned; the pastries and bread never seemed perfectly fresh and empty platters were not promptly replenished. It was adequate but with a little imagination and effort could have been so much better. Again here, the staff was courteous but not friendly. That vein of tension again. The Kette may have been a very different experience if the construction was not going on right next door. But since we were there for a total of eight nights, it would have seemed that they might have honored our request for a quieter room. Our experience may have been totally different at another time.

Due to a horrid flight delay we arrived at hotel at 1.30am to be greeted by a really friendly night porter who dealt with us as quickly as he could to enable us to get off to sleep. All other staff we encountered were friendly as well and wonderfully efficient. Room - we had two rooms between the four of us (133 and 134) both looked out on the canal (granted as somebdy else has mentioned it is a narrow canal and I would imagine rooms on the higher floors would have trouble actually seeing it - but hey the majority of canals in Venice are narrow!). Both of our rooms were clean, beautifully furnished and far more spacious than we have had in some european hotels. I loved the chandelier! I took photos as I always do to add to this review but have not done so as truly the pictures on the hotel website do not tell any lies about the rooms. The minibar seemed expensive when we first looked at 3 euros for water or 6 euros for small bottle of wine until we ralised that this was actually cheaper than some of the bars out and about in Venice. Breakfast - I have no clue why anyone has complained about the breakfast at all As you arrive in the breakfast room one of the staff will ask if you want tea or coffe and they will then bring this to your table. There are two different fruit juices an water to drink as well. We had three different meats, a sliced cheese and a brie and hard boiled eggs every morning. There were four different cereals, two or three types of bread, fresh fruit and tinned fruit as well as croissants and pain au chocolats. There were also different sweet breads or cakes on each of the four mornings we had breakfast. The staff were very polite and efficient and none of us felt rushed. It was a lovely relaxing (filling) start to the day. There were a group of American travellers in the hotel at the same time as us who declared the breakfast to be the 'best of their trip so far'. Hotel in general - it is beautiful. The floor in the lobby and the reception are lovely. The lounges are sumptously decorated. These areas are quite small but were never crowded as people were mostly out and about.

Me and my wife were staying there as part of our honeymoon and we were advised that we'd \"probably\" be upgraded as a result. We weren't however and when I asked to see one of the 'delux' rooms with a canal view, the room that was presented was not much bigger, with no better facilities, and the 'view' was of a brick wall opposite with a narrow and rather grubby-looking canal visible if you stuck your head out and looked straight down. This room was offered for 50 euros extra per night, then 40, but I declined. Contrary to what a lot of people have said, I thought the breakfast was very good - indeed one of the best and most varied continental breakfasts I have seen. The selection of wine is not so good. I ordered a bottle of red for the room and they had only 1 type of red wine in the hotel which was also decidedly average. If you want some drink in your room I would recommend buying it elsewhere.

Thanks to some excellent directions from a fellow Forum subscriber we found the hotel with ease. Without those instructions I think we may have struggled a bit as it is hiding up a small alleyway from the main throughfare. Check-in was efficient. That's the only way to describe it. Friendliness is definitely in short supply at this hotel. Polite efficiency is the order of the day. If, like me, you are a chatty friendly person who likes to exchange a few pleasant words whilst handing in your key in the morning you will be left feeling a bit deflated as the staff quite simply will not respond to you. And it was not a language thing either. Our room was very nice but a bit on the small side. When you have a six foot, six inch tall & solidly built husband, you definitely notice room size. We were delighted with the shutters onto the canal which were excellent at keeping out the early morning sunshine and ensuring a longer lie in the morning to recover from all the walking the day before!! The bathroom was also petite but very clean and quite serviceable. The shower took a bit of working out but we got there in the end. We found the bed to be very firm which did result in sore backs when we were getting up in the mornings. As mentioned in other reviews the breakfast room is not the biggest but we never had any problem getting a table. The waiters were also very 'efficient'. The buffet selection was adequate with a selection of three cereals, three cheeses, three meats, fruit cocktail (tinned) and fresh fruit. The was a quite small selection of bread / rolls/ croissants along with small individual sized 'cakes'. This was probably the smallest buffet selection for breakfast that I have encountered but ,given the size of the breakfast room, any bigger would have left no space for the tables. Finally, the location of the Kette is good. Being August, it was fairly warm (for us anyway!) and this hotel is great for being able to go out exploring for a couple of hours and then pop back to cool down for half an hour or so in your bedroom before heading out again. We didn't use any of the other communal rooms so can't pass comment on them but they looked pleasant enough when we looked in on them.

We were there 3 days/nights. Very centrally located, yet off the \"beaten path\" of the regular and busy pedestrian traffic. If you weren't staying there, you probably wouldn't never run into it or know it's even there. Aprox, 5-7 minute walk to St. Mark's and about 10-12 minutes from the Rialto Bridge. That is if you don't stop and look in every shop and window along the way. The front desk staff was nice, friendly, and helpful. However, they really didn't \"volunteer\" or provide you with too much info. unless you initiated a question or greeting. but, no big deal. The breakfast was light and simple and the breakfast staff was good and attentive - providing drinks and clearing dishes as needed. The Breakfast room is very small and may not have enough seats if you hit it at the wrong time. We were fortunate enough to find a table each of our 3 mornings. However, as more people came, some were left \"looking\" for a place to sit. The hotel itself is small and has a unique inside structural design. The floors (3rd floor for example) is at different levels itself. You may be taking steps up or steps down - after leaving the elevator - and still be on the 3rd floor. It was an interesting set-up. Our room was nice, but smaller than a typical hotel room. Not a lot of room to even walk around. However, the accomodations within were fine. Our room was #314 and was the top room above the main entrance. Still haven't figured out how our room was at the top and yet there were 5 floors (we were on the 3rd). In any case, we could see the bell tower (Campanile) and the very top of the Basilica in St. Mark's square. Also, we could view a portion of a close by canal that always seemed to have Gondola activity. Again, the location of this hotel, we thought, was OUTSTANDING!! The bathroom was very small yet satisfactory. The bed was fine. The air conditioner worked perfectly - and for the weather we were experiencing, we were grateful. No extra outlets.

The location was perfect for seeing San Marco, and centrally located on Venice Island. The hotel was a real gem in this very pricey city. Rates at $200 USD are considered very moderate for Venice, so I was not expecting much. What we experienced was a fabulous, well managed hotel, with lovely Italian decor, and charming helpful staff. The location could not have been more perfect. If arriving by plane, and want to arrive right at the hotel's back door (along the canal) then opt for a private water taxi. An extra expense, but well worth NOT having to cart your own luggage through the streets, (which is not far from the vaporetta stop), but it a little difficult to maneuver over the bridges with steps). Once you get the hang of getting around and familiarize yourself with Venice, you can save by taking the much less expensive vaporetta back to the airport-or train station. The breakfast room was small, but very functional since not all the guests were eating breakfast at the same time. We felt the offerings for breakfast were EXCELLENT. Very European with their quality meats and cheeses, but these were fresh and tasty, and the flaky croissants were delightful. There was fresh fruits and cereals and decadent pastries, so there is something there to please everyone. The coffee was quite good, and there was a choice of two different juices-orange and apple.

We were quoted 90 euros but we found a Canadian couple to share and got it down to 65 euros - well worth it. The ride into Venice was brilliant and the water taxi dropped us at the back entrance of the hotel. The Kette is a small hotel but very well presented and beautifully furnished. The staff - in particular, the front desk, were excellent - extremely couteous, efficient and very helpful - I would give them a 5 blob rating. The breakfast is as described by other reviewers - perfectly adequate in a smallish dining room but everyone seemed to get a seat and there was plenty to set you up for the day. The location is superb - just a couple of minutes from St Mark's Square. The only problem (for me) is that to get there, my wife and I had to walk past all the major designer shops - Gucci, Prada, Fendi, Valentino, Ferragamo etc; I was able to resist - she wasn't. Why not 5 blobs overall? Only because the room, while very well decorated and finished, was really small and the view from the windows was of a brick wall (Room 141). Did it ruin our enjoyment? Not in the slightest but that's what stopped us rating the Kette with a 5. Venice was absolutely magical and in 4 days, we barely scratched the surface.

The hotel appears to be newly decorated and with new carpeting throughout, so it is immaculate. There are two efficient lifts serving the five floors and though the hotel appeared busy, we rarely needed to wait for the lift. Our canal side room was rather small and had only limited storage. There was no chest of drawers, so it was necessary to live out of the suitcase. It was also rather warm for our taste, even though we kept the heating off during our stay. Contrary to some reports, we found the reception desk staff to be very polite, friendly and helpful. The Continental breakfasts were very good and the buffet was continually refreshed. The hotel does not have a restaurant but there is a wide selection in close proximity. We paid an average of 60Euros for dinner for two with a bottle of wine. The Al Falaciani Burreira, (San Marco 353) just off the corner of St Marks Square is friendly and unpretentious, The Tavernetta San Maurizio (San Marco 2619) is small and good but ask for a table with proper chairs. The benches are excrutiatingly uncomfortable! The Trattoria Di Fiore off the corner of Campo Stefano (San Marco 3461) provided the best food we found in Venice.

Other good points: bedroom was roomy, king size bed was firm but extremely comfy, the continental breakfast was above average and the checkout time of 12pm was appreciated. A few factors stopped me from giving this hotel a higher rating, though. Venice is freezing cold in winter, but the heating had not been turned on inside our room before we arrived at 11pm. We had to fall asleep in our chilly room with the heating on, meaning that we woke up in the early hours in a suffocatingly hot room! The next night was much better, as we heated the room for a couple of hours before bed. We also couldn't get the bathroom heating going on the first night, so this room was very cold until the heater was fixed the following morning. The hand held shower was set up only 10cm above the bathtub on the side, with no shower curtain etc, meaning you either had to sit uncomfortably in the bathtub or spray water all over the room to wash. The bathroom was also in the eaves, which meant that my 5'10\" hubby couldn't stand upright in most of the bathroom. And watch out for the bar snacks - we ate half a wrapped cake before we saw a bit had a bit of mould on it, although the hotel can't be blamed for this.

Use vaporetto line number 1 to go up and down grand canal start or end at san marco or piazza roma (you can walk to roma in 25mins stroll) This costs 5 euros each and is valid for travel up to one hour. 4. Gondolas cost 100 euros but with bartering will go down to 80 for 55 mins for 2 people.

This is the only cheap lunchtime snack in Venice. 7 If using a cafe remember cost doubles if you sit down. 8 Venice is very safe even in the quiet narrow streets. 9 the bar at hotel satunia just from the hotel is great, reasonable and barman very welcoming. 10 Dont be afraid to eat on grand canal near rialto bridge, would expect this to be expensive, but compares favourably with reastarants all over city, with not such a romantic setting 11 Enjoy!!!!!", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Great Neck, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat end to our honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "jen611", "ReviewID": "UR4353134", "Content": "I was surprised to read some of the recently posted bad reviews of this hotel, because my husband and I have nothing but good things to say!

Bed was lumpy and hard though. The hotel provides a compimentary trip to Murano to visit the glass making process first hand (you will, though, have to secure your own ride back to the hotel). The only negative of the hotel was that the front desk recommended a Gondola ride that was very misleading. We purchased the ticket at the hotel b/c we had asked around & the lowest price was $80 for 30 minutes (by ourselves). So when the hotel said that although we would share the gondola w/3 other people, for $70 we would have music & a serenade on a 45 min ride. What we were NOT aware of was that there would also be 8 other gondolas listening to the singer. The actual serenade took place on the first gondola and we where in the last one - making it almost impossible to hear him sing. To top it off, the gondola workers were arguing and talking loudly to each other - very annoying (takes away from the whole \"romantic\" thing).

When we arrived at our room (in the attic) we found the toilet seat half off and fixed it ourselves as no maintenance person was around to fix it. The bathroom curiously had an emergency pull cord in the bath space which went off although no one touched the cord. I guess at least it worked as we had a phone call from reception saying that it had 'gone off' although we were trying to get to sleep! Breakfast was very continental German in type of food and presentation. Very un-inspiring for a start to the day, so most days I didn't bother. The coffee was thick and overbrewed. Prior to staying here I had stayed at other hotels in Italy during this 2 week touring holiday and quite frankly some of the 2 star rated ones were better. A friend of ours stayed in a lower grade hotel (there was no more room at the inn) and had far superior accommodation including a plasma screen with 40 odd channels including BBC world compared with our Italian only 4 tuned channels CRT TV which belongs in a science museum. Room was fitted out with basic furniture and no-where near enough storage space for two people, so we had to keep most of our clothes in the suitcases. That being, we travelled very lightly with only one small suitcase and one piece of hand-luggage each! The hotel bar was about as basic as one could possible get, no hot chocolate, a stock of 2 bottles of Italian beer, dreadful coffee and tea etc. very very poor. On the other hand the reception rooms on the ground floor were comfortable and well furnished. The staff were generally polite and did efficiently order us a water taxi back to the airport when we left as we had an early flight. Rooms ought to be checked for full functionality at every change-over. One really shouldn't have to fix the bedside light before getting into bed. View from room, what view?!? Air conditioning is almost non-existant which left the room far too hot at all times and no way were we going to have the windows open because of mosquito's etc. The cleaning staff did manage to leave the windows open and we spent a good hour when we got back at night tracking down all the mosquito's!
