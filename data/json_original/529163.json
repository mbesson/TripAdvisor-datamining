The reservation had been mismarked in the booking and they only had one of the two rooms requested. They said they only had one room for the two couples and \"saved\" us by showing us to an apartment down the way and they would have our rooms ready the next day. None of their promises were kept. We had to share a bathroom and sleep on a pull out sofa while the other couple had a full size bed. The breakfast consisted of meats, cheese, milk and yogurt that had not been on ice and was very warm and I thought unhealthy at that point, so a roll with jelly is what is left on the breakfast buffet. The canal is noisy in the AM. They have no elevator or AC, but they did have black mold and some sort of centipedes in the room. They had offered us a better price for our misunderstanding and then on check-out said there was no such arrangement and we had to argue for the corrected pricing. We heard other guests saying they had a similar problem and were checking out because the hotel had promised this elderly couple a first floor room, but put them on the fourth floor and she has a heart condition and can not walk stairs. Her 83 year old husband had to take the luggage up himself. We had a great time in Venice regardless, but I would say to never stay at this place!!

Upon arrival, the staff was waiting for us (which was awesome!) and we were brought to our cozy room where we ditched our bags and got immediately out on the town. As it turns out we were right above the restaurant so when we got in at the end of the night we thought we were going to be up all night from the noise. Although we were conscious of the goings-on below us (really could only be heard out the window) it didn't keep us from sleeping and I am a LIGHT sleeper. Mind you this was in October and we had the window shut. Not sure in summer it would be so quiet from our room - 105. Our favorite things were that the breakfast was awesome, the staff was so helpful and kind and the location was amazing! Our least favorite was probably the shower size (small) and the location above the restaurant. Speaking of the restaurant, the food was great, the staff once again was amazing, and the home-spun authenticity feeling of the place was really quite nice. My only recommendation for the restaurant is that you need to be REALLLLLLY clear on what you order and to not eat ANYTHING that they bring to you that you didn't order, unless you are okay being charged for it. We didn't order the following and were charged for them since we consumed them when they brought them thinking that they might be being nice to us (only a few days before in Montelcino the waiter brought items to us and didn't charge us). Here are the items we didn't order: our appetizer, lemon liquor drinks, fried fish after our main course and two desserts. Why did we not complain? Well, we just had such a nice time trying these unusual fish items that we would never have tried otherwise and had such a nice experience (and my feet hurt less after all of the liquor) that we decided not to care. If you care then be sure to ask when these non-ordered items are brought to you. You should ask \"is this complimentary?\" (or whatever that is in Italian), or just refuse them all together.

Breathtaking\u201d", "Author": "Alison G", "ReviewID": "UR37492776", "Content": "My husband and i have just returned from a long weekend in Venice. We travelled from Shannon with Ryanair and flew into Treviso airport just outside Venice. The transfers were smooth and effortless, We caught the Airport shuttle which leaves after each ryanair flight arrival and got off at the last stop which was Pizzale Roma Bus Terminal, it was then just a short walk accross the bus park to catch the No 2 Vaparetto { water bus in italian} down the grand Canal to the Rialto Bridge.Bus and Vaparetto tickets can be purchased in advance in the arrival hall at the airport, we purchased 36 hour vaparetto tickets which mean you can take as my trips on the water bus as you like, they cost 18 euro each which is brillant as 1 single trip costs 10 euro! Print the map from the hotels website and you will find the hotel without any problems, like we did. We were very hungry as we had a 0400am start for the airport and arrived at the Rialto Bridge approx 1100am, we deceided to have lunch, which was very reasonable a large Slice of Veggie Pizza, a bottle of cold water and a Yummy Lemon Italian Gelato {Shave Ice} for less than 10 euro each! It takes less than 5 mins to walk to hotel from the Rialto Bridge and we found it without any problems, We were checked in straight away and show to our room by the friendly staff, We had the blue and gold room and it is exactly as pictured on the website. Our windows had old fashioned wooden shutters and the view of the canal below with gondala's and singing gondaliers was breath taking! The bed was very comfy and we slept for 2 hours that afternoon before heading off and taking in the sights of Venice. The streets of venice in July were buzzing with tourists,{which normally i do not like!} but it didnt bother me it really added to the venetian experiance. Its was very warm 30 degrees, and every took advantage by sitting along the river in San Marco having there picnic lunch or Gelato to cool down. You cannot visit venice and not take a Gondala ride, although they are very expensive at 80 euro for a 20 min ride, they are actually worth every penny. We both thoroughly enjoyed the experiance! We boarded our gondala just outside our hotel, the gondalier is actually sort of a tour guide and filled us in on the history of Venice, showing us the home of famous venetian residents from the past like Casanova and Marco Polo, and famous buildings before bringing us down the grand Canal and back to our hotel. The streets around the hotel are very reasonable and have 3 couse options for 18-20 euro per person which again for venice is very reasonable. Any one taking a long break in Venice and wanting to get out of the city should visit the Lido, its a Vaparetto ride from the Rialto bridge and in approx 45 mins can have you at the beach, which wasnt crowded at all, you can also hire wooden beach huts, loungers and umbrellas. Its worth it for the ferry ride alone, its breathtaking on the journey back to venice. Overall i would rate venice as a must see, i have been put off the past by people saying its expensive, smelly and dirty! I can assure you it is none of that, its water was a beautiful blueish green colour and even though the weather was really hot, there was no sewerage smell anywhere in the city, i would be the first to say if it stunk! Meals are reasonable and so are drinks most place's. If you are eating at Hotel Danieli terrace or Cafe Florian in San Marco, they are obviously not cheap based on there locations and views. Dont miss having a \"Bellini\" in venice its a mixture of Peach juice and champagne and was invented in Harry Bar { vaparetto stop San Marco}. Its yummy! Just go, you will have a wonderful time. I actually had to rub my eyes, upon first sight of beautiful venice from the vaparetto on the grand canal, i though i was dreaming.

The location is also unbeatable, right smack in the middle of San Marco, a minutes walk away from both the Rialto bridge and the world famous St. Marks Square.

The service back to the airport leaves 3 minutes pass the hour until 4pm. (Check the timetable, if not frequent Aqualina ferries run to and from San Macro and the airport). The staff are friendly and helpful. (The warnings on when the high tides were due were very welcome). The room was a good size and well maintained. Breakfast comprised of pastries, cereal, juice and freshly brewed coffee. The hotel is well-located. St Marks Square is a 5 minutes away with the Basilica di San Marco and Palazzo Ducale, then stop for a bellini at Harry's Bar or a coffee on the square. (Caffe Florian closed till Dec 18th, if memory serves me correctly). If you cross the Rialto Bridge and you can be at the Accademia Gallery or the excellent Peggy Guggenheim Collection in 10 minutes. Another art gallery definitely worth a visit is Palazzo Grassi. You can easily walk there in 10 minutes from the hotel, or just hop on a water bus and get off at San Samuele.

It's a 5 minute walk from the Rialto Bridge (and the closest vaporetto stop) from the north and 3 minutes to San Marco to the south, although the first time finding it was impossible until a fine, friendly local gentleman pointed us in the right direction. There is also great shopping (my wife found that) and dining very close by. The younger man (owner's son?) who was there during the day was helpful, and spoke pretty good broken English. Our room overlooked a canal, and had a balcony that you could go out on. The Bad: OK, I saw this was rated one star by the \"experts\" but fared much better with the users here, so that made my decision to try it. While I think the hotel deserves more than one star, there were some problems. First, the upkeep isn't so good, as evidenced by dirty-looking floor tile, a cracked shower head, mis-matching lightbulbs in outdated glass fixtures in the bathroom, a non-working remote control for the (I kid you not) 13 inch TV that was mounted near the ceiling ( a 12 foot ceiling), etc. Oh, and one final bad thing - we returned at 10:45 from grabbing breakfast on the date of checkout, and found an irate owner (not very personable) yelling at us that checkout was 10:30 and we needed to get out as there was someone waiting for the room. Problem was, no one told us of this oddly early checkout time, so it was a little nervy of him to take that tact with us. Still, they stowed our luggage for the rest of the day until we needed to depart, so other than his abrasiveness, didn't cause much of a problem. Now, I'm not one to sink a hotel because of the TV (this WAS a vacation, after all) or an owner who was rude to us, but I think realistically this hotel should rate a 2-star rating, and possibly a 2+ or 3- because of its location.", "Date": "September 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cClean room, great location\u201d", "Author": "MistaMusc", "ReviewID": "UR8382565", "Content": "Al Gazzettino turned out to be a great find.
