They were amazing and came complete with a great view of the city as well as a projection screen located on the back wall of the roof top. The pool and other facilities looked great but we once again didn't have time to enjoy them. We woke up to a complimentary newspaper and buffet breakfast which was delicious.

The staff seemed pleasant and the rooms/amenities were very much up to par. However, during my first night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay, I awoke sometime shortly before dawn with an extreme itching sensation all over my body. Having already had bed bugs once ten years before, I was justifiably paranoid and immediately jumped out of bed. However, still in a sleep-induced daze, when I did not immediately find anything, I resigned to catch another quick hour of sleep before my wake up call. I did not begin to notice any bites until sometime just after breakfast when we were heading to the office. After about a half day of suffering through discomfort, I was forced to step out of meetings to see a doctor. Unbuttoning my shirt, both the doctor and I were shocked to see literally hundreds bites all over my arms and torso. What was worse was that I was suffering a moderate to severe allergic reaction and had large protruding welts all over my body. Following the doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orders, I picked up some antihistamine and garbage bags before catching a cab to The Grand. I went straight up to my room, packed up and threw my suitcase and clothing into a big garbage bag. I went down to the front desk and informed them that I had contracted bed bugs from their room and requested to be moved to another. After trying to convince me that this had never occurred before, they sent me back to my bed bug infested room with a maid who was going to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confirm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd based on her qualifications whether or not there were bed bugs present. Equipped with a large can of Raid, the maid led me back up to my room. After showing her some very small blood streaks on the headboard and what looked like the remnants of a bed bug shell, the maid denied that bed bugs could have anything to do with the situation. She then asked to see the bites and, when I showed her, she exclaimed that I was mistaken and that I was only having an allergic reaction. To this I replied that she was correct and that the reaction was to bed bugs as confirmed by my visit to the doctor. Speaking with the supervisor on duty (at this point I still had not spoken with the manager), I was informed that, although bed bugs in their hotel was a very unlikely scenario, they would be happy to move me to the one available suite in the hotel. Upon first glance, the penthouse suite seemed like a nice upgrade and, although I still felt unresolved with the situation, thought that at least the hotel was attempting to make up for it in one way or another. It was only once I had settled in that I had noticed tiny little black specks all over the hardwood floor. Looking at my feet, I was horrified to see dozens of tiny little black flies encrusted in the bottoms of my socks. Looking around the room, I saw what my colleague later claimed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153piles of flies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd littering the entire room. There were hundreds, if not thousands, of tiny dead little black flies all over the suite. I even found some on my bed that were still twitching, evidence that the room had recently been fumigated. However, at this point, I was dead tired and rather than having another ridiculous debate with the staff, I cleared the top blanket of flies off my bed and went to sleep. The next day, I spoke with the on-site supervisor again, explained the new problem and said I was unsatisfied with the service and conditions of the hotel. I politely requested that my medical and dry-cleaning bills be reimbursed even if I was unable to have the charge for my two nights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stay waived. To this the supervisor explained that this was not the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem and that they would not be reimbursing me, nor would they be waiving the charge for my stay. At the end of the day, I am not a person who complains a lot. If I get served the wrong pizza at a restaurant, I usually just eat it so that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to waste and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the server feel bad. I also understand that bed bugs (and potentially other infestations) are a rampant problem in major metropolitan cities such as Toronto and can understand the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to admit to any history of issues. But, as a customer, I have honestly never been treated so poorly and, the fact that I was forced to incur a number of charges that were no way attributable to negligence on my part, just seems plain old wrong (in addition to the dry-cleaning and doctor bills, I ended up having to discard my luggage, costing me hundreds of dollars). For these reasons, I feel it is important to share my story.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakville, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cFeeling Grand at the Grand\u201d", "Author": "JohnAqui", "ReviewID": "UR121224320", "Content": "What a wonderful place, The staff are very attentive and will make sure you will not want for anything.

We had another couple come with us and we have told them about this hotel many times and they wanted to experience it as well. First of all the hotel is beautiful and very classy with doormen at the front. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are always so nice.The king size beds were so comfortable and luxurious with the duvet and bedding. Because we have been several times they ugraded us and if you could have seen our faces when we walked in the room- it was the most amazing room I have ever seen with 25 foot high ceilings in the main room and then stairs up to the bedroom.They also left us a really nice welcome gift of shortbread and nuts etc. which was a lovely bonus. The pool in the hotel is saltwater and so beautiful. We spent a lot of time in the pool. There are bathrobes provided and an abundance of towels. You dont ever have to worry there arent enough. We chose the dinner package and I can tell you that the dinner in the Citrus Restaurant was completely First Class- the service, the staff, the presentation and the taste- again 5*****. After dinner the four of us went up to the roof top (outdoors on the 19th floor)overlooking the city and spent time in one of the two hot tubs up there. There is nothing more relaxing than sitting in the hot tub and enjoying the light show of the city that is Toronto. We make sure that we get to this hotel at least once a year and our friends were so impressed with the quality and servie that they are going to make it a yearly trip as well.

I wanted to stay someplace close to my conference but not in the middle of the rush. I had read reviews that the neighborhood was a bit sketchy. I did find the neighborhood less than desirable but never felt unsafe walking, even alone. I had a two bedroom suite since there were of us traveling. The rooms were a good size. The beds were comfortable and the comforters were quite warm. The living area was a good size for four of us but could have used an extra chair. Housekeeping was very accommodating. When someone was resting in one room, they were very willing to clean the rest of the suite and not bother the person resting. Front desk staff was always friendly and the restaurant staff took great care of my family. My mother walks with a cane and they were always helpful to her, bringing her coffee so that she would not have to get up to the buffet. Extra kudos go to the bellhops/valets. They were always friendly and had a smile for us when we arrived. I asked if they could arrange for a cab to the CN tower for my family while I was at my conference, and they offered to drop them off in the hotel shuttle. I have nothing but great things to say about the staff at the hotel. The workout facilities were larger than most hotels I have been in. The rooftop hot tubs would be great in warmer weather. The views were very nice. The lower level hot tub and salt water pool were a highlight for the mom and aunt. They would spend over an hour every night relaxing. The pool was always warm and most of the time we had the entire place to ourselves except for the occasional new guest coming in to see it. The changing rooms had lockers you could rent for $1. They also had showers and towels as well as a sauna. They facilities were always very clean. The restaurant offered a great breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, sausage and potatoes as well as fresh fruit, pastries, assorted juices and cereals. We had dinner at the restaurant one evening and it was delicious. We all loved our dinners and they offered a good selection of wines. WIfi was available for free in the entire hotel and reception was good even in our room way at the end of the hallway and in the pool area.

This was a business trip & conference and I have to say that the hotel did a very nice job of accomodating us. They provided a decent room price and included a very nice continental breakfast in the price. From what I understand, the Grand went above and beyond in negotiating with the committee putting on the conference to come to a price point that would allow the various attendees to come from around the world to partake. The rooms were nicely appointed, modern, comfortable and clean. The Fitness Center was well beyond that of many other hotels I have stayed at and an individual is actually able to enjoy a good workout.The pool and hot tubs offered a soothing respite and the location is walking distance from shopping and entertainment. Another nice little perk is the free wifi. Believe it or not, I tend to sometimes choose my hotels based on this one little item. My rationale? I simply hate being nickel and dimed to death and appreciate it when a hotel finally realizes this :) so I tend to reward them with my business and referral. Something else I took notice of was room service. Room service prices were exactly the same as those in their restaurant. No ridiculous 15% surcharge or other stupidity. I even noticed that when they made their delivery, the server wasn't hoving over me to sign the bill. He simply left it with me and asked that I set it outside with the tray when done. I tipped him more as a result. My only negative comment would be that I felt the hotel menu was overpriced for it's offerings.

The line up appeared significant but we moved forward quickly and additional staff appeared to help but were un-necessary. Check in staff was attentive and efficient. Our room was attractive and spotless. It was generously appointed with an abundance of towels and an etra blanket in the closet. The robes were a nice touch. We really appreciated the attractive dark flooring which was a pleasant change from the usual, often questionable dusty, carpets of most hotels and also that our 9th floor window opened!(just enough for fresh air but NOT a safety concern. I was concerned that there would be sound transfer without carpet but we heard 'nary a peep' from the hallway, perhaps because it is heavily carpeted. The roof top hot tubs were lovely after dark! They wee nice and warm and the jets subtle but soothing. A minor complaint was the TV projected on the wall behind - personally I'd of preferred our quiet conversation or perhaps Jazz. The sound was low but it was an mild annoyance and was almost impossible to see due to the floor light to one side. Do bring towels though, as there are none - or weren't the night we were there and be aware that when you step out of the elevator into a tiny little glass foyer it is quite dark and takes a minute to get your night eyes. We took advantage of the salt water pool the next morning - LOVELY! It was warmer than a public pool, but not oppresive, large enough for a few lengths before breakfast. There was also another hot tub and sadly the jets were lackluster but the water was good and hot. The change room and pool area was generously supplied with towels. The change facilities have an extractor so you can spin your bathing suit and not have to worry about packing a drippy suit.

I had booked online several weeks in advance but two days prior to our arrival I checked online and noted a better deal for an upgraded room. I called the hotel, quoted my reservation and the person I spoke to changed our reservation to the bigger room and better rate. Upon our arrival, I noted as I was signing in that we were registered in our original room. I told the clerk this and she said we don't have any record of this, nor do we have any larger rooms. To her that was the end of story. I argued back that I had called and she finally got the manager, after returning together, they only offered a larger room upgrade but at an additional cost of $50 per night. They basically made me feel that I was misrepresenting the truth about my previous call. Finally with further details from me, they found my call in the system but the person who served me did not make the change. In the end, htey bumped someone else from the suite I had booked. I was happy with the end result but not happy with the feeling that the customer is always correct. The junior suite had a separate room for the king bed but there was no room to move around in it. There was also a double pull out couch. it was comfortable enough for the 4 four of us. The hotel is showing its age from scratches and at times not clean in some areas. The view from the rooftop was amazing but I would caution anyone who goes up with family, after 8pm, it becomes more of a party area. both nights there were groups drinking openly their beer and on the second night there was even smoking in the hot tub on the rooftop. We finally decided it was not appropriate for us to be there. The breakfast was hot and had a good variety. The only thing that we did not like is the servers coming around putting a cheque chit on your table for a tip.

It was chosen primarily for its proximity to the venue of the event. I arrived by taxi and was greeted by a bellman who insisted on assisting me with my one small suitcase. The red carpet on the exterior stairs needs replacing, but otherwise the hotel presents a good first impression. The lobby is small but elegant (decorated in a 1990s take on French opulence), and since no one else was there I was checked in quickly. One of the nicest aspects of the hotel are its hallways (not something usually worth mentioning); they are plush, elegantly lit and furnished-- totally unexpected. The room itself (on the 17th floor) was a junior suite of sorts: walk in to a small living room area with small sofa, table and LCD televsion; pass through a galley kitchenette with wet bar; continue on to a small bedroom with another television, desk and armchair. The floor to ceiling windows afforded terrific views of downtown and Lake Ontario (ask for an odd numbered room for this view). A very small bathroom is directly off the bedroom. In fact, with a good stretch you could almost wash your hands from the bed! Still, there were good toiletry products and a small robe and good quality towels. There was some water damage/rot near the baseboards, however, and the walls could use a repainting due to scuff marks. Because the floors are a laminate ressembling a dark finish wood, they show dirt very easily. It was obvious that housekeeping needed to do a more thorough job near baseboards. Light switches as well were a little grimy, and like the bathroom walls in the bedroom area could use a repainting. The soft goods too (sofa and chairs) could also use updating (not really worn or soiled, just not very attractive). The hot tubs on the roof are a terrific idea, but there were children in them both times I went to investigate, so I took a pass (similar experience with the pool in the lower level). Breakfast the next morning was included. The buffet offered a reasonable selection of fruits, cereals, pastries and some hot items. Cappuccino was an extra $3.50-- very reasonable and of good quality. Service was very good. After checking out I asked the bellman to call me a cab, but instead he offered to take me to the train station in the hotel shuttle. This was an unexpected courtesy, and as it was complimentary I gave him a generous tip. Overall this was a pleasant stay, but I don't think I would return unless I had business in the area.

There is a large tile literally falling off the wall in the shower; 5. There was no bedding on the pull-out couch on which my son was to sleep. In fact, the mattress was still covered in the manufacturers plastic. Nice to know it was new at least. Housekeeping did bring bedding to the room as requested, they simply handed it to us and we had to make the bed ourselves; 6. I gave my AEROPLAN card at check-in, but it was not processed. 7.

I had booked the hotel a few months back as we were in Toronto attending a wedding. I had phoned 2 days prior to arrival to see what the protocol was with regards to having an extra adult in the room. At which time, I was told that it would be an extra $30 a night. No problem! I was quoted $238 a night (travel agent rate) for 4 adults. Upon arrival I was advised that due to the extra 3 guests in my room, my rate would now be $319...WHAT? I had booked for 4 adults, so an extra $30 a night does not equal $319 a night. I was mad!! I attempted to move to the Marriott or the Hyatt, but could not get two consecutive nights and we really wanted to stay with the wedding party! So we sucked it up! At the time that I made the booking I also requested a play pen for my 4 month old son. ANd was told at the time of check in that it was in my room. Nope... not there. I made 4 calls to have it delivered and then went out with our friends that evening, only to return to no play pen. However the roll out bed that I had requested was there...big surprise they were charging me $15 a night for that! I called to see what happend and was told that I was calling too late and there was none left. What? I requested in 6 months ago. I know that requests are not guarnteed, but all day they had been telling me that it was on the way up. The next day did not get any better, at 2 pm we had to call and ask if our room was going to get cleaned. They said that they were short staffed, which was no big deal...we did not really need a huge cleaning, but required towels. They said that we would get some soon...we ended up going outside and taking some off the cart when no one showed up. And we had a wedding that we were getting ready for. Got the play today, so that was good! The room had a kitchenette in it, but no dish soap or kettle. When I requested a kettle for sterilizing my sons bottles they told me to use the coffee pot...uck!! I did get a pot from a friend in another room. Last day, we got up and went to the Blue Jays game, returning to our room at 5pm, to find that it still had not been cleaned. Called down and asked if we could get it cleaned...needless to say again not cleaned! We decided to hit the pool, and we could get towels from there, so that we could shower later. Got to the pool, no towels. I called up before we got in the pool and asked if we could get some towels and were told that there were some on the way down. Well, after 30 mins of swimming with a 5 month old...still no towels. So I called up and asked again, advising that we had a cranky 5 months old, and stated that I would come up and get them if need be. I was told that they were coming immediately. About 10 mins later, another man that was in the pool with us phoned up, and there was no answer for about 5 minutes. He called it again, no answer. My mom finally went up there and they told her that there was a girl on her way down with the towels and refused to give one to my mom for my son! Went to left the hotel there was about 50 people in line checking out, so I made it known that my say was less the comfortable and nothing but an incnvience to not only my family but many other people were unsatisfied with the service from the wedding. I made attempts to get my money back for the mis-quote to which they denied and refused to acknowledge that the service was horrible. They told me that at my next stay I would receive Friends/Family rate...are you kidding, I would never stay here again! You are in the service industry...that is your job!

My husband and I are extremely particular about our hotel accommodations. We never stay anywhere unless I see the room first. Honestly, the hotel does not look like much on the outside but is very beautiful on the inside. The first thing I fell in love with in our room was the hard wood floor. No smelly stained carpet! This was a definite bonus. We stayed one night and also visited the trendy Pantages Hotel and the ultra ritzy Hazelton. I absolutely prefer the Grand Hotel because of the overall package and we checked backed into their hotel for another two nights. However, if we were ever in Toronto again and the Grand was full, I would want to try a night at Pantages. Keep in mind, they only offer a continental breakfast. The Grand is amazingly affordable and half the price of the Hazelton. The Hazelton would be my third choice. Very expensive but fantastic location. The service at the Grand is outstanding, the FULL breakfast was absolutely delicious and I enjoyed listening to house/club music in the restaurant. We noticed many places in Toronto play house music. Love it! The fitness center at the Grand is one of the largest I've seen in any hotel. One of the greatest things about the hotel is the rooftop. It had a very large gazebo, 2 hot tubs and lots of places to sit and eat. Videos are also shown on the wall at night. My husband and I bought some food from Whole Foods and ate it on the roof while watching a movie from his laptop. Make sure you get up there in time to watch the sun go down. Amazing! Like most hotels, you're bound to find something wrong but if you do, do not hesitate to notify the front desk at the Grand. If you're still not satisfied, make sure you notify the Guest Relations Manager, Roberta Ward. She is so friendly and really seems to enjoy her job.

Pulled up to valet parking and there was not only no valet but also no bellhop available; had to climb stairs and trek all the way to front desk to find this out. They did round up a maintenance man to help us with our luggage and told us to leave our car until someone could park it. This treatment upon arrival was the first clue that the Grand Hotel was more 'show' than anything. Visually stunning no doubt, the indoor pool and rooftop terrace with hot tubs as well as room decor were all pleasing to the eye. The pool was salt water but over-heated so as not to be at all refreshing. Smokers were having a field day on the roof top, including smoking (and not just cigarettes) in the hot tubs; doesn't lend itself to clean conditions in the water or while you are barefoot on the decktop. Our room was just plain dirty; look closely at the walls and baseboards especially in the bathrooms and the lack of thorough cleaning was all too evident. Our bathtub featured a showerhead that was like a roulette wheel; three directional jets with waterpressure so low that only one would actually shoot out any water at a time. I have long hair and it took 20 minutes to wash and condition it as rinsing was a (--). Room boasts free WIFI for the business traveller however, after about 20 minutes of pure frustration trying to connect, I called the front desk only to be told that the further your room is from the router the less the chance you can connect. They let me put a $15 deposit on a cable and use it to connect my laptop stationary style via a room outlet. The complimentary breakfast was excellent, nice restaurant with quick and easy service to get you fed in the mornings. When it was time to check out we learned that the bellman is also the valet and the shuttle driver; we could either wait 20mins for him to return, or we could hump our own luggage and retrieve our own car. Seeing as we paid $28 a day for the \"convenience\" (lol) of valet, we decided to wait. The final 'nail' in this hoteI's 'coffin' if you are travelling by car is the location, add an extra 30 minutes to access any major route from here due to traffic snarls that just don't quit!

If you book a king-sized bed as advertised on hotels.com and which you will pay a higher rate for you may be bitterly disappointed. We did exactly that, ignoring the Hilton across the road, because we thought the Grand looked nicer, and when we got to our suite we found what was effectively a English sized double bed. When we took it up with the reception staff we were told that on our booking it said that they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guarantee the preferences that people choose. Hold on a minute we paid extra for a king-sized bed! No we were told we had paid extra for the junior suite and the king sized bed was a preference not part of the booking. Also, we were told that some of the junior suites actually have queen sized beds, and even that other guests have previously complained about the king size beds not being that big. Anyway, we looked up our booking on the free internet computer available in the lobby (a nice feature which hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been available in many of the other hotels we stayed in, in Canada) and there was no mention of the hotel not being able to guarantee the king size bed. We had stayed in 7 hotels during our trip and paid extra for king size and in every other hotel got a king size bed. Why does the Grand think it can be different? We were given all sorts of excuses by the reception staff who frankly came across as patronising and to be honest I think they thought we were a lower class of customer because we had booked online and paid less money for the room. Effectively the hotel is mis-advertising its rooms on hotels.com. We were even told that it was Expedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault for wrongly guaranteeing the bed! But it is the Grand that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s puts the information up there. These beds are double beds and they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be charging extra for them and advertising them as kings. In the end we were told that the manager wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in until Monday (that old one) and that the staff who were there (who were supervisors) had no authority to do anything about the issue.

It took us about an hour backwards and forwards checking the internet, speaking to 2 of the receptionists etc etc. In the end we took the names of the 2 members of staff and said we would be explaining all this in a report to their manager and would be quoting their names. Amazingly within about 60 seconds the phone rang and they explained that they had had a cancellation and that one of the king sized beds was now available!!!! And by the way the view from this room was much nicer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c towards downtown as advertised on the hotel website and not overlooking the lap-dancing club on the other side of the block. However, the bed in the room still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like a king sized bed to us although it was much bigger than the other room. Overall, I would like to say that the hotel is really lovely, very clean and some amazing features such as the swimming pool, the reception area and the Jacuzzis on the top floor with a cinema screen and views of the city (I kid you not!). However, we were really not happy about having to complain and not being dealt with appropriately. Other points about the hotel are that it borders on a really dodgy neighbourhood one side however, it is just a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw from Yonge-Dundas square which is a great place to visit. The bathrooms in our suites were very small but you do get a kitchenette with fridge etc so you can buy goodies from local stores. The breakfast was one of the best we got in Canada and included in the price but, the breakfast area wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really big enough for the number of residents so quite chaotic.

Long version and sorry if i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m long winded: My boyfriend, Derek, had booked the jacuzzi suite at the grand hotel on November 1st, 2008 apparently with the plans of getting engaged (A surprise to me obviously).His idea was to propose in the hot-tub with a glass of wine, while overlooking the city. However, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn out that way. Not even close. After driving an hour, we arrived at the hotel around 330pm only to be told that the suite was not available and they had put us in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgraded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room instead. It was basically just a larger room, with the bedroom in a loft area, with holes in the walls and a window view of the brick wall next door. Not even remotely romantic. Derek asked why he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t called in the morning so we could make alternative plans and received no response, except that we would also get private access to the jacuzzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the rooftop after hours, which is 1230 AM, plus the outdoor temperature was at the freezing mark! While I was getting my massage (which was great), Derek went down to the front desk a couple of times to explain the situation again (when i wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t around) and was told a manager would call the room. The phone never rang. Derek, in the meantime, called a number of other hotels ..but since it was after 5pm on a Saturday, they were all booked. Upon my return, we went for dinner and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where derek decided to propose instead. Of course it had a happy ending, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close to the private, intimate and romantic evening he had planned for months. I, of course, learned of the complete disaster afterwards. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the rooftop jacuzzi and merely returned to the hotel and went to bed. You would think if a hotel knew you were using their establishment to get engaged, it would do EVERYTHING it could to make sure your plan came to fruition. I guess not at the grand. I decided to write the hotel about our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153once in a lifetime experience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that was ruined and received a call from one of the so-called managers. She kindly offered a complimentary stay and dinner for derek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday a month later. We, instead, asked for our money back. The hotel refused and only agreed to drop the room rate down to 200 dollars plus tax and the massage. I also wrote the hotel general manager, but never received a response. Derek and I decided to take the complimentary stay to at least see what we were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supposed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to have for our engagement, but of course, ONLY if it was for the jacuzzi suite. I called the front desk 3-4 days prior to the event to confirm the reservation, after several minutes, the girl told me she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it...under my name, dereks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 name OR the confirmation number I was given by management. I told her I only had 3 minutes left before I had to return to work, but she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hang on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and put me on hold..then never came back in time, so I had to hang up. I called back and miraculously they found the reservation, but it was NOT the jacuzzi suite...just a basic room. Apparently, the jacuzzi suite was again unvailable and booked by someone else! I explained to the front desk that the room was the ENTIRE point of our trip, that our engagement was ruined, we were supposed to be notified etc.. etc... I wrote the manager again explaining the second screw up and she called me the next morning to IMMEDIATELY start browbeating me for not calling or emailing HER to confirm the reservation. I asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that what the front desk is supposed to do? Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it their job?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At this point, she accused me of yelling and screaming at the staff. I informed her that I actually work in a newsroom with live microphones about five feet away and that is completely IMPOSSIBLE! Shocking behaviour from a member of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153management\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd team. The manager said that the jacuzzi suite was not guaranteed until the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153day of\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the reservation, and they would not just merely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153book\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the suite for us...ONLY if someone else didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book it already. What????? So basically, they had ruined my engagement and now derek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday plans as well. The manager also accused me of slamming down and hanging up the phone on her answering machine..so I had to inform her that it was a portable phone and once again, it was impossible! This is just an example of the sheer ridiculousness of this hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost laughable. The manager immediately went on the attack when calling me over the second reservation, continued to yell and talk over me to the point that it quickly became a shouting match of personal attacks, verbal abuse and unprofessional comments. She also tried to chastise me for calling to confirm the reservation while i was on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd time at work. Pardon?! She basically said that Derek should have just proposed on the freezing rooftop at 1230am! I got off the phone feeling like I had been in a bar fight. Prior to working for the media, I worked in the hospitality industry for about a decade and i have never encountered such a complete lack of professionalism and basic customer courtesy. The grand hotel has none. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even practice the most basic business principle of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if you make a mistake, do everything you can to fix it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ESPECIALLY, if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an engagement. I think its a no-brainer that if we were supposed to get the jacuzzi suite for our engagement night, then yes, we should either get our money back or get the room complimentary at a future date. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve received neither. Just a bill, a whole lot of tears, nasty phone calls/emails and sleepless nights. It is soooo painfully obvious the management and staff have NO idea what they're doing. It's sad really. My engagement is a night i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll NEVER get back and although i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to marry the man of my dreams, i will NEVER forget what the grand hotel has done or has NOT done to make it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd memorable event in my life. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s painfully obvious the hotel is in DESPERATE need of money...if it is willing to endure so much bad publicity over this situation just for 200 dollars. Wow. *Update*-Two days prior to Derek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday the general manager e-mailed me that our original stay will be refunded, as it SHOULD have been a MONTH ago and that she was cancelling the complimentary stay. So, due to their complete lack of customer service or business sense, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to endure TWO special occasions being totally ruined . OH, and we have YET to ever receive an apology. ***We were able to make a reservation for the jacuzzi suite at the Toronto Sheraton hotel, as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153second chance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd engagement night and for derek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s b-day..and it was WONDERFUL! We were even given a compimentary bottle of champagne to enjoy in our private jacuzzi. The room was gorgeous, buffet breakfast was fantastic and service...top notch. Plus, it was less money...so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d highly recommend the Sheraton instead. It knows how to run a business.**** On a final note: I hope the 200 dollars was worth all this stress to the Grand Hotel.

There were almost 50 people from the wedding had stayed there over the weekend. The night we arrived, I checked in and found that the key I was given did not open the underground parking. After multiple attempts, I was forced to call the front desk to open the underground parking. Once opened, I proceeded under to have the chain break (my brother was told this from the front desk) and slam down on my hood. A fellow from maintenance came about about 20 minutes later, and could not get the garage door open and told me to park in the visitors parking for the night and that I could use the back door to get in the hotel as I had all my luggage with 3 small girls, only to have the fellow close and lock the back door forcing me to walk around the front. To make a long story short, I am still fighting with them for the damage, in which they are blaming me stating this has never happened before and that I went through the garage before the door went up and broke their garage door. I informed them that I have multiple witnesses and still, they want to blame me. I have a brand new family vehicle that was leased this past January.

Another \"pass the buck\"!

Sadly, none of these suggestions are ever addressed, so I come to Trip Advisor with a few words to the wise. In short, here is a hotel packed with amenities, offering rooms at lesser rates than the chain hotels in Toronto. The catch is: it's located in a section of the city rife with panhandlers (as it's just up Jarvis St from the soup kitchen) and despite some great features (which I'll go into below) poor management keeps this hotel from being a standout. First the good: free breakfast buffet (limited hours), indoor swimming pool, sauna, rooftop hot tubs, free wi-fi throughout the hotel, in-room coffee, 2 DVD players and plasma screens per room (at least), hardwood floors in the rooms, in room safes large enough for 15\" laptops, daily maid service, terrific restaurant with lovely terrace (heated on cold nights) and non-smoking areas throughout. The room pillows are soft and comfy. The hotel is located three long blocks from the Eaton Centre, a mega-mall with everything including an Apple Store. Now the not-so-good: the healthy breakfast offerings are spotty: fruit consists of a bowl of melon and cataloupe (no fruit, no bananas) with no sneeze guard. Healthy cereal offerings are inconsistent. When breakfast hours end (10am), coffee canisters are not replenished. In-Room coffee replenishment is equally inconsistent. Half the rooms have torn window screens, demanding use of the in-room air conditioner which is powerful, and is aimed right at the bed and work desk, so if you are susceptible to drafts, be sure to request a room with a screen that doesn't have gaping holes in it to let in all the mosquitos, bees and other native insects. More not so good: in this time of energy conservation, the hotel keeps the hallways and indoor portion of the restaurant about 50 degrees fahrenheit. I always eat outside, even if it's raining, as it's just too uncomfortably cold in the interior common areas. There are usually doormen at the main entrance, but they rarely open the non-automatic doors for the guests. I have arrived many times with luggage and have never had one of them offer to assist me. There is one free shuttle bus for short hops around town, but it is rarely available. The beds are made with sheets not big enough for the beds, so you are likely to encounter the bare mattress instead of a fitted bottom sheet. The reception desk pays no attention to requests you might make on your online reservation, so it's best to reiterate these when checking in to make sure you are put into a suitable room. Finally, if you are here on business beware of the following: although there is free wi-fi throughout the hotel, it is painfully slow, and you will waste much time waiting for pages to load. The infrastructure needs to be upgraded, as it appears not to have been in several years.

The room was roomy and even had a computer, though it was Windows 98. The elevators, pool, free breakfast and roof hot-tubs were great. The roof hot-tubs gave an excellent skyline view and had a changing room, gazebo and T.V.( projected on the wall )all in a nice area.

The underground parking can be a little tricky, esp if you have a large vehicle, but it is very secure. You have to have a room key to access the doors. Security was adequate. There is a homeless shelter nearby, and we did see homeless people around, but never felt threatened or uncomfortable in the least. The only improvements I could suggest would be updating the decor.

There is also a free shuttle minibus if you are going anywhere else downtown. The comments about the unsavoury area I think are a bit unfounded. Sure there is a hostel in the area for the homeless but it is my opinnion is that all cities in the world have homeless issues and I would prefer that hostels are used and safe than having homeless people on the streets and begging.

We stayed in a two bedroom suite arranged long in advance and we were anticipating the evening for a long time. We stayed following a CIrque du Soleil show which was amazing, but our stay at the hotel left much to be desired. We stayed in a two bedroom suite, two guests to a room. It was clearly stated that four adults would be staying in the suite, yet we were given only 2 bathrobed, two towels, two bottles of water. When we first arrived at the hotel at 2:00 pm the room was not ready yet, as can often be expected at that time of day. The front desk attendant made a comment about how we had chosen the \"highest of their rooms\". SInce our room was not yet ready, we were invited to change our clothes for the show in the health club. While changing my clothes in the change room, there was a knock at the door, and a man came in saying he needed to fix the hottub. Rather than wait for me to finish, he came right in and began work just a few feet away from me. I quickly finished and left the room, astounded that the man had not even waited for me to be finished in the changeroom before starting his repairs. Since we wanted to make use of the rooftop hottub, we called for two more bathrobes which arrived quickly by very friendly staff. When we arrived on the roof, it was very crowded and there were beer bottles along the edge of the tub. The hot tub itself was luke warm and after a short time in it we were quite chilly and needed to take a warm shower to warm up. The view was wonderful. In the room, the carpets were stained and there were barely enough towels for two, let alone four adults. We were struck by the comment made by the front desk attendant about this being their \"highest room\", and wondered out loud what their \"lowest room\" would be like, given the condition of their best suite. On checkout, the desk attendant was incredibly rude, and when told that she was being rude, she became defensive, curt and continued to repeat the rude comments that were initially insulting to us. There was no such thing as \"the customer is right\". She told us she would meet us halfway, but when paying the final bill, she had done nothing of the sort. We were told to speak to the manager on Monday morning. On Monday the manger was not in, and a message was left for her to please return our call. On Tuesday she has still not returned our call and is not available to come to the phone. We have travelled extensively around the world in many countries, in many types of hotels. We could have forgiven the condition of the room and considered it an average place to stay, however, the behaviour of the desk staff was not only insulting and disrespectful, but also incredibly stressfull. The bad feelings caused by the experience were hard to shake for the remainder of the day, and since the manager has not been in contact with us yet, despite repeated attempts to contact her, our final very bad impression of the hotel is unfortunately the one that will stick. If you want to stay in a nice hotel, please choose another hotel as this one is average at best in terms of room condition.

We were advised not to stray too far to the right of the hotel in our exploration of Toronto. However, the most unfortunate experience at the Grand was that electronic equipment went missing during our stay. After we ransacked the room and I retraced my steps in my mind, I felt compelled to inquire into the hotel's Lost & Found. This involves leaving a message on a voicemail at the front desk. Not satisfied, I went down a bit later and spoke with the night manager, Renee. He was courteous, helpful and apologetic about the situation. The next morning upon checkout, I was informed that the General Manager, Terrance, was fully aware of the situation and I was given his card. I asked that I be updated upon his arrival later that morning. By the next day, I still had not heard from Terrence, so I called from home. He informed me that this was the first he had heard of the situation. \"Someone would call me back\". He was dismissive, patronizing and blaming his employees for the miscommunication. Needless to say, I was unimpressed. By the next day, you guessed it, I had to call the hotel again, this time asking for someone above Terrence. I was told the Grand is an independently owned & managed hotel, so Terrence was it. I was, however, given the name of the Sales Director, \"Because she is good at returning phone calls\". The front desk called later that day to say nothing turned up in the Lost & Found (Friday- I reported it missing Tuesday evening). I asked to speak with Terrence about other alternatives and when I did, I was interrupted, \"bullied\" and shouted at. Only when I suggested a police investigation, did he agree to a key entrance & security tape check. Dont' get me started on the hotel's in-house car service to the airport. Do yourself a favor and hail a cab. It costs roughly the same and you won't have to risk an unnoticed car order in the logbook, missing luggage or the wrong luggage (I hope she got it back by now) in your trunk.

Since its transformation from the former Toronto headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, this hotel is now showing its age. My wife and I (both Toronto residents) went on a mid-winter romantic break in January for a Saturday night to the Grand Hotel. On the advice of a co-worker (who had thought it great), I booked the \"Grand Jacuzzi Suite\". My expectations were high - Jacuzzi tub, great view, king sized bed, pricey room. My disappointment began at the check-in; the Jacuzzi was broken & the suite was out of service. No problem; given adequate notice, I could reschedule. However, the Front Desk never made any attempt to contact me to advise me of the situation. Strike 1 against the hotel for poor customer service. I accepted a night in Room 205 - an \"Executive Suite\" with no discount offered for the inconvenience (plus they charged $16 for parking under the hotel). The Executive Suite consisted of 4 ill-shaped rooms - an \"office\", a queen bed, a sitting room with a rock-hard couch and a kitchenette. The first problem when you walked in the door was that there was no place to hang your coat. Unlike a regular hotel room, an Executive must feel that there is no need to have your coat anywhere near the door. The bathroom shows its age \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cracked walls, mis-matched fixtures, no shelves or sink surrounding countertop for your toilette articles or accessible mirrors for those of us with glasses to get anywhere near. My wife ended up wedging herself between the sink and a wall to get close enough to a mirror to apply her makeup. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and finish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the room was poor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c trim and mouldings had gaps and showed signs of repairs in the past. The patio door out to the shared balcony was old and ill-fitting, letting the winter winds whistle through. What Mike Holmes would make of this place would be interesting to hear. The office room had a laughably ancient and slow computer and Internet connection with a ceiling fixture that was missing its glass shade. Naked bulbs are terribly attractive in a $300 a night room. The bed was oriented on an angle to try and fix the strangely shaped room, but was in such a position that the one bedside table (there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t two for each side) couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be positioned near the side of the bed. The headboard was a tall, solid piece of dark wood with an enormous gap (about 3 foot) between the surface of the mattress and the bottom of the headboard. Consequently, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pile any pillows up to lean your back against because they would fall through into the triangularly shaped space behind the bed. The hotel restaurant's buffet breakfast was a poor excuse for a hotel in Canada's largest city. I've had better eating in hotels in small town southern USA. Even the floors are worn - it must show better in the dark. All in all, an extremely poor experience. I would never return there unless a lot of money is pumped in to fix the place up. We noted the problems with the room in detail on the hotel's comment card and just received a form letter from the General Manager making no mention of our complaints.", "Date": "April 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cRuined Night!\u201d", "Author": "TravelMasterToronto", "ReviewID": "UR4471310", "Content": "I booked the Jacuzzi Suite for Feb. 14/2006 in hopes of spending a surprise romantic evening with my loved one. I had paid cash (three months in advance) and had planned everything. I wanted Valentine's 2006 to be very special..... I had hoped to get into the room and set it up - had the champagne, strawberries, chocolates, candles etc. and was stunned to be told at 4pm that the room wasn't ready yet!!! Check in is at 3pm..... Actually, a friend who had told me about this Hotel had the same thing happen to her just the weekend before the 14th. Must be common practice at this Hotel - not ready for the 3pm check-in & the offering of complimentary drinks in return for their lateness! The staff in the lobby asked me to have a seat while they checked on the room. A few minutes later I was told the room wasn't quite ready and given a complimentary drink ticket for the bar. My immediate response was that I wanted to get into the room to set it up before my loved one arrived - it was supposed to be a special evening and a surprise. They offered what they told me was a \"far superior room\" and guided me up to their third floor to see it. It was a nice room, however, no jacuzzi in sight. Call me silly, but isn't Valentine's Day about romance??? This room just didn't \"do it\" for me. My partner was due to arrive any time, and I felt I had no choice in the matter but to graciously accept this far \"inferior\" room. My partner was waiting in the lobby after I had checked the room out. It was so disappointing, no surprize, no jacuzzi.... We went for dinner in the hotel restaurant and told them at the desk we would rather wait till the Jacuzzi Suite became available. We ended up getting into the suite around 9pm. (As it turned out, the room was still saturated from water from the previous occupants of the room.) Upon check-out the staff were sympathetic about our ruined evening and gladly gave me the General Manager's card. When I conveyed my story to Terrance, the General Manager of the Grand Hotel, I was quite surpised at his reponse. He felt quite happy about the whole situation felt it had been handled properly by his staff. Also, he felt no obligation to reimburse or perhaps offer another night in compensation for our ruined \"Valentine's Day\". Having said that, and after reading some comments by others who have stayed at this Hotel, I feel I've gotten off easy though. I will never again stay at this Hotel. In fact, I've already told some people who were planning to stay at the Grand and have now cancelled their plans and are staying at the Marriott downtown. (A \"far superior\" Hotel in a better neighbourhood with \"far superior\" Management who know what the Hotel Business is all about!) Oh yeah, Terrance if you're reading this, you have no idea what benefits you could have reaped. I work in an industry that is constantly being asked, \"can you recommend a Hotel for me during my stay in Toronto?\" I'll be sure to mention NOT the Grant Hotel! P.S. Sorry I hung up on you too Terrance. However, you really should attend some \"Hospitality\" courses. It was your condensending attitude that made me do it!

We refused to pay for our last night, due to the ceiling leak and the lack of housekeeping services, and while we were given an invoice listing a $0 balance, the Grand decided after the fact to charge my credit card more than $500 including for services we hadn't used (additional parking charges etc). I disputed the charge through the credit card company who in the end after two months reversed the charges because The Grand Hotel never bothered to respond to any of their communications. Neither did they respond to mine. To date my letter of complaint is still outstanding. I complained to the Toronto Tourism Agency and when I followed up with them, they informed me that The Grand Hotel had told them they had offered me their apologies, an explanation and a complimentary stay but I had refused all of it, which is a total utter lie.

In the changeroom, couldn't figure out the whirlpool controls, but the steamroom is great. When I returned next day, it was evident that shower stalls hadn't been cleaned.

I did a search on Batavia and saw that the population in 1990 was 16,000.

I've travelled around the world and stayed in many nice hotels in Europe and across the US, and this hotel is tops! It's the type of hotel that makes you want to come back to Toronto each year so you can enjoy all that the hotel has to offer. For me, there's two types of hotels you can stay in. There's the type where the staff and owners don't go to great lengths to keep their guests comfortable..they're there to do their jobs, and meanwhile the property inevitably gets run down and before you know it it's a disaster. Then there's the hotel where the staff takes complete pride in their hotel. They go out of their way to make each guest comfortable and happy, and keep everything at the property in perfect condition, and everything always seems new and spotlessly clean. If you want the best of the latter, you have to give the Grand a try. Everything about this hotel seems luxurious. From the spectacular setting of the indoor pool to the amazing rooftop terrace with large jacuzzis and unbeatable panoramic views of the city and lake (and even Niagara Falls on a clear day) to the beautifully designed guestrooms, it's all top notch. Not to mention the FREE breakfast buffet in the classic restaurant adjacent to the main lobby. It's not your typical hotel continental breakfast buffet, this has everything from pastries, fruit, sausage, eggs, biscuits, juices, french toast etc. and it's all delicious. Guest rooms range in size from smaller than average to huge apartment-size suites. We stayed in one of the smallest suites, and although it was on the smaller side, the comfortable beds (understatement) and views, along with the marble bathrooms and complimentary bathrobes more than made up for the fact it wasn't the largest room ever. It made for a very cozy and comfortable experience. This coming from someone who loves large spacious hotel rooms. I'd rather stay at the Grand than somewhere that offers huge rooms. The location is great because it provides for unbeatable views, and right on the corner (Dundas and Jarvis), you can catch one of the red Toronto streetcars that'll take you a couple blocks away to the Eaton Center and trains.
