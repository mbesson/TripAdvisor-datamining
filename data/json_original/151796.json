When we informed the hotel we would not use the last 2 days of our reservation because we would be in the other side of the island, we were shocked to find out they do not reimburse you for the days not used, not even if there is a death in the family.

The room did have a slight musty odor to it. I have come to expect that in this climate. I think the hotels in this area exist for the sake of the casinos. I am not much of a gambler so we spent the afternoon getting to know the area. We traveled to Rincon beach, Rincon light house, and Sandy Beach. None of which were very impressive. In fact we decided that we were wasting vacation time on this end of the island. We decided to add a night to our next reservation at the Intercontinental, and leave Mayaguez early. I booked this hotel with points and thought I would rather loose them than the day wasted with little to do. I talked to the desk clerk and let them know that we would not need the room for the next night and they were very pleasant about it. They even suggested that if I called Priority Club that I might be able to get the points credited back to my account. I did call and it worked out fine. The points for the next night were credited back to my account. Overall the hotel is nice enough. If you are entertained by gambling this would be a good place to stay.

Smell: (Yes, I rate smells!) The casino had smoking and I'm allergic to smoke. You could smell it in other places too, but not really in the room. Food: I thought the food was pretty decent. Drinking? Go for Don Q and not Bacardi. You may get 2 for 1! :) But don't expect the poolside cabana fu-fu drinks. Just an ole' regular drink. Service: Wait staff and host in the restaurant - wonderful. They became my travel buddies. Casino staff - to be honest, no one in the casino seemed to be nice, or even particularly cordial to me. The locals they were nice to. When my friend showed up, they were nice to him. (I'm white - very white...translucent even, blonde/blue. He's white, but Puerto Rican - dark hair, light eyes, etc. My Spanish is on par with his and I can get by okay, certainly not same as a local, but enough to be courteous and beyond). Hotel gift shop: I could have made better gifts (and cheaper) in my room. Snacks? Hardly. I was relagated to the restaurant or bar. Pool: I think the pool probably was decent. I literally (not kidding here) had to walk past chickens and maybe a rooster to get to it. (And there was a headline in the paper about bird flu or some other bird sickness hitting PR so I was leary of birds). Then, I get to the pool. Sit in one of the chairs and lizards begin running over to me (I'm used to lizards in FL and other warmer climates). But there were a lot of them and some were fighting under me - maybe for a better shade spot, but try reading a book while lizards are fighting under you and chickens cluck behind you. So then I decide to go in the pool. I'm leary of public pools, but it's hot and I'm bored. I'll take a chance since only one person swimming. Like most swimmers (me included) the occasional wipe of the nose happens - I can handle this. But, then... the big pick of the nose and the ensuing quest for gold continued and I barely made it out of there before gagging. He deposited his treasures into the pool. So even that was ruined. No, that wasn't the hotel's fault. BUT... I later saw him working in the hotel. Hotel staff!!!! Room: The room was fine. I don't recall anything bad or particularly good about it. The views weren't great (or even good) but that was more based on location. I think you would stay here to do business in Mayaguez, not for the beauty of the island. The water bottle left in the room as complimentary had been opened and drank out of (could tell by the lipstick). And each day, they would take my unopened one and leave that one! But other than that, I think the room was fine. Nothing remarkable though. Adequate. My situation: which jaded me a bit, did allow me to fully partake in the hotel's amenities: I kept getting ditched by my travel partner (who took the car, my phone because forgot his and the laptop in case he needed it (directionally challenged). So I was basically stuck there. We weren't close enough to anything for me to walk. I could have taken the bus, but to where? And, without the phone was hard to look up. So was stuck at the hotel. And, walking anywhere would have been difficult for me. July - wicked hot. Walked around the zoo in Mayaguez and 2 minutes in was soaked completely with sweat because of humidity (locals & animals were too). Puerto Rico is beautiful. There is so much to see and do. Go with someone who wants to do this. (Similar happened in San Juan but we were close enough to all for me to book own excursions, walk around, catch the bus, etc. And...

Very ample and pleasant room, with 2 large LCD TV,s and around 10 tables, with placemats, cloth napkins and china dishwear. The room was attended by a very delightful attendant, who was fluent in English, which is a bit rare in Puerto Rico. We had no noise problems with a 5th floor room, above the Casino. The Guest parking lot was above 100 feet away from the front entry, but it always had parking available, which wasn't the same with the rest of the parking lot. On our Sunday afternoon arrival, the regular parking lot was full, but not the guest lot, which was guarded by a chain, and a security guard. The pool was nice, the grounds very tropical, flowering bushes and trees and grass. The elevator required a room key to use, a great security feature, which was very reassuring!", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "san3571", "Title": "\u201cGreat Getaway\u201d", "Author": "san3571", "ReviewID": "UR16103912", "Content": "I was with my loved one and his first time out of the main land.

The historic town of San German where the oldest church known as Porta Coeli was built in 1606 is about forty five minutes from the hotel.
