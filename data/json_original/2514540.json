Beware!\u201d", "Author": "Dave_in_Vegas", "ReviewID": "UR106431069", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here in April based on the location and many positive reviews. First the positives: The location is good; close to museums and restaurants. Now, cue the crickets\u2026\u2026 The negatives: the hotel is seriously lacking in creature comforts that most travelers have become accustomed to. For example: 1. There is no elevator. That much is disclosed. What isn\u2019t mentioned is the condition of the stairs. They are narrow and steep. They also lean to one side. I suggest chondroiton twice daily for a month prior to your trip. Its also wouldn\u2019t hurt to make sure your health insurance is paid up in case you blow out your knee. 2. There is no cable TV in the room. Just an old TV getting local channels. OK for 1970 Orlando, unacceptable for Big Apple 2011. 3. The room doesn\u2019t have a phone. Or a fax. There is no business center on the property. Or a concierge. Want room service? Hike down three flights and visit the saucy barmaid at the Turkish restaurant next door. 4. There is no daily maid service; trash will keep piling up until you leave. Also, your beds won\u2019t get made. And, try not to get your towels too dirty because they wont be replaced. 5. One ply toilet paper may be good for mother earth and 254\u2019s old pipes (in theory) but you\u2019ll use double the amount. And don\u2019t look for a box of tissues unless you spring for them yourself. 6. There is no central air conditioning unless you count being able to open the window half way. There is no way to regulate the temperature in the room. Not even a ceiling fan. 7. The bed is positioned inches from the radiator, which is directly beneath the window. Which is where, apparently in the summertime they install the air conditioners stored in the closets. How someone can sleep with their head inches from a blowing air conditioner remains to be seen. 8. There is a coffer maker and refrigerator in the room but no coffee. For $250 a night I kind of expected at least a one serve packet of Maxwell House. 9. If you want to use the wireless internet you\u2019ll have to go down to the basement. Or cram in the hallway on the first floor. If you are in a room on the second, third or fourth floor you are out of luck. 10. The nightstand is a foldout food tray. I didn\u2019t check to see if it was IKEA. 11. The place could use a dusting. While I did wake up the first morning with a bug crawling on my hand it wasn\u2019t a bedbug, so I\u2019m grateful for that. In sum I liked the location, which is walking distance to a lot of good places to eat and the museums. But for $250 a night I felt like I got ripped off. Bottom line: 254 is seriously lacking in amenities and needs major upgrades or a big time drop in price", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Charming, Nostalgic Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "LisaBPA", "ReviewID": "UR105654580", "Content": "I actually stayed at this wonderful boutique-style hotel in April 2010 to attend a friend's bachelorette party.

Accommodations are not anything like a chain hotel nor are they like a B & B. The unit we were in was in a building shared by people that live there year round. There is no place to check in or go to if you have any questions. At one point near check in time, we tried calling the telephone number and got an automated message. Luckily, it wasn't something that we needed an immediate response for. The \"suite\" was clean but a bit old - red carpeting and gold bedding. Seemed the bed and living area should have been reversed but somehow it was OK. There was a small refrigerator in the room as well as a coffe pot however, there were no filters or coffee in the room so unless you went out and bought your own filters and can of coffee (or tea) it was useless. Bathroom was clean, however, the door's handle was a just a turning lock (no handle) and it squeaked terribly. The entry door to the building, which was accessible by a code given to us prior to check-in - was unlocked more than locked during our 2 night stay. Our room was a 2-floor walkup and we certainly heard comings and goings for tenants during the wee hours of the night. Having said all this, we probably paid at least $100 LESS than any other room available in the area and did get to stay on the upper East Side, which is where we wanted to be. Very safe neighborhood with great restaurants. Bring your own tissues as they are not provided but there is a huge - like 65\" -big screen TV. Go figure!

I booked the one bedroom apartment for myself and two teenage daughters for one night \"spur of the moment\" one day before my visit to NYC. The confirmation via e-mail was prompt and I received a telephone call the next morning regarding the doorlock combination and the quite unorthodox check-in method. It was actually easier than checking into a regular hotel. The starirs are a little steep and your legs get a good work out. There is no elevator, so travel light. The kitchen and sitting areas are small, but comfortable. The bedroom with two double beds was actually quite large for NYC standards and has ample closet space. The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty extra pillows and blankets in the closet.The only change I would make would be the location of the beds. One double bed was right under the window AC unit and it became quite arctic at night for the person sleeping in that bed. The promised amenities were all present, clean and in good working order. The bathroom looked a little worn, but was clean and the shower had great water pressure and ws nice and hot. My daughters loved having an appartment rather than just one room in a hotel. Location is great in a nice neighborhood with ample shops and eating establishments right aroung the corner. It takes about half an hour to walk to midtown and the theater district, but the walk is nice and plenty of stores to explore on the way. There are lots of taxis around if you choose not to walk, but hey, when is New York, do as the New Yorkers (and walk!) Central Park is only 10 minutes walking away. If you are looking for marble tiled bathrooms and room service, this is not the place for you, but if you are just looking for a place to relax and put your feet up after a day of exploring the city, this works very well. Having the kitchen is nice and will save you some $$ if you eat breakfast and snacks \"at home\".

Vacation apartments aren't quite as common in North America, but 254 East Vacation fit the bill quite adequately. It's well-situated on a quiet (well, quiet for NYC), tree-lined street in the Upper East Side, close to 2nd Avenue. The 77th Street subway stop, on the 6 line, is about an eight minute walk. As that's the only line that services the Upper East Side, it's usually pretty busy. The immediate neighborhood is choc-a-bloc with restaurants and bistros like J.G. Melons, and the Orsay. In fact, there's a fine Turkish restaurant right next door, another just around the corner. If you want to do it yourself, there's no shortage of delis and green grocers nearby, and an excellent full-service grocerateria, D'Agostinos, about a six-minute walk away on Lexington Avenue. We were booked into the no. 3 apartment at 252 74th St. We called Danny, the proprietor, upon our arrival at JFK, he gave us the code to get in the front door, and our keys would be on the table in the open apartment. He happened to meet us at the door when we got there, and that was the first and last we saw of him, which is part of the appeal of vacation apartments, total independence. The apartment itself is up a couple of flights of creakity, narrow stairs. The two adjoining buildings seem to be a mix of vacation units and apartments for permanent residents. The apartment consisted of a living room, a sleeping area with a queen bed in an annex and a small bathroom, which was spotless. The \"kitchen\" is really just a small fridge with a microwave sitting on top. There's a selection of plates, bowls, cups and cutlery on a shelf unit. We only really planned to eat breakfast there, but it would have been nice were there a small kitchen cart/table in the apartment to be used as a prep area. We had to wash our dishes in the bathroom sink, as that's the only part of the apartment with plumbing. The apartment is also equipped with a small air conditioner in one of its two windows, and a massive 50-inch plasma tv; I'm sure few of the top-end hotels in NYC even have that! Be sure to scan beyond the basic cable channels to get to some high-def and digital channels. The information sheet on the coffee table says WiFi is only accessible from the first floor hallway, but we were able to hook into the network no problem.

No clean towels or bedding...that is kind of roughing it for the group of females I had. One roll of tissue paper. Little things that added up to make us leave that apartment for as long as possible. We stayed in1A. It had overhead noise, outside noise and its own internal loud sounds that we never could identify. This unit has a converted kitchen into a bedroom - which is very weird as the tiny kitchen is at the foot of the bed and the bathroom is 3 feet away from the bed. Yuck. The main room was nice, except the couch was not comfortable as reported and the teenage girls had to take turns on who got the bed. Although it is nicely decorated, the decorations are just covering up very old, thickly painted walls. I don't think I would stay here again.", "Date": "August 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paisley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUnwanted visitors\u201d", "Author": "theatreproducer", "ReviewID": "UR11946213", "Content": "East Vacation is hardly the fashionable upscale site it appears to be from its website. fine if you are looking into other peoples uptown apartments in the same street but Danny's East 74th is dirty, run down, badly in need of a complete makeover. its motel hell, cheap fittings, 1980's decor, no real sense of being in an aparthotel.

It's not quite a hotel and not quite a bed and breakfast\u2026 So, if you want either of those, I might suggest looking somewhere else. However, if you're looking for a more authentic stay in New York City, then this might be the location for you. 254 East Vacation is tucked away on the upper west side, just a few blocks from the subway. I enjoyed its perfect location; just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of midtown to find decently priced food and drinks. It was also important for me to find a quiet place that I could escape to at the end of busy day of sightseeing. It was nice to see a large room that fit two full sized beds comfortably. The room had a small sitting area, which had a foldout couch, and there was also a kitchenette. The Bathroom was a good size and the water stayed hot enough for three separate showers a day. I've noticed some people complaining about walking up the stairs. They were narrower then I\u2019m used to. So, if you have rather wide baggage, you might want to request the first or second floor. Don\u2019t expect house-keeping to come around and clean up after you, change your sheets or provide you with clean towels (unless you phone them, your on your own) The bathroom really could use some renovating, not that it was especially dirty, it was just really aged.

We spent 3 nights at 254 East Vacation and paid $300/night for a suite on the second floor that had 2 double beds in a small bedroom, a fold out couch in a very small sitting area, an extremely small galley kitchen, and an outdated bathroom. For less money we have stayed in some very nice 2 bedroom oceanfront condos in some of the nicest beach resorts in the U.S. But, I guess it's really not fair to try to make a comparison between Manhattan and a beach resort. The wireless internet didn't work well. The sink drain in the bathroom was clogged, the single electrical outlet in the bathroom (on the light over the sink) is not GFI protected, the window A/C is directly behind one of the double beds, and the whole apartment had a less-than-clean feeling to it. The kitchen is too small to do much cooking in, there is no dishwasher and clean-up in the tiny sink is a hassle. The TV in the sitting area was broken, but the one in the bedroom worked okay. There is no daily maid service. On the plus side, the beds were comfortable, the linens were clean, and the window A/C did cool the small apartment sufficiently - if we ran it non-stop. The location is great, right in the heart of the upper east side, and it was fairly quiet. Just a few blocks walk to the subway station, Central Park, and a variety of restaurants. If you stay here, the subway really is the way to travel. It can take forever to try to get anywhere in a cab because the traffic is horrendous. The subways are very inexpensive ($2/ride, or 6 rides for $10) and although they can seem intimidating at first it doesn't take long to figure out which trains go where. The trains are air conditioned, but the stations are not and can be pretty hot. Fortunately the trains run very frequently and you never have to wait very long in the station. Overall, I guess we would stay here again, but it's hard to give it a ringing endorsement. I rated it 3 stars, but would give it a 2.5 if that were an option.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "254 East Vacation", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d550885-Reviews-254_East_Vacation-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$200 - $342*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">254 East 74th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10021</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514540", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/44/d3/44d39c4d23ed2da8627b3db8f7372f673large.jpg"}}
