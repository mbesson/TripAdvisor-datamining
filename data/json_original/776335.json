The room and bathroom were beautiful, nicely decorated. We were on a Trafalgar escorted tour; this hotel was the nicest of the four we stayed. The first night was part of the package but we spent an extra day in Rome, hence the second night. The hotel is remote, adjacent to a highway, although noise was not a factor. To get to the heart of the city we paid 3 Euros each for the hotel shuttle to reach the subway which cost one Euro. For our return in the evening to the hotel we took a cab which cost 35 Euros with tip. We didn't take the subway as we were uncertain about getting a cab at the end of the line. We chose not to take the hotel shuttle as it stops running at 9 PM; plus there may have been coordination issues. It took 15 minutes on the hotel shuttle from the hotel to the subway terminus. The next morning we went to the airport. The hotel tried to sell us their car service for 55 Euros w/o the tip. We took a cab instead which cost 55 Euros with the tip. However, it was a Sunday morning, traffic was light, and the cab driver \"flew.\" I imagine it would have been more expensive in rush hour traffic and much slower. So the hotel car might not be a bad option. Breakfast was included. I enjoyed this breakfast least of the four hotels visited. There is a large supermarket next door which also has a sit-down cafeteria. We didn't patronize it other than to buy a large bottle of water for the U.S. equivalent of 40 cents. I gave the hotel four stars strictly on the quality of the room; I deducted a star because of the location. Not much of anything around.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Colborne, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "DLSFamily", "ReviewID": "UR116641748", "Content": "We stayed for one night (last night of our TrafalgarTour).

The hotel lobby and rooms were clean and modern. There was free wi-fi at the lobby, you just need to ask for a code from reception which gives you about 10 hours of access.
