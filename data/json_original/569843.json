The room quality was poor, bathrooms were inadequate and shared. The furniture was poor. The bedsheets and blankets were dirty. The only good thing was that it was cheap.

Filthy windows dirty netting didn't look clean from the outside so was worried what it looked like in the inside. I was right to be worried, it was disgusting filthy carpet dirty walls any notices was ripped and old terrible service would never ever go there again. We would catch less illness staying the night on the streets wouldn't send a homeless person there. The hotel has serious hygeine problems. I advise anyone to look else where spend abit more on a hotel even if its basic but at least it should be cleaner than this place.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLOOKED LIKE A DRUG HOUSE!\u201d", "Author": "aands1605", "ReviewID": "UR123436045", "Content": "I couldn't believe the state of the place when we arrived. The front area was disgusting and run down. The hallway area was dirty the floor was dirty so were the walls. We ended up booking and staying somewhere else it was that bad. The website we booked through said own bathroom but it was shared facilities that were in a poor state, leaking taps dirty toilet shower and floors. The rooms were dingy and also dirty. We literally booked another hotel inside this place. I would not advise staying here. I wouldn't stay there as a last resort.

The amenities were basic but clean and warm, despite the freezing conditions outside. The value for money was great considering what situation I was put in unexpectedly. Being 8 months pregnant I suddenly went into labour and had to leave the hotel late at night leaving all of mine and my sisters belongings in our room. As I am from Lincoln, the next day, we had to travel all the way home in terrible weather conditions, but needed to gather all our belongings, which the staff did for us ready to pick up on our way home with newborn baby in tow. My sister managed to collect all our things but left behind a pair of boots. I called the hotel and they kindly agreed to send the boots but also offered to pay for them to be sent. I would definitely stay with them again and recommend their services.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiev", "Title": "\u201cDon't ever stay there!\u201d", "Author": "MiKaKiev", "ReviewID": "UR75956615", "Content": "Rate is below zero.

The location is good, right in the heart of London, but it does not worth it. I would not recomend the place to anyone even if I hate that person. When we got into the building we were taken to the \"reception\" (this was a room where the employee lives). In the reception, on the floor, it was a piece of meat to defrost, dirty plate with a fork and knife with rests of food under the table, I could not believe that the place was a reception so I started to imagine how the room will look like. I think there was only one toilet to share in the entire building (not sure and not interesting), the shower was dirty so we decided we will only use it in as an emergency. Our room was downstairs, I think that blankets were never washed so we decided to sleep with our clothes on. It was a door inside the room to a kind of kitchen-laundry, not sure what that was, but there were dirty sheets and dirty plates.
