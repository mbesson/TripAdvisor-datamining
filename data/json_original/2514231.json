Don't bother to ask the front desk for a razor or toothpaste or plug adapter because they will be happy to point you to their vending machine or the store across the street. I was there 4 nights/5 days. I actually enjoyed the breakfast buffet (it is normally 7 GBP per day, $10+ but mine was part of the package). The \"bar\" beer selection was pathetic with no real english beers on tap (Carling?!) but this was not unusual around Excel Centre. People attending Excel are probably on a fixed per diem and can probably find a' better hotel nearby or a short tube ride away for the same price.

As I soon as I closed my room door, I heard nothing ..no noise at all from the comings/goings in and out of them. Whilst the room carpets are rough and practical, I was impressed with the bathroom/toilet set-up and how it was encased in it's own pod. Was kept clean and felt clean. Additionally, I found the beds to be big enough for a big chap like me and very comfortable indeed. The compact wardrobe/shelf unit in the corner was also very useful. On the downside, I would avoid the breakfasts and also the wifi provider 'orange' whose service whilst I was there was very very poor.

Far from the center (it takes about 1 hour and switching from DLR to the tube or bus) the Ibis does not live up to the International standards of a 3* hotel. The bathrooms are built in (oddly I might add) with the shower cabin, otherwise pretty good size showers, but since this is a close by the Thames river hotel you can smell it though the drains. Of course the fact that the housekeeping is not doing their job helps a lot too. And not that I didn't announce the front desk about it, because I did, twice, and that's how many times in a week the room got cleaned. Except that, I did get the bed folded. And that's that. For those travelling from outside of UK no matter what you are told, watch out for the payments done. The pre-authorisation in UK will block the money in the account and the seller is allowed to take those at any point within the 30 days. So unless you want to get double charged I strongly suggest you pay when you get there. Our luck was that one of the managers did know that had happened in other cases with visitors from outside of UK and did not charge us twice (Selene thank you - I have to say she was the only one trained for the job, the other front desk attenders knew only the speech to be told). The closet is small and oddly shaped as well, barely room to put clothes for a couple of people staying in for a few days. The noise level is ok, excepting the planes - watch out the London City Airport is too close and has quite a bit of traffic. The positioning of the room may help some but not too much. Overall it was an overpriced hotel for the services rendered. The Breakfast is expensive good thing it's not included, you can manage to eat somewhere else or grab a sandwich on the way. Two supermarkets are close by, Nisa and Spar, strongly suggest the Spar which is further but cheaper plus they do have better offers.

The line to the reception desk wasn't very long and in no time I was greeted by a smiling, friendly staff member who quickly had every sorted and handed me my keycard for my 3rd floor room. The room was very clean and had a clean, well sized bathroom with quite a big shower. The bed was comfortable and was big enough for two adults as well. The room also had a desk which was ideal for your laptop and doing a bit of work or planning your next day in the metropol. WiFi is available and there was a 24 hours package on offer, which included some extras as well, that will set you back 9.99 GBP.

The room had one window, which can be opened a fair bit. The room also had air condition which worked very well. The hotel i situated close to London City Airport and during the day there can be some noice from planes flying low above the hotel. I never heard any noice during night or early morning and with the window closed the noise level was indeed very acceptable. All in I had a very nice stay. Staff was friendly throughout my stay and facilities were what you'd expect of a reasonable budget hotel. It is the perfect spot for going to ExCel, only 200-300 meters from the hotels entrance. The locations is also good if you want some good but not too expensive and too crammed accomodation for a visit to London.

Reception in the Ibis Excel was a little unreliable, we stayed there for a total of 4 days, on two bookings, but getting the staff to understand the fact that these were consecutive, and that I had actually booked breakfast too was almost impossible, needing daily maintenance with them. The rooms are large, but with a small version of the modern style of bathroom/toilet combo - this could have been larger, as there was some wasted space in the room. The breakfast was a lowish level, the scrambled egg had virtually no taste.

Overall the room being clean is the only plus , room is pretty tiny and there is no room service.

The room was clean and functional for a budget hotel, although I half expected the bathroom to go into orbit due to the noise each time the toilet was flushed. Would have liked hand towels as well as the rather thin towel supplied per person. But overall the room was ok and had a very pleasant view. Breakfast was fine, but the one evening meal we had was very disappointing. For example, my husband ordered a 'beer battered fish' dish, and a rather sad looking 'breaded fish' (which reminded us of fish bought in bulk in a supermarket) was presented to him. He explained this was not as ordered and a very willing waitress replaced it - with another albeit more presentable 'breaded fish'. He gave up. The staff were overall obviously anxious to please, but there was some difficulty with communication - none of the staff appearing to have english as a first language. However, any disappointment with the evening meal was nothing compared to the noise experienced at night. Noise starting in the early hours of sunday (2-3am) included loud laughter, running along corridors, doors banging and toilets flushing and appeared to come, not only from our floor, but from above. We put up with the disturbance putting it down to saturday night festivities. However, the following night the noises started again and this time at about midnight . The noise definately being in the main directly above us. We endured until about 1.30 am when I rang reception in desperation - the gentleman on duty was extremely polite and said he would investigate - and the noise, although not ceasing completely, became bearable after about 20 mins.

Had tickets to see peter kay at the o2. On arrival we were told that we couldnt check in until 2pm. They offered to store our baggage free of charge. We sat in the bar as it was 13.00pm. Service was friendly and efficent. whilst waiting we glanced at the food menu, it appeared reasonably priced and the selection was varied. The main areas were clean and well maintained. The alcohol prices were reasonable aswell. Our room was on the 4th floor and right at the end 449. It was clean and comfortable. The bathroom is more of a wetroom. The rooms are budget, but like i say they were clean and comfy. Things like hairdryers are available on request. But tea and coffee are supplied and rooms made up daily. The towels are small and only one pillow is provided. However i am sure if we had asked they would have offered us some more, but we didnt see the need. They are refurbing between the hours of 9 and 5, but we werent there and there was no evidence to show anything was happening, apart from banging on the first morning at 1030am. The hotel had a lot of business people from the excel centre and school children from abroad. Niether caused us any bother at all. The hotel itself was located about 2mins from the royal victoria stop on the DLR. We bought a day travel card at 8 pounds each and changed at canning town for the tube. Canning town is one stop from Royal Victoria and One stop from the o2. We went into london on both days and it took s about 20 to 30 mins depending on were we were heading. We ate at the o2 on both nights as it has a good selection of bars and resturants. We had no trouble getting about and saw lots of sights. The tube is being upgraded at the weekends so be mindful of this. The bus replacements are frequent but not as quick as the tube. Your travel card will be valid on these. London as usual is pricey but a good getaway. AS for the ibis its a great hotel. Breakfast was buffet style and varied in its selection. The bottom line is i travel frequently and know you go were you can afford. Ibis isnt glitzy or glamourous but it serves its purpose well as a base. If you want comfort and some where to rest your weary feet go here. If you want the added extras go elsewhere.

We stayed 5 nights. It's a bit far from central London, so access to nightlife was a little limited. The DLR was a 5 min walk and easy to find.

The shower design was one where water tended to collect on the bathroom floor, unfortunately (standing, no bathtub). No major problems with hearing noises from upstairs/other rooms. Small TV had a few UK channels and 1/2 channels from other European nations. The front desk could have been a little more helpful - they did not seem very interested when we showed up to check in, and initially tried to tell us that our stay did not include breakfast (which in fact we did pay for when we booked the room - they later caught their mistake). No such problems at check out. There was a medium-sized supermarket out front which was very convenient and open till fairly late. Other than a few other hotels and the Excel center, there didn't seem to be much else out here. The breakfast was good and had a lot of different foodstuffs... unfortunately it was the same food everyday! With the variety though, it wasn't that bad. One busy day though the coffee seemed to run out, we couldn't find any ketchup, and the staff seemed slightly overwhelmed. We did eat dinner once and although it wasn't cheap, it was quite tasty. The signs for breakfast said 6am to whenever, but this was misleading. On our last day we had to catch an early AM flight and when we went down at 6... the restaurant area was not setup.

Hotel is clean and rooms are modern, comfortable with excellent Grohe showers. There can be a little plane noise occasionally but not to the volume that it disturbed my sleep. Excel and Victoria DLR stations are both about a 2 min and 5 min walk from the hotel, respectively. There is a Spar and a reasonably priced mini-supermarket with a good selection of wine & beers almost directly across the road and also another Spar type shop near to the rear of the hotel at the dockside. There are a few nice looking bars and restaurants and a club within 2 mins walk although I didn't go to them. Rear rooms have nice views over the docks - there is a watersports centre at the dock so you can watch people waterski. There is a large grass covered area with benches right next to the hotel outside the Excel Centre which is quiet and is a great sun trap for relaxation and is a suitable space to let your kids run about without any traffic unlike a lot of London hotels. I have stayed at Ibis Docklands twice. I had no concerns about letting my 17 yr old son and his friend stay there on their own when on a concert trip recently as the area is quiet and feels safe. I always look to stay in Ibis hotels now unless I want to stay in a boutique style hotel on a special occasion.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cLondon on a budget\u201d", "Author": "gazuk95 Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR79337719", "Content": "This hotel is great if you want to visit London on a tight budget, The hotel is basic, but comfortable and only a 5 minute walk away from the nearest tube station.

Why do some of these moaning minnies bother going anywhere?? The rooms were very adequate and clean, the beds comfortable and the staff very curtious.....and they served a very good breakfast...what else do you need for a london getaway. getting into central london was very easy, took about 20 mins and cost six quid each for a dlr/tube full day pass. my only critisism was that because we arrived mid evening on the first night we ate in the restaurant...this was a mistake as the service was unbelievebly slow and food very mediocre...after that we ate in town so no problem. you are quite close to the city of london airport so after 7am planes take off over the hotel but again, if your'e spending the day in london you should be thinking about getting up by then anyway. through superbreaks this hotel cost 56 quid per night for a three night stay (incl breakfast) and was very good value for money.

The hotel is nice, new, and the location is beautiful, right on the canal. There are some restaurants nearby, the hotel bar/restaurant is open 24 hours, which is very handy and the prices are good. there are two small markets nearby, with long hours. the hotel itself, the rooms are sparse (this is an Ibis), the windows don't open all the way, but the AC is good, the bathroom reminded me of a cruise ship bathroom (no tub, only shower, step up, etc...). if i were staying here are a regular tourist though, I would have been disappointed because there were sooooo many groups here! we were just 1 of about about 4 student travel groups (each group being about 50 teens), and there were two adult japanese tour groups there during our stay as well. In general the kids were well behaved, but it made it very difficult to get on the hotel computers, breakfast was absolutely packed from about 8-9 every day, and the elevators took forever! As for the staff, well, since any member of the EU can move jobs between countries, it means that you have a lot of non-English staff-- they all speak English, but their comprehension levels vary. We had to explain 3 times about the light in our bathroom (it was blinking on and off-- thank goodness we were not epileptics, or else there could have been real problems). i tried, in vain, to solicit information abot cinemas and timetables (the staff referred me to the pamphlets about trips to stonehenge and the cotswolds)-- then told me that i would just have to get on the tube and travel to the movie theatre to find out if any movies were playing now, that i wanted to see. they did it with a smile, but i did not find it helpful to be told to take the tube down to canary wharf at 930pm to find out if there were still movies playing that night. they had nicely priced in room internet and movie plans, but the actual working order of these programs were spotty, at best-- in our group, atleast 5 rooms had difficulty connecting to the internet and watching the pay movies on tv (and they had to return to reception 3-6 times-- not a fun thing especially when they had to wait in line behind 3+ people every time). Overall, I think this hotel is a crapshoot-- their rates are good, it's off the DLR (which is fabulous), but if you're there with a group, or stuck there while several groups are there, then your experience is going to be different.

I stayed at this hotel as it was selected as the conference hotel for a recent conference. I brought my family so that they could have a holiday abroad. The hotel was a disaster. First, the hotel is *extremely remote*. It takes an hour or more to get into central London by light rail and the tube. Next, the rooms are very small, barely sufficient for a solo business traveler and terrible for a family. The hotel is extremely crowded--the lobby, bar and restaurant were packed to overcrowding. The hotel is very loud--it seems to cater to children's tour groups, so we had pre-teens running and yelling down the halls at night. The restaurant's food is poor and the restaurant staff were rude and inattentive. The bathroom doors are so stiff that my 7 year old daughter couldn't get out of the bathroom by herself. We also had problems with the hotel laundry--the first day our laundry wasn't even sent out to be cleaned and the next day one of the garments returned damaged. Despite an advertisement of \"fixed in 15 minutes or the room is free,\" none of these issues were addressed and the hotel refused to issue a refund of an unused night when we decided to depart early in disgust. If you must stay in this area, check out the other hotels nearby (including a Novotel and a Crowne Plaza). Better yet, stay somewhere more central to London and commute to your meeting.

Many more fun places closer to London proper.)", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "The WIRRAL UK", "Title": "\u201cwell priced hotel in quiet location\u201d", "Author": "HotelValueHunter", "ReviewID": "UR67877286", "Content": "I stay in the London ExCel exhibition and conference centre area at least 2 times a year. I write about all the hotels I stay in on the ExCel complex so I direct you to my user name to get my reviews on the other adjoining hotels I have stayed at. If you are travelling to this hotel on the DLR alight at Royal Victoria (RV) as there are fewer steps to carry luggage up and down. Out of the station across the zebra crossing and at 10 O' Clock is a wide path between the apartment blocks. Walk along this path and you come onto Western Gateway. Turn left and the IBIS comes up on your right hand side after about 250yds. This hotel is fantastic; I find no problem with the room size and the staff friendly. My room was cleaned everyday to my satisfaction and on checking in I asked for a room with a view of the dock and my request was granted. From reading other reports I think people are expecting too much for the room rate you pay. I have now stayed here 8 times in 5 years with nothing to really complain about (except small bath towels, and small ironing boards in the ironing rooms). The restaurant food is basic fayre but good value. I calculated the cheapest 3 course meal with a 0.5L bottle of still mineral water would cost about \u00a315 per person. Bar service does get people very frustrated in this IBIS but the secret is to stay at this hotel and use the bar in the sister hotel Novotel right next door. The Novotel has a far superior bar but the prices are only about 20p dearer per pint. The Novotel has floor walkers, so once you have your seat the floor walker will take your order at your table and bring you your drinks. You just then settle up one bill at the end of your visit. You cannot charge the Novotel bar bill to your IBIS hotel room, which is the only real drawback. As they are part of the same hotel chain I do not see this as a big problem to sort out. This would benefit A-Club members to ensure they maximise their points earned from these two ACCOR hotels. If staying for a while, there are two convenience stores (SPAR, NISA) to get your hotel room supplies along Western Gateway. There are lots of eateries around the IBIS hotel and I found the quickest way to know where they all are is to pop into the ExCel centre next to the IBIS and get the free local restaurant guide from the information desk. The ExCel venue is open even if no events are happening and contains Coffee Bars and Newspaper/sweet shops and free cash machines. If you are staying at one of the on-site hotels this is a great bonus to be able to use these facilities. If you want a cheap light breakfast rather than pay hotel prices a bacon sandwich costs around \u00a33 and there are plenty of tables and chairs down the main wide central isle to sit at and relax. I have also come across a WEB site which will be useful if you are staying at this hotel and visiting central London to see the sights. It is walkit.co.uk this site shows you the quickest walking route between two locations. If you are visiting London for the sights start your walking journey at Westminster Tube on the Jubilee line (change at Canning Town on the DLR).

Rooms: These are very basic. The walls appeared to be rough painted concrete or cement, there was no carpet, more like something you would find in a kitchen. The bed was not particualrly comfortable, as the matress was about 4in thick and put straight down on wood. The bathroom was like a modular unit, that was presumably dropped in when the hotel was constructed. The bathroom was very clean and the shower was roomy. Location: This was ideal for Excel, but not really for anything else. You could see the O2 (Dome), but this would be a fair distance if you were walking. The hotel is based near the DLR network, Custom House station. But the DLR does not run particularly late, so if you went out further afield, you may end up getting taxi. Noise: The problem with a budget hotel is the type of people who stay there. There was a lot of noise outside of the hotel at about 2am, this was even clear from the 7th floor. Colleagues who stayed the night previous, said it was noisy then also. General: The bar areas were clean and tidy, plus the drinks and service were OK.

The hotel is situated at the Docklands which initially seems a bit of a way out from Central London, but once you get on the jubilee line its a straight ride through to Canning Town and then just one stop on the DLR to Royal Victoria. you need a travel card to cover zones 1 to 3. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from th DLR, exit the station take a right and then follow the road as it bears around to the left its right next to the Excel centre (i put the directions down because we couldnt find it when we got off the DLR and wandered around nervously for a bit and there were loads of workmen around as the area near the DLR is under development) The hotel was just \u00a355.00 a night and so for 4 nights we only paid \u00a3220.00. It was half term as well and so we expected it to cost more. (Breakfast not included \u00a35.50 for adults and half for children under 11) The first impression was good, the hotel was clean, the carpets/floor, the tables, the bar was well stocked and the waiting area was bustling with life as many guests sat around comfortably having a drink and having a laugh. The hotel reception staff were very friendly and helpful which put me at immediate ease as this was the first time I had travelled to London for fun rather than on business or training. We were served quickly and efficiently and given directions to our room, which was a bit small but was situated on the 3rd floor and had an amazing view of the waterfront. (the morning views were amazing) The bathroom was spacious and the shower was huge and very powerful. The bathroom was very clean also. Tea and coffe faciilities in the room as standard.. The double bed was comfortable and there was a single bed in the room too. There was sufficient wardrobe space but not enough storage space for our cases which ended up on either side of the bed which was a bit inconvenient, but not major at all! The rooms were cleaned well each day and re stocked with all facilities. We ordered food from the bar on one night only because the restaurant said it would be 40 minutes as they were so busy, but the service at the bar was good, if a touch pricey. \u00a37.50 for a v small margherita pizza.

The receptionist staff were very friendly and helpful even though we had got to the hotel very early they still let us check in, we were delighted about this as we were tired from a very early morning flight and we didn't have to carry our bag around London all day. The nearest station to the Hotel is Royal Victoria and then the Hotel is only a two minute walk away. We were going ot the O2 Arena to see Prince and this was an Ideal location it was just one stop from Royal Victoria to Canning Town where you change for the Jubliee line and one stop on the Jubilee line to North Greenwich this only took 10 mins at most. The concert itself was fantastic and we had no trouble returning to our hotel that night. I will be staying here again without a doubt I just wish we had another Prince Ticket.", "Date": "August 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "east sussex", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "mrspink3", "ReviewID": "UR8242002", "Content": "Stayed just 2 nights but a great value hotel in an expensive city.
