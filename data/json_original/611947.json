There are Starbucks, Deli's and Au Bu Pain nearby for breakfast and lunch, also street corner vendors will sell you good fresh pastries and coffee.

We took a flight from London and landed at JFK airport around lunchtime. By the time we arrived at the hotel it was mid afternoon. The hotel is a large hotel, and is ideally located within walking distance of Central Park and Times Square. Our first impression of the hotel was that it was extremely busy. We noticed a lot of young people who were carrying placards with names of various countries of the world and guessed that they were attending some sort of a United Nations related conference. Check in by Indhira was efficient. Our room was on the 21st floor. It was a king size double bedroom measuring 290 sq ft. It was modern in d\u00e9cor, although I was not too keen on the brown coloured theme. The lighting was adequate. The view from our room was (predictably) of skyscraper buildings. The room had all the usual mod cons associated with Hilton hotels. There was a large flat screen TV; minibar; air conditioning; bathrobes; safe; all bathroom amenities etc. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and which guarantees you a good night\u2019s sleep. You can cut through the breakfast area to 54th Street \u2013 so there are a lot of people passing through all the time. Our room rate included breakfast \u2013 but we were not overly impressed with the breakfast buffet. I think that the management should review the variety and the quality of food on offer and assess whether it truly represents value for money. If you prefer your coffee from Starbucks, there is a Starbucks caf\u00e9 next to the breakfast area. All the staff members are helpful and they work hard to ensure that the hotel\u2019s standards are upheld. The staff members who run the concierge desk are extremely helpful too. Ruth in the Business Centre was very helpful. The price to print one page from a file is $1, which I think is quite excessive. Later I had to make an important phone call using the room telephone to a number in the US. Again, I felt that a charge of $1 per minute was excessive. Readers should remember that in New York and almost everywhere in USA, tipping at 15% is the norm. This is just for \u201can okay\u201d service. 20% is for good service and 25% is for \u201cwow\u201d service. It is useful to have lots of $1 bills handy because when you arrive at the hotel, you are expected to tip the man who takes the luggage out of the taxi and the bell boy who brings your luggage to your room. The same applies to when you are leaving the hotel. Sometimes the lifts can take a bit longer than expected to arrive. The Hilton Vacation Club sales people may collar you to attend a presentation. Be polite and firm and say no if you are not interested. I would recommend this hotel as it is within walking distance of Rockefeller Centre, Central Park, 5th Avenue and Times Square.

I told the waitress I was upset about being pushed out of our table and she smiled. When I took her name, she then offered me coffee to go. Is this the hotel policy or is this the waitstaff policy? We left and went upstairs to the executive lounge for coffee. The continental breakfast there is very nice and the waitstaff is excellent.

I am staying at this hotel for the SES conference which is in the hotel otherwise I would have already left. On the positive side the location is great, but thats the only positive at this point. I am now on my 3rd room in this garbage can of a hotel. The first two smelled horrible so I immediately asked to be moved. I was finally moved to the 39th floor and the room here is okay. Problem is, there is no ethernet connection and the wifi is abysmally slow. I plan to post some some screen shots later that show how this hotel's wifi is worse than dial-up! Reason, I'd like an ethernet connection is that, I have a travel router, that I could plug in and fix the problem. I did bother to talk to tech support even though I knew it would be a waste of time, and they were completely unhelpful. In the end their suggestion was that ALL 6 of my wifi capable devices were the problem and not their network. When I challenged them on this by quoting speed test numbers which were lower than 0.2Mbps, they tried blaming the problem on pop-up ads/my internet browser! Sorry tech support, but I am not an idiot and resent being treated as such. POP-UP ADDS?!?!? SERIOUSLY?!?!?! So because I desperately have to work during the day for the next three days and DO need a reliable internet connection, I have been trying to get into another room that has one. To do this, I have had to sit through nearly 10 phone calls with customer service and the front desk with about 80% of those people showing some major attitude and being rude questioning why I couldn't just work in the lobby and insisting at first that their wifi was fine, but then admitting later (when challenged) that there were widespread complaints. Finally they offered me a room on one of the executive floor which (when I arrived at) smelled really nasty and was in fact smaller than my room on the 39th floor. If you are paying extra to stay in one of those rooms, you are an idiot. The executive floor room was worse than my room on the 39th floor. I tested the wifi up there and it was equally as crappy. (less than 0.2Mbps). They did have an ethernet connection, but the smell was so awful, I didn't want to move for the 4th time and make my wife endure the nasty smell on top of being in a smaller room. I called the front desk again to ask if they had anything else that was at least the same size as my room and had an ethernet connection and was led to believe that they had larger rooms available on the executive floor but was never offered one. The person told me, that it must be that \"you don't like the decor up there\" so you \"won't like any of the other rooms\". I told her I didn't want a smaller room and could care less about the decor. No offer was made to give me a room upgrade or some kind of discount. Internet aside, I have to say the customer service here has been absolutely abysmal. I have talked to so many rude people that have given me a ton of attitude and grief for simply asking them to make good on their word that the Hilton has high speed internet in every room. I'll be sure to update more later, with photos, and screen-shots of the internet speed tests I have performed, confirming that their internet is positively awful!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yellowknife, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "Benji S", "ReviewID": "UR126424630", "Content": "4 night stay with family was very enjoyable.

This was exactly what we were expecting. -Room: spacious ( for NY standards ! ) but old and in need of renovation, bathroom extremely small but with a good size shower which was very appreciated.

I woke up on my first morning and headed to the gym, they wanted to charge me $15 the woman on the reception desk was obnoxious and rude to me and a woman and her children. She was raging about how she couldn't bring her kids in and it wasn't her fault the person the day before didn't do their job properly. I was exhausted just listening to the argument so skipped the gym and headed back to my room. No shower gel, just a bar of soap and to my delight no towels, so I ended up having to dry myself with tiny hand towels, it took 15mins for room service to deliver some towels by which time it was too late. And no apology!!! Breakfast was in keeping with most Hilton's a large variety but incredibly expensive with tip it was $40 if I were you I would get breakfast elsewhere around the area, rather than wasting your cash here. I decided to check out early and head to Boston early so I didn't have to stay here another night.

Staff at the front desk, concierge and executive lounge were uniformly helpful and friendly. We stayed in a room with 2 double beds and while not luxurious large, was more then adequate for our family. It looked newly remodelled and was crisp and clean. The TV was an awesome HD set. Of course being in NYC the point is to get out and about and the hotel is well located for this. Its a quick 2 block walk to Rockefeller Center, close to the theater district, MoMA and Time Square - but not so close to it to be sucked into the craziness there. Its a quick walk to subway lines downtown or crosstown. My only - very minor - compliant was using the elevators to get to the executive lounge was a hassle. The Hilton Honors floors were 8 & 9 and I was on 10. The elevators ran in 3 or 4 soerat banks that went to different floors. I had to take an elevator down to the lobby or fitness center then catch another elevator up to the lounge on 44. Some busy mornings that coud be 10 minute trip. It would be nice to have direct access to the lounge from the HHonors floors. I have to say the view was worth the ride as you can sit in one corner of the lounge and see into central park, or the other look down 6th Ave at the Radio City Music hall.

I have read the reviews on the New York Hilton prior to staying there in December 2011. I feel many people are very critical. What I can say is this, my family had the very best time while we stayed at the Hilton New York. We had a 2 double bed suite on the executive floor. We were surprised to find a Christmas tree in our room as we arrived along with ornaments and small presents for our children by the tree. We were also welcomed by fresh cookies, milk, and Dilan's Candy bar as well. We were called every day to see if we needed anything by the managers! The executive lounge was busy at Christmas, but not an issue and the food was out of this world! In closing, believe me Hilton knows how to take care of its customers.

There was no shaving mirror in my room and the person to whom I made a complaint just said that \"some rooms do not have shaving mirrors\". So , I went to the drugstore next door and bought one for 12 dollars. The maid seervice is fast but polite. The wallpaper in the bathroom needed serious fixing. Another negative issue lies in the fact that the coffee-shop closes at 2.00 pm and, after that time, you have to go out to eat. Their italian restaurant is so-so and only opens for dinner.

There is an excellent breakfasr servIce in hotel where you are presented with a choice of continental breakfasts or full breakfasts which range from abouT 14 - 23 USD, continental breakfast at 17 USD was more than ample and we all took that every day of our stay. There is also a Starbucks and take away available in the hotel. Free internet acces is available in the huge hotel lobby but not enough seats for the demand to the extent people were camped out on the floor which was a bit off putting on arrival. i found if you went down to the lobby and logged onto to the free wi fi, you were given one hour's access which still connected in my room. For a worthwhile and informative city tour I would recommend the \"see it all\" tour with \"On Board City Tours\" where the local guide gets off the coach with your group(about 20) and talks you around the attractions and water taxi and gives loads of informal snippets of wisdom.

Executive King size bedroom. We recognized the hotel in earlier visits to but never took the chance to stay at the hilton. Checkin in we saw a long line of guest at the reservation desks but clearly structured by normal, HHonors, diamond etc...., so queueing up at one line it was not so long waiting time. We checked in, got a room and went up to the room. First impression: clean room, standard equipped with king bed, desk with chair, LAN cable + wireless, an armchair and very small sidedesk. The bathroom was very clean, this is something i highly appreciat. Nothing unclean, everything fresh. The room was actually not like the photo on the website (booking.com), difference was the missing seperate seating area and coffeetable. What hit me with a little surprise was that everybody, from the doorman to the room service staff was extremely friendly. A short hello, a wellcome to new york, even in the floor when we arrived at the room, the staff cleaning the floor and some rooms, they looked up, said hello and asked if we need assistance. Very very nice experience, especially after at least mor than ten stays in different hotels in manhatten we also experienced at some hotels a little of an arrogant attitude, even in very expensive hotels. Not at that hilton. So this was a very positive! After a while at the room, i decided to go down to the reception and ask about our reservation and the difference to the shown photo on the booking website. I had a printout of the reservation with photo so i asked the frontdesk about the difference. i was told that this is very often the case and that she was very sorry, but can't do anything about it because the hotel was fully sold out. Reason why I asked was, that the trip was one and a half months after our wedding and supposed to be a short honeymoon trip. I mentioned that but also said that I understand that we booked exactly the room we got only the photo was misleading. But surprise, the lady offered me a free wireless for some days, since she was sorry not beeing able to help with another room. Great gift, since the price for wireless lan is somehow from the stone age like 15$ per day. So we went out for shopping and sightseeing the next day, and afterr returning in the evening we found a surprise gift in the room: a bottle of sparkling wine, two champaign glasses and a card from the front desk wishing us a wonderful stay and all the best for our marriage. This was very nice and hit us by surprise. Why the big surprise on our side? Taking into account that the hotel was so crowded by tourists and visitors, long queues at the front desk and so also a little hectic with argueing guests and whatever, the staff always stayed very friendly and in our case even was very sensitive in listening. Aft that story a little more on the location. There is more or less no better location if you are in manhattan for shopping and the usual sightseeing. MoMa is just 50meters around the corner, 5th ave and park you can reach within minutes. Even a nice deli is just opposite the hotel, like a starbucks in the hotel and another one opposite the street. Some ok restaurants are also close by. A walk to columbus circle is also only some ten , and then you're just about to enter central park. Subway stations close by to take you downtown or wherever. Executive room comes with an access to the executive level lounge. There you're offered breakfast everymorning. If hotel is very crowded go an check for breakfast early (opens at 6.30 if i remember correctly), so beeing there at 8 to 9 is ok but later you might have to wait untill seated because lounge is full. Some postings here already mentioned the elevators. Yes you sometimes have to wait, but even when the hotel is very full around holidays waiting time still was ok. There are three express elevators to the floors 40-44, which shortens waiting time. Taking the stairs to exec level (in our case room was located on floor 41, exec lounge is on 43) is much quicker than waiting. So all together, even if you are not a fan of business hotels or bigger hotel chains, this hotel was a great experience we did not expect.

Cereals were eaten with teaspoons, no dessert spoons were supplied. The milk was in an unmarked jug, full-fat, half-fat, who knows? The cooked food was canteen standard.

Location 2. Personnel and service 3. Room and amenities 4. Food and other services \u00c2\u00a0 The Hilton New York gets my 4 stars for location and personnel/services and 3 stars for the rest. \u00c2\u00a0 Our hotel was on 6th Ave. and 53rd street - right at the center of things. A few blocks from Central Park, a block away from the shops and sights of 5th Ave. and just a 10 minute brisk walk to the theaters along 42nd - 44th Sts. and 7th avenue. But far enough from the hectic hustle and bustle of the Tie of Broadway. At 6th and 7th avenue, from e Hilton New York, one could access two different subway lines bringing you to different parts of the city. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Right when you arrive, the hotel personnel make every effort to distinguish themselves ( attentive and courteous) from other hotels' personnel (isn't this the customer service)? Despite\u00c2\u00a0the hectic holidays, the still managed to smile. Despite the fact that we took a broadway.com promo (hotel plus theater show), I didn't feel any discrimination. We were treated as regular paying guests. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0However, the Hilton is a business hotel. Elegant not opulent, classy but not cold. Rooms were 3/5 and I've been in much more better ones but just right enough for a stay in NYC. Our standard double bed room was just right. Mattresses were comfortable and linens were changed everyday on request (environmental concern). Bathroom amenities were of standard fare. Don't intend to open the room fridge and replace what you've gotten as weight sensors automatically charge you once item are removed. I get a USA today. Room service is prompt and the persons answering are helpful and courteous ( very much unlike the European hotels I've stayed at) and this I've got to hand it over to the Americans (at least at the Hilton).\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0The only thing at struck me was that, if you looked closely, the paint was peeling off at certain places and some of the \u00c2\u00a0door edges bear signs of wear and tear. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0There is no free wifi in the rooms. It's a LAN there which you have to pay for. Free wifi is at the lobby and you have to go down for this. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 Food for breakfast was standard but I think they included some Miso soup and congee for their Asian guests but buffet breakfasts at the Shang ri la in Manila could beat this hands down any day of the week. What the Hilton lacked in food offerings were offset (again) by the head waiters and servers being so attentive and courteous. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 Will I come back? Yes!

This is what I have to say about Hilton new York: Pros: great location for tourist as it's at the centre of every place of interest. Cons: no matter which level of membership you are either walk in, gold or diamond, no difference. The waiting time for check in counter at hhonors or diamond counter was so much longer than the usual counter. I am a diamond member and believe me this doesn't mean anything at all. Upon check in we asked for a nice room and was told that the room assigned to us was nice. When we walked into the room, to our horror, it was so dim even we switched on all the lights and the bathroom was so pathetic. The furniture was so old that you can smell it. Looks no diff from any 3 star hotel actually. No upgrade at all. So we went down back to the front desk to complain and she gave us a much better renovated room. Still the bathroom is so tiny. Don't understand why she couldn't give us this room from the beginning. Have a feeling that the staff will try their luck to give away the old ugly rooms first and hope the guest will just accept it without any complaint. It's wasting so much of our time on queueing to changing room etc. The hotel is seriously under staffed as we had problem getting through our calls to concierge especially. The lobby was really busy and crazy. Morning breakfast was chaotic and we decided to take away from second day onwards. On check out day, we were being approached by a man before the taxi queue to tell us that we can take his town car to JFK airport at $69 instead of the usual $85 cuz he give special rate to Hilton guest. We were made to understand that was hotel limousine so we took his car. As usual the taxi queue was chaotic. Upon arrival at the airport, he told us that total should be $69+tax+toll fee+20% tipping. We really felt that it was a rip off and the hotel staff should have control over this kind of crooks that hang around and behave like he is from the hotel limousine service. He seemed to know the hotel bell boy well and tipped him when we went into his car. Overall, you should stay in this hotel only for it's location purpose, and don't expect anything else from them.

The taxi ride from JFK was filled with excitement and nervousness. This was New York City. I'd been dreaming about coming here since I was watching Sesame Street! There is a flat-rate fee of $45.00 now (excluding tip), from JFK to Manhattan, which was very lucky. I was there right after a public holiday and the traffic was terrible. My driver tells me it would have cost me well over $100 if not for the flat-rate. Phew! Finally, I arrived at the Hilton New York. I was early for check in, and told to check my bags and come back at 12:30 and it should be ready. So I wandered around the surrounding area for about an hour and a half, and boy, was this a good location. Having a great central location and being a 'safe option' were high on the list when doing my research, and the Hilton was a good choice. In that short time while waiting for my room to be ready, I had seen the LOVE sculpture, sussed out where the MoMA was (for another day), ate a pretzel, stumbled upon Radio City Music Hall, which lead me to Rockefeller Centre and the Plaza was all being set up for the winter ice skating, NBC's news studio, the LEGO store, NewsCorp headquarters (in the midst of the phone-hacking scandal, it was a media circus!). I trotted back to the Hilton at exactly 12:30, and the big beaming smile of the lady at the check-in desk ushered me over and had everything ready to go. Such lovely staff, especially for New York. The room was quite small, and was decorated as though I'd stepped back into my grandmothers house, 20 years ago. Very 'old-fashioned' style. Hear me clear, it wasn't old or out-dated, it was just that regal, old-style of decor. Maybe I'm just too young to appreciate it, but it wasn't anything to write home about. The bath was TINY. The water level wasn't even over my legs before the overflow plug was reached. Mini-bar was extortionate. But hey, this is New York City... I wasn't here to sit in the room! Don't you dare get in a taxi from this hotel, unless it's more that a 20 minute walk! I saw so much of the city by walking everywhere. Times Square, Broadway are about 10 minutes walking away, and Central Park about 15. I never ate, drank or ordered room service, so I can't comment. In summary, it was a great experience, it was a huge, busy, grand hotel, in a wonderful location. That being said, I did come across some other hotels on my walking about, that were on my list which were much cheaper, and had just as good a location. Would I return to the Hilton New York?

I cannot say enough about this hotel--from start to finish, the staff went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied. When I made reservations online a couple of months ago, I requested a refrigerator in our room for medicine. When we checked in, the clerk noted that request and told us that our refrigerator was already in the room. We got to our room, and it wasn't there, so I called down. The customer service agent was most apologetic and said the refrigerator would be there in a matter of minutes. He called again in five minutes to check, and I told him that it had not arrived. He apologized profusely, then told me it would be there ASAP. It was there momentarily, and the young man who installed it was most polite. We received another called within 5 minutes, checking to see if the refrigerator was there yet. I'd say this all transpired within 15 minutes of our checkin. We were given a handicapped accessible room (although we didn't request one) on the 10th floor. The bathroom was a little larger than in standard rooms (I had stayed in this hotel before). Our room contained two double beds and was plenty large enough for the two of us. The location of this hotel can't be beat. It's on 6th Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) between 53rd and 54th street. Radio City is two blocks away. Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral are just a few blocks away as well. There are two subway stations on 7th Avenue and 53rd, which was very convenient. Broadway and Times Square are closeby, as is Central Park. Again, you couldn't ask for a better location!! Neat factoid: the Ziegfeld Theatre is right next door on 54th Street. It is an old-time movie theater, and while we were there, Tom Cruise's new \"Mission Impossible\" movie premiered there....red carpet, tv crews, papparazzi, etc. From what I've read, seeing a movie at this theatre is a real treat, although we didn't have time to do that. Maybe our next trip!! The one downside to this hotel is its bar. We were looking to have nice cocktails in an upscale atmosphere during our trip. One night, The Bridge Bar was not even open, only the Lobby Bar, which is where we went. We were NOT impressed with the selection of cocktails or the quality of them. The following night, The Bridge Bar was open, but it was the same menu...so we left and walked up 54th to The London hotel, where we had our nice cocktails in a great place....but the lounges were the only blip on our otherwise fantastic stay at this hotel. Also, next door on 53rd, there is a deli that is open 24 hours--it has really good prices and good food. We used it several times....and there is also a food cart that had a long line non-stop...from what I've read it's fairly famous. Here's a word of advice: check the room prices occasionally after you book. The hotel is not cheap--we paid $369 a night for a deluxe room. I originally booked in Sept. for $419 a night, but checked Hilton's website from time to time.

For an NYC room, this was a spacious two double bed affair. Outside of NYC hotel rooms being too noisey, this is my second pet peeve...too tiny. So far , we were relieved on both counts.

Our room had the toilet paper holder way way to close to the toilet to the point where it was uncomfortable to use the toilet.

The laundry was 12 hours late and was only delivered after 10 phone calls with incompetent employees which all had major attitudes. To make things worse a random cleaning lady literally walked in the room without knocking one evening, and when she realized the room was not empty she mumbled something about checking to make sure we are ok and then she more or less stormed out.

After checking in we walked into our room and were amazed how nice it was. After unpacking we headed down to the concierge desk for some information on what clubs or bars we should hit up that night. Thankfully we had a great Concierge by the name of Winny who told us what the hot places were with only a couple blocks from the hotel. Her directions were flawless and made our long day a great night. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel, set aside from our evening on Sunday night at the hotel. My friends and I stopped by the concierge desk again and unfortunately Winny was not there, but another concierge greeted us warmly by the name of Eugenia. As we began to talk we told her where we wanted to go and she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure of the exact location, which is fine because I myself a concierge at another hotel based out of Chicago doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always know where everything is in such a big city. After Eugenia printed us off the directions she explained what train to take vaguely (later getting lost for about an hour because she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specific enough on what train to take). But what really got me upset was the fact that she mentioned an ignorant comment about people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak English. She said she cannot stand when guests don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak English because she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand. I was confused why she would say this because as a concierge in a popular tourist city, being ignorant to others inability to speak clear English is very unprofessional, and the hospitality industry is no place for someone like that.

During our last stay, a worker up on the roof accidentally spilt some very powerful substance that smelled like a harsh industrial chemical of some sort and it went into the air duct. The overpowering smell woke everyone up and some had to briefly leave the hotel; the fire department showed up because it was a HazMat spill. After an hour or so they had it cleaned up. These things happen. We did not complain when we checked out on schedule but did mention it to the customer service rep at the front desk (we asked what the smell was from), and she instantly removed quite a bit of money from our bill.

Warning: the lounge can be packed at breakfast, so much so that there can be a line to get in.

The Hilton has more business travelers and fewer of the tourists and high school bus trips that I encountered in the Sheraton. So I give the Hilton a plus in that department. Two things were negative for me at the Hilton. First, the rooms that I was in on two seperate stays are quite old. The bedspreads and all that was new, but the bathrooms are old. Everything from the height of the ceiling to the showerhead to the fixtures is dated. It all functions, but for $450 a night I expect better.

The attitude from this person is they are somewhat inconvenienced by your presence. Then one morning I came into the Lounge to use the computers and one was not working. I asked the monitor for help and she again had a bad attitude. I suspect that the bad attitude may be a result of a number of people trying to \"crash\" the lounge, but that does not excuse it.

We arrived at 1am which we had notified them of this prior as we had a late flight. Check-In was smooth and easy. We arrived in our room to find a terrible smell, it was smoke like so we rang to tell them of this their answer was to come up and spray it with a peach smell spray which made it worse it stunk they would not change us rooms so we had to put up with it which I found really hard. If we had not pre paid for the hotel I would have found somehwere else. I took my shoes off to find that the carpet was sticky not just in one spot the entire carpet was like this so I had to wear my shoes from the bathroom to the bed because of the dirty feeling. I layed down on the pillow to find it smelt of vomit so we left the pillow with a note the next morning. And the beds are really uncomfortable because the bed rolled in to the middle. Which had us amost on top of each other. We had to keep the window open because of the smell which had its downside the noise. It was really old and rundown with rust and paint peeling in the bath room. The functionallity of the bathroom was terrible fancy putting a bench above a toilet. Lets just say my kids managed to knock a few things in there while they were going to the toilet. There was also very little space to put our things in the bathroom. On our first night when we arrived at 1am we forgot to put the do not disturb sign on but you would think they would have let housekeeping know that we only arrived a few hours ago at 9am they were at our door. The other thing that I found a problem we booked for 2 adults 2 children but in our room they only had 3 towels. Now I dont think its that hard to provide enough towels when we have said how many people were staying. We were then made feel like a hassle asking for another towel. They also charge per bag to hold your bag. If we had thought about it we could have held our room for 4 more hours as we checked out at 9am so they could have access to the room but when we went to put our bags in we were charged 3.50 per bag. To add to the terrible stay I had just bought a new suitcase a samsonite hardcase and when we went to get in the taxi even through my husband went to do it himself the bellman threw it in the cab putting a huge deep 5cm gash in the case.

We got free coffee and a pastry for each day we were there. It allowed us to get a light b-fast for free, avoiding the overpriced buffet. - Halal food cart is right across the street. Long lines all day & nite (it moves fast) - but good food. - Housekeeping was nice. They had no problem giving us plenty of towels. Disikes: - Double beds!!! I don't see why hotels use these as its impossible for 2 adults to sleep in them (and we are thin people). This room was big enough for 2 queen beds. - High charges for internet service. $15 for a \"basic\" connection - WTF! I know hotels are doing this more - but it really makes me angry. - Breakfast in their cafeteria/restaurant is expensive - even for NY. - Concierge was rude to us. We asked a simple question about car service to LaGuaridia and she answered us with a ton of attitude that wasn't necessary.

I arrived on a rainy evening, and porters immediately helped me and my belongings out of my taxi. Check in, considering it was the eve of a major conference at the hotel, was almost instant. The lobby was packed with people, including some guests that seemed to linger making use of the free wifi for their ipads, but I was able to cross the bright, low-ceilinged lobby quickly to my elevator. I got a room on the 15th floor which is actually handy as it is served by 2 sets of lifts. The room was not large but perfectly adequate to my needs, and was spotless, clean and had the typical contemporary Hilton decor with light wood tones and a good chair for my desk and a bed that was perfect (I fell asleep in my street clothes when I lay down, having arrived from Hong Kong). There are lots of great restaurants nearby, it is great for meetings, shopping (there are 24 hour drugstores and supermarkets), or shows between 56th and Times Square. The staff seemed quite accommodating to both leisure and business travelers, and that is probably the most attractive aspect of this hotel. It actually is a great choice for midtown, and all the boutique hotels in the neighborhood should take a close look at themselves and ensure they are offering both a competitive and differentiated full service experience if they plan to charge a $100 premium.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cExtraordinary Help in time of Personal Crisis\u201d", "Author": "sgapdx", "ReviewID": "UR118291074", "Content": "As part of the Oregon Flight for Freedom, I stayed at the Hilton NY from September 8, to September 14, 2011, in room 4034.

LOCATION: The flagship Hilton New York is a colossal 2000+ room convention hotel housed in a massive building on 6th Avenue [Avenue of the Americas] at 54th Street. Its location is probably its strongest point: across the street from the Museum of Modern Art, a block from shopping on Fifth Avenue, a few blocks south of Central Park and surrounded by restaurants, bars, shops, badly-needed/overpriced parking lots and signature New York City sights. Everything you need to see is all wonderfully close by. John F. Kennedy International Airport is 45 minutes to an hour away. ENTRANCE/LOBBY: Seeing as this is a huge hotel catering to huge events and huge number of visitors every hour, the lobby is expectedly huge. The space was renovated a few years ago and looks the upscale part as it should, but the waiting times to check in at the reception can sometimes take upwards of half an hour due to long queues. The staff handle their weight very well given the pressure they work under, with the entire check-in process taking no longer than ten minutes. ROOMS: Since there are about 45 floors in the hotel [give or take], elevators to the rooms are split into four banks of three elevators each, with each bank of elevators servicing specific floors [i.e. one elevator bank would go to floors 2-15, while the other went from 16-30, etc.]. This is convenient since it greatly eases the load of guests and visitors ferrying about, but can be a bit confusing to those not used to the system. Also, the hotel has been in the process of renovating their rooms, something which has taken a few years. Be sure to specify a renovated room at reservation or check-in; they're far better than their tattier, worn down predecessors. We were given two renovated, interconnecting rooms [king/double] on the twelfth floor. They were predominantly decorated in beige with white and red touches; very contemporary and relaxing. There are large windows that stare out into neighboring office buildings and the New York skyline/streetscape. Also, these rooms were HUGE by New York standards, with plenty of space to navigate around the beds, a real working desk and plenty of storage space seen in counters and drawers below the television and decent closet space. Unfortunately however, the bathrooms were tiny; this IS New York, after all. The three-piece bathrooms have a toilet, sink and either a bathtub or a glass shower. Counter space is tight and water pressure is mediocre to slightly above average, with moderately hot water available at all times. Another quibble has to do with the bed; although they're Hilton's patented Serenity Beds, all the traffic that these beds have seen resulted in the mattresses being very worn out, complete with body indents and lumpy bits. The pillows are fine, though. On the plus side, tea and coffee are replenished every morning and evening, so coffee junkies like myself can gorge themselves to a hot, free cup of Lavazza whenever the urge strikes. FOOD/BEVERAGE: We ate breakfast at the hotel's main restaurant two of the five nights we were there. The quality of the food is just above average at best, but there is a good selection of yogurt, baked goods and cereals. Also, the egg station is good since everything is made to order. There is a Starbucks in the building with direct access to the lobby, so this can come in particularly handy. There's also a deli across the street from the Starbucks, but none of us checked it out. Room service is decent; dinner arrived at our room within 30 minutes of being ordered and was hot and well-prepared. LEISURE: There is a gym in the hotel, but access to it is paid; we didn't use it throughout the duration of our stay. There is no pool. FACILITIES: The hotel has several floors above the lobby dedicated to meeting rooms and ballrooms, and these see tremendous use all year round. There is complimentary wireless Internet in the lobby, with paid access in the guest rooms. Consequently, you'll find throngs of people packing any available lobby furniture and even curled up in corners and on the floor harnessing their MacBooks and iPads at all times of the day and night. SERVICE: The Hilton's service is fantastic given the load that these people are subjected to on an hourly basis. They're efficient, to-the-point and still manage to flash smiles and crack jokes. The concierge also handles reservations for Broadway shows and tourist trips, saving time for visitors and making things oh-so-simple. Good on you, team. OVERALL: The [renovated] rooms are very good, the quality of food needs to improve and be prepared to battle hordes of people; this is not a hotel for the claustro/agoraphobic. That being said, however, this hotel's strongest selling point is its location, so visitors to New York will not be disappointed since the property puts them in the center of all the action.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cA pretty nice hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "Bunnydots", "ReviewID": "UR118205526", "Content": "Hilton Honors member.

I got a room with my club points for one night in order to get to an early appointment in the neighborhood. Although I'm used to the lobby here being very busy with long lines, I was able to get service almost right away at the HHonors desk and without asking was given a free upgrade to the Executive floor, which also includes a free continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge. My room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and everything was in good working order, which I appreciated. I especially liked the Internet access which worked very well, even for high-speed applications like watching videos, and was complimentary for HHonors members. The included breakfast was good despite the lack of any hot food, and the executive lounge offers a wonderful view to eat it. I appreciated the tables facing out windows so solo business travelers like me can enjoy the view and don't have to worry about sharing tables.

There is also a halal cart by the deli that, judging by its lines some nights, must be one of the better ones.

It is a large, bustling hotel and one can often feel like a rushed number instead of a valued guest. It seems to be geared to business and conferences, and likely is not a great choice for families (especially young children). The staff are generally very friendly and accommodating, but when unable to deal with issues will just blame the hotel's size and capacity for issues. Waiting for elevators (to go up, or go down) has been an issue every time we have stayed in this hotel, and often gets quite irritating. The elevator noise travels pretty far too, we moved rooms twice and despite having four rooms between us and the elevators were still subjected to elevator noise constantly. On my behalf my wife booked two rooms for this trip, one for us and the other for my in-laws. Despite checking in with my HHonors card, I'm still waiting for my points. Room wise, having stayed in both Queen and King rooms I would urge potential guests (if possible) to book a King room, the Queen rooms can be a bit small and the Queen beds seem to be a bit smaller than usual. Smallish beds and elevator noise did not make for as restful a night as hoped. The rooms are comfortable, but need some updating. While everything is functional, it just seems to be one step away from needing to be replaced. The plumbing system seems to be a bit strained, and in both the rooms our family had there were issues with basins and baths not draining. The mini-bar is quite basic (and New York pricey), and ours had several items past their sell by date (we had this same issue during a stay in January 2011) since the cleaning staff check the mini-bars daily this simply should not occur. The fitness centre requires payment or Hilton HHonors Silver or Gold status, at $15 a visit I found it quite irritating that the hotel did not provide a fitness centre for guests without payment or status. After complaining I was granted access, and was very pleased with the fitness centre. It is very well appointed, with friendly staff, high quality machines, and a good mix of cardio and weight training equipment. Wi-Fi needs to be paid for (seriously, in this day and age, complimentary wi-fi should be standard). All in all, the Hilton is comfortable and clean. It is not a welcoming hotel and feels formulaic at times. Despite four stays at this property over the past two years, I'm in two minds as to whether I'll return, it's missing the welcoming feel I expect at a hotel. Another reason could be that a front desk staff member basically stated that Hampton Inn provides more than Hilton - not quite delivering on the brand promise. You'll likely not be disappointed after your stay and the New York Hilton, but then again you'll likely not be impressed either, but I do hope they improve as the location and potential in this hotel is immense.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haywards Heath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWe were very pleased with the helpfulness of the staff\u201d", "Author": "mike c", "ReviewID": "UR117748552", "Content": "My wife and I joined up with our daughter, her partner and our two-year-old granddaughter from Australia for a six night stay last month.

See the attached photos. There was at least 3-4 months worth of dust on top of the fire alarm. The wallpaper in the rooms had clearly visible dirty fingerprints all over it. In places the wallpaper was torn and poorly patched. This was not limited to our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hallway walls were severely banged up with divots missing from the wall and black streaks from where the rubber bumpers of luggage and cleaning carts had rubbed against it. Part of this is due to the age, it is in desperate need of renovations. But a larger part is due in my mind to a clear and severe lack of direction and management from higher up. Dirty linen would be left on the floor in the hallways for up to 9hrs. A dirty glass was left on the counter at the end of the hallway for 2 days! While waiting for the elevator I saw and elderly man having trouble getting his cardkey to work in his door. He asked in broken English to a maid for help. She pointed to the phone outside the elevator and told him to call the front desk! This is supposed to be 4 star hotel? It was clear the man could barely speak English and even if he could the maid should have walked over to the phone and called the front desk herself to ask for help. If I was upper management at Hilton I would fire every manager in this hotel. If they were actually supervising they would address these deficiencies and instil a culture of service and quality. This is obvious not an isolated situation, browsing though photos on tripadvisor shows numerous other examples. I have never seen anything like this. I will no longer book at any Hilton but will stick with the Sheraton and the Marriot where I have never had such an issue.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cI expect better\u201d", "Author": "Gerard-advisor", "ReviewID": "UR117711486", "Content": "Toilets don't flush properly, annoying loud speaker and LCD screen in th lift will drive you crazy.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasanton, California", "Title": "\u201cGood, but could have been better!\u201d", "Author": "SKG109", "ReviewID": "UR117567595", "Content": "We were supposed to stay there fro four nights, unfortunately Hurricane Irene cut short our visit and we were gone in two days.

Executive lounge was very different to European versions. Size was the first thing- it was exceedingly large, but with a drawback that it was noisy with lots of families using the lounges, so sitting quietly reading or working was impossible. The lounge does charge for alcoholic drinks, which is very different to European Hiltons. The deluxe room is tastefully decorated and had a queen sofa bed for extra guests if required. Lavazza coffee maker in room, but with dried creamer instead of half and half. Bed was exceedingly comfortable with very fancy LCD reading lights. The shallow American bath has been replaced with a spacious shower cubicle with a monsoon shower head! During Irene I needed to book a room on a night-for-night basis and the Executive staff at the front desk were exemplary. Special praise should go to Giovanny and Kelly who were exceedingly helpful. They had a lot to put up with checking in evacuees and stranded guests. I had to change rooms twice during the last part of the stay due to the day-by-day reservation as the airlines reworked schedules. I was offered a corner suite which offered a three window view out to the encroaching hurricane! Very enjoyable to watch as a rookie! The suite was not as up-to-date as the deluxe room decor but very comfortable too!

The suites are on the Executive Level, which I now highly recommend! Also, the location is indeed perfect, close to everything in Midtown Manhattan. We stayed from August 6 through the 9th, on the 43rd floor. I was absolutely delighted with the wonderful service. Yes, it's a big hotel, so you don't always expect that. Everyone was friendly, from front desk to housekeeping, and quick to respond to any request. Whenever I had to call customer service from the room the phone was answered at the first ring - impressive! We needed the bedding for the fold out bed - I called and it was at the door in FIVE minutes. Couldn't believe it! The One Bedrooom Suite with two double beds was HUGE. A living room with couch and chairs, large TV, executive desk, kitchenette, closets - and a spacious bedroom with two beds, another TV, a sparkling clean bathroom.AND a big walk in closet! The beds were so comfortable I want to buy one for my home. Really! AND all three of us were thrilled with the complimentary Executive Lounge that's included with the Executive Level Suites. To be honest, I thought that meant a small room with a coffee urn and some cookies. Not! It's a beautiful large space on the 44th floor, windows line both sides of the room, it's like walking into a penthouse restaurant. All the hosts were so nice, it was furnished beautifully, and the food was wonderful - such a selection! - and the view!! -as I said, I felt like I was in a multi-million dollar penthouse. The breakfast was expansive and so nicely presented - fruit, bagels, pastries, breads, spreads, and more. And for two hours in the evening they offer a complimentary hors d'oeuvres buffet - dim sum and shrimp! Crackers and cheese and lots more. There's bar service in the evening (bar service is the only thing you have to pay for), so before I went to the theatre I stopped in for a glass of wine and some nice appetizers, sat at my favorite window seat that looks down on Central Park, and considered myself very lucky! We felt like privileged guests, it really was wonderful.

This evening we returned home from our yearly jaunt into NYC for our daughter's dance gig at Radio City. I was thinking on our ride home that I really needed to drop someone a note to let them know how wonderful your hotel is.....each and every visit. We always stay at the Hilton New York, as the location is just perfect for the daily back and forth to Radio City. We have been coming for three or four years and each time we visit we are greeted by a perfectly professional front desk staff, always accommodating parking garage staff, courteous housekeeping folks, etc. Each and every Hilton employee with whom we have had contact has made our stay enjoyable and made us feel like we were an important guest. What capped it all off and made me write this note to you at 11:00 pm, is my phone conversation this evening with Emmanual Issaka. Upon returning home this evening, I realized that I had left a number of items in the bottom drawer of the bureau in our room. My son was devastated, as two of the items were new shirts he had purchased from the NBC store. I told him I would call the hotel right away, but not to get his hopes up. My call was transferred to Mr. Issaka, who could immediately confirm that the items had been recovered and that he would be able to send them to me with a quick exchange of a credit card number to cover the postage costs. He then phoned me back within ten minutes to relay the tracking number. I was astonished at the that level of service and at this hour. He was professional and courteous, just as every other employee always is. I assume you must get tons of emails on a daily basis and I am not sure this will even grace your desk, but I hope it does. You have a wonderful hotel that has become a tradition in our house. We look forward to our trip there every year. This year we even stayed for the entire six-day journey. That is not easy for our family to afford, but it is worth every penny. You can't put a price on the service and comfort you afford us on each visit.

Chose it because of the location at 6th Avenue, very close to Times Square and Central Park. Overall, we loved the hotel, very friendly staff, good rooms. Hotel: The location is perfect, only 10 minutes walk to Broadway and Central Park. The hotel is very big, 44 floors, huge lobby. Out first impression was very positive, warm welcome at reception. Lobby and bar in very good condition. Room: Because this was a trip for my birthday and friends joining us, who have never been to NY, I sent a Fax to the hotel, that we would highly appreciate a room on a high floor. At check-in we were informed, that we got an upgrade to executive floor rooms on 41 and 44 floor with access to the Executive lounge. Rooms are very nice, not too big but very comfortable, great beds. Air condition is silent and working great. They are currently renovating the rooms, but we were glad having a not renovated room. Typical Hilton rooms, thick, draped curtains, nice wallpaper. Everything very well maintained. Only negative issue: The walls are really paper thin, one night we had loud neighbours and we thought they are with us in the room. Lounge: We had access to the executive lounge on 44 floor, free continental breakfast, non-alcoholic drings, free internet. Great view over New York. Only negative issue, they close at 10.30 PM and really kick our people. They could just close the bar and keep lounge open to continue work on the PC's. Staff: Entire staff was really nice and helpful. Restaurant/Bars: We did not use the restaurant, but there is a Starbucks in the Lobby and the Cocktail Bar on Ground floor was very nice. Good drinks and casual atmosphere.

We had 2 rooms booked through a deal prepaid on a travel website. We were a little upset that we did not get adjoining rooms as requested, but the hotel was very accomodating to get us as close together as possible. We checked in and within 15 mins, the people in the room between us complained to security about how \"loud\" we were (it was 4pm on a Thursday). So we went down to the front desk and explained the situation, and they not only happily moved our rooms, but upgraded us to higher floor and larger rooms. PROS Excellent location. Easy walk to Central Park, Times Square, Shopping on 5th Ave, Rockerfeller Center. Bar service was friendly and fast. Try the Long Island Mojito at the lobby bar. And complimentary yummy chips that the waiter kept refilling. Our 2nd room was spacious (corner) with a great view. Beds were comfy. Starbucks in the hotel was nice, although there is nearly one on every corner anyway! CONS Bathrooms in every room were TINY. Hardly any counter space. Elevators were a little slow. Not horribly. But a little. Starbucks employees (inside the hotel) were grouchy & rude. WIFI not free...nor was it cheap. Note: We did not use the workout facilities or eat at the hotel since we were out and about a lot so I cannot comment on those. OVERALL - I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. It was a great stay. I'll review the restaurants we ate at separately, but here they are in summary: The Eatery, Tao, Otto's Pizzeria & Enoteca. We also did the Today Show (Kenny Chesney concert) and it was really worth getting up at 5am.

This stay was from 30th May to 4th June 2011. We stayed last year and was so impressed we booked again this year. Our stay in NYC was for the purpose of getting married. We married in Central Park and had dinner on a boat cruise. Inbetween this I liaised with a wonderful lady who worked at the Hilton called Hope Boorojian. I wanted a relaxed couple of hours in the bar with our guests. The Hilton were so accomodating. I asked for a wedding cake and a few savoury nibbles and if the bar staff would mind hosting a champagne toast for us. Well what can I say but the Hilton went above and beyond expectations. On arrival at the Hotel we had champagne and strawberries awaiting in our large clean room. We then met with Hope who ran through a few things with us and was so lovely and listened. On the day of the wedding the Hotel sent flowers to my room. The pastry chef made the most beatiful wedding cake in Ivory icing and the inside was moist and light. This was placed on a huge silver cake stand and small tealight candles lite are reception area in the bar. On all the tables were nibbles and the most gorgeaous range of crudities and dips. The hotel had left us a gift and card on the table next to the cake. They had also provided lovely side plates , silver wear and good quality napkins. All these extras I did not ask for but were provided without charge. The bar staff kept our guests happy and we were kept up to date on the amount being spent. The final bill was very reasonable and I would recommend anyone wanting to marry in NYC contact the Hilton and ask for Hope Boorojian. A lovely touch was the General Manager coming and congratulating us along with the restaurant manager. Cant wait to go back . There is no were better to stay and to top it off the hotel is in the perfect location. Do not listen to the negative reviews. Make your own mind up as I chose it for my wedding this hotel is definately one of the best. We chose this hotel as last years stay was so wonderful we could not imagine staying anywhere else while in NYC.

If you check out in the morning, make sure you have enough time to wait for the elevator, or be prepared to walk down the stairs yourself. On the day of checking out, housekeepers were knocking our door loud around 8:30AM and about entering our room. I had to shout loud:\" We are checking out today\" before they went away.

When checking out at the front desk, the lady must had a bad day, because there was no friendly greeting such as \"how is your stay?\".

I am a long time, loyal HiltonHonors guest and this trip with the family was with 50,000 Honors pts earned over the past year. I chose this Hilton over the other Hilton Properties near Time Square (Doubletree, Hilton Time Square, and the Hampton Inn) mainly because of Nostalgia. When I was to work in Manhattan I used to stay at this hotel regularly when it was Hilton Rockfeller Plaza. Sadly, the Hilton NY isn't what it used to be - both in the rooms and the particularly this time around the service. I will NEVER return to this Hilton again when I visit NY for both personal and work trips. This I would have to say is the single worst experience I've had with any hotel as I was treated as a criminal (actually got the hotel security involved) by the overly obnoxious Bell Captain and the hotel security guard when I attempted to retrieve my belongings from one of his carts without his authorization (even though I had asked the front desk and they said it was perfectly fine). To keep it short, I did not appreciate being treated this way by a HOTEL I WAS STAYING at and it escalated into discussions with the front desk and manager on duty. To be fair, they were at least professional and accomadating and made every attempt to recover (including refunding my honors points). Sadly, though that really wasn't nearly enough to get over the fact that I was treated as a thug by one of hotels staff. And I probably would not have noticed the dingy, fraying carpet on the 17th floor, the lack of bottled water (which is provided to Honors members of status), the lukewarm water, and slow running toilets. To again be fair, I was told by the manager that I would be upgraded to the 13th floor which has been renovated and \"much nicer\". Maybe it was a just a bad night for the Bell Captain and the staff (it was extremely busy) but I cannot stop thinking that this was definitely NOT the great Hilton Rockefeller Plaza.

I did not pay much attention to the bad reviews thinking they could have been made up from a competing hotel. I thought you could trust a Hilton and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far wrong, having stayed at Hiltons across the UK. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way there would be a noise problem. I was wrong, I can assure you I am a real person relatively well travelled and experienced in what hotels should offer, this is one of the worst. When I arrived the staff were robotic they were unfriendly and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered to talk to you/serve you, there were a row of them looking at us waiting for us to choose who to go to (there were no other guests waiting)they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered or cared less. I was told my double room was ready I said it was a twin I booked. We went to our room and it looked nice tried to switch the TV on and there were no free channels which could be viewed. So it was basically a decoration. The bathroom was shabby and small and needed decorating. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the worst of it. (also they say they have business facilities but you have to pay to use a computer, even as a guest of the hotel. You also have to pay for use of the leisure facilities and everything else possible there are no benefits of teh facilities unless you are willing to pay a high price for them, others say great location but there are hundreds of hotels in the same area) We left the hotel to grab a bite to eat on our return I found I could hear the conversations of people in the hall passing by our room, word for word, and also those of the couple in the room next to us and the tv of the other room (including a telephone discussion the man was having word for word literally). The couple were arguing and there is not a word I could not hear, not mumbled but instead very clear. There was also the outside noise to content with, it sounded like I was trying to take a nap on the street on the pavement/sidewalk, in the middle of times square/fifth avenue. I called customers services and told them the problem they did not dispute it, as though they are use to this complaint and put me through to the front desk to switch rooms. This was done and I was told the hotel of over 1000 rooms was fully booked and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this, I was basically stuck there and I could lump it (unless I had a spare money to book another hotel, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so I was indeed stuck and regretting booking it.) The funny thing is our cab driver who picked us up from the airport recommended another hotel if we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy with the Hilton, its obviously a well known fact to New Yorkers that this hotel is not very good - i hope BA remove it from their recommended list of New York Hotels). I went back to customer services and relayed this saying I had a trans Atlantic flight and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep with this sort of noise and considering I was staying for a few nights surely they should try and do something. I asked if I could speak to a manager, it was early Friday evening and I was told they were not around but would call me back. This never materialised. I called back the following day and I was told there was a different manager on over the weekend and I asked if I could speak with them and again they were not around nor did they bother to call me if they ever were. The staff were unhelpful/unfriendly they thought they were doing you a favour simply being there not realising they were being paid by the customer, which is why a customer should be valued. I have never experienced anything like this, the better hotels were cheaper but could not accommodate twin beds that weekend, even so I would rather pay a higher price for a suite at any hotel other than this one which is unprofessional and soulless because of its size. Also to note NATO sent around 1000 teenagers there for a conference on the same weekend, the hotel was actually busier than grand central station (I say this after visiting the station on the final day in new york) on the Friday and Saturday of my stay. It was a circus not a hotel if they cannot cope with the capacity and are unable to help their customers because they are preoccupied with babysitting then they should make a change one way or another. Furthermore most city hotels are sound proof what went wrong with this one? The problem is it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter how many bad reviews they receive they do not care and will not do anything about it because they think their name is enough to guarantee customers, well it is the worst Hilton I have stayed in (something seriously went amiss) I have stayed in better Premier Inns than this hotel, they have managed to deter me from ever staying at a Hilton again irrespective of the country, my friends and family will also steer clear. You need a lesson in customer service and i can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe I am saying this to a hotel chain as large as the Hilton but there needs to be a serious review of what a hotel should be, privacy and not being able to hear everyones conversations around you when trying to sleep at least, is very important.

But this is a large and very busy hotel, so be prepared for the lobby to feel like Grand Central Station almost any time of the day. The buffet breakfast was better than expected, at a cost of $30 per person--but we noticed that many people had discount coupons that came with their room.

I've stayed in a dozen others throughout the city and I actually liked the Hilton Times Square as my previous favorite, but now that I've been here it will be hard to go back. I got a room upgrade because of status to the 44th floor with a Central Park view. The location is convenient to just about everything in mid-town, the upper floors are quieter in my opinion than staying further down in Times Square (although its still NYC never real silence).

No complaints. This time I saw the other side of the hotel. The first room they put me in was a \"new room\" on the 7th floor. It was, in my opinion, garish and tacky - cheap-looking modern furniture, color scheme of brown, bright blue, and lime green. I couldn't believe that was what they were renovating to when I'd liked all the other rooms I had here. It also had a chemical smell from all the new carpet/furnishings. They moved me to a room on the 19th floor and I immediately saw why they're renovating. Water damage on the wall in the hallway. Really \"dated\" decoration. But it wasn't bad enough to be the annoying guest and move again. Then I discovered that the walls were paper-thin. The first night I thought the yelling, laughing female voices keeping me up until midnight were just thoughtless teenagers. But the second morning I heard the news and every word of the conversation between two men on the other side of the wall. Also, it didn't matter what I set the heater on... it just kept on going. If the temperature started at 70 and I set it to 73 I would regularly find it had kept going to 75 or higher. The service to the room was not perfect. First they didn't replace the ice bag. The next day they didn't throw away the old one. I used the disposable coffee cups and after three days, the maids hadn't replaced them. So then I saw the coffee/ mini-bar guy in the hallway and thought, \"Oh, maybe he's supposed to take care of that.\" So I told him my room needed service. Came back... still no coffee cups. Weirdest of all, every afternoon they knocked on the door to ask, \"Was your room cleaned today?\" Shouldn't they know that?! When I asked them why they do that, they couldn't even explain it except to say, \"We have to do it.\" As I said, every other visit has been fine and I would have recommended it, but after this time, even though all the problems were small... go somewhere else.

Of course, the room wasn't ready, so we did a little sight-seeing. Upon returning to the hotel at around 3:30pm, I checked in and was given my key to my room on the 14th Floor. As is with nearly all hotels, now, it wasn't actually a key, but an electronic data card. I found my way to the 14th floor, followed the arrows to the correct room number, slowly inserted the card into the slot and removed it quickly. BINGO! I got the flashing green light which is almost like winning in Vegas. I gained access to my room on the very first try! I opened the door, dragged my suitcase in, and was greeted by a man in his underwear laying on my bed! In those few seconds, I actually thought I had entered the wrong room, but then it occurred to me that I had actually used a key to get in. Just then, Captain Underpants rolled over and looked at me. This is how the encounter went: Captain Underpants: \"Hey... how ya doin?\" Me: \"I'm ok. (Yes. There's a half-dressed stranger in my room, and I tell him I'm ok.) You're in my room\". Captain Underpants: \"Yeah. I'm just waiting for my wife. We're actually staying on the 21st floor. I'll be out in like 10 minutes.\" Me: \"OK.\" At that point, we ran out the door and down the hall to the elevators. I got down to the lobby, and even though there was a line, a staff member could tell there was a problem, so he took me to an available person in registration who was only supposed to be helping elite Hilton members. I explained to her that there was a man in my room. She asked me to be more specific, so I explained to her that there was a man in his underpants sleeping on my bed in my room. She excused herself for a second, and then returned to tell me that she would give me a different room. I responded, \"Well obviously, but don't you think you should do something more? Like maybe find out WHY Captain Underpants is in my room?\" After the girl behind the counter told us she would alert security, we got the key to a new room and headed back to the elevators. We pushed the up button, the doors opened, and who do you think appeared? Yep! It was Captain Underpants, but in his civilian attire. As we passed, he made some type of a complaint about the hotel and how there had been a big party in the room next door to his the previous night, and the hotel had given he and his wife a different room. My girlfriend didn't recognize Captain Underpants in his disguise, so she responded with \"Well that's nothing! We just found a guy in his underpants in our room!\" Evidently, the night staff switched the captain's room, and never told the day crew.

The check in at the lobby was smooth and quick. We were given a lovely room that was a good size and was reasonably priced. The room looked out onto 54 street which provided a great view as well as less noise than the 6th avenue side. The room had comfortable beds, flat screen TV and a VERY clean and well appointed bathroom bathroom. The hotel has room service and a nice restaurant. The hotel also has a fitness centre that is unbelievable! It has more elliptical machines and treadmills than any other hotel fitness center that I have ever seen! It was a pleasure to workout there. The location of this hotel can't be beat. A short walk to central park, 5th ave, radio city music hall and times square. The concierge was very helpful with directions, restaurant recommendations and also provided info on how to obtain show tickets from the booth in Times Sq. I would not hesitate to stay there again.

Having read numerous reviews re busy lobby and pushy Hilton Honors sales person was more than surprised to experience neither. Stayed in room 3924 older decor but very clean well presented and more than adequate. Following morning had breakfast in Entrusia on the ground floor as exec lounge being remodeled. However the quality of continental breakfast was supberb, the waiting staff also were more than helpful and very pleasant. Plenty of choice for our two son aged 15yrs and 11yrs..... enough to fill their hollow legs. When exec lounge reopened the quality was as good but the icing on the cake as far as we were concerned were the great views to Central Park, and down 6th to Radio City, 30 Rock and the Empire State. Evening hor d'ourves were plentiful and warm, bar area clean and serving staff great. OK at busy times there was a queue to get seated for breakfast, and of course the lifts/elevators get busy..... use the stairs or the service elevator at busy times between floors or to get to the lobby. In the size of this hotel, 2200 rooms it can only be expected. The concierge staff in main lobby assisted with all requesrts, booked us an SUV to get to the airport and at all times were pleasant and efficient.... never had to wait more than a few minutes to recieve service. While on trip booked NYC citysights holiday lights tour..... not worth the effort or wait..... guide was interesting enough but you can see as much as the tour provides by spending an hour walking round the main attractions, as opposed to sitting in mid town traffic getting very cold then being whizzed past certain locations in order to comply with the traffic regulations. Overall NYC at Christmas does not disappoint .... the atmosphere was great, yes it's very busy but you can always find a quiet space to sit and recharge before the next expedition to Macy's or Bloomingdales for those essential last minute Christmas items...

If you want intimacy or a quiet lobby this is not the hotel for you. During our trade show the lobby is packed with nervous business reps hoping that their next appointment will show up on time, meanwhile shaking hands with almost anybody. In the past the hotel's brusque service matched the relaxed charm of my fellow conventioneers. But that has changed. This year I saw a new attitude. I went to the package room to retrieve an item after their closing time. A management guy who was standing around called security to open the room; he then helped me find the package. I had a minor problem with the sink stopper in my room. A maintenance person quickly came to fix it. I called someone when the TV went blank. She promptly called me back to say that the entire system on my floor was being maintained. After the TV service was restored she called again to ask if I was satisfied. I ordered room service twice. In both cases it arrived warm, at the time promised and served by great old time waiters. Other reviewers have commented on the old rooms that still remain. I agree that the hotel should have completed their renewal years ago. The updated rooms are excellent and very quiet. Another important plus for me is that windows in rooms can be opened for fresh air.This is not the norm in today's hotel environmant. If this is important please confirm that your room will have these windows. I also agree with another reviewer who commented on the unnecessary doormen who take tips for opening cab doors. They do not go out on the street to find taxis; they only open doors of cabs that have been lined up. I go on the street to find my own taxi heading in whatever direction I want to go. The good news is that the area usually seems to have cabs available. The coffee shop has excellent breakfast and lunch buffets but no dinner service. However the neighborhood has many eating places including a great halal meat stand across the street which always has long lines. The location remains incomparable in my view. A short walk to Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue , Central Park and the Theatre District. Also subway stations very nearby and car rental companies within a block.

There is a lovely coffee shop on the premises with adequate food at semi-reasonable prices which closes at 3.00 pm - 3.00pm! why? After 3.00 if you want a bite to eat, you must parade to the outside wall of the hotel where there is an access to a Starbucks or fight for one of the far too few tables at the noisy lobby bar. Ugh. The rooms are nicely appointed if way too traditional and stuffy (tassels - really?). The bathrooms are clean and adequate if small and lacking in counter space. On the plus side there is the fact that the hotel is smoke free and the beds are comfortable and the room temperature is easily controlled. Also, the glasses are brought in fresh each day and not washed with your dirty towels as per the 20/20 expose scandal. In addition there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a bed bug to be found!. On the negative side there is way too much for such a pricey hotel. Upon arrival in our room there was a huge wine stain on the carpet, the desk phone didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, the safe was locked shut, no robes, no makeup/shaving mirror, no hotel directory, no room service menu, no writing paper - unless you count three sheets of a post it sized pad by the non functioning phone. One of my favorite luxuries is room service. Not here! The prices and service take all the joy out of it. I ordered buttered toast with jam and a pot of tea. They took their time and brought unbuttered toast and no spoon or knife with which to spread the butter for myself. I discovered this after having been asked to sign the bill and the additional space where, if you ever read the fine print, you are allowing for a 15% tip. Although they corrected the error and canceled the tip at my request, no complimentary allowances were made. Everything at this hotel is average in quality and vastly overpriced.

Bits of this hotel are great - the room service staff, the porters, the maintenance guys are all really friendly and helpful. What is not so great is the hotel itself. On check in we were given a room ( a deluxe king) where the shower/bath fitment leaked, bulbs were out, there was still rubbish in the room from the last guest, the chair was broken with dangerous bits of plastic sticking out. We were offered a room swap but not until the following day, and we had to get our bags back down to reception and then re-checkin that afternoon ( they said they couldn't move our stuff for us, we had to do it) The new room was a lot better - everything worked for a start, but housekeeping in this hotel is shocking. We left a plate with an apple core on it by the bin and housekeeping didn't remove it as part of the room clean, nor did they restock the bathroom with toiletries or replace the sodas or water from the mini bar we consumsed the night before. When we rang down to guest services they got some sent up but ended with the phrase \" I will put a note on the account that the room should be checked each day\" as if she was doing us a favour! -Damm right it should be checked each day - this is meant to be a five star hotel not some roadside B&B. The Executive lounge is ok - but vastly inferior to any other Hilton Exec lounge and the food in the breakfast restaurant is nice, if a little expensive. The lifts are appauling - you could be waiting up to 10 minutes to go up or down from your room - I started using the service elevator in the end! Room service menu is limited and stops at 1am ( no 24 hour options) and they automatically charge you for a morning newspaper unless you \"opt out\" Overall this place feels like a tourist hotel where they really dont have to try too hard becuase of the location. If this hotel was in another city where the demand for hotel rooms was a lot lower it would have lost the Hilton brand name years ago..... Very very avererage.

That being said, it was definitely too much money for this quality of hotel. It is advertised as a 3 and 1/2 star hotel, and I see how that could be true. The lobby is large and open, looks pretty nice at first impression. We got a room on the 28th floor, which was nice. But it had two double beds, and I requested a king-- though I didn't ask to change because I was happy with the high floor. At first the room seemed okay though dated, at least the TV was a flat screen and the beds looked well made. Well, the beds were very comfortable, I slept great, and no signs of bed bugs. Everything else seemed not very good at all. Nice TV, but the remote was broken. The bathroom was small but typical for NY, but the mildew on the shower curtain was gross. Nice big towels in good shape, and they had decent soap/shampoo/conditioner/lotion. The room was not well cleaned on further inspection, either. There was an empty water bottle under the nightstand, for example, with dust that looked like it hadn't been touched in a long time. I know that in NYC things tend to be pricier-- but somethings here at the Hilton were ridiculous. The bellman charged you to hold your bags, $3.50 per bag per day not including tip. I have never had to pay for this service before--- the line to pick up and drop off was huge, and seemed to run efficiently enough. Internet at the hotel is 20 bucks a day, which seems excessive too.

Arrived in New York from LA in the early evening and a cab from JFK cost about USD $60. You can do the public transport thing for way less but you know, so annoying with luggage. Check in was fairly easy as I had advanced purchased online. Process was easy and we were given free access to the gym with my HHonours status. Can't remember which floor the room was on but it was fairly high up, maybe 20-something. Entire floor was tired and screaming to be renovated. This I don't usually mind so much but the room was small and not as clean as it should have been. We had trouble with the TV system during our entire stay, the remote didn't work, there was no room service menu (this was supposed to be on the tv) and repeated calls to the front desk got us nowhere. Perhaps we weren't tipping the right people... The in room wifi was also unreliable and ended up getting refunded twice as the service would just drop out and not come on again. Ended up leeching wifi from a hotel across the street which worked 10 times better than the Hilton's.

This was not the case. The executive floor lounge was so busy you had to wait in line to be seated. Some people waited up to 15-20 minutes. Breakfast was a selection of cold pastries, 2 fruit choices, yogurt, cereal, cold boiled eggs and toast or bagels. Not a bad selection.

The only slight complaint was the bathrooms, which are not large enough to get in and out of without doing a dance with the door, but the living space in the room is far more than ample. Water pressure was great, tubs are the wider, almost soaking tubs, curtain rod is rounded out making for more space in the shower. Bedding was fabulous, towels were great. Had no problems with noise in the hallway. Housekeeping staff was very friendly and fast, and rooms were spotless. Do be aware that the elevators can be lengthy waits, so just plan for 5-10 minutes to get down to the lobby, worst case. 10 minutes only happened to us once, because one of the three elevators was out of service, and every car that stopped on 29 from above was already full, so we needed to wait for 3 cars to come before we could board. Again, that was an exception, there was a 6000 person convention in the hotel, and it was right before a big kickoff meeting. Once the 3rd elevator was back in service the next day, our waits were minimized. Would highly recommend the 29th floor. There was always a cab waiting for passengers in the queue out the front door, and you're one avenue away from the thrills and fun of walking the amazing shops of 5th avenue.

A nice easy going day out, nice place to stay very close to time square in fact just 2 block from times square and few block away from shopping ..,u get good street food just out side the hotel.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cA Great Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ryguy2008", "ReviewID": "UR69019685", "Content": "Everyone knows that there are many hotels available when booking a trip to New York, but for some reason this hotel seemed to be the best choice. We were a group of 3 friends from Canada, on our first trip to New York. We booked over 3 months in advance through Expedia.ca. At the time we booked, it was only $40/person extra to be on the Executive Level, and it was definitely worthwhile. CHECK-IN: When you enter, there's a huge reception area on the left, which could have lines at times. However, on the right there's a small desk for Executive Level check-in. Even though check-in was 3 PM, when we arrived at 1:15 PM, our room was ready and we were on our way to our room in less than 5 minutes. LOBBY/ELEVATORS: I read before our trip some people complaining that the lobby is too busy, or the wait for elevators is too long. By being on the Executive Floor, which is the top floor (44th) of the hotel, you get access to 3 quieter elevators. To access the 39th-44th floor, you must use your key card to gain access. Therefore, we never waited more than 2-3 minutes for it to come. As well, the lobby was busy, but we were never bothered by any timeshare people or anything else. ROOM: Our room, on the 44th floor, was very nice. 2 double beds, with a desk and a night table. As well, there's an alarm in the room with some preset radio stations. There's a full bathroom, with bathtub/shower, as well as a small counter for your belongings. We found the usual hotel amenities in the room, including shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, etc. There's a nice blackout curtain in the room. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, and we all slept well. There's a minibar in the room. You're offered the key at check-in if it interests you. It had some alcoholic beverages, chips, candy, and so on. We didn't take anything, but it's there if you get hungry. One of the perks of the Executive Level is you get bathrobes. We noticed we were short a bathrobe, and short towels. On our way out, we stopped at the Executive Level reception in the lobby to ask for some more, and by the time we got back, we had more than enough towels and enough bathrobes at our disposal. There is a safety deposit box in the room, which is free to use. You program the code when you enter your room. As well, there's an even more secure one in the lobby if you want to use it. EXECUTIVE LOUNGE: At the end of the hall, there is the executive lounge. In the morning, there's a continental breakfast including bagels, yogurt, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, coffee, etc. Never had to wait more than 2-3 minutes to be seated. As well, between 5-7, there's hors d'euves available. This included stuff like little spring rolls, pieces of meat, some vegetables, and more. Definitely useful if you're planning on eating dinner late, and want a quick bite. Outside of these hours, there are fresh cookies and fruit available along with coffee and tea. As well, there's free wifi and computer access available in the room. We didn't try the other places to eat in the hotel, but I did see a large Starbucks on the ground level. There is a fitness center available, but we didn't use it. LOCATION: This hotel is only about 15-20 minutes walking from Times Square, and is very close to many popular attractions such as the Rockefeller center, and more. As well, the staff at the door always keeps a steady flow of taxi's coming into the hotel, so you never have to look hard to find one. Taxis in New York are very inexpensive, and are really convenient to use. ISSUES: We found the hotel to be very responsive to any requests. When you call, they already knew what room you're calling from, and they have your name and info on their screen. Our second morning there, around 6:45 AM, I found the room next door to be very noisy, which woke me. They were having a very loud conversation. This is beyond the hotel's control, but I ended up calling the front desk, who informed me that they'd send security up. It seemed to get a bit better shortly after. As well, I used the bathroom on the ground level late our first night there, and it was rather gross. There were no paper towels left, clogged toilets, and a large puddle on the ground. This is a maintenance issue though, and overall, didn't detract from our impression of the hotel. CHECK-OUT: Since we booked through Expedia, we had nothing to pay upon check-out. It just involved giving in our keys at the Executive Level reception, and that's it. We were able to store our luggage for $3.50/item during the day, since we had a late flight. As well, we used the lobby safety deposit box for our passports, which was free. We didn't use it, but I spotted a machine in the lobby that even lets you check-in to your airline from the convenience of the hotel. OVERALL IMPRESSION: This hotel is big, but shouldn't intimidate anyone from booking here. The Executive Level is definitely worthwhile, and allows for a more personal, and enjoyable experience. Being at the top floor, we wouldn't hear people in the hall that often, or the elevator all night. The staff were always all friendly and willing to please, and clearly enjoy working at this location. The food available in the lounge was decent, and allowed us to start our day much fast than at a normal sit-down restaurant. For our first trip to New York with friends, this hotel definitely helped ensure our trip was such a success, and I would definitely consider going back.

It was more spacious, had an updated bathroom (which was still very small and awkwardly set up with not enough space for toiletries but had a modern shower) and a generous workspace. The fitness room also has a decent selection of equipment. One other annoyance, it costs almost $19/night for high speed Internet access; that seems a little steep in this day and age.

I was the only person left in line (it was a line of two people) but the cook stuck a sign up in front of my face that stated that he was no longer cooking. It was extremely rude as he had seen me standing there for five minuteswaiting to give my order and he could have had the courtesy to say that his shift was about to end, instead of wasting my time by having me stand there for no reason. Then, on top of it, the breakfast was $30 per person. With coffee it cost my husband and I $75 for a bad breakfast that left an extra bad taste in my mouth due to the ridiculous behavior of the cook.

Anna was absolutely amazing and very friendly! We had an upgraded room and although it was not huge (most rooms in NYC are smaller, so don't expect an enormous 2000sq ft room) it was immaculate, clean and remodeled. We felt extremely comfortable and had a desk to work and a nice couch as well. We had asked about a refrigerator and internet, which are normally additional charge as with most hotels, but we were able to get both at no additional charge! This was excellent because my husband had some work that he was concerned about finishing. Finally, we were given coupons for breakfast which could also be used in the Starbucks.....AMAZING!!! The restaurants were nice and quiet and the staff was very nice! The location of the hotel is perfect! We walked everywhere and it's close to Times Square but out of the crowd. Rockefeller Center was just around the corner and the metro was also close. Central park is a very very short walk as well! The area was very safe and I even walked down the street alone to Radio CIty Music Hall (barely 2 blocks away...you can see it from the hotel) at night alone and did not feel a bit worried.

Drove up there, and parked ($40/night) and went into the lobby where the desk clerk proceded to tell me they were sold out. I showed them my blackberry and they said there was nothing they could do. I spouted off about being a Hilton Diamond Member, and they got the manager who opened up a Suite on the 42nd floor (maybe it was 22, whatever the highest floor was) for $479. For $50 more than the website said, i figured what the heck. We got to the room, and it was enormous. Easily 900 square feet. Living room, dining room, kitchen, and bedroom, and two bathrooms. Decorations were typical of Hilton, but nice nonetheless. I love the Hilton bedsheets, so comfy. Bathroom was amazing. One of these shower stalls with 6 jets that sprayed you from all sides. Incredible water pressure. I was way impressed. Got to the Diamond Members breakfast a bit too late to eat, and the manager gave us some coupons for the buffet downstairs. Went downstairs and the buffet was amazing. It was $7 to \"upgrade\" to the full buffet. Well worth it, as the buffet regularly costs $38 or something. Very good food. Very impressive. Well worth $7 !! Was just impressed from the start to the end of this experience. Spent less than 12 hours in the hotel (and $600+ after taxes/parking/etc), but heck, this is NYC and it was worth it.

I am an average middle class family man expecting high standards in Hotel Service, Cleanliness and Food. This hotel has them all, don't believe any of the negatives. We arrived on Friday afternoon around 3pm and flew through Check-in. Our room was ready (Deluxe with two Double Beds) and was clean and tidy. The staff at Check-in were polite and helpful as were the Ladies that did the maid service in our room. I tipped them $10 every couple of days, and our room was always clean and tidy when we returned from a day out. On two occasions we required help from house keeping both were delt with quickly and efficiently. The first was that we decided that it would be better if my Son slept in his own bed, so we had housekeeping put a rollaway bed in the room, which was as good as a single bed. The second was a slight defect with out plumbing, which again was delt with quickly and effeciently. We had prepaid for breakfast for two adults at the market place (on-site dining area), and at the time of booking were told that we could pay for the children on a daily basis ($9-99 each). However, when going in for breakfast we were only charged a daily service charge of $10, basically the children were free. The breakfast service and choice was excellent. Everything you could want from full cooked american style, to fresh fruit and pastries. My children enjoyed getting freshly cooked omlettes and waffles from the counter chef. We had such a good breakfast, that we found ourselves only having a cake or baggle at lunchtime. The hotel location was excellent, being basically opposite the Rockefeller centre, a short walk down to Times Square, or up to Central Park. Being a couple of blocks north of Times Square, it was ideal for sight seeing, but not in the madness or hustle and bustle of Times Square itself. Yes the lobby area of the hotel is busy. But apart from Check-in/out when you might be there a bit longer, you only spend a few seconds there passing through it in the morning and evening when you go out or come back. This hotel might be a little more expensive than some in the area, but it is of a very good standard, and believe me we saw several hotels, that we considered, while we were out and about, and were glad we didn't!

These rooms have access to the executive floor where breakfast, evening canapes, coffee/tea biscuits and fruit are complimentary. WIRELESS access is free in the executive lounge also which is a large saving and you have somewhere to kick back after a day of touring - ie with great televisions it is certainly like your lounge room. The location of the hotel is fantastic and the rooms quiet. As someone whom travels alot and has stayed at many hotels worldwide this on is a safe option for business or leisure. Our room was a typical standard size per Australian standards and certainly not small as other reviewers have stated. The executive rooms have not been upgraded but are of a higher standard to begin with. Other reviewers also noted the lifts as being an issue - we have not found this to be a problem at all. Other reviewers stated the Hilton Club issues in the lobby - we were asked nicely if we wanted any information and would not consider it pestering or over the top.

It is, however, positioned in an excellent location for visiting New York's major attractions. I stayed at the Hilton over Memorial Day weekend on a Mother/Daughter trip to the city and we were very pleased with our stay. The room was clean and fairly large for an NYC hotel. We had space to stash our suitcases and the various purchases we made throughout the weekend. The lobby is often a bit crowded but it's roomy so moving through there to the elevators is not difficult. We were out and about throughout the island for most of our four day stay so if you're simply looking for a good home-base from which to depart for sight-seeing, shopping, dining or threatre, I would highly recommend the Hilton New York. Since we did not take advantage of the hotel's many additional services, I can't speak to them. I did think the gym access, internet fees and mini-bar prices were rather steep but a smart traveler can simply walk the ten feet to the sundries store downstairs to obtain most necessities (water, soda, wine, snacks) at a much cheaper price and I used my Palm for any of my internet needs while at the hotel. (Business travelers who's companies often pick up expenses like internet access shouldn't mind the associated price tag - it's competitive for what you might expect to pay in a large NYC hotel.) We had a smooth and quick check-in process, our room was always cleaned for us when we returned each day and the few requests I did make of the hotel staff (wake up calls, late check out) were taken care of efficiently. Bottom line: this is an excellent location and a clean, lovely hotel for your visit to NYC. Quick Guide: estimated walking time at a SLOW pace... Rockefeller Plaza - 5 minute walk Times Square North - less than a 10 minute walk 5th Avenue Shopping - 5 minute walk Times Square South - 10 to 15 minute walk Central Park - 5 minute walk There are also excellent connections in the area to the Subway system and we had no problem catching a taxi at any time from the hotel's front door.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MN", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay\u201d", "Author": "mtino", "ReviewID": "UR65651884", "Content": "Great place to stay while in NYC.

Actually I had no idea what it was for. It was not appreciated. Came for a holiday. Did not want to go through 90 minutes of incentives about club 57.We didn't participate. TWO: I had to screw back on the shower head before we could use it. Figured it was quicker to do this than asking for it to be done. Why was it so un-screwed off in the first place I don't know. Also, the steel caddy for soap etc, was barely recognisable as there was metal prongs sticking out from it - or missing. A bit dangerous and not what I expected to find in the Hilton! The room was a recently rennovated room. But it still was tired in places. Given the room rates there is no excuse for tiredness in furniture? THREE: Internet access $10 for 10 minutes - rediculously dear. Go to \"smilies\" (I think that's its name) near times square and you can go upstairs and get internet access for about $5 for 20 mins. San Fran Hotel - Americania had the internet for free. Which is a great idea! I won't come back to the NY Hilton.

The nicest thing we can say is that the rooms were large (for Manhattan).

Upon arrival: the room was missing the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, one of the phones did not work, the remote did not work, neither the requested pillows nor towels were in the room, there were hairs in the tub, and there were used condom wrappers in the bedside console. We called customer service, and they said they'd send someone and have a manager follow up. Later we received pillows and towels and the phone was fixed. But then... The next day, after housekeeping visited, still no sign and a non-working remote, the previously supplied additional towels/pillows were back to 2, and the WRAPPRS were still there! We called AGAIN, and were told a manager would follow up with us. A few moments later housekeeping arrived and removed the offensive garbage and repeated that a manger would call. We requested towels and pillows on day one, two and three, and only received them on day one. Why do they supply a confirmation number, if even they are not going to pay attention to details. No Manager ever called or followed up. Nothing was done accomodate us. The only person to apologize was the housekeeping woman who removed the offensive garbage. For the price of the hotel, it is offensive to be disregarded. We put more time into resolving the issues than we wanted to to begin with, so we just let it go.

The lobby was not as busy as the last time, and we were able to check in easily requesting 2 beds.

The decor was nice, bathroom was clean, bed very comfortable, 27\" LCD tv and safe in the closet. They offer Crabtree & Evelyn prods: shampoo, conditioner, body lotion & shower cap. They even have these adjustable lamps on the headboards of the beds for reading. They have a starbucks inside the hotel and a regular one across the street. The restaurant has a nice looking bar but we did not dine there. Plenty of banks around the area, too: Chase, Bank of America, Wachovia etc. Times Square is less than a mile from the hotel. I won this hotel on priceline for $115 bid. After my bad experience at Intercontinental Barclay, I decided to never include Midtown East as an area to stay. Plus it's more convenient since we were seeing broadway musicals for both days of our stay. The hotel is close to the orange and yellow lines, 5th Ave, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, MOMA. We got back late from eating after our evening musical, and it felt safe walking from the subway stop. This hotel does not offer complimentary internet, nor free wifi in the lobby. Our tv stopped working the next day (sound but no pic), but I forgot to report it to the desk when I checked out. I'm not sure if it was due to the slow weekend, but we won the lottery drawing for $25-27 seats to Hair and In the Heights (certain broadway shows have these lottery drawings 2 hours before showtime - show up 10 minutes before the drawing to put your name in the bucket).", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wake Forest, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, expensive room service\u201d", "Author": "NCLimey", "ReviewID": "UR57393739", "Content": "I spent two weeks at this hotel at the beginning of 2010. 1 week in a north facing room, 1 week in a south facing room - I got nicer photos/views from the north facing room.

My biggest issue was the pricey room service - A greasy cheese steak cost and a coke cost about $45 after charges - Against recommendations, later in the week I ate from the street vendors that are just outside and the chicken and rice cart gets some long lines of people waiting in the cold and is a great, tasty meal for $10 - the hot sauce is very hot tho!

I am pretty easy going, but enough is enough when it comes to this hotel. I will NEVER stay here again. I to this day can't get my issues resolved and it will never happen. I paid for a suite at $600/night because we had 6 adults on our \"girls trip\". There were problems after problems, but I will spare you the small stuff. The biggest problem is that we were supose to have a suite with 2 beds and a pull out couch (for 6 people). Well the couch was broken, and the staff was not willing to help AT ALL! I would call and get transfered to houskeeping every day and still nothing would get done. My mom and I slept on the floor for 2 nights before finally getting some matresses that we could just throw on the floor. Every day we were told it would get taken care of and every night we would come back it wasn't. It was the worst stay I have ever experienced and mostly because I felt like the staff could care less what was happening. It litterally ruined my entire trip, and when I got home my husband called hilton to complain and they wouldn't even talk to him because he didn't stay there, so I had to call in. I told them everything that had happened, and after months of arguing with them on the phone (because I thought the fair thing was to refund the 2 nights I had to sleep on the floor) which they would never do still nothing happened. The lady that was supose to call me back never did and when I called back in again I got the run around again. After almost a year I finally got someone who I thought was willing to help me, only to find out that all they would do is give me a few few nights at a hilton hotel. I was tired of arguing so I said fine to the deal. Then the certificates arrived and they were for a hampton hotel, not the hilton hotels and they had an expiration date on them. I called back and talked to the lady who said if I paid to fed ex them back to them then they would send me the hilton ones...yeah right...like I believe that one. It has been since fall of 2008, but as you can see I am still bugged by the fact that neither the hotel or hilton themselves would ever make good on this problem and I will never stay there again. Other things that were small details were things like we had a room for 6 people who showered every day, yet they told us it was impossible to leave 6 towels because they only leave 4. if we wanted more we had to call in an ask for more. So every day we called and asked for 2 more towels. Our shower was moldy and the room had a weird smell to it that we never could figure out. It was also so noisy every night on one side or the other of us. People partying until 3 am, others fighting next door. Security was called once by us and other times not by us, but we heard them come. The party would get quiet for 20 minutes and then start again.etc. etc. etc. Oh and I almost forgot my room bill said one amount and when the cahrge went through it was $400 more than what it was supose to be.

Either A.C or heat. It is December, so only heat, even though it's really warm. I even opened the windows as far as they would open. Set the thermostat to the lowest, and yet the room never got below 74 F. Not even in the middle of the night! Housekeeper did not even leave paper and pen in the room. How nice. The iron in the room kept leaking water. As Gold, I thought some kind of upgrade might be available. Or at least free breakfast. Well, I got 2 bottles of water and a coupon for a mid-size drink and a breakfast pastry. And a room 10 ft from the elevator on the \"HHONORS Floor.\" I can see Hilton really appreciates my business.

We traveled with a large group of girls who were performing in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. At times, this meant 1,600 girls trying to get to practices using the elevators. We were told to expect delays and to allow 30 minutes to get an elevator. This was usually sufficient, but there were still times where the girls had to resort to using the stairs. When returning from events, we had to stand in line to get an elevator. Now this was not just our group staying in the hotel. There were other people there too and they also had to endure the inconvenience of waiting for elevators. It seemed that the elevators designated for floors 1-15 were the worst. They have sets of elevators for other floors and those seemed to move quicker. The staff we came in contact with were all very nice and were always accomodating. Room service was extremely over priced...for just a sandwich, after tax, tips, and other fees, you were probably going to pay about $40. Au Bon Pain is across the way, as is the 53rd Street Deli, which were more convenient for our needs. Nice people at both of those places as well. We were asked not to use the hotel restaurant so it would be available for the other hotel guests, so I can't comment on anything other than the Starbucks that's connected to the hotel restaurant. We only went there once, but Starbucks was good...just like any other Starbucks except that they were busier thanks to our group. As far as our room, it was a pretty decent size by New York City hotel room standards. I've stayed in smaller. The bathroom was really small, but was nice after having been remodeled not too long ago. The room was always clean. Room temperature was sometimes a challenge, but luckily I could open the window to let cool air in. Internet was a bit pricey at $15 a night. For a hotel that expensive, I would think they'd let you have it for free. We stayed at this hotel because we were required to by the group we were with, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice next time.

Frankly, I was not looking forward to the stay because of comments in other reviews about traffic noise in the rooms, long queues for check-in, long waits for the lifts and harrassment from time-share sharks. We arrived at the hotel just after 12.30 and checked straight in - no queues. We grabbed our cases off the minibus, thus depriving the bellboys a chance to fleece us for porterage. According to the Hilton website, check-in starts from 16.00, so I don't know if Cunard had arranged an earlier check-in for their passengers. The check-in process took hardly any time so we proceeded cautiously to the lifts on the other side of a huge reception area, keeping a wary eye out for the dreaded time-share bozos. There was no sign of them - indeed, we didn't see a single one during our entire stay. Hopefully the management have got rid of these awful people. There were four sets of lifts, one each for different groups of floors. We were on the 10th floor, and our set of lifts serviced as far up as floor 15 so we hardly had to wait at all - it MAY be a different story for higher floors but we never saw any queues at the other sets, and the cars were all of a good size. We consider the room to be of a good size, but it's probably small by American standards. The bed was extremely comfortable, as was the sofa. There was a large LCD-screen TV on the dresser with a limited selection of channels which weren't that easy to access, having to trawl through an extensive menu of pay-per-view channels first (do they HAVE to have \"adult\" channels featured so prominently?). The bathroom was a good size with a large walk-in shower. My wife is a light sleeper but she said she could hardly hear the traffic, even though we were overlooking 6th Avenue. The mini-bar is sealed with a break-off plastic tag - make sure this is there as soon as you check in to avoid any surcharges. A coffee-maker is provided with proper- and decaf- coffee. Having read that meals in the hotel restaurant are expensive, we didn't even look, but went across the road (right opposite) to Starbucks for breakfast on the first morning. I thought Starbucks offered free wifi, but unless I was doing something wrong, I couldn't pick up a free signal - all the available signals required me to have a logon id (we eventually went to the Central Library - worth a visit in its own right - to use the free connection terminals there). On the second morning, we went to Europa for breakfast. This is a fairly cheap and cheerful eatery, two blocks down in the UBS building. Go past the UBS front door, turn right and it's on the corner of the plaza within the UBS building. When we came to check out, Cunard had previously arranged for our bags to be collected from the room, so we didn't have to worry about storing our bags at $3.50 a shot - in any case, we didn't have to vacate the room until 12.00.

In the set of three elevators that stops at the 26th floor, one was out-of-service my entire time at the property. This is unacceptable at such a large hotel hosting multiple conferences at the same time. The doors would routinely open on the way down with no room for me. I found myself climbing stairs to the 34th floor to use that set of elevators multiple times.

Elevators were available and speedy, separated into ranks by floor grouping so you don't get stuck with the \"milk run\" so common in many hotels. I can't comment on the Executive Lounge because I didn't try it out, even though the check in person did helpfully provide me access without even asking, given my Diamond status. The breakfast in the main restaurant was very adequate and not crowded. I wouldn't have paid the price they asked but it was included with my conference package. Check in went well. The desk clerk did apologize that the room reserved for me was not available but she gave me several options of equal or better rooms. It was unfortunate, however, that upon check in the clerk told me to pick up a package at the concierge desk -- but didn't bother to tell me the concierge desk was closed until morning. I stood there looking rather forlorn until finally another guest had mercy on me and clued me in. The room seemed up to date and clean. Everything worked (well, except that changing the thermostat didn't seem to make any appreciable difference.) Sure, the room was small (the couch had to be set on an angle to fit in the room) but this is Midtown Manhattan after all. For a single traveler or possibly even for two, it really was quite comfortable, having both a work desk and a couch. I thought all the staff was friendly. Maybe you have to try to be friendly to them first but they certainly made me feel welcome. And, by the way, I certainly didn't have any trouble getting a cab. Personally I never saw fewer than about 20 in the queue at any given time. Even at 5:30 in the morning, a bellman spotted me in the lobby and ran to get me set up. Finally, everyone who writes reviews of this hotel does seem to be taken with the location. Undoubtedly that is probably the largest selling point for this property.

Oh, well - we got a room with a queen size bed (fine for my husband and me) and a pull out sofa bed for our 2 teenage daughters. The pull out was REALLY, REALLY bad. Upon opening it, there was no bedding whatsoever on it (no sheets), and not really a mattress. There was a thin poor quality sort of foam pad acting as a quasi mattress over the metal frame. The head of the pull out \"sleeper\" (can barely be called that), actually sunk below the back of the couch - so that one's head is lower than their feet - it sloped down.

I love the location because it is within walking distance to Central Park, Rockafeller center, Radio City Music Hall, The Letterman Show and a few extra blocks to Times Square. MOMA is right across the street too and on certain days you can get in for free, just check with the concierge for the day. There are some great places to eat around here. Only a block or two up is 7th-9th streets which have tons of restaurants. One of my favorites is at 53rd/9th called the Eatery. Also, two blocks down from the hotel is Magnolia bakery made famous by the Sex In the CIty movie. They have yummy cupcakes and other items to feast on. There is a pharmacy across the street and a deli on the other side which sell snacks and drinks. There are also several subway entrances within a block or two of the hotel. I've stayed here twice and plan on staying here each time.

Please see my blog at http://talesfromtheroad-mwalno.blogspot.com I checked in early (around 2 pm) and requested a high floor. I am in room 4129 and it is nicer than I remembered a Hilton room. King size bed, decent shower and desk. Good air conditioner. Easy check-in process, and friendly service. They have moved the Diamond Desk over by the regular check in area, and the \"old\" Diamond desk is called the \"Executive Level Check in\" -- I don't know what that means as there is only 1 floor with Ex level rooms, but there was line there so I went to regular check in. Hilton does try and get you at booking on their web site to pay a fee ($70 I think) to upgrade to the Exec level -- this is the thing that drove me away from them -- rather than taking great care of their elite members they sell out to those who will pay. One thing to remember is to get a room on 34th floor or higher so you don't have to switch elevators to get to the 44th (club level). I went up to the club level first in search of some water bottles, but there were none. They have remodeled the club, and it is nice and open with free wifi. I did have a very good chocolate chip cookie. I headed to the gym on the 5th floor. They remodeled it last year and I LOVE IT. Free weights with a bench, large work out area, tons of treadmills and ellipticals, and a large stretching area. Excellent perk. Bed was great, room was cool (temparature), and it was quiet. I asked for and was granted a 12:30 check out time. I did not go to the club room for breakfast beacause it took too long for the elevator to come (only 3 elevators for floors 34-44).

Then there were the prices, they wanted to charge an arm and a leg for anything and everything. Went to have 3 pages printed in the business center and was told $2.75 a page. I had them printed just round the corner for $0.97 a page. Laundry service wanted $109.00 to wash and press a batch of clothes, the laundry caf\u00c3\u00a9 just two blocks away picked the clothes up, washed and pressed them and delivered them back for a measly $10.50. Food was anywhere from double to triple the local shops cost and then in fine print they add another $4.50 charge per item if you wish to eat it in your room. This includes taking it there yourself as I found out on a busy Sunday night when they had a convention going so the place was insanely packed and I just wanted some peace and quiet. And the cleaning staff seems to be just looking for a reason too not clean your room, no big deal for me as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used the time share style where you clean up after yourself, except that like many hotels the trash cans are very small. So I found myself having to pile trash on the floor after I had spent a large amount of time in my room due to constant rains. No I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the room all day, and I even tried to leave to go do something else so they would clean the room (IE empty the trash) the second time cleaning people came around but they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean the room as I was there at that very moment.

The bar downstairs was ok, and over all, it was an ok base for our first stay in New York. We were far from blown away, and we are looking for a different hotel for our next stay this summer. Funny thing is, we are thinking of booking the hilton garden inn times square. We both like the idea of a busy(ish) hotel that is a good size in the heart of all the tourist traps. After all, we are tourists! And it feels safe. Both aged 28, we don't care for quiet hotels, or being treated like royalty. You will only be using the hotel to re-charge your batteries, because you will be too busy enjoying New York. If you havn't been yet, then book NOW. You only live once, and you have to see this city. You won't go wrong with the New york Hilton, and although we will stay elsewhere next time, I think we will stay somewhere new everytime we go. Don't be afraid to book it if you are used to Holiday Inns etc... :) ... what are you waiting for!? Book your trip to New York!

The last time we were there, we planned to stay at the Hilton. We liked the location and thought it would be great. We checked in to the hotel at 9 PM at night and unfortuneatly for us, there was still a line at check-in. I had even joined Hilton Honors to try to avoid the dual line issue I had read about in a review below. It didn't help. We still had to wait. There was only one person working the desk for quite a bit of the time and they were only working the Hilton Preferred honors or some level above the regular hilton honors members. So that was not pleasant. We asked if we could have a high floor room and they said no, they were full and we only could have floor 10. We also asked about upgrading and again were told no. I always mark high floor on my preferences when making reservations and usually we are accomodated although its something we can live without. I had sent a package to the room paying for express mail for Monday delivery. Because the Business Office was closed we were unable to get the pkg until the next day even though they told us they would have sent it to the conscierge desk. That package had our toiletries in it and so we called to the customer service desk as they said they would provide complimentary toothbrush/toothpaste if you needed them. They said they would bring it up and they never did. They did however bring up room service for us. The next morning we called again for the toiletries as the business office wasn't opened yet and they did come up with 1 toothbrush and 1 toothpaste. Then we did get our package. The maid service cleaned the room but never replaced the glasses in our room during our stay. We didn't really want to pay room service prices on the other nights and so had to rinse out the one remaining glass. The room was ok but fairly small. There is no mini bar. It is locked and if you want anything you need to call down for the key. There was some discoloration in the shower that I wasn't sure if it was mildew or not.. I didn't like seeing it anyway. There is alot of business meetings in the hotel, which has an entirely different mood than we were on for our leisure trip. The hotel bar was stuffy and the waiter cutally asked us not to sit on a nice large couch that my hubby was wanting to use as it was romantic and it was our anniversary and asked us to sit at a table for two. We did and we left the large couch empty after we had our drinks, just like 85% of the room was when we arrived. Hubby was mad that I left him a tip at all. We did like being close to the Halal cart on 53rd and 6th as that is great food at a good price ($6.00 a platter) but we could definitely walk there from another hotel when we go next time.

We drove into the city and the hotel and parking garage were very easy to find. We had called the previous day to see if you could have early check-in on the Friday that we arrived and we were granted permission to do so. We checked in at 10:30am on a Friday.

They do provide a hair dryer in the hotel...no need to bring your own, and it isn't a typical hotel hair dryer, it's nice and powerful. We only went to the lobby bar once and each had one drink....very expensive! $14 for a small glass of red wine (house wine too) and it just wasn't worth it. Better to walk 2 blocks towards Central Park and do the 2 for 1 martini's....yummy!! And you get two for $13! No complaints about the elevators that I had read in previous reviews.

Our 2 double bed room on the 36th floor was of reasonable size, clean, and well maintained except for peeling ceiling paint in the bathroom and a scruffy, banged up safe in the closet. A small, but nice touch was having 2 luggage racks. The mattresses were the low point (pun intended). We only needed 1 bed, but tried both. They were ok, but both sagged considerably on the night stand side. Another annoyance was that there was only the center night stand. I did manage to pull a little side table somewhat near to my side of the bed to hold my glasses, etc. at night. Our north-facing room had a tiny view of Central Park and an even tinier view of the Hudson River, but it was nice to see more than just tall buildings. The noise level from both inside and outside was remarkably low. The staff were courteous, though with the exception of the housekeeping staff and the person who checked us out, I wouldn't characterize them as friendly. We never waited long for help. The Hilton Club hucksters at 2 booths in the lobby were aggressive and annoying--they are best avoided. Finally, the best thing about the Hilton New York is its location, It's an easy walk to Central Park, Lincoln Center, the Empire State Building, and much more. It's also of course near Times Square, but far enough away (a plus in my book). Subway stations and bus stops are nearby.

Hotel lovely on the outside, porters so helpful in bringing you to your room. (suppose they're after their tip) Once your in, it appears your forgotten about. There was a minibar, located in the room, behind a cupboard door. To open the cupboard door, you had to first break off a plastic tab and then insert the key that reception has given you. Of course, we all wanted to have a peek and looked inside but didn't take anything. Closed the door and then locked it. We then went out for a stroll and a sight of the city that never sleeps, and a bite to eat. On return I noticed that a NEW plastic tab, had been put on the cupboard door. This could have only been put on by a member of staff and although I understand its their hotel, I felt as if my privacy had been invaded as I wasn't expecting anyone in to the hotel room. Why would I expect anyone in the room, I'd just checked in!!! I hadn't requested anything from the hotel either. Sounds funny, but I'm sure you know what I mean. Secondly a big complaint is the lifts......only 3 elevators to serve the floors 24-34 and the porters use the same lifts with all the luggage. Always waiting for at least 5 mins for the lifts. No aircon appeared to be working in the hotel either as was always so hot waiting. The lowest I could set the temperature to in the room was 75F. Couldn't adjust this. One evening, my 9 year old son was unwell. We decided to rush back to the hotel as he felt he was going to throw up. Guess what??? We were waiting for the lift for a good 5 mins and my poor little lad, threw up on the floor just outside the lifts on the ground floor. My hubby called a member of staff and all he could do was 'roll his eyes to heaven' when he saw what happened. Line to deal with Reception was very long and only ever saw 2 receptionists. More waiting in line. No apology from receptionist about the wait. BIG Complaint was the cost of services within the hotel $3.50 per item to hold a bag once you've checked out $5.00 for 3 slices of toast and on top of that there is a 'room service tax' or something similar for room service delivery of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.50!!! Salad was something like \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18.00 Even the Starbucks downstairs within the hotel charged $1 more for a cup of Latte than the one across the road. Mad One thing I will say, they're beds were fantastic. So comfortable. Doesn't make up for very poor shoddy service. I had just come from 10 nights at the Marriott in Orlando, and no comparrison to the service. Unfortunately the Marriott in New York was full. Ridiculous prices.

The Hilton offered to upgrade our standard and therefore not renovated rooms for the last two nights to deluxe when I pointed out that their website said that the suites were renovated . Renovated rooms are classed as deluxe and charged at a higher rate. First impressions when walking down the corridor to our 43rd floor suite were not great. It was just all a bit shabby - not dirty or dusty - just well worn and tired. The suite was large though. Two double beds in a large room, double sofa bed in the lounge with plenty of room for a rollaway bed if required. There was a huge walk in wardrobe to store luggage and hang clothes. The bathroom was small but extremely clean, tiles were good, grouting looked new. For two teenagers and two adults, the space was great. Would have been very happy to stay in the suite rather than moving to the deluxe rooms but the suites were full. The Hilton staff (with the exception of the dour faced staff in the Exec lounge) were all fantastic and made our move very easy - allowing us to move from the suite by 6pm so we did not compromise our day. The Deluxe rooms were very good - certainly 4 star. Again the bathrooms were small but well equipped and immaculately clean. As for the location of the Hotel, it can't be beaten.....5 minutes walk to Radio City and the Rockerfeller Center, 10 minutes walk to Times Square, 5 minutes to Fifth Avenue.

On the downside, both the hotel reception level elevator lobbies and the number of elevators are woefully inadequate for the size of the hotel. At busy times every day it was not unusual for every elevator that stops at your floor to be crammed with people. We sometimes had to wait for the fourth or fifth elevator before there was one with room to board. The satellite TV system was glitchy and might or might not be receiving the network you'd like to see at any given moment. The bathroom was very small, especially compared to the relatively spacious room. It was clear at some point the tub had been removed and instead there was a shower big enough for four. I would have preferred more bathroom floor space to all that shower floor space.

This once wonderful hotel has slipped from luxury to tourist class and is not representative of what one would expect from the Hilton name in New York City. In fact, it may not even be worthy of being a Howard Johnson. The location is in need of dire renovations and we were even housed on the Executive Levels of the property. The furniture in the rooms were deplorable, the elevators were slow and insufficient to handle the amount of group travelers that were housed within. This property has evolved from a business hotel to a group tour property, and if anyone is aware of what this can do to a hotel, it now not only has a high occupancy, but a high abuse occupancy as well. When we were there, the hotel was filled with high school students who were running the place. With such groups of a high number of occupants in the rooms, the elevators are completely insufficient in numbers to carry the load and it is made worse by the bellman carts utilizing the same passenger elevators. When contacting the Concierge, the phone rang off of the wall each night that we were there with not even a voicemail option to leave a message. It simply rang off of the wall. Also, the timeshare solicitation is overwhelming and a burden to the guests each time you walk past their desks, which it is impossible not to as you come out of the elevators. Another indication of losing the class of this property. In short, this property has a choice of continuing to operate as a tourist class property or investing significant dollars to get the property back to the levels that you expect from Hilton in New York. Due to the size of the property and the dificulty in securing loans, I anticipate that it will remain a tourist class property well into the future. The location, however, is perfect for the New York experience, should you being trying to accomplish just that.

The hotel is huge, some poeple may not like that, but we do b/c there was always a little corner/sitting area we could go to and talk/watch people. Limited amount of shopping at the hotel.

We always arrange for a car to pick us up at LGA, almost the same price as a taxi but the driver meets you at baggage claim so if its your 1st time to NYC it makes it easier, we paid for a sedan-they sent a stretch limo SUV(almost always, so book the smaller car).

I would have expected them to be hugely apologetic for this, and not to have made the customer keep calling around to solve the problem when it was the hotel's error.

Because this is a really huge hotel I wondered why they would not room at a Executive Floor level because I'm a Gold Vip but the man at this Executive Reservation Desk said that hotel is very crowded. I said that I have also card for Marriott hotels and maybe we have to go another hotel. After that he found us a room at the 40th foor giving us the key card in total silence. I have been in many Hilton and other hotels around the world and only once I have felt same coming to the reservation desk at Hilton Chicago. At this hotel my reservation was from some internet site than at Hilton's and the lady at the desk was very eager to tell that I'm not gonna get Hilton points for that stay although I did not expected to have any. Because of that experience I made this time my Hilton New York City reservation at Hilton site but it did not help us. At all other Hilton hotels around the world they ALWAYS have greeted me or us saying like \"welcome to the Hilton hotel\". Maybe it is different in USA but I wonder why because friendliness does not cost a thing. This was not even the one and only experience of lack of hospitable because after this episode when we had our room at Executive Level and we went to daily to their breakfast and we find also there a man in the staff who did not always reply when I said Hi, Hello or Good morning. Usually they should say it first but now it was random if you got any response. Now you might think what kind of people we really are so it is better to tell that we are normal and typical europeian academic couple in our fifties who have not encountered any remarkable difficulties in other Hilton, Marriott, Intercontinental, Shangri-La etc.hotels. Vice versa for example in Hilton Vancouver they gave us their best rooms without asking and also at Inntercontinental in Beverly Hills. I do not even mention hotels in Asia because they always give everybody more than expected in service as you certainly know. Of course totally this was a minor thing and we certainly know that there are also other customers than us. But if you are on your vacation this kind of situation affects to your mood liked or not.So we do not expect moon from the sky just a little bit more hospitability as Conrad Hilton advertides in video tape which they so to customers (?). This maybe also the first Hilton hotel which did not ask any customer comments of the stay when we left. That is why I'm writing it here.

I brought along two t-shirts - one to sleep in, one to work out in. It was chilly in the room the last evening so I wore both. One was an extra soft \"Life is Good\" shirt my hubby got me on a trip and the other was a shirt the Obama campaign gave us in return for a donation. On Jan 30, I checked out early (around 8:30 am) to get to my conference. I packed my belongings - my two shirts in a shopping bag. Big mistake. I picked up my two bags in the afternoon and dropped them off at a nearby hotel (my husband was joining me that evening for a weekend in NY). Around 7 pm, I am unpacking and can't find my two tees. I think - well, maybe I left them in the room (although I'm 95% sure I did not as I travel alot for business and pleasure and I'm good about triple checking my room before I depart). Anyway, I run across the street - I see security. They take me to the room (which was cleaned but unoccupied). Nothing there. Nobody returned the shirts to the Lost & Found. I check the baggage check area - where I paid $3.50 for the day, presumably to keep my bags secure. No response. So they ask me to fill out a report, slip me a number to call \"Mike in security\" during the week to check with him to see if the shirts turn up. I do so the next week. Mike basically tells me he has \"no idea\" why they told me to call him. Really? A guest has items missing from either the room or the baggage area and SECURITY has \"no idea\" why I'm calling? Especially galling since SECURITY gave me \"Mike's\" number in the first place. I explain this to Mike. I also ask for the name of the Manager of the hotel, as I think maybe he should know about this. He tells me: \"I can tell you right now that he isn't going to care. He'll refer you right back to us [SECURITY].\" Then he says \"oh, the baggage claim is not Hilton - it's a third party contractor.\" I replied, \"Nice try, but it is the hotel's responsibility and at the end of the day, the hotel should know if any thefts are occurring on its premises.\" I also mentioned that on THursday, January 29, I was rudely treated by the maid on my floor Sophia. Here's what happened - I went back for my lunch break and went into my room to watch television. My remote control was gone. Since my room was clean and I had seen Sophia down the hall, I walked up, said \"excuse me, I'm staying in room such and such, where is my remote?\" She didn't respond. She waved me away. I asked again. She pointed down the LOOOONG hall: \"Go ask her.\" And she turned away. So I walked down to the other end of the hall and ask this poor woman, whose name, unfortunately, I didn't get because it seemed she actually cared about doing a decent job and treating guests with respect. She said \"Sophia cleaned your room -- Hold on, I'll find out...\" she walked with my down the hall and asked Sophia about it. Sophia, annoyed, said \"what? what are you talking about.\" This poor woman said \"her TV REMOTE! You cleaned her room! Do you have it?\" Of course, Sophia did - she had taken it from my room for some reason and put it in another and couldn't be bothered to answer my question. So of course I thought, well IF I did forget and leave my two tees in the room, maybe the oh-so-helpful Sophia would \"forget\" that she saw the tees although why someone would steal two tees I'll never know. So I mentioned this to \"Mike.\" No effect. A week later, I get a call from a David H. in security asking me to call him. I think - wow, maybe they found them in the laundry or something - that's great. I call back. Nope. David wants to know whether I have receipts for the tees. I was flabbergasted. Now I have to prove that I had them? I have time to make up stories about two tees not worth more than $30? I explained to him that the one tee I got on a trip to MD with my hubby in October 2007 - so, uh, no I wouldn't have a receipt for that. As for my Obama tee - it was a gift from the campaign so in a way it is priceless. I explained that to this guy and then asked why - and he said \"well, we need to know what they were worth IN CASE WE'RE LIABLE.\" Um, ok. I still plan to contact the hotel management. That was the most ridiculous, aggravating and downright obnoxious experience I have EVER had at a hotel. Like I said, I travel alot for business and pleasure and I have never had something go missing. I also felt like the so-called SECURITY Team was completely uninterested in my plight. I mean, I did say - yea, I get it, they're just two t-shirts, no big deal, but they are MY t-shirts and I like them both. I'd like to recover them. The whole thing left a bitter taste.

I liked that the security guard asked guests to show their room keys after sundown- I hadn't seen that done before. The only disappointment was that 2 of the towels in my room had grey stains on them, like shoe polish. For a hotel that is 4 star, this in unacceptable. The towels also looked somewhat crumpled, like they weren't folded immediately after they had been washed, but it made me wonder if they had been changed since the previous guest. They probably had been changed, but I'm a little finicky about my towels and sheets. I ended up just using the handtowels and washcloths, because I didn't feel like waiting for housekeeping, or getting any housekeepers in trouble if the towels are coming from the laundry looking like that.

First off, I'll start off with the good things. The room was nice, though small. We were booked into a room with a double bed through priceline without our knowledge. They were able to switch us to a room with a queen, but it was \"a little smaller.\" That's ok, it had a desk and a dresser drawer, and that was fine with us. Through priceline, our rate (before taxes, etc.) was about $150, so we couldn't ask for too much. The location was great for what we wanted to do. Close to central park, subway, etc. Perfectly happy with that. Now, let me tell you why I wouldn't stay here again. First off, the line to check in and to check out was very long. I tried checking out through the TV, but the service was \"down\". I tried the zip kiosk, but that didn't work either. I had to stand in line. I had to check in some luggage for them to hold before and after our stay. This line was also long. Also, they charge $3.50 PER ITEM (be it small shopping bag or a huge suitcase) to store luggage. I have never seen this before in my life. Not only did I have to stand forever in line to check in luggage, but I had to pay for this privilege. Of course, part of why they are so slow is that they have to collect payment. Ironic, isn't it? And we had to pay after checkout, in cash, making reimbursement for work (wasn't a work trip THIS TIME luckily) annoying and tricky. What if we didn't have cash? And were running to catch a cab to the airport? This can happen under many circumstances, of course, but the point is we don't need one more of these possible circumstances when so many other hotel options don't make you go through this. All told, I spent at least an hour in line, if not more. Really, I have better things to do. The most annoying thing by far is the internet access. They charge $10/day per computer. Now, not only is this a ridiculous cost (think about it: if two people have two computers for 3 days, that's $60 for internet access, even though you probably only need it for an hour per day). More importantly, it's just a huge pain in the butt to set up. I just want to open my computer and use the internet. If I have a business colleague or friend over for some conversation and he needs to check his email for a moment, does he have to enter his credit card information to do this, while sitting in front of me? It's not so much the cost, it's the incredible inconvenience. A few other things: - no bathtub - >$20 continental breakfast. Is this a joke? Now, let me compare this to my experience at Ramada Eastside just a few weeks earlier, which is also in a good location. I did not stay at the Ramada this time because the Hilton on this particular weekend through priceline was cheaper ($150 vs. $220). Last time, however, the Ramada was $135 (standard rate just by calling them) and the Hilton standard rate is at least $350 or so. This is a no-brainer, as my Ramada experience was better (in an absolute sense, not just relatively) than my Hilton experience: - line for check-in: instant - line for check-out: instant - holding my bags: quick and painless and free - internet: check \"yes I accept conditions\" and it's free and unlimited instantaneously - room size: same as Hilton, and I had a bathtub, not just shower - room quality: not quite as nice as the Hilton, but certainly comfortable, clean, and reasonably high quality. Fitness room available in both, but didn't check them out. - free local and long distance calls on their landline, which is a cordless phone! Very convenient, although with cell phones the need is not huge for this kind of service. For a business traveler, the Ramada makes infinitely more sense, as it values your TIME. I would only pick the Hilton if room ambience made a huge difference (like maybe for a romantic getaway where you don't really want to leave the room-- though I don't know why you would come to NYC if that's your goal). However, standing in line usually puts a damper on the mood, as did the beeping smoke detector due to low battery in our room at 11:45pm (ok, this could've happened anywhere). For personal travel, the Ramada makes double sense, since you'd be paying half the price (except maybe through a priceline deal). Basically, I would only choose the Hilton if it were actually cheaper, and even then I would have to remember to factor in the hidden costs. If I were paying $350+ for a hotel room here and also all those hidden fees, I'd be really angry. By the way, some might argue that the Hilton gives you a \"choice\" to avail of those services or not, making it cheaper for some whereas other hotels just factor that into the room cost. Nope. If it weren't for the extra administrative hassles that they have thanks to their payment scheme, their own costs in providing internet service and bag check would be lower. Anyway, no matter what it's completely overpriced. And more importantly, it's just a hassle to pay. I just want it to work. Again, no way would I voluntarily stay here again, even at that price point, unless nothing else were available. The small things were good, but the big things weren't right.

The Executive Lounge on the 44th floor was huge. Although we did not eat any of the light meals/snacks they server there it was typically very crowded during the morning but a great place to get free coffee/water. We used Hilton points to book this room, and were charged a $750 non-refundable deposit to secure the room. We understood the fee since the hotel was sold out and rooms were going for over $600/night. However at check in the desk person was a little unfamiliar with the deposit situation, and the manager had to come over to explain how we would get our money back. Both were polite. Although there was a large convention going on at the hotel, most services were speedy and phones answered quickly. The only recurring problem was the wait for the elevators. A bank of only three elevators served floors 34-44 and sometimes the wait (especially in the mornings) could be 5+ minutes. On Sunday we actually had to catch an up elevator to get down because all the down elevators were packed. My other complaint was that this hotel did not have any shoe shine on the premises. Otherwise we did not have any problems with the property. The doorman was efficient and taxis were easy to get. The subway is 3 blocks in either direction. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay much closer to Rockefeller Center, Radio City, and the best stores along 5th Avenue. Although walking along the cr\u00c3\u00a8me de la cr\u00c3\u00a8me retailers along 5th Avenue, we did most of our shopping on Broadway in SoHo. As I say in many of my reviews about Business-style Hiltons, Marriotts, etc. don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a lot of personalized assistance as the hotels are simply too big to give that level of service.

I had some slight concerns about some areas of the hotel from reading reviews on this sight, but didnt see anything to back them up. Check in was very fast and efficient, we hadnt pre-booked any special upgrades or made any requests so we were really pleased when we got to our room. We had room 3011 so were really high up amongst the other skyscrapers. We must have been given a recently modernised room which was luxurious and had plenty of space for the two of us. The room was cleaned every day promptly, no moans there either. Another problem we had read about was waiting for lifts, we simply didnt experience this even though we were there during thanksgiving. The hotel lobby is very busy but is big enough not to feel cramped and chaotic. We had drinks in the lobby bar one evening which averaged \u00c2\u00a36 for a pint of lager, I thought this was expensive but later found the whole of New York very expensive!! The location of the hotel is perfect. Times square just 5 mins on foot, same for central park and the Rockerfella center. My wife and I demand high standards from our holidays and we were very pleased with everything, so take it from me, as long as you get one of the newer rooms high up, you will do just fine with this hotel. Now for the other bits....The Empire state building experience wasnt good. We got into the lobby area quicky and all seemed well, then the queues started. There are no warning signs telling you how long it will take to get to the top, so here is the warning. When you start to queue at the top of the escallators before you have even bought tickets it will be nearly 2 HOURS, you are just led around queueing area after cleverly diguised queueing area! They allowed too many people to get to the top, meaning it was crowded when we got up there and you had to jostle for a position. All in all I would go for the top of the rock next time and miss this one. Show tickets....Another lengthy queue 1.5 hours in Times square got us to the front of the ticket line where it is a bit of a lottery as to what will be available that night. Be prepared for tickets prices of around $160 dollars (2 people) for the likes of Chicago, even with 40% taken off!! These queues form quickly so get there on time. For an evening show you need to be there at around 1500. On the whole NY is fantastic, eating and drinking is VERY expensive (not the case for Starbucks) but it's a city that has to be seen to be believed.

We landed at JFK at 11.05am NY time and check-in at the hotel is from 3pm onwards.

House keeping were also very friendly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we would leave 3-4 dollar tip every morning with a little note saying 'thank you!'. Our room would be spotless when getting back to the hotel. We had a very comfy King size bed Deluxe room which also had a very comfy sofa in the corner by the window. The room was very spacious with a good size bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shower was a walk in one and it was heaven to shower in! The view wasn't fantastic but who cares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were out and about in NYC!!! We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as we're not big fans of hotel food. And we think the food is quite expensive for what it is. So we ate out every morning for breakfast! There are PLENTY of places to go to for breakfast that are literally 5 min walk from the hotel. The portions are enormous and will keep you full until dinner time! Girls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don't worry about how much you eat when you're in NY. You'll do SO much walking that you'll burn loads of calories!! The Hilton is in a GREAT location! Times Square, Rockefella Centre, 5th Avenue, Central Park etc. are all in close walking distance. Subways close by too. We both bought a 7 day metro card. It's cheaper and easier than buying a ticket everyday. For people who are going to NYC for the first time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you'll get the BEST EVER views of the city from the Top of the Rock Observation Deck at the Rockefella Centre rather than the Empire State building. And make it a big must to go see the city at night from the top of the Rockefella Centre. One word 'BREATHTAKING'! Central Park goes on forever! It's a never ending park and another world. It's beautiful. If you want to get some serious shopping done then we suggest you go to Woodbury Common in New Jersey. It's fantastic and at discount prices. Shops there are: Timberland, Ugg, Guess, Dior, Chanel, CK for women, CK for men, Juicy Couture, Lacoste, Banana Republic, G-Star, Tommy Hilfiger etc. You can catch a coach from NY Port Authority which is about a 15 min walk from the hotel (probably less than that as I'm a slow walker!). Coach tickets are 40 dollars each \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this includes return tickets and a big book of discount vouchers to use when you arrive at the outlet. The shops open at 10am so we caught the 8.30am coach. The journey to the outlet takes 45mins and same coming back (if you catch a coach after midday then the journey would probably be longer as NY traffic get VERY busy). You can have a look for yourself if you google 'Woodbury Common, New Jersey'. One thing we do suggest\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.is that you get there early as it gets very busy. FYI most shops in NYC open at 10am Monday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Friday. Some shops open on Sunday at 12. Girls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you have to 'pop' into Tiffany's.

The place is amazing. You'll fall in love with their jewelry selection. One last thing to leave you with and that is \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.

On the 1st Fl is a Starbucks and some other stores to buy food at as well as a bar and restaurant off the lobby which we didn't use. The health club is pretty large and has many cardio machines and looked very clean though we didn't use it. The Hilton Club is actually the vacation ownership part of the property and there are salespeople on the 1st floor who would love to give you a tour (probably high-pressure sales) of the facility. We took a pass on that option. As others have said the location is excellent. It's a short walk to Rockefeller Center, Central Park and Times Square.", "Date": "November 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, busy hotel, small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Chitownee", "ReviewID": "UR21982470", "Content": "We booked our hotel through my husband's work account and we got a rate of $299 per night.

We had an \"executive room\" on the 34th floor, it was a very good size and the beds were REALLY COMFORTABLE, the same could be said for the pillows, way above average. We had our breakfast - included in the room rate - in the 44th floor lounge, its a pretty standard continental breakfast, wont set the world on fire but filling and plenty of it. One tip here though is GET THERE EARLY we used to be there by about 7 and when we left there was always a long queue to get in as the capacity of the room is 99 persons and any more is illegal as the sign clearly points out!!!. There is also free internet access in the lounge, you can either use your own laptop or the provided pc. Although it is shared with a lot of guests it works well as you just book a 15 minute slot, we never had any problems using it. The loung also provides free tea and coffe throughout the day upto 2245 and hors d'oevres at 5 pm, again the secret here is get there early. I had read several rather negative reports on trip advisor about this hotel and I was a little apprehensive especially as it was part of a birthday treat for wife and daughter, but everything was fine To give an example one evening the bathwater was very slow to run away, i rang the reception and they were going to send up a plumber straight away !!! now that is what I call service. There are two nearby subway stations, one by the Sheraton and one by the Radio City music hall, which is the one we used mainlhy as more lines go through it, both of them are less than a couple of hundred yards from the entrance. One thing though which shouldnt happen is the Hilton's policy of charging 3 dollars 50 cents per bag if you leave it at the hotel after you have checked out and before you actually leave for the airport. In all the hotels I have ever stayed in no one has ever charged for this. I did object to the charge, pointing out I had paid a lot of money to stay in their hotel and didnt expect to pay for something which should be provided free. the charge was waived, so do query it and tell them how unacceptable it is. The lady in front of us collecting her bags was charged 21 dollars which does seem a rip off.

During our stay the front staff, concierge and theatre desk were all helpful but not friendly. The beds at this place are the most comfortable I've ever slept in and the room we had was quiet and very nicely set out and fresh/new - we had a problem with no hot water one morning (hotel wide) but the people I rang seemed less than bothered - having paid over $3,000 for a week - I wasn't best pleased. Final straw was them attemtping to charge $14 to leave our bags with them for 3 hours after checking out. The guy on the luggage desk was the rudest we'd confronted and dropped my heavy suitcase into my hand rather than lift the bar and pass it through. We refused to pay as the sign clearly said $3.50 daily charge and I assumed this was for people leaving luggage for a few days whilst going elsewhere. After trying to struggle to retrieve the suitcase and a bit of a scuffle the guy (still have uttered NOTHING other than \"$14\") called security. It was an unpleasant and unnecessary end to the week. However their follow up action - a Director of the Hotel rang me in the UK to apologise for the issues I'd had and for bringing it to their attention via the Guest Survey they emailed - has made me feel they are seriuos about sorting the issues.

The bathroom was a bit of disappointment. Extremely small. The view was great. We could see central park from up there, HOTEL SERVICE: The hotel is very big and therefore very crowded. We arrived by taxi and bellmen were nonetheless promptly on hand to get our bags and escort us to the check in area. Check in was at the regular check in counter not on the executive floor. But we had zero wait time so it didn't matter. On check out since we had a late flight we asked the bellman to store our bag for a couple of ours, which he did. He forgot to mention that there's a 7 dollars fee per bag for storing the luggage, be it for a day or for an hour! It would have been nice if you would have told us that. anyway all the hotels I have been in, including HIltons, can usually store your bags if you check in early or late for free. EXECUTIVE LOUNGE: Staying in a suites gives you access to the lounge. In the evening (5-7 if I recall) they offer some hors d'oevres. I found the selection was pretty good. You can't make a whole meal out of it of course. In the morning you are served free continental breakfast. We did have breakfast and all considered it was satisfactory. The only negative thing is that the lounge is not extremely big and can't hold all guests at once. There was a queue for breakfast, but we waited only 10 minutes so all in all I find that acceptable. Did not dine in the hotel so can't comment on that. All in all I'd rate my stay as good but not over the top. Would probably stay here again cause the location is great and service is good.

Nicely decorated with a flat screen TV. The bathroom was on the small side, but had plenty a room for all of our toiletries, make up etc. The only thing that annoyed me was the toilet, to flush you had to bend down and reach your hand under the sink, it was a strange. But for the $$ it was perfect! We booked through the Hilton website and paid $299 and $259 for a Thurs/Fri stay, worth every penny. We checked into going back @ x-mas time and the price is double so not sure if we will be going back that time, but if the price was the same I would book there every time!

It is located in Midtown Manhatten, only a few blocks from Central Park and Broadway. If you are in NY for theater, this is a great hotel, because when you get ready to leave the hotel for the theater, you can avoid the long lines at the taxi stand by simply walking to the theater, or taking one of the many bicycle taxis - they're a litte more expensive than a regular taxi, but for a short trip, they can be faster, and certainly more entertaining. Location-wise, this place is great. Many of the staff (especially the restaurant and the housekeepers) were very nice and accomodating, even though the hotel is very busy all the time. Next, the Bad: In contrast to the nice staff that I mentioned under the \"Good\" section, some of the staff were not very helpful or friendly at all - mostly the bar staff. As you will see, some of the staff were downright \"Ugly\" - read on. Another \"bad\" thing (at least for me) is the fact that the hotel is extremely busy all the time. In the main lobby area, the noise and activity level is pretty much non-stop. Some folks like that, and I do too, in limited doses, but I have to get away from it once in a while, and also, although I complimented the housekeeping staff for being nice, there was one little thing in the room that I didn't like. When we checked in, the bathtub/shower had a lot of hair in it. Now, I know this happens in all hotels, from the cheapest to the best, but this wasn't just one hair, tucked away in a hard-to-see corner. There were several strands of hair, in various locations throughout the tub/shower, and also in a couple of other spots in the bathroom. I don't think I'm alone in feeling that the room is less than fully clean, when I see that. And finally, on the bad side, there was a sporting event that I wanted to watch on ABC. I don't normally spend my holiday time watching TV, but I wanted to take a couple of hours out to watch this particular event. So I turned on the TV, to channel 7, New York's ABC affiliate. Appearing on channel 7 was the NBC peacock. Nothing against NBC, but they weren't showing what I wanted to see. I contacted the service desk four times, and after the fourth call, they sent a service person up to check. He confirmed what I already knew - that the central server for the hotel's TV service had ABC \"programmed\" out of their channel lineup. There was no ABC in the hotel. I checked other TV's and they were all the same. No one knew what to do about it, except to call the cable service provider, which didn't help me at all, since from the time I found the problem, it took 5 hours for them to even respond, and who knows how long it took the cable company to come out and fix it. As of the time we checked out the next day, the problem still wasn't fixed. Finally, The Ugly: We stepped out of the hotel to get a taxi, and I admit that I made a mistake. I wasn't paying attention, and I was simply focused on my goal of getting a cab, so I didn't notice the line of (3 or 4) people to my right, waiting for the doorman to put them in a taxi. A taxi stopped right in front of us, to let out a customer, and I began walking toward it to get in. The doorman began yelling (actually, \"screaming\" is probably more descriptive) at the driver (although I think he was clearly trying to send me a \"message\" too - it was just that since I was a hotel customer, he felt obliged not to confront me directly), and using abusive language, even cursing, at the top of his lungs. Of course, his problem was that he had a line of taxis waiting at the curb for him to call them up and put passengers in them, and he couldn't allow a taxi with a drop-off to cut into the line. I understand that, and I don't have a problem with him taking corrective action. Now, as I said earlier, I was wrong, I was not paying attention and should have walked over to take my place in line, but it was clear that I was not intentionally trying to jump ahead of the line (this sort of thing only happens about a thousand times a day there, I imagine) I was just being inattentive. Finally, when he did put us in a cab, he simply grunted at me and slammed the car door just a little too hard for me to think that he wasn't trying to send me a message. There is a way to politely waive the offending taxi driver off, and to politely ask the offending inattentive tourist to take a place in line, but this guy chose to go the other way, and frankly, I think he made just about everyone standing out there, even the good folks who had politely and attentively taken their places in the taxi line, feel very uncomfortable. It was just an \"ugly\" moment. Of course, his tactic worked, sort of. I'll never walk out of that hotel again without looking right, to make sure there is no taxi line waiting. On the other hand, I may never come back to this hotel again, so .... I give the hotel an overall \"average\" rating, because the location and some of the staff are really very good, but the negatives that I mentioned above drag the overall rating lower.", "Date": "September 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cUnbeatable Location\u201d", "Author": "andrew23", "ReviewID": "UR19786557", "Content": "The Hilton New York's location is simply unbeatable because you're steps away from just about everything.

Yes, there was a line, but they had a few staff members checking people in and we waited maybe 10 mins to check in, and we got there at exactly 3PM.

I had gotten a pretty good good deal by booking an advance purchase/non-refundable $239 rate through the Hilton website.

The room was of a good size while the bathroom was smallish but nicely done with marble. Other strong points: the staff was generally helpful, and the location on 53rd St. (right across from the MOMA) can't be beat. As for weaknesses, the hotel is indeed huge and caters to many many guests, but the staff manages everything well and we never found the hotel's crowded-ness to be a problem. The check-in line moved quickly and the wait for elevators wasn't too bad. The only real weakness is that the Hilton does try to nickel-and-dime you: breakfasts and the mini-bar items are shockingly expensive, and they charge for Internet (they'll try to offer you several different levels of internet service... just get the basic $14.95 internet service.. it was plenty fast).

I waited in the line for 30 minutes to get my key changed for a problem that was the hotel's fault. I did protest to the receptionist but I got the distinct impression that it fell on deaf ears. One major annoyance was the fact that the floors became an assault course during the days littered with dirty laundry thrown down on the carpet and with staff congregating in the corridor and totally oblivious of the fact that you needed to get by. Dirty room service items were never collected promptly and generally gave the hotel a very sloppy appearance. At nights the utility room would be wedged open and stayed open with the assistance of a vacuum cleaner. Despite the fact that hotel is large and very busy it is a good place to stay given its location.

I later found out that having booked the exec lounge package I could have checked in at the lounge, but this was either something I had overlooked or failed to read in the booking confirmation.

I mentioned it to the hotel staff and did not see the clerk in question again during our stay.

Is it just me that notices these things ?. Executive Lounge busy in the mornings, we stayed in July, however worth a marginal wait for breakfast, but they turn the Free WiFi off during several key times, such as breakfast, to prevent people from occupying the tables and working.

I stayed here for 2 nights based on a promotion to hear a presentation on the Hilton Club. This place is always busy and bustling with activity. The mid-town location is probably the best feature of this hotel. Check-in was very fast and easy. The staff here is very friendly and helpful. The room was a decent size for NYC standards. It seems like it was a renovated room. It had marble bathroom,flat screen TV, and very tasteful furnishings. My room was on 7th floor with only a view of buildings but there was next to no street noise. View wasn't a big deal for me since I wasn't in the room very much. Here is why I only gave the property 3 stars. First off, Forget about getting an elevator between 8am and 8pm. There was always a wait. I waited as much as 10 minutes for an elevator. There was a modeling convention in the hotel when I was there and I am sure the hotel was at or near capacity but you figure the engineers would know their hotel would sometimes be filled to capacity and would have planned accordingly. Secondly, The prices for food and room service are beyond outrageous for this class of hotel. Afterall, I expect high prices at a more upscale 5 star property like a Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental but not at a Hilton. It was 26 bucks for 2 eggs sausage and homefries,28 bucks for a hamburger. 19 bucks for a simple BLT sandwich. Something is wrong when 2 people are spending 60 bucks for an barely average basic breakfast. There is no excuse to charge those prices. Hilton seems to like to gouge customers. Also, they charge for internet use which is another form of gouging customers for every dime. Room service was even more expensive than the restaurant. Overall, this is a decent property with nice rooms,friendly staff, average food(surely a very poor value) though if you go remember to bring a fat wallet to eat or better yet don't eat there. The only reason I dined there was convenience. If I had more time, I would have never dined there.

My husband and I both brought our laptops, but ended up sharing mine, because it simply wasn't worth $30 per day for us to both have a connection. We were there for 4 nights, and I just couldn't justify paying $120 for internet access. The fitness center would have been another $18 per day, but since the hotel is so close to Central Park, it's better to go on a nice run there. Definitely check your credit card statement (in addition to checking your room check-out statement) for miscellaneous charges. We, like several other reviewers, were charged for a $7.75 drink from our mini-bar that we did not drink. The Hilton did reverse this charge for us, but I wonder how many people don't notice and get ripped off. The food and drinks are ridiculously expensive when you consider how many restaurants and carts are close by. My husband paid $25.95 for a burger with fries (plus a $4.50 service charge, which does NOT include gratuity), simply because we were too tired to go anywhere. McCormick & Schmicks has a great happy hour ($1.95 burger from 4-6 and 9-12 pm) and is only about a block away. Finally, on Saturday night, we waited about 20 minutes for an elevator to take us to the ground floor. We eventually packed like sardines into an elevator that was going up, just to reserve our spot when it eventually went back down. So plan ahead if you want to leave the hotel at around dinner time on Saturday night! On a positive note, we had a complicated reservation in that it was booked as 2 nights and then another 2 nights... and they allowed us to stay in the same room all 4 nights. Even though the first 2 nights were supposed to be in a queen bed, and the last 2 nights in a king bed, they let us have the king bed all 4 nights.

Plenty of storage to unpack clothes for 4 people. The beds were good, but the bed at the Hilton in Sandestin was better (or maybe newer).

Not a \"peace and quiet\" kind of place. But you honestly can't beat the location.

We did not eat at the hotel since there are millions of other options when eating in NY. There is a fabulous little deli-type place up 6th toward the Park on the opposite side of the street that was VERY good for take out and affordable - the calzones were delicious and the pasta was as good as any sit down place. We brought food back two nights instead of eating out (a bit easier with a tired two year old) and had a medium sized desk that pulled out and we used for a table. You can find much cheaper hotels in the area and next time we might try something else but I was really happy this time to have the extra room and the location.

You actually can go to all the museums, statue of liberty, Ellis Island, all the backstage tours (NBC, Rockefeller, Radio City, Carnegie and Madison Square Garden), Bronx Zoo, Madame Trussands and various other. If you plan right you can cover alot. I went on all the backstage tours in one day. This pass cout around $100 for three days and I ordered it online and picked up at the Planet Hollywood in Times Square. Also, you get $10 off each day at Planet Hollywood for food or purchases which is great. So staying at the Hilton was easy to get around. My only complaint is wi-fi which cost around $15 a day.

My stay was for four nights, beginning April 14. Check-in was quick and efficient. There was no line at the front desk (at approximately 3:00 p.m.), so I chose to deal with a real person at the desk rather than the computer available in the lobby. The clerk was quite courteous and first offered me a room on the 23rd floor. I asked if it was a refurbished one, to which the clerk said no and offered to place me in one on the 8th floor that was completed just over a month ago. I opted for that one, knowing I was trading any real view for essentially a new room. I noticed later that a separate line was available for HHonors members at the Blue and Silver levels and a completely separate check-in desk across the lobby for Diamond members. There's no cost to becoming an HHonors member, so I highly suggest doing so. The hotel lobby indeed reminded me of a busy airport terminal, just as other reviewers stated, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise upon entering the massive lobby. My first experience with the elevators was not positive, but was due to my inattentiveness. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice the elevators to the right were for floors 15 and above, while the ones on the left were for the lower floors. I naturally entered an elevator for the upper floors and had to take a round trip before entering a correct elevator. Having a room on a lower floor also made my elevator waiting time much more tolerable than those waiting for the upper floor elevators. My room was small, but nothing unusual for New York City. It looked newly furbished and indeed was comfortable. It could have been better designed in order to utilize the limited space more efficiently. For example, the desk and chair were situated near the front of the bathroom door, leaving a narrow clearance when entering the room. The bed was quite comfortable. Also handy were the flexible lights on the headboard, which allowed me to lie on the bed while using my laptop with the light shining directly on the keyboard. The only significant noise heard in my room was coming from the streets, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be expected in the big city. Probably my biggest issue was the $14.95 daily charge for wireless internet service; this is an outrage for a business-class hotel. Oh, please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to leave a nice tip for the housekeeper each day; they are the hardest workers in the whole hotel and deserve a little monetary recognition. Thanks to previous reviewers, I totally avoided the hotel restaurants and opted for numerous neighborhood establishments. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adventurous enough to try the food from sidewalk carts. Several subway stations are available close to the hotel, so venturing to various neighborhoods was quite easy (I only got lost once on the subway, which is great for someone who gets lost in his own house). Remember to grab a handy map of Manhatan available at the concierge desk; it notes subway stations and lines, which you should study before venturing out. Check-out was quite smooth, probably because I did so at 5:00 a.m. Remember to check your final bill carefully before walking away from the front desk! I did so and noticed an erroneous $10.82 mini-bar charge (I never ever use mini-bars). The clerk promptly and courteously removed the charge upon my pointing out the error. In all, I had a perfectly fine stay at the Hilton and would return. I cannot over-emphasize my appreciation for previous reviewers, whose insights and suggestions allowed me to make informed choices.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Coast", "Title": "\u201cHilton New York - Being realistic\u201d", "Author": "kasey363", "ReviewID": "UR15029662", "Content": "Let me preface this review with telling you New York is like my second home. I live three hours away, but travel here one or twice a month, even more so at times, to enjoy the city - and have for years and years. I think what everyone looking for a review needs to be certain they realize is the NYC is a big place - lots of choices..if you choose a \"brand name\" large scale hotel (such as this Hilton) in midtown Manhattan this realistically is what you'll get: (1) Accessible location - Times Square, 5th Ave shopping, Rockefeller Center, multiple subway stations (53rd - C, E and B, Q, N, R) within a block (1, 3, 9) lines a block further. Theatre District and Central Park within a few blocks. Starbucks on every block and shopping on Madison Ave within a few more. Radio City across the street. (2) Clean, updated rooms of decent size for NYC - decent beds, dressers and good size closet space and a locked mini-bar. Bathrooms are a bit small, but clean, marble counters, good shower heads and pressure, very adequate and updated. Large mirrors in bath and full length mirrors on the closet doors. Towels are fluffy. Rooms range from standard fair to suites - so you have options. Although truth be said (from this Hilton honors member) the only time a suite is worth the money is for a long stay or if using for business purposes and the \"executive floors\" are never really worth the extra. Midtown location and demand at this convention type hotel make it fairly expensive - but remember it's NYC - it's the demand and the location. (3) There are several hotel bars and several restaurants - all convenient - but remember it's NYC....meaning average (if that) food, very expensive for quality and drinks are expensive. Even an import beer is $9.00 - but again....follow the mantra <<smile>> it's NYC! If you are going to spend $$ this city has a place for every palatte....street food...local places... (even hit the Astro one block north for a variety of simple/local food - reasonable, fast for breakfast and lunches). Get out of the hotel to eat - hotel restauants are last choice - especially in this city of endless choices in thre area and much more so beyond. (4) This Hilton is smack in midtown and hosts convention/meeting spaces - it's close to 2000 rooms - so be realistic, it's lobby will be spit-shined marble polished but as big and wide as an airport terminal; and it will have (at times) just as many people...which means long lines for everything...charging for luggage storage ($3.50 per) and lots and lots of service employees that are not trained to act as ambassadors to the city. Again...it's NYC - I have stayed here numerous times, you do get some helpful people and smiling staff and then you just get those that go about their jobs with no extra or any effort to the public. I travel alot and have stayed at many different hotels in the city - if you want more personalized service and interaction - there are hundreds of boutique or smaller hotels in this city. This Hilton is not one of them - just be realistic! Use the zip check in stations - there are multiple ones in the lobby; it's a good alternative to those long lines. Lower floors get you less wait time on elevators, make a request - and if not - then again, it's a very large, crowded hotel - waiting goes with the territory. (5) The good part of such a large, centrally located hotel such as this? Lots and lots of taxis at your disposal under a covered area and even better - within a block or two you can access the majority of subway lines to get anywhere in this city. It's a busy hotel - so it's populated, still, walking to and from the hotel (at most times) it is not a desolate (at night) - so that's plus. Overall, if you are looking for a great midtown location to many things (Central Park/shopping/theatre/tourist attractions/transportation) and don't mind being faceless - just want a clean, spacious room to sleep and shower in and go about your time seeing the city - this is not a bad choice. In all fairness - I have asked for extra towels and they were delivered in adequate time. I have asked the conceirge for assistance in a difficult reservation and got good service. I have had the door opened for me frequently from the door staff, and had my stored luggage mistagged, but we found it and even gave him a tip (which I'm sure he didn't expect) but then he proceded to carry my bags out front for me (which is not part of his job). So set your expectations realistically, know what you really got when you choose, and this Hilton most of the time will not disappoint.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGood Choice\u201d", "Author": "PASkier", "ReviewID": "UR14876850", "Content": "Good Choice in New York.

My standard double room was well-sized and well-appointed with a desk, soft chair, mini-bar, tv cabinet, double closet, and bathroom with granite counters and floors. The rooms were clean and well-tended with daily refreshments of bathroom supplies. The mini-bar was rather pricey, at $8 for a domestic can of beer and $3.50 for a can of coke. The room had wireless internet access that will set you back $15 a day. The tv had about 40 channels, including HBO and HBO 2 and the usual ability to buy movies and games. I stayed on the 18th floor and was surprised at how quiet the hotel was--expecting a lot of street noise. Either there wasn't any, or the hotel has well-insulated glass. The hotel sits amidst a sea of skyscrapers, so there are no views other than more buildings. The hotel conference facilities were quite large and expansive across 3-4 floors as one might expect in a major city.

A short walk to the west is Broadway and all of the theatre complexes around Times Square. A short walk to the north (about 5 blocks) is Central Park with the natural history and met about 20 blocks further. A short walk to the east is 5th Avenue and all of the high-end shopping (Tiffany's, Bergdorf's, FAO Schwartz, etc.). Location is the best attribute of this hotel, as the pricey nightly rate would indicate. If you stay at this hotel, there are several dining options nearby besides the overpriced hotel restaurants. The Global Kitchen, for example, across the street and down a block on 52nd has made-to-order omelettes and sandwiches for less than $8.

During our last few stays we encountered hallways cluttered by huge green bins containing what seems to be laundry, many -- yes, many -- housekeeping carts and equipment blocking passage, service doors propped open revealing trash bins and debris guests need not see. The housekeeping staff indifferently clustered together in chatty groups as guests struggle to pass in the narrow hallways. Now, we understand the housekeeping staff has its tasks to do and the carts and equipment used cannot always be hidden away, but the stuff seemed to be in the halls at all times of the day, some of it never moving for the entire time of our stay!

Numerous restaurants also within walking but I highly recomment the following - Teds Montanna Grill (order the Bison its fantastic), Del Fusco (expensive but worth it), Heartland Brewery (great for lunch and dinner). All these restaurants are within easy walking distance from the hotel.

I had phoned the hotel from London gatwick to tell them of our late arival and was told all was ok. Anyway we arrived checked in, went to our rooms, just normal ones (not executive) on the 9th floor, we had 2 rooms and our children were staying on the other side ot the corridor which was perfect. Rooms very clean and the most comfy beds I have ever slept in away from home! We had booked to have breakfast included which we thought would be easier so we could just get going in the morning without worrying where to go and eat. The first morning we were late for breakfast about 9 am and there was a rather large queue (about 20 minutes wait. But we got seated got our drinks and we were of to the buffet. Great buffet fresh fruit, bacon (no one does bacon like the americans do!), sausages, eggs in ayway you can imagine, cold meats, lots of pastries (heavenly) and bread, there was also salmon and stuff for the oriental market, they also had something called Birchers Muesli (this looked too much like vomit and therefor left it well alone!!) When we left I was confused as we had paid for breakfast I thought that was it, but we had to pay a service charge of about $15.00, I was not happy with this as it was self service all they brought us was drinks and cleared the table. When we returned in the evening the girls room had not ben made, a call to reception and the room was cleaned, the next day we had no towels, then they had no towels. When they used the hairdryer and the television was on they would loose all the electricity in their room. These were small things and they were very good at putting them straight more or less immediately but it was just a bit annoying. We also had no showergel, when we asked for this we got given more shampoo and conditioner (we are not very hairy people!!) so perhaps they do not use showergel, we have stayed in other Hiltons and we did get showergel anyway this is not very important. After the first morning we used to get down for breakfast by about 7 -7.15 am and there was no queue then. Eventhough it is a very large hotel it does not feel that way, there were always people around but you never felt overcrowded. The hotel is perfectly located for sight seeing, just a few blocks from Central Park, Times Square, subway stations and the main shopping areas. Lots of great delis around, go in to the pubs as the food is great and good value. We were in New York for Christmas, which was good fun, the skating rinks got very busy, everyone looking at the Rockefeller Tree you would not be able to move for the people, the shops obviously were very busy but it was a nice atmosphere. The Radio City show was mindblowing. All in all we had a great time. When we were due to leave we got our bills under our doors, please check them very carefully as they tried to charge us nearly double, it was only because I had the print outs from the UK we got the rate we had booked for. They also tried to charge us for no show on our first night! They also take payment on your credit card straight away, so you may need to extend your limit before you leave the UK. Reception was very helpful , and took off the charges they had added. but had we not checked the bill we would have had a shock when our visa bill arrived.

We ate there once because I had a coupon (much to my family's horror). Oh and here is a big problem. They charged per bag if you had a late flight after check out. I have never had this anywhere else and it wasnt cheap-and they didnt take cc-cash only and I had to use an expensive atm to get the money.

We chose this hotel because we had previously stayed at the Hilton Times Square and thought it was excellent. Big mistake I'm afraid. As I said, we booked two exec rooms and called the hotel 2 weeks prior to our trip to ensure that the rooms were ajoining or at least on the same floor. When we checked in at 44th floor reception we discovered our rooms were 10, yes 10 floors apart. Granted they did eventually find us two ajoining rooms on floor 35 but it should not have happened in the first place. We discovered that we could not use the telephone in our room because they did not swipe our credit card. Well, they did, but for the original room on floor 44 which was changed for a room on floor 35 but they did not cancel and reswipe or transfer the swipe to the substitute room. Breakfast was on floor 44 and was complimentory with the exec rooms. Trouble was, the place was too small and we had to join the queue along the 44th floor corridor (outside residents rooms) to get into the place. Once inside, it was plainly overcrowded. They did offer guests that if they wanted to take their breakfast back to their room then that was OK. Not for me I'm afraid, to juggle breakfast for 3 along the corridor and down 9 floors was too much. Finally they overcharged us two and a half grand for the stay but did amend this when their error was politely pointed out. All in all, NYC was great, Hilton on 6th Avenue not so great.

We were immediately impressed by the spaciousness of our room. It was by far one of the biggest hotel rooms we have stayed in, while visiting NYC. We always take along a 6 pack of soft drinks and some granola bars for use in our hotel room, in case we get thirsty or hungry and need a quick refreshment. The trouble started our first night. We got back from having dinner and immediately saw the minibar was opened. I called down to the front desk and told them that someone was in our minibar when we were gone and we hadn't touched the thing because we have no need for it. The front desk associate told us she was making a note of it on our account and that nothing from the minibar would be charged to the room. About an hour later, my husband and I were resting on the bed and a guy, dressed in a service coat, walked right in to our room. He got almost the whole way in when we asked him what he was doing. He said he was there to service the minibar and would come back later. My husband told him there was no need because we hadn't taken anything out of it. The next morning we gone for a walk and had some lunch and when we got back, the maid had serviced the room. We were in the room resting, for a few hours, before our next trip out on the town and all of a sudden, the maid came walking into our room. She was almost to the bed when I noticed her and asked her what she was doing? She never answered me, just quickly apologized and left. Early the next morning, I got up and found the express check out sheet at the base of our door. I looked at the billing and what do you know, we were charged over $21 for a minibar we never used. I tried calling the front desk 4 times and each time, the operator disconnected me. I got dressed and went down to the front desk myself to explain what had been happening our entire stay. The front desk clerk was very quick with me and assured me that the charges had been taken off and nothing else would be charged to the room. Later that morning, my husband and I decided to go out for breakfast and take a quick walk around midtown before we'd check out of the hotel. When we returned to our room, once again someone had been in our room (and it was our checkout date, so there was no need for anyone to be in the room until we had officially checked out) once again, the minibar was opened, and the money we had lying on the desk had been taken. Nothing else in the room had been touched. The bed was still a mess and the towels were still on the floor in the bathroom. My husband and I immediately checked out of the hotel and we even waited in line to be sure we could talk to someone about the people who were in and out of our room during our stay and also about the minibar charges to our room that we never used. The front desk clerk wrote down our issues on a copy of our bill and assured us that nothing else would be charged to the room.

Nice flat panel t.v's and the most comfortable bed I think I've ever slept in. The soft duvet and pillows....ahhh...just what we needed after walking the city for 12 hrs!! The elevators were very quick - which you don't find in a lot of hotels ( I have no patience so I hate waiting for elevators). The locations was perfect for us. Close to Rockerfeller Center (which we wanted) and close enough to walk to Times Square & Macy's (about 10-15 mins walk). We walked to both shows (Mamma Mia & The Rockette Christmas Spectacular). You really won't need to taxi it anywhere unless you plan to visit the financial district (ground zero, statue of liberty)...I guess it depends on what you are going to New York to do. We shopped (a lot), watched a couple shows, skated at Rockerfeller Center, visited Top of the Rock, went to beautiful (and it is indeed beautiful) Bryant Park, Macy's, Central Station, Madison Square Gardens, & basically that's all we had time for (3 days) and we didn't have to taxi it anywhere from the Hilton. We did take a short bike-taxi back to our hotel one day only cause our feet hurt so much after 2 full days of walking!! I can't wait to go back and visit other areas we didn't get to see.

On the way there, my cabbie told me this was the biggest hotel in NYC with 2000 rooms, TripAdvisor lists 1980 rooms, still amazing. And at different times, the lobby did seem like a small town unto itself. I had made my reservations through the organization that was putting on the convention for the rate of $385. I looked for cheaper hotels in the area that I might stay at for less, but couldn't find a rate lower than the group rate they had arranged. I would recommend staying on a Hilton Honors floor if you are in the program, they seemed to be less crowded and quieter. The rooms are pretty big considering its right in the city. My king-room on the 25th floor was nice with a view of Sixth Ave. Even 25 floors up the car horns and emergency sirens were audible until about 10 PM when traffic calmed down. Everything in the room was satisfactory (see pictures). In all my stay at this hotel was fine. I wouldn't normally pay the high price of the downtown hotel, but would stay outside the city. Since work was paying, and my event was actually at this hotel, I decided to stay. There is no pool at this hotel but a pretty good gym facility. The resturants in the lobby area are a nice convenience, but a sandwich platter and a drink will run you about $18. They also have a buffet lunch each weekday for about $18 until 2 PM. There are plenty of other resturants in the area both up and down 6th, plus plenty of street food, even in December, if that's your thing. I spent about three hours walking through Central Park before I checked out. I spent about 15- 20 minutes walking there from the Hilton straight up 6th.

We thought it would be fun to stay near the Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parade route and take our 2-year-old to the parade, so we chose the Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich would also put us in a central location for visiting scattered family members. The location was great; we walked out to the parade, visited the Central Park Zoo, and took quick cab rides to other locations. The hotel itself, however, was mediocre and overpriced. Upon checking in, we were told that we had received a free upgrade. We were baffled by this information when we saw our tiny room with one queen bed (upgraded from what??). I had requested a crib for our son, and I phoned a few minutes before our arrival to ask if the crib could be ready for us, since it was around midnight. After some back-and-forth, the clerk said we were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all set\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Of course, there was no crib in the room when we got there, and it took about half an hour longer to arrive. There was barely enough room between the bed and the wall for the crib. Throughout the night (every night), a mysterious rumbling noise kept me awake (unseen freight elevator, maybe?). Our room rate included free American style breakfasts at the Marketplace restaurant. This was decent enough (except for the terrible coffee), and included things like bananas, yogurt cups, and small boxes of Cheerios that I could pocket for my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snacking needs. However, the stated value of the free breakfast was $30 per person, on which the gratuity was calculated. While I fully expect to tip the staff at a complementary meal, the price was ridiculous. On the 2nd day, the breakfast went from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as my husband got a moldy orange. These things happen, but again--$30 per person?? We skipped the breakfast on our third morning. I had been using the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minibar fridge to store milk for my son. The fridge door was crooked, and each day Housekeeping would apparently open the fridge, fail to close the wonky door properly, and leave the fridge cracked open. For $350-$400 a night, can my minibar have a door that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hanging off? Regarding the lobby and elevators, I chalked up the crowds to the holiday weekend. I see from other posts, however, that the long wait for elevators was not unique to Thanksgiving.

We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the restaurants or the breakfast - the location is just brilliant so there's no need to breakfast at the hotel, and there is a fab place across the street (Lou's place) that had a really good selection, inc veggie. (my favourite breakfast was at Cafe Bari in Soho - highly recommended) Check-in wasn't very informative and I didn't really like check-out as the bill had been put under our door in the morning and our credit cards already charged - obviously I'm British so this isn't really considered polite service and i would certainly prefer to confirm the bill is correct before it is charged. On that note be aware that there are three different taxes on top of your room rate and a daily room cleaning fee that we were not aware of - this added a lot to our bill (400 GBP) so you should check your total rate at check-in. I found the concierge and the doormen and security all to be fabulous. Security is good, we felt very safe at the Hilton, you can't get lost, it's easy to find, you're not far from anything, so while it isn't cheap i would pay the price again for all of the benefits it provided.

Of course if you want personalised service, and staff to know your name, a quiet lobby to sit in and talk to other guests, you should probably go to a B&B - you might find that NYC is not the place for you at all as you won't get friendly attentive service anywhere you go and you will feel quite anonymous - all part of the thrill of a city which I totally loved!

The rooms at the Hilton were perhaps slightly smaller than national average, but they were extremely large for NYC standards!! With our two double beds we had plenty of room to move around the room, and the bathroom was large as well. As for location, the Hilton was perfect for our needs. One block from Rockafeller Center, one from Broadway and a few more down to Times Square. We couldn't have been happier to be in the middle of the action. Best of all with our room- the beds were SO comfortable! It's no surprise they offer to sell you the mattress, pillows, etc. Very comfortable. Only negatives- the housekeeping room was outside our door. At 7am all of the cleaners gather outside of that room and throw some kind of a party. Pretty noisy! Also our flat screen tv was fuzzy.

My floor was labeled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hilton HHonors Floor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but there was no lounge and the rooms were pretty normal-looking. Since it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an Executive Floor, there was also a charge for Wi-Fi: $14.95/day. (Unlike many hotels, it was not free in the public areas or the meeting rooms, either.) Room upgrades are at the discretion of management and usually hard to come by, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t push for that. I also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother asking for the breakfast coupons since I had breakfast meetings both days of my stay anyway.

No, it was 500 HHonors points in return for being told about the Hilton Club they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re building- basically a Vacation Club. Conveniently, my husband was not with me but I was offered a bargain rate for 2 nights, plus a $100 AE Gift Card, if I brought him back so they could deliver the hard sell to both of us. Thanks, but no thanks. I was not told when I made my reservation (called the hotel directly) that the Fitness Center was closed for renovation. I happened to notice the announcement on the Web site when I was checking on my reservation, but there was also no mention of it when I checked in. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153replacement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was free use of Gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gym, a 5-minute walk away. Well, I guess if you want exercise, an additional 5-minute walk each way is OK. I just ran in nearby Central Park instead. (Can't argue with the hotel's location; great location.) A colleague with allergies requested a feather-free room when she made her reservation. They gave her one with feather pillows. It took her 3 calls to get it right- one to call it to their attention, one discussion with someone who took down her requirements, one to take away the feathered stuff and provide a substitute. My room was decent- for $300/night it should have been. The bill for 2 nights came to about $100 over that thanks to taxes (including a daily \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Javits Center fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) and one day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Internet access.

The posted sign stated that there was a charge of $3.50 per bag. I hefted my bag onto my shoulder and walked to the deli. Sure, my boss would have approved the charge.

Our room was on the 'Executive' level, 44th Floor. If this was the executive room, I am unable to fathom the rooms below the 44th floor. This is an old hotel and begs for a modern interior designer. The window draperies look like they were snatched from a southern plantation. The A/C and heating is one unit below the window with unreadable knobs for the fan and temperature. Of course, the higher the fan, the louder the rattle from the unit. To get between the bed and TV armoire to see out the window, we had to turn sideways. The size of this room may have been adequate in the 1930's, but surely not for the 21rst Century. I cannot even begin to describe the bathrrom. Suffice it to say that the 70+ year old, painted-over rusting vent above the bath speaks for itself in more ways than one.(rattle, click, etc.) If your suite/room is even half way down the hall from the executive lounge, get ready to be awakened by the long line of talkative people waiting to be seated in the lounge. You can insist on a coupon to have the same continental breakfast at the Marketplace on the main level. When we arrived in our room, the lidded ice bucket was full of water! This about states it all for room cleanliness. I wanted ice in my glass and found an UNwindowed heavy metal door with an ice sign on it--This is a huge housekeeping service room with stacked dirty room trays, hanging Hilton robes, as well as many other housekeeping supplies. There is also as elevator for staff use. As a single woman, I felt very unsafe in this utility/housekeeping room. Anyone could have been waiting in there or entered and accosted me. I should have tried the elevator in this ice/utility room for easier access to the main level. There are a total of 6 guest elevators in the hotel, 3 are for the lower levels, 3 for the higher levels. Take a magazine to wait for the constantly operating rides. The elevators do have a small TV with CNN on it which you may enjoy when the elevator door closes and then you figure out it is not moving and you cannot get out immediately! The next day there was an out-of-order sign with caution tape on it. There are no vending room amenities here, just room service and the stocked in-room bar. For $3.75 you can get a 1.5 oz Kit Kat Bar, 6 Oreos, 2.07 oz Snickers, 1.75 oz Chex Mix or the big one---3 oz of Planters Peanuts for $4.75! & 1.5 oz Pringles $4.25. Single serve Poland Spring Water $4.75, Heinekin $8.00, 1/2 bottle of Kendall Jackson Chardonney $25.00. You can request a small room refrigerator but be sure to go to the ice machine room and get cleaning supplies for it because ours was filty inside and out and it looked like they dropped it from the 5th floor! Well I guess it was to fit the ambiance of the room? The in-room movie selection had way too many porn-lover selections. If you have kids, there is no video/arcade/gaming room here either. The exterior of this Hilton LOOKS magnificant; they spent mega-bucks for the first few levels of the exterior. The first few levels above the lobby are set-up for convention type arenas. The lobby also looks grand but apparently has no housekeeping staff assigned to it on a regular basis. At times the lobby is like a mini Penn Station. There are retail stores lining the corridor, along with a few, priced higher than others, restaurants and tons of fellow travelers everywhere. Walk less than a block up 6th Ave & on opposite side is a grocer, get a room refrig. and endure. Hotel is within walking distance of subway, 1/1 1/2 blocks. This hotel is obviously geared toward the 'convention' business crowd. Hundreds of people trying to get on/off the elevators at the same time, etc. then hanging out and getting obnoxious in the bar off the lobby.

My poor experience may be due to the fact that I'm not a New Yorker and infact had never been to New York before. Just getting to the hotel was an adventure. My taxi driver didn't speak English very well but miraculously seemed to know all the words to the Britney Spears song that came on the radio. For about 3 minutes, we both sat bobbing our heads to the beat, it was very amusing. When we got to the hotel and I tried to pay him with a credit card, his demeanor changed from funny cab driver that sings Britney spears to mean driver who doesn't take credit cards. He gave me a big ol attitude, even though I was putting the card away and grabbing cash. I paid and he left. Interesting. The Hilton hotel check-in lady was extremely unhappy with her life and just couldn't break a smile for anything. Even when I flashed a bright smile asking \"is this where I check in?\" Stupid questions will get you nowhere in New York apparently. I got my room key and was directed to a specific set of elevators that would take me to my floor. I got to the room and was pleasantly surprised to find how comfy and cozy it was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6especially compared to the check-in lady. My room was super cool. The bed was the softest I'd ever jumped on and the mini-bar was fully stocked. The view from my room was neat\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6all sorts of tall buildings. I had the window open to hear the bustling of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6meaning\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6car horns. =) The TV. in the room was HUGE; I really liked that. The bathroom was pretty, but very small. There are three restaurants in the hotel, but thank god I'd managed to find a starbucks in the lobby. Who needs 10 oz. steaks when you can get a tuna sandwich and iced coffee? Iced coffee please. I decided to brave the city that first afternoon which then quickly turned into late evening and I hadn't eaten dinner yet. My feet were sore, so I decided to order room service. I ordered the Pappardelle Pasta with Meatballs, tomatoes and basil. It cost me a whopping thirty bucks! But you know what? It was brought to me by a well-mannered man in a nice suit, the table was set quite nicely and it just made me feel special. The room service guy pushed the table right up to the bed in front of the T.V. He was very polite, nothing like the check-in lady, and so I tipped him well. At least I hope 6 bucks is well. I delicately laid the napkin on my lap and dug in. There were more meatballs than I could handle\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.which says a lot about this dish. It was delicious\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.not quite 30 bucks delicious, but delicious none-the-less. A word of advice on room service\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I learned this while making my order\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6when you're perusing the dessert menu and it says \"New York Style Cheesecake---$11.95\", they mean one slice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not an entire cheesecake.

The stoppage ended shortly after we got there without incident. I will second the previous comments about the elevator situation. When the hotel is crowded (which it was every day we were there), it sometimes took up to 15 minutes to get an elevator. This is a BIG hotel, and there are alot of people going in and out. We chose not to eat at any of the hotel restaurants. The prices are way too high. Also, keep in mind that within an easy walking distance there are at least 100+ of some of the best restaurants in the country, many of which are quite reasonable. Perhaps the best place to eat is the gyro cart stand right across the street on the SW corner of 53rd and 6th avenue. Sometimes there were 30 or 40 people waiting in line.

Since this was part of a package connected with a performance at Carnegie Hall, we were'nt given a choice of hotels and the New York Hilton was chosen for us. I've been a fan of Tripadvisor for several years, so I immediately checked out the hotel on the site. I must agree with what most have said - the location is perfect. Very convenient to just about everything. One thing to be aware of is that some of the rooms have been updated and some haven't. The first room we were given was on the 6th floor and had furniture that was rather dinged up and no room safe (they do offer free safes in the lobby, but what a hassle). I requested a move due to needing a safe and they moved us to the 17th floor. Along with the safe, this room had much nicer and newer furniture. One strange thing is that the 6th floor room had a flat screen TV and the 17th floor didn't. So I'm not quite sure what the plan for updating is at the NY Hilton. The restaurants within the hotel are rediculously expensive and obviously just for those traveling on an expense account. I didn't dine in any of them but can't imagine them being worthy of the prices they charge. There are many better options in the surrounding area. One of my favorites is Angelo's Coal Oven Pizza on 57th. We ate there a a group and the food and service were wonderful (great salads and pastas as well as their famous pizza) and the prices are fair. Maid service was a little spotty - we had to ask for coffee twice, and the bolster pillows were left off the beds after the first morning. But nothing too drastic.

We were just minutes from the Rockefeller Center and Times Square by foot. Would recommend this hotel to families, since that's who I went with. There's also a small Broadway ticket box in the lobby that will assist you in finding and buying tickets, even to sold-out and hard to find shows (just be prepared to pay extra sometimes).", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cCentral business hotel giant\u201d", "Author": "M747", "ReviewID": "UR7867514", "Content": "Stayed here toether with 5 collagues for a business trip.

The Hilton New York was my 2nd choice of hotels. I had wanted to stay in Times Square, but after reading the reviews here, decided to give the Hilton a try. I still like the \"glitz\" of staying in Times Square, however this hotel lived up to reviewers comments. I requested a renovated room on a high floor as was suggested here on Trip Advisor. I would suggest doing the same thing as they are much nicer rooms. The beds were quite comfortable as were the pillows - if you didn't like the 1st one, there were 4 to choose from on each bed! The room was big by New York standards, with a 30\" wide screen TV. Our remote had a mind of it's own, and it was my fault for not asking for another. The outside wall is all windows which is quite nice. There is a small ledge around the windows that you can sit on. The windows were sealed shut while we were there since they were doing some work on the outside of the building, otherwise they would normally be able to be opened. I saw that another reviewer complained about this, but there is a sticker on each window of the room explaining and appologizing for the inconvenience. The view was not that great as you are surrounded by other large buildings and a Sheraton across the street from our room. We had a small slice of 53rd and 6th from our room - 3331. However this is pretty typical in a city of very tall buildings. The bathroom is very small. Only 1 person at a time, and in order to sit on the toilet, you have to close the door unless you want to straddle it while on the pot. The countertop and sink area is also quite small. However, the shower had very good pressure and the shower head was very large making showers very nice compared to many other hotels. Amenities included shampoo, moisterizer, a shower cap (does anyone really use these??) and 2 small bars of soap. The bar we used at the sink, did last the whole trip. However, if you like your own bar for the shower/bath, bring your own. My only complaints are small, and again, I didn't bring them up to the hotel. One of the garbage cans was not emptied one day, one day we were not given clean glasses and the soap dish was never cleaned. New bars of soap were not provided. Our room was always cleaned by late morning (we left the room by 9:00). We always had plenty of towels. The front dest wasn't real quick at check-in. There always seemed to be a line by mid-morning and through the afternoon. Being a Hilton Honors Member, I was able to by-pass the long line. I would recommend this hotel if you want to be close to many attractions and just a bit off the \"beaten path\". Times Square is a 10 minute walk, Rockefeller Center is 5 minute walk down 6th Avenue as is Central Park just 6 blocks north on 6th. Broadway and the theatres are a 15 minute walk. There were many near by subway stations to choose from. You can always get a cab at the hotel. There seemed to be a constant line of cabs on the street, waiting to be signaled by the doormen. Note - if you are looking for directions, stop at the Concierge and they have preprinted instructions for getting to the WTC, Little Italy and Chinatown. They have what trains to take, which ones to transfer to if need be and where to pick them up. I'm sure they have instructions for other main areas of Manhattan as well. I booked our room directly with the property for variable rates of $299/269/249 a nite over Memorial Day weekend. I looked at 3 Travel sites, but the best rates were through the hotel directly. (plus you can specify what you want when booking direct. ie: high floor, renovated room, a view) Considering the location, size of the room, quality of the room, and the property, I'd say it was a decent price. Another plus is there are 3 kisoks in the lobby from which you can check in and print your boarding pass for most major airlines, for free. The rooms did have TV internet access, but we didn't try this and I don't know what it costs. If you are looking for a place to eat close by, the Stage Deli on 7th has excellent corn beef sandwiches that are absolutely huge (2 people can easily share 1 sandwich). If you like seafood, McCormack and Schmick's on 52nd and 6th is very reasonable and very good. An added plus; they have outdoor seating as well. Lindy's on the corner of 53rd and 7th has good quick food. I'd stay away from the hotel restaurants as they were quite pricey as was room service. We ordered 2 appetizers (buffalo wings and chicken fingers) and a coke. With tip, the bill was $57.00! There are many great small eateries in the nearby area to choose from. Nothing is cheap in New York, but for the most part, you get decent size servings, but be prepared to pay a bit more than you're used to. I would definately return to this hotel in the future. I think I would try to get a higher floor, and a room that faces 6th Avenue if possible for a little more of a view.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cMy favorite New York hotel - Especially when I use points to pay\u201d", "Author": "Statmans", "ReviewID": "UR7715432", "Content": "I've stayed in lots of NYC hotels.

Only the heater is working during the winter months, so no air-conditioning. We opened the window very often to cool down the room. We ate breakfast (complimentary) in the New York Marketplace at the hotel. For a few days it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK, but not for a whole week and more. Every day the same food, no change at all, was something I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like. There was always a long line for breakfast. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case in May. If you only want a cup of coffee, Starbucks is attached to the hotel. Location: Finally let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk about the location. The location of the Hilton can't be beat! Wonderful location in the middle of tourist attractions like 5th avenue, MoMA, Times Square, Central Park, and Rockefeller Center. Overall: Well, we experienced this hotel during the summer and the winter and we had both times a wonderful stay. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spacious, the rooms are very nice and as a HHonors member you have some privileges.

When I first arrived at about 2pm (2/24), my room and that of my colleague\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were not available for check in. Check in time is officially 3pm and given that they were hosting at least one large conference, I guess this could happen. They did store our luggage for free (the normal cost is $3.50/item stored). Also, when the time came for check in, we had some of the best service I have seen and experienced. The staff at check in and throughout my stay in every area of the hotel (including the restaurants and housekeeping), were amazing. I want to also want to mention Arnold (do not know his last name) who provided us with some of the best check-in service I ever experienced. This hotel is located within walking distance (about 15 or so minutes) from Times Square. Also, great amenities such as restaurants, ice cream and chocolate (yes, ladies, chocolate) store, and a grocery store are within two blocks. In terms of the room, I had a king room, which met the expectations for the price of the room. Another note especially for the ladies is that the bathroom lacked vanity space. I mean, very little space, some of which is too close for comfort to the toilet. I actually resorted to spreading a towel on the bathroom floor to store my toiletries while using them. I would rather do this than have my stuff land in the latrine, which would be quite gross. When they were not in use, I kept toiletries in my suitcase. I usually store these on the vanity during my other hotel experiences. My colleague had similar vanity space issues in her room.

In a city where hotel rates are consistently among the highest anywhere, the Hilton usually has affordable-for-NYC rates for the level of quality and amenities. My floor was recently updated, which I understand has happened to much of the hotel (but not all). I was bumped up to a better room as a result of my \"standard room\" not being available and after refusing to go to another hotel for one night and then come back. Do people actually think this is a reasonable suggestion?) PROS: Rooms are confortable, typical Hilton - desk, newer \"comfort sleep\" bedding, decent size room and bathroom. Good for one or two people, but you'd be overcrowded with 3 or more. Also, the hotel is 5-10 minutes walking distance from many subway lines, and has easy access to taxis (of course, a NYC trademark). It is also close to the Museum of Modern Art and perhaps 10 minutes from the heart of Broadway (though a couple of theaters are very close). If you need quiet to sleep, ask for a higher floor. Noise levels above floor 15 or so are reasonably low - not silent, but low. Of course if you want absolute quiet, you probably should stay out of NYC :-). There are 2 bars at ground level. Drinks are very good, but expect NYC prices ($7 beer, $10-$15 martinis). If you need a rental car, Hertz is across the street. CONS: I found it amusing that the undercurrent of the front desk was that I should be grateful for the upgrade. Needless to say, warm customer service is not exactly a trademark. The Hilton's lobby can often be clogged with travelers, and they don't always seem to staff for demand very well. Further, both at the desk, bars and througout the hotel, there is a definite lack of outgoing customer service. You get what you ask for, little else, and with little of that positive customer attitude you'll find at higher end, customer-focused hotels. I find this endemic at Hiltons, so clearly they are not focusing on customer service. That said, staff is not mean or rude, just disengaged, so get your key and enjoy the stay.

We arrived at 11:00 a.m. so we didn't expect our room to be ready but decided to check just in case. After standing in line for 20 minutes, the stone-faced woman at the front desk shoved a form at us to take to baggage storage and said the room wasn't ready. We asked if she could tell us when the room would be ready and she shrugged. We asked if there was some way to pick up our key later to avoid standing in a long line again. She snapped at us and said that we would have to stand in line again like everybody else. I said that I didn't think it was right that we should have to spend another 20 minutes in line and she shrugged and said that there was a manager's line (which we never found). We stored our bags and went to take a walk. We came back around 2:30 and tried again to check in. After spending another 20 minutes in line, a different woman snapped at us and said, \"the room's not ready. Check-in is at 3.\" I saw all 10 people ahead of me in line walk away with keys so I was a little frustrated. We paid extra for a Deluxe room so I expected to be treated a little better. The woman said that Deluxe rooms are always the last to be cleaned and that our room might actually be ready but housekeeping hadn't entered it into the computer yet. I asked if she could call housekeeping to see if it was ready and she said, \"Yeah, at 3.\" I used to work in the hotel industry and whenever people tried to check in early, we blocked rooms for them and called housekeeping and had them clean those rooms first. Obviously this hotel doesn't care enough about their guests to do this. My husband and I went to the lobby bar and had a couple of very over-priced drinks while we waited for our room. Finally at 3, we got back in line (with at least 15 people ahead of us and only 2 front desk clerks). I saw a woman walking around who looked like a manager. I was just about to walk over to her and ask if she could help us when she asked if anyone in line was just waiting to pick up a key. We raced over to her and she directed us to someone who actually gave us a room key. We booked the Romance Package which included a bottle of sparkling wine and breakfast. We had to ask about how to go about getting the wine and breakfast. We were told to call Room Service to have the sparkling wine delivered. We asked if we needed a coupon for breakfast and the front desk clerk advised us that all we needed to do was order breakfast in the restaurant and it would be deducted from our bill. We asked three times to verify and each time we were told we didn't need a coupon. When we went down to the restaurant in the morning, we told the waiter our package was supposed to include breakfast and he asked for our coupon. We told him that we hadn't been given one so he had to call over the restaurant manager to look into things. The restaurant manager was the only friendly person we encountered in our visit. He did some research and came back with the coupon we should have received at check-in. The room itself was adequate, but certainly not deluxe. We didn't have much of a view and we were close to the elevators. The bathroom was small and only included a shower and we found a few hairs in the shower. There was really nothing special about the room. The hotel was crowded at all times. There was always a long line at the front desk and we had to wait for several minutes every time we had to take the elevator. There were always several employees milling about the lobby but nobody ever greeted us or offered to help us with anything.

The room was nice and well decorated with a small bathroom. There was nothing special about it but it was clean and well maintained. We unfortunately did have noisy neighbours who insisted on shouting and talking loudly to past 1:00am. We called downstairs and asked for them to be stopped and security must have done something as eventually the noise decreased. We did not use any of the restaurants, room service or gym as there are plenty of restaurants in the area so cannot comment on these amenities. We did use the concierge to arrange for a car to take us to the airport and that was done quickly and efficiently. The hotel was nothing to write home about but it did provide us with a decent place to stay in New York city at a decent price.", "Date": "February 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSurprising great\u201d", "Author": "travellinghopefully", "ReviewID": "UR6777858", "Content": "I have stayed here a number of times in the past and it was adequate but on this trip I stayed part of the time in one of the new renovated rooms.

They are efficient, though. That said, this hotel was good for me. The rooms are small (but if you think you'll find a huge spacious room in NYC, get over it). Clean, quiet. I was on the 40th floor, so above the street noise. My favorite was the 44th floor executive lounge and continental breakfast.

So I called the front desk from my mobile phone and asked to speak to the manager. He started yelling at me to be patient. When I told him that he had a diamond member in line for 40 minutes with no movement---he hung up on me. So I have a number to HIlton Diamond Customer Service and ended up speaking to a Hilton Executive at home (I think he was sleeping). The Hilton Executive told me that he would immediately get the root cause. Withing 5 minutes about a dozen people came out from behind the wall, including the night manager and each person received personal attention. I asked for the night manager.

The hotel was clean, the people were friendly, the staff helpful. I have really only two complaints. One, room service was VERY expensive. Now, I know this is New York - so what do I expect? I don't know. But I paid $50.00 for my daughter and I to get dessert via room service. The hotel charges a $9.00 room service fee to deliver the food - and then I was reminded by the waiter that gratuity is NOT included in that $9.00. So, I gave a tip too, so by the end - I paid $16.00 more just to get room service. Next time, I'll walk down to the restaurant or get ice cream to go at one of the many restaurants nearby. Second complaint - the breakfast buffet. My entire meal was cold and I could not get the waitress to bring our check to save my life. It was frustrating. But, I also will admit that it very well could have been simply an \"off\" morning for both the waitress and the restaurant. Our trip was fabulous, however, and I would most certainly stay here again. The location could not be beat. We also booked via priceline and we received a rate of $150.00 per night, which for the quality and location, could not be beat. On a side note, my daughter and I went to see \"Hairspray\" at the Neil Simon theater, and to say it was FABULOUS would not be giving it enough credit.

The hotel was absolutely ideal for our trip - we were looking for a good quality hotel in a fantastic location and it scored maximum points on both criteria. Overall Hotel: This hotel is huge! It has everything that you would expect from a 4 star Hilton hotel in New York - large reception area, bars, gift shops, restaurants, concierge etc. However, I know that Hiltons often have a reputation for impersonal and sometimes even inefficient service due to the size of the hotel - not this Hilton. Everybody we came into contact with at the hotel was lovely - friendly, courteous and professional. If they said they would do something, it was done and done on time - they even did a little bit more when they could. For such a large hotel in such a major city I think this is a big deal! Room: The hotel is currently renovating some floors and unfortunately our room was on a floor that had not been renovated, so although it was fine, everything worked - it was getting just a little bit tired. I'm happy if a hotel has a nice bed, a good bathroom with a fully working shower and a minibar and it had all three! Believe me, I have been to some grand hotels that didn't have ticks in all of these boxes! If we had stayed in a room that had just been renovated I am sure that this hotel would have scored maximum points in all criteria - but because the room we had was a little tired (and the air conditioning smelt a bit funny) I need to mark the hotel down just on this bit!

Our room was on the 20th floor and I really hope that it was not an \"updated\" room, because there were some clear deferred maintenance issues: the wallpaper was peeling, the toilet seat was not firmly affixed to the toilet, etc. (The bed was very comfortable, though.)

Hotel is not bad for families as it has two restaurants, one of which is fairly kid friendly (Marketplace). The room service menu was relatively reasonably priced, (kid's meal around $9). Drinks in the lobby lounge were over-priced for NY but probably average for Hilton. ($8/9 for a beer). We were up-graded from a standard room to an executive room due to lack of availability - a slightly nicer decor and toiletries! Internet facility in lobby quite expensive (about $1 per min+ $1 per printed sheet). Most staff members were polite and professional, but not over-friendly.

We stayed in New York for a long weekend June 9-12 at the Hilton New York. Hotel Selection: I am an Honors Gold member so we wanted to use points for our stay. We did not want to stay in Times Square (and once we got to NY, I was happy we didn't!). The Milennium Hilton, while it looked like a gorgeous hotel, was just too far out of the way from the things that we wanted to do. So, that left us with the Hilton NY. I had stayed in this area of NY before and enojoyed it so we gave the hotel a shot. This hotel is a nice place. Big lobby and a couple of bar areas. Taxis always waiting outside. This hotel seemed to be mainly used for business people/conventions and lacked any kind of unique or special feel. Also, due to the size of the hotel, elevator time was sometimes a problem. Upon arrival, we checked in at the Honors Desk and were upgraded to an \"Executive Room\" on the 35th Floor. Unless you really want the free continental breakfast, I think spending extra $$ on the Executive Room would be a rip-off! We entered the room and I could tell that it had not been updated. The room appeared dark and the bathroom was not very clean. I called the concierge and asked to be moved. She said someone would be right up to pick up our bags and move us to a remodeled room, but that we would still get the executive floor breakfast priveleges. After 20 minutes, no one came to get our bags so I went downstairs to get the new key for myself. We were moved to the 32nd floor into a remodeled room. It actually appeared to be a bit bigger and felt a lot lighter and cheerier. The modern TV area was much nicer. The bathrooms were pretty much the same in both rooms, but our 2nd room's bathroom did appear cleaner. Pros: Comfortable room and very comfortable bed and linens Nice desk workspace and sitting area Cool flat screen TV and wireless internet Neat MP3/Alarm clock deal Abundance of cabs outside Location is very good! Close to subway stops, Central Park and Times Square without being in the middle of a really loud area. Windows open so you can let the cool breeze in Cons: Remote and wireless access to the TV appeared to \"lag\" a bit. Bathroom could be more updated and modern to fit with the rest of the room Concierge service was rude and not helpful. There are some good books and maps to help you out at the concierge desk that you can take for free. In general, service was extremely slow. I found it easier to just do things for myself. Big hotel that lacks the charm of a smaller place Elevators sometimes slow Conclusion: A good comfortable and clean hotel, but definitely not a good value. It was fine for us since I used points, but the rate would have been about $500/nt (including tax). I think that is way too expensive, even by NY standards, for this hotel. I definitely think there are better values out there. Other Tips: The Top of the Rock which is located nearby at Rockefeller Center has one of the best views of the city. Although I have been to NY several times, I had never even heard of this. Got some great pictures from up there and I thought the view was better than from the Empire State Building and also NO LINE! Check out the Meatpacking District for some great places to eat and socialize. Seemed to be a pretty trendy, up and coming area. Ride the subway!

This was my first trip to NYC and one of the most memorable 3-day-3night getaways I've had. The hotel was top quality and a great value ($139 per night until Dec 26th when it went up to $339 per night - ouch!). We stayed the nights of Dec 23rd, 24th & 26th. We arrived at Kennedy airport and found that there was no shuttle to the hotel. We could have rode the train/subway but did not want to carry our luggage so we took a cab ($45). Check-in was a little slow as we had to wait in a 20-minute line (but it was Christmas in NYC). The lobby was large, nice and clean but not grand. We were given a great room on the 14th floor overlooking the Avenue of the Americas - spectacular view with all the Christmas decorations! The room was very large, had a beautifully clean marble bathroom (albeit a bit small); they heated the hotel and room perfectly (even for us and we live in Key West). The hotel was centrally located and we only used a cab once (due to tempurature and rain). There was a vender selling awesome food (a sort of a gyro) on the street next to the hotel - his food was sooo good that the line was typically 30 minutes or longer - but worth it! We had pre-purchased tickets (definitely the way to go as tickets can be hard to get at the door) to see a Broadway show and we asked for walking directions/maps from the conciege in the hotel lobby - very helpfull and pleasant. We used the tourist map given to us to the rest of our stay! We ate at the hotel's restaurant for breakfast once - nothing special and a little pricey for what you get. I used the gym twice during the stay - it cost extra but I couldn't run in Central Park in December (it was raining a lot) so I paid the daily rate (I believe it was $15 per day). The facilities were clean and adequate; the treadmills had a view of the Avenue of the Americas and TVs. The gym attendant dissappeared quite often but may have been cleaning equipment or helping guests. The elevators were very small and always crowded. We often had to wait two or three trips before we could get on together. We didn't mind becuase afterall, it was Christmas. Most guests were very happy and pleasant - we had no loud noises or distractions during our stay.

The service charge was only $3 instead of the usual 17-18% surcharge. For the first time in a long time, I actually tipped. 5. Concierge was available later than most (I was able to stop by around 10 pm). The negatives: 1. As mentioned in other reviews, the area is NOISY! Lots of construction going on, even in the middle of the night (jackhammers at 2 am, taxis honking). There was even maintenance going on in the hotel at nights. After awhile I tuned it out, but light sleepers will have a rough time. 2. Can be crowded during busy times (i.e., Friday night, multiple conferences at the same time). The express elevator ride can be really slow when stopping at every floor. 3. Room temp was hard to control. I was feeling under the weather one night and tried to turn the heater on, but it just blew lukewarm air. 4. I was charged $150 for a wireless bridge, although they did refund it. 5. Flat screen tv remote was laggy, with a second delay between pushing the button and the channel or volume changing. Turning off the tv using the remote turned it back on again (finally figured out I had to hold the power button longer). 6. Restaurant food is mediocre.

Having read the reviews on this site I wanted to book the Hilton Times Square. However due to an admin error I ended up booking the Hilton New York by mistake. The internet site I used didnt let me cancel however I neednt have worried... it was a great stay in a nice hotel. OK it wasnt the best hotel I have ever stayed in but it did everything we asked of it. First the good - the location - The best thing about this hotel - 5 mins walk from Central park in one direction and 5 mins from the theatre district / times square. The rooms - big and bright. Bathroom good, air con no probs, no street noise on the 39th floor. It wasnt a renovated room - we had one of those on the 32nd floor but due to a family staying next door we moved the next day (incidentally the front desk staff were perfectly amenable) to a room that had not been renovated on the 39th floor facing central park. OK so we didnt have a flat screen TV now but what the heck - we didnt go to NYC for the TV - we didnt even open the TV cabinet. Room service - friendly, very quick, not cheap but they brought it in on a big table and laid everything out spending a few minutes making sure everything was perfect. Maids - cleanliness up to standard, as soon as we took the do not disturb off the door they must have been in like a shot to start cleaning. The beds - very very comfortable - we had a king. The sheets are great and the pillows just the right support. Slept like a log. Zip out checkout using the phone - we didnt need to check out just press a button on the phone and hand the key cards in at the desk. There were periods when the reception was busy and others when it was dead so it was nice to just press a button in the room and go. Now the bad - OK there were a couple of times we saw trays and leftover food in the coridoor - we generally went out in the morning and then returned later and the trays were gone. Left luggage - bit steep - we checked out and left our bage while we went out for the rest of the day and it cost 14 US. We had coats and a couple of little bags and at least they didnt charge for those). Would have liked a room to get changed into when we got back etc but there wasnt one - except the rest rooms - problem was the floor was wet with an overflowing toilet ! We didnt eat in the restaurants so cant comment there. Try \"Red Flame\" 67 W44th Street for breakfast - dont bother with Lindy's near the hotel - its overpriced. Also \"The Red Cat\" in Chelsea for nice evening meal and go down to the Village and try a pizza at Johns and Jazz bars. You have got to walk over the Brooklyn bridge see the views of manhattan and try the brooklyn ice cream place under the bridge near water street. Its near to Lombardi's - famous excellent pizza place - prob best in NY. If you are looking for clothes shopping as well - go to the newish Abercrombie and Fitch across from Trump tower near to central park on 7th avenue - 5 mins from hotel. The tickets booth in the hotel was helpful getting us phantom tickets on the same day - great seats (paid twice the value of the tickets though).

Contacted hotel direct to request, and check, that we had interconnecting rooms as with a very late arrival and two small children problems at check-in to be avoided.

I was never informed of this penalty when I booked my trip and wanted to have a flex day at the end. It seems like they must receive a lot of complaints about this because when you go to do the automated phone check out, the testy voice on the recording reminds you sternly once again that you will be penalized if you check out early.

There were little hints here and there in the room that the hotel has been around a long time, but most of the furnishings were probably only about four years old. We had a one-bedroom suite which had two double beds and a TV in the bedroom, a very small bathroom off the bedroom, a living room with a couch (with pull-out bed) in the living room, as well as one chair in the living room plus a second chair at a desk, and a kitchenette with a sink and a micro fridge plus a minibar. The room was not what was advertised on the Hilton web site. The Hilton web site has a picture of a very large living room with a six-seat dining table off to the side. Our living room, while nice, was small and did not include a dining table. It was just not as grand as advertised. This was disappointing given the rate we paid. But, it was still acceptable and mostly clean. While the living room was smaller than I expected, the bedroom was a good size, maybe slightly larger than average for New York City. There was no electrical outlet in the bathroom. This meant you had to take the portable hair dryer included in the bathroom out to another room to make it work. While the suite was mostly clean, there were a number of light stains in the carpet. As it was a suite, it was automatically on one of the executive floors (43rd floor). The executive lounge, where we checked in, and ate a continental breakfast a couple of times, was on the 44th floor and was large, open and well lit, and had lots of tables and (continental) breakfast food and juices. The elevators were not a problem and were fairly fast as they had rows of elevators for different groups of floors. We parked our car using valet parking at the parking garage on 53rd street. If you come east down the one-way 54th street, you will have to bypass the hotel which is on the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and go to Fifth Avenue, turn right onto Fifth Avenue and then immediately right again onto 53rd street, which is a one-way street headed west, then you will pass Avenue of the Americas while still on 53rd Street, then before you get to Seventh Avenue you will turn right into a parking garage that is part of the building that contains the Hilton. We ate breakfast once in the hotel restaurant \"New York Marketplace\", which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The breakfast was a little expensive, and though acceptable in taste, it was not great. There is a business office on the second floor of the hotel, but it is not run by the hotel. You can use a computer there with internet access for $15 for 10 minutes. There is a great grocery store called Ernest Klein & Co. International Supermarket between 54th and 55th streets (one street north of the Hilton), on the opposite side of the Avenue from the Hilton, at 1366 Avenue of the Americas. By \"great\" I don't mean the prices, I mean the selection. It is good to have a full grocery store nearby and not just a deli with limited selection. I would recommend the hotel for its location. You can walk to Central Park, to Times Square, and Fifth Avenue shopping. As for other tips about NYC, my favorite meal was at Virgil's Real BBQ on 44th Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. A fun stop was at the \"Ecomony Candy\" store on 108 Rivington Street in the East Village, which was piled high with almost every candy you can imagine, and where we walked to after eating a great breakfast at the Clinton St. Baking Company. We then walked from \"Economy Candy\" to visit the soon to be demolished CBGB rock n' roll club on Bleeker & Bowery. I would advise you to buy your Empire State Building tickets online before you go (you don't commit to a specific use date when you buy them online) as you can then avoid the ticket purchase line when you get to the building. A fun place to visit if you have kids is Deb's Family Disco in Manhattan. The Grey Line bus tour is top-notch and a must see for a visit to Manhattan. The Burger Joint makes the best burgers I have ever had. It is secretly located in Le Parker Meridien hotel on 57th Street and Avenue of the Americas. I say secret location as it is not advertised and has no obvious signage except for a little neon hamburger that you can see if you peer down a dark hallway, between the check-out desk and a lage curtain in the lobby of Le Parker Meridien hotel.

We had a queen room on the 10th floor near the elevator and although we could hear the elevators going up and down, it was not loud enough to keep us up at night. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any street noise. After reading other reviews, I was expecting the rooms to be tiny but they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We were very happy with the rate (booked through ----) and we got exactly what we expected. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay Ritz prices so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get Ritz rooms. The bed was very comfortable and the size was plenty big enough for our shopping, with room to spare. The bathroom was a bit outdated but who cares. The service was helpful; we called the concierge a couple of times for directions and we were always able to get a cab outside with almost no wait. I like that security screens everyone coming into the hotel at night. The location is a short walk to Times Square, Broadway, the Empire State Building, MOMA and shopping on Madison and 5th Avenues. One complaint is that the only restaurants in the area are all tourist traps; overpriced and nothing special, although we did eat at Norma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (expensive) and the Burger Joint (cheap), both at the Parker Meridian Hotel, and they were both great. We also ate at Bobby Flay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar Americain and it was not great. Also, because we tended to hang out in SoHo, Nolita and the Meatpacking District for dining and shopping, we will stay in a hotel in one of those areas next time (although if the rates aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as good, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely go back to the Hilton); we took $12 cab rides there and back each day. I took a shuttle from La Guardia when I arrived and paid $15 in advance for Supper Shuttle service (my husband was already in New York); the service was fine but I would only recommend it for solo travelers. Cabs are faster and cost around $35 to midtown plus tolls, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not saving that much money with a shuttle service.

The negatives: - The rooms are very bland and somewhat dated. The flat screen tv helps, but it doesn't make up for late 80s decor. - The whole place just had a dreary feel to it for me.

This hotel is big and impersonal, and seems to exemplify the \"NY minute\" ideology with it's rushed and boisterous atmosphere. Because it is a popular convention and tour group hotel, it is always crowded with rude folks who will ignore queues and push and shove their way ahead of lines, especially with regard to the elevators.

Our room in the Hilton was on the 22nd floor. Some other floors appeared to have been renovated, but several did not appear to be; those older floors looked quite depressing. Book a renovated room and you're much more likely to have a good stay here! The Service: if you've read the reviews here, you'll know not to expect too much in the way of service. The front desk staff was efficient but fairly disinterested at check in. The concierge seemed annoyed that they had to give out directions to the subway to yet another customer. On the last day of our stay, the room was not made up at all. Sometime between 6pm and 9pm, someone dropped a new set of towels on the unmade beds but did not clean up at all; we called the front desk but they said housekeeping was behind (no kidding) and they would get to our room as soon as they caught up. Needless to say, they never did! Finally, the Hilton airport shuttle service charged us twice for our ticket to the airport so now we have to get that cleared up with the credit card company. Oh well. We liked our room anyway. NY Marketplace Restaurant: Breakfast buffet (included in our rate) was extensive and most things tasted good. Dinner was horrible (calamari, pizza, burger) and extremely overpriced; don't waste your money there, especially with so many restaurants nearby. Overall: if we can get a renovated room at a decent rate, we will stay at the Hilton again.

A couple of issues kept this hotel from being better than just average. First, the Hilton employee at the check-in desk never cracked a smile and made little eye contact (and check-in wasn't even busy). Second, our room wasn't ready when we checked-in at 2:00p, no big deal, it's happened before at other hotels but when I called the hotel at 3:00p to check to see if the room was ready I was placed on hold and after being handed-off to 2 other employees, was finally answered by someone that sounded as if they were not having a good day. I found the overall attitude of the employees not very friendly. Third, I requested a non-smoking room and was told that's what I was getting at check-in, but as soon as I entered the room I noticed a very distinct smell of cigarette smoke and the bathroom, even for NYC standards, was tiny. Lastly, at check-out, I called the bellman to get my bags for storage because my plane didn't leave until 4pm - well he came and got them in a very short time but neglected to inform me there was a $3.50 per bag storage fee! I found this out when I went to collect my bags. I refused to pay but had to go speak to the manager before they would give me my bags! This is the first time in all my trips to NYC that I've ever had a hotel charge me for storing my bags for a few hours.

I've stayed on lower floors at other New York hotels and have never heard a peep. And then there was the heat. I've never called downstairs to complain before, but after fiddling with the thermostat and couldn't get the temperature to something below 80 (it was in the 20's outside), I called to find out how to lower the temperature. I was told to turn the heat off. The shower had a problem, because when I got out the bathroom floor was covered with water. And yes, I did have the curtain on the inside. I ate in the New York Marketplace restaurant. The service was very good, although for a restaurant in a four-star hotel I don't expect paper napkins.

Since I'm not a big fan of the treadmill, it was nice that Central Park was only five blocks away. Rockefeller Center was only three.

We had such a great time in NYC and experience at the Hilton, we decided come back with our children for Spring Break. Unfortuately our second experience at the Hilton was not as good as the first. We arrived just before 3:00 PM on Thursday afternoon and the line to check-in was huge. The NY State Teachers convention was being hosted at the hotel and everyone was checking in at that time. After looking at the line (we were told by those waiting that the line was 1-2 hours long), we tried to self-check in based on the advice of hotel employees. However, the self-serve kiosk would not recognize our confirmation number. A roaming employee was checking guests using a hand-held computer and he tried to get us checked in - then our room was not ready. Hilton allowed us to stow our bags for free so we took off for some sightseeing. When we returned to the hotel about 3 hours later - we were informed that they were \"out\" of non-smoking rooms. One of my children and my wife have asthma and are allergic to cigarette smoke, so we complained that the room reservation was unacceptable. We waited another 30 minutes or so, before they were able to put us in a \"non-smoking\" room. Once we got into our room, we felt like we had been duped. The room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. We immediately contacted customer service who informed us that our room was a \"non-smoking\" room on a \"non-smoking\" floor and they would be happy to freshen up the room for us. Of course, freshen up meant opening the windows and spraying air freshener. We requested another room, but they did not have one available until Friday. Plus an ionizer/air purifier was not available. We were less than thrilled with their response to this matter as we felt as we were being treated as if we were inconveniencing them. Plus the room did not feel all that clean. The color scheme was dark. The room overlooked the roof to the main entrance. The floor was wet by the bathroom entrance and the mini bar was open. Not only did we have to sleep in the \"smoking den\", but the room next door featured a \"late-night\" drunken teachers party. They knocked on our wall repeatedly until about 2:00 AM. We contacted customer service to have them quiet down (about 12:30 AM) but we noticed no discernible difference in the volume level. Once the main party died down, the festivities carried on a bit longer as a \"party for two.\" Even though the woman was a screamer, we were fortunate her partner only had enough stamina to go about 4:28 seconds. Nevertheless, my 6 year old woke up thinking \"that the people in the next room are trying to break down the wall.\" The next morning, Hilton said we could move to our new room anytime after 12:00 PM. This was correct and we were moved to the exact room promised when we got back to the hotel around 5:30 PM. The front desk staff explained that in the week before our stay, the two floors that they have reserved for smokers were closed for repairs/remodeling, thus some of the non-smoking rooms were used for smokers. Our new room was much better. The colors were brighter. The room was much cleaner and there was a much better view. It did not smell like smoke. The rest of our stay was uneventful, although they shorted us a towel on Saturday morning. Check out on Sunday was a problem though. First, we were charged $13.00 in mini-bar charges for our first room - but as we explained to them when we moved the mini-bar was wide open when we first checked in. Second, with the concierge, we arranged for a car to take us to the airport. It was to arrive at 11:30 AM. We ended up leaving the hotel for a little while that morning - there was a parade. When it looked like that we might be slightly later than 11:30 AM we asked the concierge to hold our car for about 10 minutes. We got back to the hotel about 11:30 AM. My wife went immediately to the front desk to check out and clear up the mini-bar charges, while I went up to the room to gather our bags. I called the bell captain for a bellman to come assist me. 20 minutes later I had to call down again! 35 minutes after my first call, a bellman arrived to help with my bags! When we finally got downstairs, our car was gone! We had to arrange other transportation to the airport and almost missed our flight. The bellman claimed that he was sent up after my 2nd call Only the bellman apologized. We complained to the bell captain and the concierge - but neither seemed concerned.

I visited one weekend last September on business. Like most pricey hotels, the lobby was more lavish than the rooms by far. My co-worker and I were placed in a handicapped room due to overbooking. The bathroom was aggravating for that reason. Instead of a counter sink, which would have been helpful for grooming activities, the sink just protruded from the wall, and was very low. The shower did not have a stationery showerhead, just a sprayer. Imagine trying to scrub and shampoo yourself with one hand while trying to spray with the other. All of this would be understandable and helpful had we been handicapped. Since we are not, it was simply a nuisance. The shower drainage was awful. It was hard to feel like I was getting clean when I was wading in gray, dirty water that left a residue. I reported the problem and never saw evidence of any improvement. I did use the spa services the afternooon before my company's dinner, which was held at the Hilton. Both the spa staff and the event staff for the dinner were great. We pulled off a 1400 person dinner without a hitch. At the end of the night, I was harassed by a male guest on the way to my room. In such a large and famous hotel used by high profile guests and businesses, you would think there would be security or at least cameras somewhere, but I was on my own to deal with the incident. Luckily it didn't end too badly, and the security staff fell all over themselves the next day to apologize and shower me with gifts and even offered a free night and an escort to the train station, but it was all too little, too late.", "Date": "March 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "aiterry", "ReviewID": "UR3306661", "Content": "I stayed here for a conference my company was having.

We arrived fairly late in the evening and the hotel lobby was like an airport departures hall: it was mayhem. As soon as we stepped out of our cab from the airport it was besieged by other guests desperate for a taxi (we assumed this was due the snow shower which everyone was over reacting to, as it wasn't a major storm). Check-in was efficient and quick, although the staff were like robots. with little in the way of personality. This didn't bother me, as I've visited New York before and I expected it. The bedroom was on the 25th floor. It was clean and a reasonable size, although it smelt of smoke even though it was a non-smoking floor. It was far too warm (another over reaction to the weather?) and the ventilation system didn't make any difference, which made it difficult to sleep at night. There was no in-room safe which meant we had to waste time putting stuff in a safe deposit box at reception which was a bit of a pain. The bathroom was tiny and pretty basic. The bathroom light switch was filthy and looked like it had been covered in chewing gum which hadn't been removed properly. We checked out pretty early on a Sunday morning and expected the hotel to be quiet, but we were wrong. It was mayhem again. We were overcharged by 700% on the minibar and when I explained this to the receptionist at check-out she (deliberately?) misunderstood me and added the disputed amount to my final bill. When I finally managed to make myself understood there was no apology or even a light hearted comment, just an insolent, cold and pitiful 'attitude'. Emptying the safe deposit box when we left the hotel was a horrible experience due to the fact that the receptionist said she was too busy to help and the staff at the end of the 'house phone' she directed me to couldn't understand my non-American accent. Surely in a hotel of this size in a city like New York you think they could employ people who understand British English. I dread to think what they're like with Europeans or Asians! We asked for our luggage to be kept for a few hours until we were ready to go to the airport. In every single other hotel I have ever stayed at (including the Hilton in downtown NY) this is free of charge, but here it costs $3.50 per item.

The rate we paid was actually less than what we would have paid at the the hotel we checked out of, and we got so much more! After hightailing it out of the Carnegie, we arrived at the Hilton very early (9am). Although our room was not ready, we were invited to partake in the lovely continental breakfast served in the Executive lounge. The lounge was very large and comfortable with tables, chairs and sofas throughout. Two televisions were on so travellers can get caught up on news. We had a wonderful view of the Empire State Building as we ate. They offered a nice assortment of breakfast breads, cakes, muffins, pastries, bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, juice and several hot beverages (including different types of tea, coffee and hot chocolate). Bottled water was available upon request. From 5 - 7 pm the lounge serves hors d'oeuvres and offers a cash bar for beer and liquor. Soft drinks are complimentary. The items offered were fresh and abundant. There were cheese and crackers, raw veggies with dip and assorted fried finger food such as wings, jalepeno poppers and mini egg rolls. The one mystery was the mock shrimp. It looked like fried shrimp but in fact was some sort of unidentified meat and some sort of mayonaise based gunk shaped to resemble shrimp. The room was a good size by NYC standards with a king bed , mini bar, desk and armchair, and there was still enough room for a roll away bed for our son. They offer a good selection of TV stations including Nickelodeon for the kids. There is also in room Nintendo for a very reasonable price of $6.95 per hour with a very impressive selection of N64 games. Ethernet and wireless internet access are available for $9.95 per 24 hour cycle. The front desk staff were courteous and helpful. The first room we checked into was too small for 3 people, but a brief visit to the desk was all it took to get a larger room. The Marketplace restaurant is great for casual dining.

There is always a doorman to hail a taxi and occasionally, but not always, a security person checking keys before allowing entry. The hotel is also very centrally located. Our personal aim was to wander about and see Broadway shows. We were within walking distance to Central Park which we walked to quickly and then strolled through slowly. We wandered the East side and visited the Met on one day and wandered the West side to Strawberry Fields and the reservoir the next and walked to different Broadway shows at night.

We purchased a 2-day Hop On/Hop Off bus ticket, which allowed us to get off at any number of stops and then get back on when we had spent enough time in that particular area. I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing this for first time visitors. The tour guides give you a lot of inside information and it is a great way to see all of the city if you have a limited amount of time. The tickets were actually pretty inexpensive, around $45 per person. That price also included a night tour which took us over to Brooklyn for a view of the Manhattan skyline from the other side of the river. In addition to the Hop On/Hop Off tour, we purchased a Sopranos tour. This also was well worth it. If you are a Sopranos fan, this is for you. It takes you to various locations where the show has been filmed in New Jersey, including the Bada Bing.

It was booked through United Vacations so I've no idea what particular room rate I paid as the total cost for the holiday incorporated all flights and another hotel in Hawaii also. Arrived early evening on the Monday night and checked in without any delay or problem whatsoever. We had requested a double non-smoking room and got exactly what we'd asked for on the 30th floor. Our room was certainly more than big enough for us. We may have gotten an upgrade for all I know given that it was a honeymoon but if that was the case then no-one actually informed us of it. It was a very big bed as far as I'm concerned also. I think it was a King size but as I'm not overly familiar with what's a King size and what's a Queen size I might be wrong. Location was perfect, easy walking distance for Central Park, Broadway and much of Manhattan. Tour buses passing the door also. Our first visit to New York so we wanted to do the obvious things like visit the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Empire State, World Trade Center site, Central Park, Macy's, etc, etc. Apart from one day when there was a big conference going on we never found the lobby especially busy as some reviews on here have suggested. The staff were never a problem at all and always very helpful, including the lady at the concierge desk who helped us book our return transfer to the airport. The hotel also has an activities desk within it which can book you tours and theatre tickets, etc. That may be an independant concern though. We used that to book tickets to Mamma Mia and a couple of tours and found the staff to be extremely helpful and informative. Our room was clean though there were a few small strange orange stains on the carpet but that's getting really picky I guess. We had a problem with the toilet not flushing properly right from when we arrived but one call to customer services and someone was up to fix it within 10 minutes. I'd agree with the person who recommended Astro's for breakfast. We went there a couple of times. Cheap and chearful. If you want something a little fancier then there's an Irish bar down the street from the Bridges Bar which does fine breakfasts for not all that much more cash. Can't recall its name though. For dinner there's a brilliant Italian restaurant just beyond Astros called 'Pazza Notte'. We also ate in Bensons which does phenomenal steaks but it's very expensive. First night treat but $150 for two one course meals with a couple of drinks was way above my expectations. Fortunately they're not all that expensive. Ate in the Hilton Marketplace one night and found it to be okay but nowhere near as good as the 'Pazza Notte' for instance. They put an invoice under your door overnight on your last night so if it's fine in the morning you can auto-check-out using either the phone or the tv which saves any potential queueing. We used the phone method and I presume it worked out properly though as I haven't had the final bill yet I can't confirm that. As it happens though, when we went downstairs to leave the reception area was quiet. The hotel bar is spacious and pleasant though certainly not the cheapest place to drink at $6 for a beer! The elevators were reliable and pretty quick.

In fact we liked the busy lobby, it is so New York City.", "Date": "March 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cUnless Paris is here, skip the Hilton\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1710829", "Content": "As others have said, the lobby is beautiful. However, the devil is in the details, and the details fall short at this place. The clock was off by an hour in time set, the hair dryer was missing in action (and it took over 30 minutes to get a replacement). The TV sound sounded like a blown speaker, room was listed as a queen bed, but was a double. Old style wall heat & AC unit. Ultra small room. The grafitti in the closet said \"hilton sucks\", and while I wouldn't condone vandalism, I understand the frustration. Using Hotwire or others, you should be able to get the Westin or Millenium for about the same which are much nicer, or get it for $100 or less on Priceline.
