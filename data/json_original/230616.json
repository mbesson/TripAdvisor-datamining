We arrived at 11 am, so we were prepared to wait an hour to get into our room. Very friendly concierge told us, that our room was already cleaned, so we were able to leave our luggage there and start to enjoy our trip. The rest of the hotel staff were just as nice, and every time we asked for something they were really eager to help us with our problem. We had a room with a canal view, though the hotel is now under restoration, so the view wasn't as excellent as we had expected. The location of the hotel is perfect, it's just between the Museumplein and the centre of Amsterdam. Also there's a tramstop almost in front of the hotel with two or three different tram lines. The only problem with the trams is that they are quite loud, and you can hear the traffic to some rooms, so if you're not a heavy sleeper, it's a good idea to bring earplugs. The room was big and clean, as was the bathroom. The bed was excellent, and they even had a pillow menu, where you can choose your like from 5 different pillow types. The breakfast fullfiled all our dreams. There was a cook who made fresh omelets and pancakes, fresh bread and many kinds of cheeses. Also there was a free self service drink bar in the lobby, and during the evening little snacks, like cheeses and candy and waffles.

I was disappointed. Not with the service or concept but the size of the bedroom which was very bijou and made me feel that I was retiring for the night in a dolls house rather than a grown up persons hotel room. I checked in late to find the front door closed and a sign that suggested I ring the bell. I was soon spotted by a male member of the hotels staff who buzzed me in and welcomed me by name, guessing that I was who he thought I was. A nice touch. He then explained that the hotel was a full service concept where guests were encouraged to treat the hotel like a home away from home as he showed me the lounge area with bar, all of which he assured me were 'included' in the price. I was tired. I realised that my iphone charger plug wouldn't work in Amsterdam so asked him for an adaptor. I was offered a large assortment of 'free' adaptors, none of which would work adapting an English 3 prong plug or, I could purchase, rather than borrow, an adaptor for 9.50 euros. A bit cheeky I thought and proceeded to my room on the first floor. My first impressions were that the Art Deco inspired room was very clean, but VERY cramped and I felt boxed in. Although small, the room was well appointed in fairness, good quality fixtures, excellent bed, pillows and cotton bed linen and a Nespresso machine which is a nice touch. I retired for the evening too tired to ask for a room move. Shower water pressure was not great either which was a pity because the shower itself is impressive to look at, I have the same shower head at home as it happens. The breakfast offering was good with the added bonus of ordering something cooked to order which I did. The Omelette didn't look pretty but tasted OK. All in all the experience was let down by what I consider the unacceptably small bedroom and the added value freebies, which I didn't use were not compensation enough, at least for me.

There were 3 different types of pillows, very comfortable and soft (including memory foam). The room was very clean, beautiful view and perfect quiet acoustic.

After notifying the hotel that this was infact our honeymoon break it would have been a nice touch if we were not infact charged an additional cost for the bath at 32 Euros for our two night stay.

We had a cosy room with a TV, DVD player, Nespresso machine, free mini bar and 3 decanters containing Whiskey, Gin & Cognac.

Next morning we went down for breakfast and helped ourselves to juice and continental breakfast items before discovering the chef who made omelettes, fried eggs, French toast and Dutch pancakes on request.

Our first room was dark and had mold in the shower....we were moved to a room with larger Windows and a bit larger on size. It was very clean. The rooms with huge bathrooms had much smaller bedrooms and in my opinion were less desirable. If you can get a hood rate I would stay here as it is quiet and close to things.

The bucket has no liner or a plastic bag that prevents any kind of infection, etc. The bucket in our room had some clear liquid in the bottom when we arrived! Yuck! We assumed it was melted ice.... but who knows. I called the front desk and informed them of this and they apologized and said they would send a replacement. One never came. This spoke poorly of the guest service staff. The second thing is that the stairwell was literally quite dusty and needed a very thorough cleaning. I did not use the stairs but used the elevator but my husband did on several occasions and was agast at the dirt. And third, we asked for a recommendation for a nearby restaurant. We indicated that we wanted something close by, maybe Italian. I use a cane and didn't want to walk very far and said that closeness was more important than gourmet standing of a restaurant at that time. We were directed to go along the canal for some distance in the opposite direction of an Italian restaurant that was just moments away on the same street. Thankfully I had done some research on Trip Advisor and knew we could find something closer... So even thoogh the room was small we did enjoy the canal view.

The offer cookies, crackers, cheese, fruit, chips etc. All are free and there 24/7 for when ever you wish it. Every evening they have wonderful warm appetizers that are delightful after a day out. I personally loved the lobby and felt so at home there. We would go out all day and come home around 3 or 4. My husband would go up to the room to nap and I would go to the lobby with a good book, get a cappuccino and a munchies or two, sit by the fire and read for hours. While we were there they had a rock band staying for a few days who were playing in the area. They had security with them and fans who wanted to see them, but since you can not get into the hotel unless you are a guest, it was peaceful and quite yet exciting to be around all that. The bottom line is this place is amazing. Can not say enough great things. I am a person who likes the finer things in life and I don't mind paying for them as long as they are what they say they are.This place will make you feel like you are a rock star....!", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201ctotally recommends this hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "proudberkeleymom", "ReviewID": "UR117192434", "Content": "my husband and i stayed here for 4 nights and we thought this hotel was awesome. the room is on the small side but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom big. location is perfect - we walked everywhere - museums, shopping.. the staff members were great - breakfast is also included as well as drinks in the hotel room and downstairs at the lobby are.. soda, water, alcohol.. will definitely stay at this hotel again. we totally recommend this hotel.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel\u201d", "Author": "mikedespo", "ReviewID": "UR117158301", "Content": "All the reviews I read about the Banks Mansion were positive and I understand why. The hotel was fantastic. The \"concept\" is unique in that they offer an open bar (which is well stocked with licquor, sodas, waters, etc.) that's in the lobby and that guests can access themselves without any charge. It's part of the hotel/room price. And it's available 24/7. Newspapers in both English and Dutch available for guests in the main lobby along with two computers which were for guests to access without any charge. Free wireless internet as well is available through out the hotel and rooms. Chairs and sofas with a fire place all in the main lobby. The rooms themselves are comfortable, clean, with flat screen TVs, and large bathrooms. Bed is comfortable. There was free bottles of cognac, whiskey,a dn other alcohol in your room that costs nothing extra. A mini bar is also fully stocked in your room and free of charge (part of your room rate). Comfortable robes and slippers. One minor problem. When we checked in, we paid in advance for a room with a view of the canal. We were given a nice room but no canal view (which cost extra). I mentioned this to the front desk, they saw my copy of the reservation, and they looked in their system. They saw the error and admitted it was there fault but no canal room was available. They offered a discount on the room which is what they should have done. They advised if I wanted ... to call the next morning and they would switch us to a canal room for the remainder of the stay. I took them up on that and called the next day. The hotel offered to give us a canal view in an upgraded room with extra perks in order to not have to offer a discount for the first night foul up. That was reasonable and I took them up on that offer. All in all ... mistakes happen and the hotel acknowledged it and did everything they should to rectify it without any attitude. Breakfast is served in the morning and offers a wide variety of food....again a plus. No fitness center or real restaurant in hotel, but the hotel was just such a great place that these negatives don't even rank against the hotel. One block walk to the flower market and two block walk to canal boat tours. Easy walk to train station, but don't walk it with luggage people ... pay for a cab. It's not that close to the train station and don't struggle on the cobblestone streets with the madness of bicycles and tons of people on the street. The hotel is in a great location, close to everything, but also in a good location in that the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam eases up at night near it so its not loud.

We stayed for 3 nights at the Banks Mansion. It is a lovely hotel - very well located, helpful staff, great \"living room\" lobby. We particularly enjoyed the open bar and late afternoon snacks in the lobby. The weather while we were in Amsterdam was not particularly nice (chilly, overcast and often rainy), so we didn't hang around outside or just randomly stroll as much as we would have liked. As such, we spent more time in the hotel than we did in Paris, for example. The lobby area with the beverages and food was great for this. My husband loved sitting near the fire place, sipping wine and reading. The breakfast buffet was nice - I've been in hotels that had more and less in the breakfast buffet category. This was in the middle and was certainly adequate. The computers in the lobby were very helpful in terms of checking e-mails, etc. The only comment that I would make is that the room is rather small or more specifically lacking storage. We had a superior, canel view room. It wa very nice and comfortable and quiet. The only criticism I have about the room is related to storage space. The wardrobe is not that large and there are no drawers in other pieces of furniture. My husband and I left half of our stuff in the suitcase because we weren't going to use it due to the weather - if we had needed to unpack everything we would not have had anywhere to put it however.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just read a number of the good reviews here on TripAdvisor and agree with much of it. That said, I read most of the below average reviews and agree with almost all of them. First, not trying to be mean but this is not by any stretch of the imagination a four star hotel. The size of the rooms alone make it three star tops. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be overly swayed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drinks and minibar. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re included in the room price and the room price is slightly high for what they offer. The positive: A very good location. Decent restaurants nearby. Walking distance to almost everything, minibar items, wine and liquor is included in the room cost, most of the staff is very very nice and helpful, OK beds and bedding, news available on the TV in several languages, free computer use if needed, complimentary map of Amsterdam, light blocking curtains and sound-reducing windows. A reasonable offering of breakfast items. Plenty of hot water. Safe in the room. Comfy lobby with ample seating, magazines and newspapers. All in all, OK. The negative: Small rooms (even for Europe) and I really know what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talking about after nearly four decades of travel. The carpets and furniture show considerable wear. It has only one very slow elevator and filthy stairwells as an alternative - an issue at a totally full hotel. A tiny wardrobe closet with three hangars provided. Two shelves to unpack clothes. Barely room for a couple to store two suitcases and still move in the room. \"Room Service\" is practically non-existent. They serve three things. The lighting in the rooms is poor unless it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daylight and the curtains are open. OK, so you get free wine and liquor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we don't drink hard liquor and who wants to drink from open heaven knows-what-bottles of liquor in your room? The wine offered downstairs is free but very cheap quality. Our room was never properly cleaned. Not vacuumed once that we could see. My husband had to ask that it be dusted on the fifth day. I wrote my name in the dust on the desk! Likewise the bathroom sink was cleaned but never the floor. I left something on the bathroom floor to monitor if it would be cleaned up and as each day passed, dirtier and dirtier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the halls as well. I'm sorry to be critical but this is true. The VERY negative: Be careful! Their booking policy as was experienced by a friend there at the same time who came from another city to meet us. She booked four nights at their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best buy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd price (a 20 euro per night reduction for paying in advance) but had to change her plans before coming. No changes they said. Once there, it was obvious that they could rent the room for the two nights she wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be there. We all spoke with ***, one of the managers who was hostile and rude. It seemed to be a simple request: charge for the two nights she would be there with the 20 euro discount per night re-added to the room charges and then rent the other nights to someone else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hotel loses nothing. Still, the very nasty \"duty manager\" said no. She charged my friend for all four nights and rented the room again to others the last two nights. Double profit for Banks Mansion. I was surprised by their outright greed and unwillingness to be accommodating when they would suffer no loss at all. There is just no need for this.

We booked a canal view room again and we were allocated at corner view on 3rd floor, this room was larger than the room allocated on our last visit, it was clean bright and well maintained. We arrived at 9am on 29th April and were immediately given access to our room by the friendly and efficient reception staff, we were then allowed to have breakfast as it finishes at 1030 (11am on Sunday). You are given an excellent cooked breakfast which is another reason we returned here. The minibar was reasonably stocked and replenished daily, as were the drinks decanters. The lounge at reception is like a living room it has a well stocked beer fridge although only Beck's, which was ok and a disgusting concoction called Hoegaarden Blond on offer, honestly it's like drinking partially diluted scouring powder, actually thats doing Ajax or Vim a disservice this stuff is that vile. An abundance of various wines, spirits and soft drinks is also available so no complaints from me apart from that rotten beer. Nibbles and cheese boards are occasionally offered as well. Another bonus is the 2 desktop PC's in the lounge giving free internet and printer services. Queens Day was brilliant yet again, its one giant carnival with everyone dressed in orange. The streets and canl sides were packed by 2pm as 800,000 visitors walked into the centre. Its a long day but the weather was good and it's great watching the various boats on the canals, some bedecked in variety of colours and others simply for partying, it's nigh on impossible to get on a party boat though. We were better prepared this time and made sure we had orange tops etc this time, although the hotel did give you a T shirt as well. On 1st May we had our anniversary meal at the Saturnino Italian restaurant just around the corner from the hotel, its turn right as you leave the hotel, cross the road and turn immediately left at the travel agent/KLM office. The restaurant is about 300 yards along this street on the right. We can confirm that it's good reviews on Tripadvisor are well deserved. The hotel is mostly used by US, Canada and UK guests so English is widely spoken and everyone is very friendly, we met some very nice people.

We ended up here because a change in onward travel plans required us to stay in Amsterdam an extra day, and after much searching, were told this was the only hotel room available in the city that night. For $450, we were told we would have a \"deluxe\" room, quietly situated away from the street. Upon arriving at the noisy intersection where the hotel is located (on a busy cross street with a tram line and many motorists on one side, the canal on the other) we were glad at least we would have quiet. The staff were pleasant but made a great big deal about the hotel's complimentary bar... great, we thought, until we saw what was on offer: in the room sat a bedside tray of spirits that had been decanted into large bottles labeled only with little plastic signs \"whiskey\" \"gin\", etc, as though one whiskey is equal to any other! Clearly the \"free booze\" is an attraction to many, as the lobby was full of sloshy pickled-looking folks sitting in the cheap and chaotically decorated lounge, imbibing liberally in the no-name booze. The room itself was barely bigger than the bed and reeked of smoke that had been doused in vast quantities of perfumed room-spray. The one tiny window opened onto a blast of noise from the street behind the hotel. The bathroom was as big as the room, but what good is that? Every surface was gross: vinyl wallpaper, \"wood\" laminate on all the furnishings, loud patterned carpets... everything the epitome of the cheapest hotel decor. After having spent three lovely days in a bright, airy and tastefully decorated canal house for half the price, the strange alchoholic-zombie funeral home feeling of this place was too much to bear. I decided to go on to Antwerp rather than spend another minute there, and left my travel companion who had to catch a train out of Amsterdam the next day, requiring him to stay.

So, I read all the reviews and did a lot of research on hotels in Amsterdam, and couldn't be happier I decided to do my homework. In the end we didn't have to settle for something that would have made our stay any less enjoyable in this beautiful city. Here was my basic list: Good Size Clean Room Clean Bathroom Air Conditioning Smoker Friendly Located in the middle of everything Free Wi-Fi in the room Let me just say after doing countless research hours into hotels in Amsterdam that this was one of less than 5 that met all these needs. Trust me. The hard match for us was the Smoker Friendly part with nice amenities. For people interested in something away from a smoking environment this is for you as well, as the top floor is set aside for smokers, so it in no way appears smoking friendly or hinders others stay. Brilliant. Aside from that point, I couldn't say more about the staff and housekeeping. Both are very friendly, pleasant to stay with and accommodating in every way. For example, after one day of not being out of the room for the housekeeping's usual routine, the staff adjusted their schedule seamlessly without asking as to when would be the appropriate time to do their work. I thought this was a really great touch as I had to say nothing. This gave us the comfort of not worrying if we were in the housekeeping's way. As well the reloading of the mini-bar came with intelligence as we preferred some of the free beverages they had in the lobby as opposed to what was available. Once again, we didn't have to ask, they just made the adjustment. TOP NOTCH! Anytime we needed help as to the location of something or just general assistance the staff could not be more helpful and friendly. In particular Anna-Loush was fabulous(i apologize for the spelling) as she seemed to overlap the times we were in and out or answered the phone anytime I called. Here are some bonuses that I found overlooked in previous reviews: The ice from the ice machine---AWESOME. I think Americans could appreciate this as it is very similar to Sonic Ice! Yes. Sorry if this makes no sense. The bathroom is HUGE for a hotel, especially one in this small cramped city. Separate Rain Shower with plenty of pressure and Separate Dutch People height tub. For 6'+ er's! An absolutely beautiful bathroom with endless hot water. We tried, trust me. Adjustable Air Conditioning. We were there this month in May and the temp did change enough from cold to hot that this feature was highly appreciated. Also had an opening window to get fresh air when needed. ;) All the inclusive drinks! Whether in the room or downstairs you have free every kind of drink. Decent liquor, sodas, coffee, juice, etc. This stuff adds up in Dam. A 7oz coke at 1.50-2.50 Euro at an average restaurant vs. free all day. We just stocked up before we left each day or hopped in for some. Well you get the picture. Although we were strictly on a 420 tour with sites mixed in, the free-liquor could have really added up had we even wanted or could handle a sip. Looked tempting everyday. Big Plus for some of you! Free REAL FULL breakfast every morning or Delivered every morning for 5E. Enough said. Of course this has everything great others have mentioned: IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING- Museums, Coffee Shops, Dam Square, Shopping, Anne Frank, Bike Rental, Canal Trips. We literally walked to everything. Clean, well-maintained. Professionally staffed from head to toe. The all inclusive home-vibe. Free Wi-Fi. Saw a complaint about that on Trip Advisor as if they baited one into paying for internet. It's Included! Bottom Line, there is a reason this hotel is ranked in the top 8 in Amsterdam.

From the minute we entered the doors we felt like home. Arrived late friday evening and were greeted with a smile from the staff in the reception. Checkin went smooth where we were informed of the free minibar, breakfast in the Kitchen, bar in the Living etc etc. First night we stayed in a standard room that was surprisingly large (the rooms are individually sized so I guess we were lucky) and nice furnished. Very quiet (not facing the road/canals) so we slept like babies. :) Next two nights we stayed in the suite, that was brilliant. Very large room, with separate sitting area. Huge kingsize-bed, coffee-machine, jacuzzi etc. Good view over the streets/canal, but therefore also a little bit noisy (especially saturday night), but not worse that one could fall asleep. Breakfast was superb. Maybe not the biggest buffet Ive seen, but everything was fresh and the room had - as the whole hotel - a tranquil atmosphere. Far from some large hotel buffet-restaurants that sometimes have felt like a school-kitchen. And we should not forget the lobby..called the Living. An excellent spot and somewhat the heart of the hotel where you could relax with a drink and a magazine before going out. During the whole day you could serve yourself a nice cup of coffee, a soda, juice or a cold beer. In the afternoon there was wine (red/white/rose/sparkling) and some cheese/salamis to enjoy. All in all we couldnt ask for more. The only complaint I can come up with is that the floor in the bathroom was partially flooded when taking a shower with the nice rainshower..but that is really a very minor detail. Yes, the hotel is at the expensive side..but the friendly service, the ambience and the extras really makes it worth every penny! Would I stay here again? Absolutely! The sooner the better! :) Would I then choose to stay in the suite again? No, I dont think so.

My room was immaculate on arrival and was kept to a high standard of cleanliness by the housekeepers throughout my stay. It was very cosy and had plenty of storage areas for my belongings. When I booked my accommodation, I noticed that it had a shower instead of a bath. I prefer a bath to a shower so I was a bit unsure of my choice, but the shower turned out to be luxurious with plenty of space and a drench option which was perfect for relaxing under after a busy day of sightseeing. The furnishings in both my room and the communal areas were elegant with a stylish, rich colour scheme.

In addition, there was a complimentary self-service bar in the lounge with a wide range of alcoholic and soft drinks. The hotel is located in the picturesque Canal Loop and, as the city centre is so easy to get around on foot, it is ideally situated with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Because I was sightseeing for most of the time, I only ate three times in the hotel. My first meal was a delicious breakfast of cheese, cold meat, crusty bread, pain au chocolat, a croissant, Rice Krispies and orange juice delivered to my room on my first morning which set me up for the day! I also enjoyed two evening meals of tomato soup and vegetable lasagne via room service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both were very tasty!

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and can fully endorse the other good reviews that have gone before. There were a couple of minor niggles which I will come to and we also had a feature in our room that, strangely, is not mentioned anywhere on the hotel's web site and is also not mentioned in any of the last 45 reviews on here. I'll also come to that later. On arrival, we were greeted by some very friendly and pleasant reception staff who explained where everything was and how everything worked (for example, the free bar area, the internet computers and so on). We were then shown the way to the breakfast room. Breakfast is also included in the price. Our room was well furnished, if a little on the small side. The bed was one of the best I have slept in for a long, long time and the pillows on the bed were, without doubt, the best quality I have ever encountered in a hotel - and I've certainly stayed in quite a few!! You even had the option of requesting more, or different, pillows from something called the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpillow menu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122! I kid you not! The large flat screen TV is also equipped with a DVD player and the hotel has a range of DVDs you can borrow for no additional cost. On top of this, the TV has about 30+ channels, including BBC1 & 2, various film channels and, apparently, two 'adult' channels of the type you most certainly will not encounter in the UK - or so I am told! All free! The bathroom was small, but clean with a full size glass enclosed shower cubicle. Now, here's the unusual feature that has not been mentioned by any previous reviewer. Our shower cubicle doubled up as a personal steam room. It had a stone seat and an electronic button on the wall which turned on the steam. It worked really well - easily as good as you will find in a professional spa. That was something I have never encountered in a hotel room before and which was an interesting find. The niggles I mentioned above mainly relate to the bathroom. After using the shower, no matter how careful you were, a large amount of water seeped out under the shower door and across the bathroom floor where it lay for hours before drying up. We mentioned this to the front desk who promised to look at it but nothing at all was done about it. It really was a nuisance throughout our time there. On arrival, I discovered that my flimsy plastic glass on the sink was already broken in several places before I had even unwrapped it. I put it in the bin but it was never replaced. Likewise, the second plastic glass broke on day two and was thrown away. That, also, was never replaced. We used up the shampoo and shower gel on the first day. Neither was replaced on the second day, forcing us to use our own toiletries. Fortunately, they were replaced on the third day. The room minibar contained one solitary can of beer (and no other alcohol), which, when drunk on the first day was... you've guessed it, not replaced the next day! But this was not a big problem as there are half-full spirit decanters in the room and the hotel also didn't mind you taking drinks to your room from the bar downstairs - as long as it was not past midnight as we discovered on coming back in on our last night at about 12.05am. We got a seriously frosty glare from the man on reception who came round to see what we were doing. He didn't say a word but it was clear from the look on his face that he was not at all happy at us taking a couple of beers from his freshly-stocked fridge! Breakfast was good but nothing to write home about, despite the hyperbole on the hotel's web site! There is a chef who cooks eggs 'live' (according to the web site). That was much nicer than having to select them from a hot buffet. Was it value for money, bearing in mind the hotel is more expensive than most others in the same category? Overall, I think it was and I would certainly stay here again as we did like the hotel very much. Although it cost more than others, when you factored in the cost you would have had to pay elsewhere for two breakfasts each day and unlimited drinks (at typical hotel prices) you certainly break even. Finally, I see some reviews mention traffic noise. We had a second floor room overlooking the road outside. The double glazing was so good that we had no traffic noise whatsoever.

You can also eat or drink anything from your hotel room refrigerator at no cost as well. The location is only a 10-15 minute pleasant walk into Dam Square, the city center.

If you don't mind walking, it's very accessible to all the attractions.....we walked to Anne Franks, Rembrandt Square, central station, .....everywhere is walking distance with good walking shoes. Otherwise, you can take the local shuttles, taxis, trams everywhere. New Years Eve in Amsterdam is spectacular and crazy! We walked into Dam Square, had dinner there, which the hotel called in a reservation for us, walked around the red light district and stood among tens of thousands of people in Dam Square when the clock struck midnight!

The front desk staff were quite polite but did not know some very basic things about the city. For example I wanted to go to a pharmacy and it was about 5:30pm. I asked the person at the front desk and she said i could try one place around the corner but actually every pharmacy in the city was probably closed. I asked at a shop next door and they directed me to a place close by that was open until 11pm every night of the year. The front desk should know this or be able to find it out. Similarly I was jet-lagged and asked about where I could eat out late at night. Again I was told that there is nothing in the city open after 10pm. Simply not true. I had the feeling that the front desk staff didn't feel like it was their job to learn anything about the city except the most obvious stuff. I was told by more than one person at the front that I should just google something they didn't know about. When I come to a hotel at this price level I expect the staff to know more about the city or at least to go out of their way to find out more.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cCharming hotel - perfect location\u201d", "Author": "HCLiverpool", "ReviewID": "UR88371555", "Content": "Fabulous hotel.

The hotel has the best location for the people who want to visit various city attractions. Every attraction is within 15 mins of walking from the hotel and hotel is central to most of them. Van gogh museum is 15 mins towards one side and dam square is 10 mins walk to the other side. Hotel has a policy of offering complete package including mini bar and bar in living room within your room charge when most of the amsterdam hotels charge you around 40-50 Euros extra for breakfast for 2 people. This gives you a great relaxation that you can have as many drinks as you want (coffee, beer, congnac, gin & wines). Central location helps you in coming back to the hotel room while you go to an attraction from another and enjoy a drink and then start your excursion once again. There are lots of good restaurants next to the hotel. We ate at La Traviata (Italian Restaurant). The restaurant serves very good pizzas and pastas. Fast food chains like McD and Burger King are also next to the hotel. A falafel shop next to the hotel, named \"Maoz Falafel\" also offers inexpensive snacking option during the day. Banks Mansion also offers 50 mins free wifi internet access for every day and also has 2 PCs installed in the living where you can surf the internet while sipping on your favourite drink. The hotel staff is very friendly and help you with everything. Breakfast offers eggs in anyway you like (Omlette, scrambles, fried etc.) and also pancakes along with fruits, cereals and juices. The living room with a free bar makes your stay comfortable. I can never recall my stay in any other hotel where I spent so much time in the hotel lobby as I did here. You can bring a book, read newpaper, surf internet or just chat while sipping on your drinks before/after dinner. The bar is very well stacked and accompniments (water, coke, munchings) are replenished every now and then. Rooms are small but that does not matter here as anybody staying in banks mansion would not spend much time in their room apart from sleeping time. Overall, I would go to an extent to say that Banks Mansion is the best hotel to stay in Amsterdam bacause of its location and its all inclusive policy.

We asked for another room but couldn't be moved until the next day. Our new room was fresh and had a larger bed but no bath. At the side of the bed on a table were, a bottle of whisky, a bottle of cognac, and a bottle of gin, all half full but totally FREE. The mini bar had water, soft drinks and pringles, again all free and replenished each day. We were also given some complimentary chocolates as an apology for the first night. Each day at 5.30 p.m. down in reception a free cheese and spicy sausage selection was brought out for the guests to snack on with a good selection of cheeses. There was also a free selection of wines and beers, soft drinks, coffee, nuts etc. All hotels should do this - it's a fantastic idea!!! It was difficult to resist the temptation to just sit and gradually get drunk whilst enjoying the free food instead of going out to a restaurant after seeing the sights. The location is perfect for walking around as everything is within easy reach but if you want to you can catch the tram very close to the hotel. Breakfast was the buffet variety with a good selection of the usual - cereals, fruit, yogurts, cold meats and cheeses, and hot food - bacon and sausage with freshly cooked eggs,omelettes and french toast if you required it.

Thankfully the B&B owner was understanding and allowed us to depart earlier than planned. BM hotel had a few rooms available and showed us a few rooms to pick from. We decided to request the room facing the rear of the hotel to avoid the potential noise from the main road elevation. This meant sacraficing a view and large windows but well worth the quiet nights sleep. Note that the room we viewed on the top floor felt extremely hot and were very small though did have a view of the canals, for an extra 50 Euros, we would suggest avoiding those rooms. recpetion service was excellent. the girl held the room for us whilst we worked out the B&B issue and returned an hour later to our clean and comfortable room with free minibar. the room rate for a very very large room was 200Euro for the walk in price. perhaps more than a prebooked net price. the price included unlimited free soft and alcoholic drinks at the bar in the reception. refilling bottles during the day allowed us to save a little money on buying water and juice throughout the day. :) in the evening we had an appetiser prior to dinner again savig some money buying wine at the restaurant. :) Very very nice touch.

Firstly and foremost are the staff - during our stay Kiki and Nancy were the greatest of hosts. As soon as you walked in you were met with a genuine smile and a willingness to make you feel at home. In a business sense I have not experienced this in Europe or the UK before. You immediately feel like a friend and not a guest. The rooms are spotless and have all mod cons. Yes they are of a European size (smaller than what is on offer in Asia/Pacific/USA) but everything you need or what want is included and for most items with-in the accommodation rates. There are very few hotels where your mini bar (replenished daily) is included in the rate, as is wireless internet, and where evening drinks (huge choice) is included (free) and a fabulous breakfast is included. This is a special hotel in so many many ways. Having highlighted all the included offerings free (well this is really with-in the rate structure) at the end of the day for me it comes down to the staff and they are simply the best - I would reccommend Banks Mansion to anyone coming to Amsterdam, my only concern is that the property gets too popular and I can't get a room here next time I visit Amsterdam!!

The Dutch are great people, and always make you feel welcome & at ease. It's a great country to holiday in. Amsterdam is always busy, always moving. And it's rare to find a quiet and peaceful hotel anywhere. But to answer the usual questions about noise, this one seems to be really solid. Never heard a peek out of the other guests, the double windows block out most noise. And the curtains keep it dark enough when you want it. the air-conditioning works, and as it was quite warm when I visited, it was a welcome relief. The rooms are specially designed ( as is the hotel) in an Art Deco motif. And it gives it a stylish and uncluttered feel. It's not that expensive either. Amsterdam is an expensive city for good hotels. And you don't always get good either. I've visited the city for over 25 years now. And I think this hotel is a goodun. I had room 206, which is a corner room ,so was little roomier than some of the others. The rooms are comfortable & clean. The bathroom is stellar ( bath & power shower). Plenty of room to move about. It's got a nice coffee machine, which took a lot of the stress out of the 1st drink of the day routine. And surprisingly the free mini-bar and booze supply makes it more relaxing. The free bar & snacks thing downstairs with the internet and newspapers are a great idea. And it's nice to have a refuge from the streets. The more frugal amongst us will really like this, as it enables you to have a few evening drinks both before going out, and when you return all included in the price of the room. Lovely. Lol. I like to think I'm not a demanding customer. But I think we all expect politeness & helpfulness when staying in a hotel. This hotel has it in spades. They are lovely & professional, with that relaxed Dutch approach, which means you aren't speaking to a machine, but a human being. They are lovely people. The breakfast bar was uncrowded when I went. And stacked with a good choice of foods. It's also a largish room, so not the usual box room so many hotels use breakfast. Location is spot on also. Just go out of the entrance, and explore. Nigh everything you'd want to see in the city isn't far away. I never used the trams this time. Just walked and walked. If you like to do that, Amsterdam is the city for you. If you like using trams and taxi's, Amsterdam is the city for you. If you like bikes and boats. etc etc. I do recommend this hotel. And will use it again.

Breakfast is very good and if you want to stay in the room they will put together an incredible tray for you for only 5 Euro service fee. In the afternoon they put out some nice cheeses, pate, and meats. It is located right on a main canal and you can request a view room for about 30Euro extra. We slept with the windows open the first night and woke up with several mosquitos in the room. The rest of our stay we just left the air on if we wanted to cool down a little. Bathrooms were very nice with a deluxe shower. The only down side and it was minor was the wireless service. They give out 50 minute cards. You have to scratch off the code and use it to get online. They are not stingy with the cards but it is a bit of a chore and if you have multiple computers, phones or devices, it's not great.

It's good, mostly - a damn sight better than many hotels in Amsterdam, a city which is riddled with terrible places to stay - and the things they get right they get very right indeed. I was assigned a room on the ground floor, literally steps from reception and with a window looking out onto the busy street outside, complete with trams and bikes going past just beyond the glass. Because of the traffic noise and lack of privacy, I went and asked at reception if it was possible to have another room, but was told that the hotel was full, and that I could move in the morning if I left my bag packed in the room. To cut a long story short, this didn't happen though I did as requested. Despite this, I slept well in the small but comfortable room, which was clean and well-appointed, with a variety of pillows and wall-mounted TV + DVD player. Weirdly, in common with many other refurbished hotels, the room was terribly underlit (though this was compounded by having to keep the curtains drawn to keep passers-by from looking in!) The hotel's proud boast that it is all-inclusive means that each room comes stocked with a (free) minibar and carafes of gin, cognac and so on. In the main lobby, a free bar operates in the same way as at an airport lounge - you help yourself. There are also two internet-connected computers there, which is good because despite the all-inclusive claim, wifi connection is charged extra. If you ask at reception, you'll get a 50 minute card free, but can pay for longer.

BTW: NEVER book a room off the main street just west of the Canal as a street car runs all night some 10-15 feet from just half of the Hotels Rooms. The ambiance when you arrive is romantic and inviting with an open lobby and open bar for all guests. Kudos here.

I think the best way to describe the Banks Mansion is that it is a quirky hotel that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite make up its mind whether it is a full service hotel. On the positive side, it is wonderfully located\u00e2\u20ac\u201dabout 2 minutes from Rembrandtsplan and 10 minutes from Leidesplan and the museums. So, you are right in the heart of Amsterdam. Also, a plus is the lobby lounge of the hotel which provides a complementary full bar, tea, and coffee. The lounge has a wonderfully cozy fireplace, just right for chilly Amsterdam winters. On the down side, the hotel seems to run with very minimal staff. We arrived on Sunday night and quickly learned that there was no bell staff available. Indeed, the Sunday staff consisted of just one person and so far as we could tell, there was no bell staff employed by the hotel. So guests are expected to manage their luggage pretty much on their own. Of course, many people prefer to deal with their own luggage, as we often do, but it is nice to have the option. The room had a lovely canal view (as advertised), but was incredibly small even by European standards. There is really no place to put luggage in the room and the armoire is not big enough to tuck the luggage or other items away. So, while the bed has the best down pillows imaginable, the room is not especially functional. Be prepared to map a path from the bed to the door around your luggage. The room also lacked basic instructions on how to use the television and phone and so we were constantly calling the front desk (our one staff person) to ask how to do this or that. If given the opportunity, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we would stay at the Banks Mansion again. While it certainly was not a bad experience, it was just not so enjoyable that one can overlook the room size and other issues.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cPerfect blend of luxury, comfort and style\u201d", "Author": "HampshireMonty", "ReviewID": "UR58277883", "Content": "This hotel is perfectly situated within walking distance to all attractions.

The hotel's location can not be beat. It was super easy to get to, we took the train from Amsterdam airport to Central Station and hoped on the bus from there. The tram was about a 5 minute ride and literally let us off right in front of the hotel. Check in was a breeze. The room was nice and the view was awesome. Wasn't technically a balcony, but we did sneak on it a few times to enjoy the peaceful canal view ( i believe it could be referred to as a \"french balcony\"). Beds were extremely comfortable and the rain showerhead was pure heaven. Yes, rooms were small but that is to be expected in Europe. My boyfriend and I are in our late 20s and really wanted to do up Amsterdam, so I will be honest, the main reason I booked this hotel was for the inclusive drinks and it did not disapoint. There was a bar set up downstairs with a wide selection of beers, wine, liquor, coffee, sodas, and bottled water that was on a help your self basis 24 hours a day. From the Jameson put in my coffee in the morning to the late night after the bar beers this was a really nice touch. I am also a huge water drinker, so the free bottled water also was great. The mini bar in our room was fully stocked, but it was not refilled (this minor detail was my biggest complaint). We were definatley the youngest people staying at the hotel, but the evenings were a great time to socialize with other travelers when they would put out wine and cheese trays (and cheese in Amsterdam is wonderful). I cant say enough good things about this place. The location was awesome. With in walking distance is the Rembrandplein, which is filled with lots of bars and restaurants. There are many pleins throughout the city and this was by far my favorite one. It seemed the most local and not touristy like Dam Square and the Red light district area and even the Leidsplein There is really no need for a car in Amsterdam. My boyfriend and I rented bikes and rode everywhere.(mikes bike rental was great and with in 10 minute walk from hotel) Breakfasts were wonderful. Lots of buffet items, but you can also order basically anything cooked to order. Staff is so friendly just like the rest of the city. Gotta love the Dutch. We booked the Float package and have to comment on it because I was unsure of what to expect. With the float package we were given a free float session at a highend spa down the street(this was not done by the hotel but offered by them) . The Koan Float was one of the oddest things I have ever experienced. Basically you submerge in a blue chamber filled with warm salt water. You are given a floating headrest and basically just float for an hour while calming music plays. Very different, and can't say I'd want to do it again, but an experience none the less. The float package was cheaper than booking per night so that's why we went with that. All in all I am dreaming of returning this summer. This was our first stop in our Europe tour last year and set the bar very high. The rest of the trip unfortuantly did not compare in quality, and would highly recomend Banks Mansion when in Amsterdam.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merseyside", "Title": "\u201cFantabulous\u201d", "Author": "tripaddy", "ReviewID": "UR57517249", "Content": "Went on trip advisor to find hotel as so many in Amsterdam where do you start?!!!

We re booked this hotel, as it was so good previously, and we were celebrating a special Anniversary, so we booked the deluxe canal rooms, and paid 515 euros plus city tax on top, for 2 nights, so not the cheapest, but we thought we have been there before and we felt it was worth it as it was a special occasion. I emailed the hotel approx 36 hours before we were due to arrive, explained that it was a special Anniversary (20 years) and that we were very much looking forward to our stay, and if there was any chance of a upgrade and a bigger room (as the standard and deluxe canal rooms are quite small), and also that we would be arriving early so if the hotel wasnt full was there any chance of a early check in. Before we departed we had no email and no response to our email - which isnt great customer service, and when we arrived the email was not mentioned - no Happy Anniversary nothing - the person that checked us in was very efficient, but not at all personable, and the email was not mentioned at all. Our room was the room that we booked and paid for, although they did have more superior rooms and the hotel wasnt full - so that was disapointing. All treats, mini bar, and the drinks, beakfast are included like previous people have stated and yes it is great, but you do pay a premuim for this, so unless you are planning on spending a lot of time at the hotel and getting your moneys worth, I would go to another hotel - equivelent in class, that doesnt include all the extras, but is less probably far less expensive. Things we were dispointed with - The hotel was the same as it was 4 years ago decor wise, and hasnt been revamped at all, and is starting to look a little tired in places. They didnt acknowledge our email. No upgrade was given although the hotel wasnt full. The remote control didnt work properly -batteries needed replacing, and when we returned back to the hotel from a day out exploring the city on the Saturday at about 6 oclock, we had a drink in the bar, before heading to our room for a quick change around - and our room was exactly how we left it - bed unmade and no clean towels, we rang reception who said that it must have been overlooked and they would get it sorted, which they did, but thought that this was poorand really not good enough for a hotel of this class, and that we were waiting for the chambermaid at 6 oclock at night. Also missing from the room was the breakfast menu, as late on sat night when we returned we got into bed and decided that we would have room service and have our breakfast delivered to our room, which you can do for a extra 5.00 euros - you just have to select from the breakfast menu and ring down to reception - we didnt have a menu in the room and at 2am, after waiting for our room to be cleaned earlier on, we were really were to tired to wait for one to be sent up and then select and then order - another disapointment Reception staff all leave alot to be desired on the whole, as I said efficient but not personable, apart from Nancy - the weekend manager that arrived on the Saturday, she always asked if everything was ok, and seemed to with all the guests, and always asked people whether they had a nice day and seemed genuinley interested in the people staying there and what they were up to. That all being said it is a good hotel in a nice central position, of a nice class, and if you get the chance to go on a special deal then do, especially if you go with a crowd and intend spending alot of time at the hotel, and enjoying the freebies, but if you have to pay top money then just look around at the alternatives - there are many. Another thing if you have booked or are planning to stay here - If you have breakfast, there is a help yourself buffet and also a menu with things to order about 3/4 things, be aware that you can also order other things that arnt on the menu, as a couple came in on our last day and ordered, eggs, bacon, sausage, tomatoes and mushrooms and they got it - this wasnt on the menu, and my hubby would have definately ordered it had he known.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Uk", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with 'freebies' galore!\u201d", "Author": "hoosenpoon", "ReviewID": "UR38883289", "Content": "Positives: 1/ The hotel is excellent value for money.

I also skimmed through the reviews here on Trip Advisor and honestly, I was not very impressed with the pictures which I saw but then again, pictures from other hotels in Amsterdam were even less impressive. Given the 'somewhat decent' price, location and promise of \"free\" amenities (unlimited access to the lobby bar, free in-room mini bar and 50min free daily internet access) I decided to go ahead and book it. I just accepted that Amsterdam isn't known for having world renowned hotel brands (no Westin, Hilton, Hyatt etc. in the city center) and fairly sized hotel rooms. I just prayed the Banks Mansion isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really the Haunted Mansion The trip into Amsterdam (from Paris) started by me almost getting ripped off by the taxi from the train station (Amsterdam Central) to the hotel. Do yourself the favor and just carry your luggage a few more steps on to the tram (name for local metro) which has a stop next to the hotel. The hotel is only 1.6 miles from the train station. When I arrived at the hotel the check-in process was easy enough and the staff was friendly, even though their cordiality didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come across as being genuine. The front desk seemed to be managed by the cast of The Stepford Wives who were good with scripted responses and fake smiles. I checked in after the hotel check in time but was told that the room was clean but the mini bar had not been serviced yet. I had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeluxe canal-view room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which was small even by European standards; I hate to see their standard size room. Upon entering the small room, I saw a table top full of open beer bottles and the room had a faint smell of cigarette smoke (supposed to be non-smoking). The room also had little flies and some mosquitoes in it (a sign near window advises to keep it closed since the canals attract insects). This defeated the purpose of paying extra for a canal view. The bed and bedding were left to be desired. They offer a pillow menu with different types of pillows which is nice but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the fact that the bed feels like an IKEA futon mattress. Also, they only put one comforter sheet on the bed which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel good and made me dream about bed bugs. The TV in the room was a joke; it was no bigger than a computer monitor, about 18\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd small. I get a larger picture on my IPod. This is a shame given the fact that the hotel does have a good selection of channels including free porn - if that gets you going. I also had to reconnect the cable to the back of the TV. It was half way out causing the picture to go in and out. It took me a few minutes of tinkering with the TV before I realized the problem (the front desk couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure it out). After blasting the air conditioning the room seemed to quickly clear up (bugs & smoke smell). When I returned later in the evening the mini bar was serviced but the free bottles of gin and whiskey were not replenished and near empty. Also the bottles were not sealed, so I was wary of even drinking out of them (if I could bring myself to drink cheap liquor). My first shower (no bathtub) proved to be a daring act as within minutes of my shower the shower hose busted and scalding hot water shot out on to me (aimed at the worse part for a man). I was on the verge of looking like Freddy Kruger after that experience. I complained to them about this and they were generically nice about it and did fix it quickly. Luckily (for them) my bodily discomfort was very temporary and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any lasting damage to my um\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 skin. The next day I had their complimentary breakfast in their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kitchen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was okay. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chef\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that morning was a woman who had an ugly attitude which was reflected by her face. She couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even give the name of the cheese she was putting the omelets. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153French Toast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she made was just some stale bread slices with a fried egg on them. This made all of us guest in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckitchen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 think \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what is this mess?... at the very least put a dash of powdered sugar and cinnamon on them\". I highly doubt she was a real chef. She was more like the maid whose turn it was to fry the eggs. The rest of the breakfast offerings were decent - cereals, breads, breakfast meats. The juice and milk were in open containers and left out which made them warm and not so desirable either (but better than the French Toast). The 2nd and 3rd mornings of the stay there was another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chef\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who was much friendlier but you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find her cooking at any 2 star restaurants either (maybe just eating in them). The quality of room cleaning is also questionable. At 6pm they still had not provided more towels or washcloths as they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153still in laundry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The floor wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vacuumed and the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dusted (during the whole stay). All the maid did was make the bed. The bottles of water, which I drank the night before, were taken out of the trash can where I had placed them, and left on the nightstand next to the bed. What the...? I put them in a plastic bag and placed them in the hallway where they sat until the next morning. The cleaning cart used by housekeeping which I saw in the hallway was no bigger than a hand basket and had a bottle of Windex and two cleaning rags in it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious that housecleaning only did the bare minimum when cleaning the rooms between guest and even less during one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay. Given this was the 3rd hotel on my trip through Europe this hotel fell far behind the others in quality and comfort. The hotel was nothing more than a high priced hostel. They try their hardest to make the hotel feel high \u00e2\u20ac\u201cend and to make their guest feel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give some credit for, but I guess they think feel at home is in a housing project. When I return to Amsterdam I will look for other hotels to stay at. The location was good and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd amenities were good (even though you do pay for them within the nightly rate). However, the quality and comfort of the rooms and maid service probably do not outrank those of a low end room in the red-light district.

It was nice to have Cappuccino in the AM, water throughout the day, and beer whenever I wanted. The room also had decanters of liquor that I did not use because they were in unsealed bottles.

SERVICE IS DEAD. We were there for 2 nights. After checking out of the hotel, my friend was too scared to drive our rented BMW out of the garage so I drove. We were DUMBFOUNDED at the cost. 90 EUROS FOR TWO NIGHTS. That's right, over $140 (even with the stronger dollar) for parking. We are lucky we could afford it and were splitting it, but this was a NASTY SHOCK. I would stay in a hotel with valet parking next time just for this parking insanity if I drove in to Amsterdam. The bad- our room safe was broken. This is a MAJOR inconvenience to me as I travel with a LOT of cash at times. I am an antique dealer, go to markets, and carry cash. I always check to see that the hotels I stay in have a ROOM SAFE for this reason. The Banks Mansion had them but ours was broken and no solution offered after two people had looked at it other than \"you can put your documents in an envelope and we will put them in the safe downstairs\" They had no other room with two beds for us to check into. Obviously I was not going to hand this woman $10k in cash and say \"here you go\". Also bad- the beds were foam and very uncomfortable. We had a nice corner room with canal view but did not sleep well either night. The funniest bad thing- the BLACK toilet paper in the downstairs powder room. I won't elaborate on this. It is just a bad idea. Wipe and find out for yourself. Praise God they were smart enough to have white toilet paper in the upstairs bedrooms. The good- location is very good to walk to the Reiksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, and Rembrandthaus Museum (which we did) all are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Location is also good for walking to restaurants. The lobby is nice and the free internet computers is a BIG PLUS. They were usually occupied, but I found time to use them and check my e-mails. Breakfast was good and nice to have included in the room bill. They made the most of the breakfast room in the basement with no natural light. It is 100% self-serve and I prefer a bit of service at least for hot tea or coffee. Free mini bar and booze was nice but we only drank water so would not use this as a selling point to book here, unless you are a big drinker and boy this hotel caters to some big party people. There were some WASTED Brits who entered at night and were very loud and obnoxious (not sure if they were only drunk or had been drugging). The group came in one night about ten when I was in the lobby and using the computer. They had to pull one woman away from the jars of sweets and they were very rowdy. I put this in the \"bad\" category because I came here with a friend so see the sights, not to party but if you are a party person or big drinker, you will LOVE the free booze in this hotel. It is in the lobby and in your room. Drink free until you drop (which some guests here do.) I can see how some guests ADORE this hotel.

To the hotel: Breakfast this time around seemed a bit on the skimpy side compared to my last stay. Still good. Still sufficient. But less to choose from. And what happened to the dutch pancakes? Also, I said it on my last review, and I'll say it again. For a hotel known for it's \"all inclusive\" concept, how can this not extend to internet? Yes, the computers in the lobby are free, but this doesn't benefit people traveling with their work on laptops. 15.95 euros for a day pass...come on Banks, you can do better than this.

I really liked it. Here's why: Location: After flying into Schipol, I took the train to Central Station and then took the tram (16 or 24) from the station four stops right to the hotel. The hotel is located off of the super-touristry district and more on the edge of a residential area, which makes is much nicer in my opinion. I bought my tram ticket (the Streifenkarte--but that's German, not Dutch) at the book/magazine shop in Schipol, behind Tourist Information). So really, it cost me about 5 euros to get from Schipol to the hotel. The Free Drinks Policy: It was so great to check in and then help myself to a Sprite in the mini bar and not have it cost me 5 euros. I drank all the bottled water, all the Sprite, and the Sparkling Water. I couldn't stop! It was great. Also, there's whiskey, gin, and cognac in the rooms. For free! In the evenings, there's beer, wine spirits, and snacks in the lobby area. Really nice. The Shower: Rainforest showerhead. Slippers/Robe: Provided! Oh, and great towels. Bath sheets. The Rooms: I was in 202, and it was small. But I was also paying the lowest rate. That being said, it was so QUIET and so DARK! It was great. The black-out curtains were awesome. The Breakfast: So I've stayed in a lot of hotels that include a buffet breakfast. Usually, you have to pay extra for a hot breakfast. At The Banks Mansion, I had a ham and cheese omelete one morning (excellent) and French Toast the next morning (average). But still, I thought this was an excellent touch. Downsides: Pay for Internet sucks. And I got a bit screwed in that I paid for 100 minutes, and they didn't give me my free 50 minutes, so I had to get that later after I had already used my 100 minutes. Rooms are a bit worn around the edges 202 was a bit small. It was fine though, honestly.

Simply left luggage there and went exploring Amsterdam. When we returned at 2pm to check-in the room was ready and we headed up. We stayed on the 3rd floor in a corner room with canal views. It was awesome! It felt more like a suite than a standard room. The bathroom with rain shower and separate bath was impeccably clean. The bed was comfy and we had 4 massive double windows/doors and a mini balcony looking out over the canal. And the best bit, *everything* is included in the room rate. So i nailed at least a dozen Hoegaardens and a few glasses of wine in the lobby over the 3 days, all complimentary.

No stupid rip-offs with the mini-bar, lots of terrific extras - all 'free' and a really great location. BUT, the breakfast was about as poor a standard as could be imagined, eg scrambled eggs made by reheating already-made stuff resembling yellow rubber, poor selection etc. This is not what hotel dining rooms should offer. The safe was broken, the phone didn't work, and they would only move us to a different room at OUR expense. The \"free WiFii\" turned out to last 50 minutes and in one room didn't work at all. Hmmm. The worst part was that our foursome booked for 2 days and were forced to leave after one due to genuine and serious circumstances beyond our control. We asked (at breakfast time) if they would let us off the second night's charge. The (young) guy at the desk was very tough and said he would 'ask his manager', later saying he did so and was told 'no'. I said I expected a more lenient attitude under the circumstances and wanted to speak to the manager myself and he immediately said 'OK, we will let you off one room but not both. We can't lose money because of your problems.' I later discovered that they managed to fill the entire hotel that night but still pocketed the room charge they demanded from us. I know we had booked for 2 nights and technically, they may be said to be in the right, but I doubt the manager was even consulted and whereas the small things are what could make this hotel so attractive, knowing they employ transparently poor actors like him and are happy to 'fine' us a (not inexpensive) room rate they ANYWAY sold to somebody else, makes me reluctant to set foot there again or recommend them.

And we did have a couple of requests: 1) we were arriving in the morning and asked to check earlier than the usual time 2) we asked for a room that had a bath tub (most rooms have showers). The staff replied promptly, saying that they will try to accommodate our requests - and they did. We were checked in by Nina, who is very efficient, knowledgeable, and friendly, and so are the rest of the desk staff - Pamela, Laura, Kevin and Ali. Our corner room commanded a view of the canal (Herengracht) and the street (Vijzelstraat). The room and the bathroom were spacious and comfortable. We travel in Europe once a year, so we are used to smaller (than North American) rooms. Breakfast in the \"kitchen\" was also very good; omelettes, pancakes and French toast can be ordered in addition to the buffet-style standards (cheese, cold cuts, smoked salmon, etc.); however, the selection wasn't changed when we were there. The 24-hour lounge snacks and drinks were also good, keeping in mind that these are snacks and not mini-meals, along the lines of nuts, olives, Dutch waffles (cookies), and the occasional dips and cheese. I would have rated the hotel excellent, but the housekeeping service leaves much to be desired. In our 7-day stay, we had to ask 4 times for bathroom items that were lacking: soap, shower gels, bath salts. In addition, the cleaning was cursory: empty gel bottles and soiled face cloths were left uncollected. But again, the desk staff was very quick in sending whatever we needed. As a matter of fact, one of them came to our room with the items that were missing, and she saw the condition of the bathroom. The location was also ideal for us. It was central enough, but not too busy like the Dam, Rembrandtplein or Leidseplein.

There are better views around town but other things in this hotel make up for the lack of a balcony. Rooms are small but extremely functional and charming.

Free WI Fi in lobby at two big desks. You could check in on any info without using your room computer. They also gave you 50 minutes free WI FI in room. Bathrooms were great...not huge but perfectly set. Great big tub and fantastic rain shower. Very clean. Ice and shoe shine right at the end of the hallway. Bed was nice and hard but I did not like the seam down the middle. This would be so easy to correct with a proper pad over the seam! Pillows were rather lumpy. Breakfast down stairs in the basement was fabulous. We missed the first morning because we slept in but the second day we enjoyed all the goodies. Great selection of papers and magazines at breakfast and in lobby each day. The front desk was outstanding! Great help and extremely friendly.

The room was slightly on the small side but this is quite normal in European hotels. The room was well stocked with cognac, vodka and brandy and the mini bar had some cans of beer, fruit juices, smoothies and water. There were also some complimentary apples which we didnt have a chance to eat! We had bought some drinks from the airport hence the big bottle of baileys on our table! Word of note, if you want the mini bar restocked, make sure you let the cleaners know you want your room cleaned/drinks restocked! we didn't get it restocked on the second day. The beds were really comfy, I didn't notice the choice of pillows that other reviews had mentioned, maybe I missed that. The air-conditioning worked fine, and we did have a nice view of our canal from our window. It was very quiet at night which was surprising but welcomed. We also had a flat screen TV which had English channels. The bathroom was nice, which was also on the small side, again this is expected in European hotels. The rain-shower was amazing, although there was no bathtub. The complimentary slippers and massive white bathrobes were also a welcome addition. The breakfast was nice, we went for one morning (closes by 10.30am) we got there about 10.20 and the toast had run out so its best to go earlier, the cook was nice and she made our eggs to our liking although she couldn't make the poached eggs I wanted! The un-staffed bar downstairs was also nice with comfy seats and a fireplace, and with a range of alcoholic drinks, soft drinks and a coffee machine. There was also a variety of snacks which changed during the day. The free internet downstairs was also a welcome addition. Many of the people seemed to be business travelers, so we did feel a bit out of place as younger travelers!. The staff were very helpful with places to go and things to do in the locality. The nearest trams were 16/24 to get to central station but pretty much everything can be reached by walking too. The usual taxi service from the hotel to the airport was 48E so if your trying to budget it might be better to take the tram/train route.

Although it is undeniably in a great location - no more than 10mins walk to everywhere it seemed, and just around the corner from the picturesque '9 streets' - the hotel is just not worth the money. Our room (212) was incredibly dark - we felt like we were in the basement despite being on the 2nd floor, and was really way too small to justify the 279Euros it costs a night. We could hardly walk around the bed - and had no-where to put our luggage. On the plus side the bed was very comfy however the pillows were lumpy and really need to be replaced. FYI - Banks Mansion claims to have a 'pillow menu' - but they didn't have any pillows available when we asked so the claim seemed a bit of a let down! We also only had one pair of slippers and one dressing gown. The drinks in the 'free minibar' were never replenished, and after the room was \"cleaned\" on Saturday morning the maid left old half full cans of coke and beer. Finally, the room was not clean (by my standards) - hair in the bath and in the sink, soap marks on the mirror, grit on the carpet in the bedroom, and dark marks all over the wallpaper. FYI - our room was non-smoking but everything including the bathroom towels smelt smoky and dusty. The communal areas - lounge etc are also smoking so it cannot be avoided in this hotel. The free nibbles (always the same..nuts and crisps, nougat and small waffles) and drinks were great but again they did not make up for the room. The very last bone of contention about this hotel is the breakfast. It's really quite horrible. The pancakes (\"made to order\") come out of a packet and are literally warmed up on the griddle in front of you. The eggs are worse - they have a tub of orange eggy liquid which they pour into a frying pan...) There were no pastries or croissants, etc. Not much choice at all to be honest. All in all, based on our experience we would not recommend this hotel. There were simply too many problems to justify the price, and even if we had loved our room it is still too expensive.

I mentioned that we had been promised a corner room and after some deliberation we were reallocated to room 306. That wasn't ready so we left our bags with them and took the tram into the centre and the railway station. Here we collected tickets for the prebooked Candle Light Cruise (no candles!) and the canel bus. The hotel is right on the canel and ten minutes walk from all the main sights. We ate out at Visrestaurant Lucius, 5 minutes away, and the mussels and king prawns were delicious. The room was tastefully decorated and had 4 windows out onto the canal and intersection. There was some road/tram noise. As mentioned by others the minibar and associated decanters of whisky, brandy and gin are all included, as are drinks/nibbles in the lounge. Breakfast, served in the basement was OK. Checkout was at 12 noon. Again we were able to leave our bags and continue sightseeing coming back to the lounge at 5pm for a drink and wait for the shuttle.

I had a wonderful omelet one morning. Again, the service was great. Free drinks of all sorts were always available in the lobby. This included wines, beers, sodas, and even liquers. The hotel is very well located to allow walking to all the major sites in Amsterdam. We never felt the need to take a tram. It was wonderful to be able to stop in the midst of sightseeing for a cold drink and a snack. The staff at the desk provided a very good street map, and were unfailingly polite when we needed replacements, having twice lost ours. The lobby has 2 internet workstations, which I had no trouble accessing whenver I needed. It's a great help to check in and print boarding passes before going to the airport. The hotel will arrange a shuttle to the airport for 24 euros, which worked out well for us--we turned out to be the only 2 passengers, so it was like having our own taxi but cheaper. Do yourself a favor and have an Indonesian dinner at Tempo Doeloe, Utrechtestraat 75. Try a \"rice platter\" which includes portions of 18 different dishes.

Our canal view room, booked weeks before our trip, wasn't available. Instead, we were shown to a dark room facing, well, nothing. Not an auspicious start! Two stars or less. Room 312, however, had its good side. The bed was very comfortable and the Banks Mansion offers a \"menu\" of five different types of pillows, for any kind of firmness or softness you desire. The four pillows already in the room suited us just fine, and I'm a pillow snob. Four stars. The bathroom was also another definite plus. It was very big. The separate shower was large with a huge shower head and loads of water pressure. The tub was great for a deep soak and you faced away from the toilet. I love my bubble baths but I hate staring at a toilet for the duration of my bath. Four stars. However, the towels were tiny and the soap/shampoo situation was pretty miserly. Also, a face towel that went astray sat at the back of the cabinet floor for four days. The cleaner never spotted it though the rest of the bathroom was sparkling. Two stars. Everybody raves about the free booze and snacks. Yes, there are decanters of cognac, gin and whiskey on the bedside table. If that's your thing then I guess it's pretty exciting. I'm a bit of a cynic and always wonder what other guests may have added to the mixture. But, hey, that's just me. There is a mini bar with water, juice, pop and two Heinekens. I must admit that was a nice touch. Also, the bar downstairs had lashings of red and white wine, beers, pops, sparkling and flat waters, coffee, tea, liqueurs, you name it. Help yourself. Four stars. Breakfast (included) was great. No quibbles there. It was open from 7-10:30 during the week and until 11 on the weekend. Very civilized. The usual ham, cheese, muesli, yogurt mix but also the added bonus of omelets, pancakes and porridge made fresh to order. Four stars. The staff were WONDERFUL. Especially Michel. He deftly saved every two star situation and made it into a four. He knew we were disappointed about our room change and made sure a chilled bottle of champagne was waiting for us the next evening as well as an offer to change rooms as soon as a canal view was available (we elected to stay where we were because it was too much of a hassle to re-pack). Noticing our interest in dining, he gave us a fabulous book on Amsterdam restaurants and insisted we keep it. He also gave us great recommendations. A charming man and a real asset to the hotel.

This room seemed bigger than the canal view rooms and included two windows not the one found in canal view rooms. We were a little disappointed, but we felt we ended up with a good trade off. The bathroom was nice, black and white with a good shower, but the bathroom was pretty small. As others have said, the complimentary food, wine, newspaper, and internet access in the lobby was great. The lobby has a fireplace and several large windows overlooking the canal, creating a nice setting to unwind and relax for awhile after seeing the sights or returning from business. They even had two computers available to use. I wish more hotels would offer this amenity to leisure travelers that leave lap tops behind, especially since it cost them next to nothing. The breakfast each morning was nice with a good selection of foods (including some made to order dishes), but it is held in a basement room that is cute, but not as attractive as other areas of the hotel. The overall decor of the hotel is nice and things are in good condition. The hotel has a slight art deco feel to it. Although the staff was courteous, we did not find them as friendly as other reviewers have. In addition, when we checked out, we ordered a cab through the front desk on an early Sunday morning. After ten minutes we asked the front desk to call again. The front desk employee did and was surprised the cab had not shown by then. About 6-7 minutes later still with no cab, we went outside and hailed one down ourselves. Not sure why this happened, but it put us off a little.

Arrived after a short delay on our flight at around 7 pm, we were greeted by 'Nina' on Reception, who was very friendly. We were given room 201 which had a view overlooking the Herengracht canal, and our window was directly opposite the Mayor of Amsterdam's house!! Lovely room, large bed with a chair/footstool at the side. Nice shower-room in art-deco style with a lovely big shower cubicle. The shower leaked onto the floor each time so we had to make good use of the bath mat, but it wasnt worth complaining about! Loved the plasma tv on the wall, and the dvd player. Also enjoyed the free decanters of drink - gin, brandy and whiskey. We made it to breakfast 2 of our 3 mornings, very nice but found the girl who made the omelettes/french toast etc a bit stroppy. I think she was just a bit stressed as she had been left alone by her colleagues, but even so she was a bit rude! (I only asked if there was another loaf of bread as when we arrived in the breakfast room there was none!). (on Sundays the breakfast room is open until 11, we had arrived at approx. 10:20 - so obviously we expected to have bread available)! However, dont let this put you off, the hotel is great in general!

Oh, and free use of the internet if you need it. The hotel was in an excellent location, everything we were interested in seeing was within a 10 minute walk. We had a lovely meal (probably the nicest meal we've ever had - and we've eaten in a fair few restaurants!), at Casa di David which is located on the Singel, a 7 minute walk from Banks Mansion. To start we shared bruschetta with mozzarella and pesto - delicious. My husband then had a plain old spaghetti bolognaise - but said it was the best he'd ever eaten! I had kebabs of king prawn & poached salmon, on a bed of green beans with parmesan dressing - gorrrrgeous! This was served with saute potatoes. The food was lovely, the setting lovely, waiters very friendly, lovely atmosphere. (by the way we got Nina at Banks Mansion to reserve us a table as we'd tried to get in on the Friday night but couldnt). We also ate lunch at Cafe de Kroon in Rembrandtplein, just a snack, but it was a lovely sunny day and nice to people-watch for an hour or so! We also tried a 'coffee shop'. We stayed away from the tourist-y ones, and went to a more 'locals' type coffee shop. Had a great atmosphere, with funky dance music playing. Had a wander through the Red Light District - what an eye-opener!!! Also did a canal boat tour, during the day, this was really enjoyable too.

This hotel does not go for massive luxury, but has massive amounts of friendliness, comfort, service, drinks, coffee's etc. Unique is the word for the all exclusive service, pillows yes lovely, bed yes very comfortable, televisions great, shower well did not want to leave the shower! Our stay was even made better by all the reception staff, especially Frederique and Sonja (hope I have spelt them right) who went out of their way to help my wife find some craft shops. The lounge area was also very nice for the internet, coffee, Baileys, Brandy, Beers, waters, fruit juice, snacks. With also drinks in your fridge in your rooms, and Gin, Whiskey and more.

The area also is perfect, 10 minutes away from shops, rembrandt square (loads of cafes), 20 minutes walk at the most from Grand Central Station, 10 minutes from DamSquare. Highly recommended to you from someone who studies what to do on holidays. 1 Anne Frank House 2 The Red Light Tour 3 Sauna Deco (more in next paragraph)(has it's own web site) 4 Privare hire of driver and his car (with drinks and snacks) (Dennis Van Leerdam phone 0655785832) 5 Canal Bus (14 stops, get on and off canal bus) 6 Candlelight Canal Tour (lindbergh) I really hope this help you, and is not too much reading. Sauna Deco, Wow !! Twenty Minute walk from the hotel, on the same canal, where you can have sports massage, and any massage. But if your not modest it is a unisex sauna, steam , relax , showers, plunge pool , with no clothes, another eye opener and very relaxing. The private car with Dennis Van Leerdam was great to travel to the windmills, Boerk, and the Waterland area. I hope you enjoy your stay , please feel free to mention my wife and my name (Mr Sean Peters and Mrs Tracey Peters), let me know. May post photos later, don't forget to ask for a canal view.

The lobby has a nice bar with complimentary cokes, water, juices, snacks, etc. Breakfast was especially enjoyable with a full menu and a chef to make omellets, pancakes, and the like.

After booking the hotel through a travel website, we contacted the hotel directly and asked if we could be upgraded because we were celebrating our anniversary. When we arrived we were greeted as if we were old friends. We were told that we had the option of picking from 3 different rooms. When we entered the first room, on the bed was a porcelain figurine of a dutch boy and girl puckering up to kiss and a note stating \" Welcome to the Banks Mansion. We are so pleased that you chose us to celebrate your anniversary.\" The room was beautiful, facing the front of the hotel on the corner with views of the canal in either direction. The room was large even by american standards. The room had double beds pushed together, a large armchair wth footstool, a desk with a mirror, a tall closet and plenty of space to walk around. The bathroom had a shower stall with a refreshing rain showerhead, a bathtub which could also be used for showering and the sink was higher than ordinary making for easier use. The room had AC which we could control which we found to be unusual in european hotels and which we were very grateful for because we hit a hot spell in Europe. Needless to say, we never viewed the other two rooms. The \" living\" and the mini in roombar along with the three decanters of gin, whiskey and cognac were as advertised and included in the room price, plentiful and useable 24 hours. I shouldn't forget to mention free internet use. The breakfast was varied and plentiful. There was an egg, etc. station where you could order what you wanted. The cook remembered and asked us if we wanted the same order as we ordered the day before. The only drawback is that the \"kitchen\" has no AC which on some days, because of the hot spell, made it uncomfortable. If that were not enough, the staff was extra-ordinary. They were always pleasant, smiling and very helpful. Nothing that is asked is too much for them. Don't miss this place.

The hotel is ideally situated and in walking distance to all the main areas. The reviews that I read before we travelled are spot on; this is a great hotel and I would highly recommend it. We used the Connexions shuttle service located at A7 at the airport. Took around 20mins to get to the hotel at a cost of 12 euros each which I didn't think was bad when you consider it drops you right outside the hotel. Will use the tram and train to return just for a different experience. Apparantly the train to the airport runs every 15 minutes and the tram can be picked up about 50m from the hotel. The staff are extremely helpful with plenty of knowledge about the area and things to do and see. The room which features the complimantary minibar was great, a good size and extremely clean and well presented. It was very hot when we stayed and the air-con was a welcome relief from the heat of the streets. The addition of the complimantry bar in the lounge together with snacks and sweets was also a real plus together with the free internet access on which i'm writing the review right now! We were recommended the Dynasty chinese restaurant by the staff who based their advice not only on having visited their themselves but also with the aid of the trusty restaurant guide book they have behind the counter with ratings based on customer experiences. We paid 90 euros for the 2 of us; not cheap but the food and service was exceptional. If the weather is good ask for a table in the rear courtyard garden which is very pretty and away from the hustle and bustle with a great atmosphere. We did what I imagine are the usual museum visits including the Anne Frank house which is about a 25min walk from the hotel. Don't be fooled by what appears to be a queue that stretches round the corner. It moves pretty quick and once inside there is plenty of space to walk around freely. Pretty poignant stuff. Keep your wits about you in the Red Light District and ignore the the drug dealers and you'll be fine.

It is very centrally located where trams #16 and #24 run right by it. It is right on the canal, but our room was located so that right below us would be the street and if we lean just a bit from our window we can see the canal. If you ask for rooms facing the canal, that would be preferable. All the other houses along the same street facing the canal use to be mansions of Amsterdam's elite society similar to our hotel, renovated to be a great value hotel. We usually like decors reflecting the grand old elegance of a past era, but the modern/art deco look was a treat. It is far from the largest hotel we've stayed in around the world, but by European standards and for the price the room is a good size with room for a desk and a lounge chair to relax in instead of having to camp out on the bed to watch TV. The TV sound pipes into the bathroom so that we can listen to the news while getting ready. The staff was friendly, accomodating and it was cute to see a petite girl running to help us carry in our luggage we hauled across France and Belguim, into the hotel entrance. The lobby has 2 PCs with internet connections, comfortable seating areas and one area near a fireplace. The hotel provides snacks, liquor, wine, beer, coffee and tea in the lobby 24 hrs a day, constantly stocked so that we can help ourselves like we were at home. The mini-bar in the room is also complimentary and I think we are still shell-shocked over that one. Gin, Vodka and Gran Marnier were also provided in cut glass ware in the room. Every morning we went downstairs to the Kitchen where a full breakfast is provided, again complimentary. Besides the full continental breakfast items, eggs, sausages and bacon are provided. If you want, there is a cook available to cook pancakes, eggs any way you want, french toast and waffles.

Oh, I did forget the free internet in the looby! I could not recomment this hotel more - if you can - stay there.

The quality and extra features (breakfast, all drinks, snacks) easily make up for the slight increase in cost over other hotels. Longer version - My wife and I spent my 30th Birthday at the Banks Mansion hotel and had a fantastic time. We used Trip Advisor for reviews and advice of where to stay so thanks to all for taking the time to comment. Although we have been to Amsterdam twice before, both stays right next to Dam Square, we wanted a quality hotel with attention to detail whilst being central enough to get around to the sites easily. We booked direct through the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website (cheaper than Expedia etc) received confirmation promptly and any requests were confirmed upon providing a credit card number. Looking at the map it appears that Banks Mansion is a little far from the attractions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but once you get there and take a look at the map you realise you could not be in a better location. You are simply right in the middle of the most popular areas - the Dam Square area to the north where you will find the tourist spots of Red Light District, souvenir shops, Madame Tussauds, coffee shops etc; East to the Artis zoo, the Leidesplein to the South West (restaurants etc) and then South to the Reiks Museum, Van Gogh museum and Heineken Experience. Oh and you are 50 yards from the flower market and the Rembrandtplein. Banks really is in the right spot - central AND quiet - it is in the old finance and lawyers district which means beautiful old historic bank buildings in traditional Dutch fashion, and is right on the canal. It took us 15 minutes to amble down the Damrak and Rokin taking in the sites and to arrive at the corner plot of the Banks Mansion with a decadent entrance warming you to the fact that you have chosen wisely ;o) Check in was easy and an upgrade to a small suite was offered to celebrate my birthday. Note in no way has the upgrade swung my vote on this hotel as it is so much more than that. The suite was on the ground floor and was a great size. More importantly the decor was just right, comfy and plush with clever lighting. Massive 7 foot square bed, 2 arm chairs, widescreen TV and DVD, large desk/dresser, Private Bar, lots of storage space in pretty art deco wardrobe, separate toilet and a big bathroom with deep bath and a separate, powerful rain fall shower. The BIG benefit of this hotel is the 'At Home' experience. So rather than spending a nice day seeing the attractions of Amsterdam and then coming back to your hotel and crashing out in your room and watching TV, waiting to go out not wanting to spend money on the mini-bar and not wanting to go to a bar just yet, here at Banks you can come back, dump your coat and chill out in the large lounge area with free self serve drinks and snacks. Every drink you could ask for is here including branded spirits in decanters, bottle beers, coffee machine and soft drinks. Snacks consisted of sushi, expensive nuts, pesto and bread. Just enough to get your appetite going for a nice meal out and plenty of magazines and papers to recommend the best nights (and days) out. In case you were wondering \u00e2\u20ac\u201c does a free bar mean everyone gets wrecked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Not whilst we were there, it seems the hotel attracts the right type of guest who has better things to do than abuse a great feature of the hotel. So we ate at the Indonesian across the road (very tasty), Ocho's a Brazilian Grill near Leidesplein (great steaks) and Bangkok, a Thai recommended by the hotel again round the corner (which was very good and very popular with the locals - worth booking). Breakfast in the hotel is very good, full continental selection plus fruit, pancakes and the staple eggs, bacon and sausages (cooked well for a change) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c plenty to get you through and avoid the need for lunch. If you are not a great lover of walking then a cab (hotel ordered us a very nice Mercedes MPV with chauffer) to the train station is less than 10 Euros perhaps a normal cab is even cheaper, and there is a Tram stop 50 metres from the hotel. But as the city is flat and there is so much to look at and take in I would strongly recommend an amble around this interesting city. For a third trip to Amsterdam this hotel served us incredibly well. We wanted something different (stayed in the Swissotel before which although pleasant is not even in the same league as Banks Mansion), something with a bit more attention and thought whilst still being affordable and within easy reach of the sites. We found it all in the Banks Mansion and would not hesitate recommending it for couples, business trips or small groups of friends.

The rooms were of a first class quality and suprisingly big for European standards. As other reviewers have mentioned, everything is included in the price of the room, even the minibar in the room. What gave it that extra touch is that there were decanters in the room containing three different spirits to choose from and mixers in the fridge, rather than spirits in little plastic bottles!! Our room looked out onto the Herengracht canal and had windows that opened right up. Gave a lovely feel to the room.

It is an excellent value - we got a relatively low rate directly though the hotel, and were very happy with a canal view room that was quiet if the windows were closed. We found the staff very helpful and nice, the room was narrow but decent in size and very nice in decor and furnishings (art deco look, with a big bathroom), particularly for Europe where narrow and eclectic rooms are typical even in more expensive hotels. The room was charming, if you like contemporary and spare European sensibilities. There were a lot of amenities included with the room (free in-room mini-bar, free alcohol in room and in lobby, inlcuding bottled beer and soft drinks, free snacks, complimentary breakfast which did include custom egg and waffle making, etc.) -- all of which was quite excellent and unique in our experience for any contemporary hotel in the US or Europe -- they are simply not out to strip you of every dime you bring in this place. With the decent nightly rate (180E for the two of us), for a canal view room and all of the amenities, we thought it was an excellent value. The hotel is extremely well located, in the central part of the canal belt near the Amstel River, the Rembrandtpelin and the flower market, yet its not too inner city (where it can get a little sleazy). It was a 5 minute or less walk to the Joordan, the Spui, Dam Square, Leidseplein and the Museum area. It's very close to Tempo Doloe and other excellent Indonesian restuarants, several of our favorite coffee shops (Damkring, Rokerij and Tweede Kamer), 2 or 3 trolley lines within a block of the front door, so it is ultra-convenient. This is a relaxed hotel with a relaxed attitude in an excellent location. We have stayed in hotels in Amsrterdam where we felt ever so slightly unwelcome, but not here.

There's also a good chinese directly across the road. We have already been raving about this hotel to our friends as the place in Amsterdam to stay and worth the cost.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cbrilliant hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4164020", "Content": "stayed in banks mansion for a few days and did not want to leave, the rooms are comfortable and very clean, the bath room was lovely and the staff are extreemely friendly, i was delighted to find out that all drinks in the room and in the lounge downstairs were included within the room price! would not think of staying anywhere else when i visit amsterdam!", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "\u00c4\u00b0stanbul", "Title": "\u201cfulfills the recommendations\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4091206", "Content": "Needing a place to stay, in the tad-expensive Amsterdam, the previous reviews of this hotel convinced us to reserve our room.

I had read previous reviews about the fact that the lobby bar was not re-stocked in the evening but this was not our experience. There was always wine, beer and snacks available in the evening but what we particularely enjoyed was the espresso/capuccino maker we could use anytime. We also loved the complimentary internet access (2 stations in the lobby). The breakfast was excellent and most of all, all the staff we encountered was extremely helpful and would go out of their way to make our stay perfect.

Tram stop very close by for those who wish to go further afield. The hotel is Art Deco and nicely furnished; contemporary design style room was absolutely fine with comfortable bed, good bathroom, flat-screen TV, free minibar; the public area including the lounge also featured free food and drinks; the breakfast room (and breakfast) also perfectly acceptable. Staff were friendly and service was good. Really can't understand why anyone would be unhappy with the place; enjoyed a great stay and would recommend to anyone.

It is located centrally within easy walking distance of all the main sights/museums and shopping/eating areas, as well as easy to get to from the airport by public transport. The building itself is beautiful from the outside, and the bedrooms, whilst not enormous, were certainly big enough for the two of us. The art deco/macintosh style interiors were very stylish. Breakfast was included and was of an excellent standard - but my favourite part was the complimentary mini bar in the bedrooms and the complimentary hotel bar in the lobby. During the day the fully stocked bar also offered cakes and chocolates, which gave way to nuts, nachos etc in the late afternoon/evening! Very welcoming after a long day sightseeing to fall into a big armchair with a complimetary glass of wine or beer and nibbles!

I have a weakness for Art Nouveau and Art Deco and so I very much liked the decor of this splendid hotel-others might find it a bit \"over the top\". The desk and waiting staff were helpful and efficient and everything was spotlessly clean. The bedroom and bathroom were both of a good size (my room had a pleasant outlook onto the Herengracht) and the power-shower was much appreciated. I made little use of the flat screen TV, DVD/CD player or free computer access but it was nice to know that they were there. The free bar (and free mini-bar in each room) is an excellent idea-the extortionate mini-bar prices in most hotels are a regular source of irritation-and I did not see anyone the worse for these facilities, though obviously someone with a weakness in that direction would do better to stay elsewhere. The breakfast was ample and served in an agreeable room with a relaxing atmosphere. The hotel's location is convenient for most parts of the city centre.

It touts its style and free bar but falls down on the basics. The rooms on the ground floor, we were lucky enough to catch two of them, are literally 2 metres from the pavement and three from the trams. Despite the double glazing there was far too much noise from both outside the hotel and inside from the reception area. The rooms themselves were constantly gloomy and the hotel doesn't seem to be able to afford lighting above 25 watts. One room, 008, is so small the wardrobe door only opens 45 degrees and the bathroom is so small you have to sit on the toilet sideways! The water is constantly boiling and with cold water taps in the shower that slowly turn themselves off, it makes for interesting bath times. The breakfast is merely adequate, not what you expect at 210 euros per person per night. There is a free bar and 2 computer terminals that are free to use but that in no way makes up in the deficencies of this hotel. Most of the small team of staff are pleasant, the leas helpful being the Genaral Manager who showed no interest in offering an alternative room.
