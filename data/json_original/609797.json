Actually, the price was quite fair. When you pay this much (or this little) for a hotel, you can't expect it to be a beautiful top-quality stay, but I was looking for clean and quiet. This I got. I will say that I had to change rooms a few times. The first room was at the end of the hallway and the wifi (free) signal was not strong enough to stay connected. The second room that they gave me was a smoking room and while it didn't reek, it was not terrifically pure smelling. Overall, I slept well there.

As we did not want our weekend to be ruined completely, we have decided on last minute to go to Berlin and hotel Mercure. GREAT CHOICE! The hotel is located just few minutes walking distance from U-Bahn station near the street Kurfurstendamm. We arrived about 11:15 p.m. and had a very nice check-in by the night receptionist Herbert. We got a room 401 on the 4th floor, even better than we expected. Large room, totally clean, modern, beautiful bathroom.. Great bed, after all the travelling we slept like angels. :-) We had a room breakfast excluded, however we paid 12 EUR/person extra and we took it. Another great choice. Best breakfast we have ever had in any hotel. Unbelievable choice. Everything tasted fresh and great. Also very good stuff working there. Always smiling. So no wonder we paid for a breakfast also next morning. Only thing which did not work during our stay was internet, neither wifi connection, neither the computer down in the lobby. But that was not a problem, as Emina at the reception explained for us everything we needed to know (like how to get somewhere and stuff). On Saturday we went to Tropical islands, but as it was really nice weather, we took a long walk around Tiergarten to Brandenburger Tor, Unter den Linden and further on up to train station Ostbahnhof for our train (S-Bahn) to Tropical islands. (We were a little disappointed from TI, as it was really not so warm in there, kinda like if you leave the shower early in the morning and go to cold hall). When we came back to our room that night, we found out cleaning ladies did a good job, everything was so clean again. :-) On our last day we wanted to go out for a walk before we had to leave back to Prague and pnce again we got some great suggestions from receptionist Christin, who was very nice to us and explained also few things we did not quite understood about Berlin. We took U-Bahn to Charlotenburg Schloss, took some pictures there and went back to hotel to pick up our luggage and went home. Overall - if you are going to Germany, this hotel should be your choice, because of the location, cleaningness, food, quality of rooms and sleep quality, extremely nice and helpful stuff. It's definitelly going to be our choice for a hotel next time we go to Berlin.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cQuite good, but not great\u201d", "Author": "lesliedocherty-GLA", "ReviewID": "UR123370986", "Content": "Stayed here whilst on business in Jan, The good points are 1) Free internet in room which is a great bonus, very few hotels in Berlin offer this, i know as my wife spent hours trying to find the ones that did. 2) Big rooms, my room was long and had plenty of space, great size room with a fold out couch, good for relaxing after a long day in Berlin. 3) Supermarket is right next day, its well priced, has amazing pastries and a great selection of fruit (great for making up breakfast). Bad points were 1) Rooms were quite dated, and a bit reminiscent of a 80's room, old decor and just a bit tired. 2) No English TV channels (not that you come to watch TV, but after spending the day round trade shows, a bit of TV would help) 3) Coffee/Tea making was there but not working, nowhere to plugin, no coffee supplied.

In our room service was so poor that I was reduced to going to reception to log in or bringing my iPad with me to breakfast.

We thought hotels would be very expensive, but after coming across this hotel on easyjet hotels, it was quoted as a 4 star, and for 3 nights and 4 days accommodation was only \u00a3120 for a double room if I remember correctly (costing more at the weekend than through the week). Still, a brilliant price mid-world cup. Although I wouldnt class the hotel as 4 star, I would say it was definitely a 3 star by UK standards. It was very clean, and newly built at the start of 2006. It has lifts and stairs, and the breakfast, which Is included was quite nice. The downstairs also joins onto the main supermarket (these are in small majority in Berlin, so it is great that this is next door), which is very well stocked with its own bakery etc. Surprisingly (especially during world cup fever time) the language barrier was quite certain. Although reception staff who were very friendly did their best to accomodate us, the bars and restuarants round about, was quite tricky (with very seldom having English written on the menus). There is a lovely Italian round the corner about a 5 minute walk, and the restaurant across from the hotel is tasty too! The hotel is a 15 minute walk to Berlin Zoo, and aquariam which made for a fun day out - although the animals did look a bit hot, and I didnt like it (being an animal biologist!!). It is a fun day out for the kids though, with lots of animals to see (although unless you can read German you have no idea what it is you are looking at as no signs in English!!). The hotel is situated off Kurfurstendam (the main strip in Berlin). Lots of shops, but expensive shops!! With so many side streets off Kurfurstendam, we did get lost, but found our way back by remembering that burger king is on the corner!!
