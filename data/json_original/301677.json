The breakfast buffet was very reasonable and offered plenty of variety and flavour. The coffee however tasted like dishwater....make sure you order fresh coffee.

We ensure we travel once every three to four months, just to rejuvenate ourselves. We visited Singapore a second time in February this year, just because the first time we visited it during our honeymoon, five years ago, we couldn't see or travel much due to the fact that both of us had taken ill out there; must say it was pure bad luck that time. Anyways, this time, in February, we took another trip to Singapore and stayed at the Copthrone Orchid Hotel; just because we wanted to see all that the city had to offer and visit. This hotel is 10-15 minutes away from Orchard Road, so it's relatively peaceful, and away from the hustle bustle of Orchard road. Being a business and leisure hotel, it has all amenities on offer; like conference facilities, wi-fi service, swimming, amongst a host of other activities. We had a swell time out here; the food is delectable and the staff is extremely courteous, just like one would expect in hotels. The hotel offers a free coach ride to Orchard Road every 30 mins, that too free of cost. This helps a great way when you want to save on the expensive cab fares. The hotel offers an excellent buffet lay-out, with Indian and Continental cuisine on offer. Being in Singapore, the hotel is one of the best, if you don't want to spend a lot of money. The rooms are extremely clean, with all modern amenities available in the rooms. One gets to enjoy a peaceful stay at this hotel, along with all activities for kids, and grown-ups to enjoy.

The carpets were stained and the place looks like it hasnt been decorated in 20 years. I can only guess that water pipes must have burst as I cant explain why there was such a bad overwhelming smell throughout. Our room was adequate. Poor natural light, noisey road outside and the bad musty smell was also present. Breakfast was non descript and again just about adequate. Room servive was good and the food was resonably good. Never used the pool or spa. Fine for 2 nights but dont have high expectations. Oh yes..the use of the internet was $11.77 SD for 30 mins which was an incredible rip off.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hyderabad", "Title": "\u201cComfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "Abhishekanand", "ReviewID": "UR77743293", "Content": "Copthorne Orchid is a nice place to stay.

The location wasn't the best in the world but the hotel does run its own shuttle service which goes to the DFS Galleria on Scotts Road and back throughout the day, and from there the nearest MRT (underground) station is ION Orchard which is 5 minutes away. Get the Singapore Tourist Pass which costs SD34 for 3 days (SD10 of it is a refundable deposit) which allows you unlimited access on the MRT and buses. Having said that about location though, it is situated in a scenic residential area and near the University and Botanical Gardens which is all nice for taking a walk around. The breakfast buffet was very good, the bacon was the best I've ever had! I wouldn't bother having dinner here, just take a 5 minute taxi ride from the hotel to Newton Circus where you can eat for much cheaper. However we found it very difficult to get a taxi back, there was no taxi rank, we couldn't hail one down as they drive too fast to slow down, if you try to phone a cab company you're put on hold for ten minutes, and the drivers in the yellow taxi even refused to take us to our specific hotel for reasons they did not give! Singapore taxi drivers are by far the most arrogant too. So what we did the second time round was to get the MRT from Newton station nearby to ION Orchard, from where we caught the hotel shuttle (last one at 10pm). A bit ridiculous though. The staff are useless when it comes to asking for tourist information and they didn't seem too friendly in general either. We only found out from the concierge how to best get to Little India when we asked him the best place for a dosa as he was Indian! You basically have to get the 66 or 67 bus from the bus stop outside the hotel for only SD1.60 and get off at Serangoon Road.

When my son called the House Keeping In-charge, she talked very rough and told that they had already provided at the time of room cleaning but we had consumed the sugar. She could provide extra if we wanted extra. We told that sugar pouches were not provided. Then I noticed that even towels, foot mat towel were not provided, Dustbin was not cleared & room was not cleaned. Only Bed sheets were changed. I again spoke to House Keeping In charge, but she again spoke very rough. Then I had to call the front desk & then only required Items were arranged in the room. 4. No complementary water bottle were provided in the room. 5. When we again checked in on 01.01.2010, the front desk officer was very rude. Her behavior was such that as if she was giving some complementary stay to us. She asked that when we will check out the room next day, I told around 10 AM. Then she told very rudely that if we do not check out the room before 12 in the room, she will charge $ 98 per room. Similarly she asked for the deposit of $ 100 for two room. When I gave $ 100, she again told very rudely that deposit slip should not be lost otherwise I would not get the refund. 6.

I knew before I booked this hotel that it was not central but that a shuttle bus was provided to the nearest metro station.

The shuttle was regular but for the sake of waiting we would usually jump on a bus - the stop is about 200 yds from the hotel - and get to Little India station then continue on from there. Getting back by public transport was not so easy as the hotel is on a main road seperated by barriers so we used taxis which were cheap enough - from Clarke's Key about 8 SGD. The staff were very friendly and helpful at the reception and they upgraded our room as we checked in. We were in the 2nd wing in the hotel - the room was spotless, spacious and we did not hear any outside traffic. We did not have breakfast so cannot comment on that as we were only there 2 nights and had an early start to the airport - we had to leave at 4;45 am and when I asked reception the night before to order me a cab for that time, they helpfully told me that to do so would cost me SGD 7 but it was not necessary as there is always a cab outside. They were true to their word.

The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere\" and you really need to cab it or take the hotel bus shuttle to get anywhere. The rooms are badly in need of refurbishment. I would also agree with other reviewers' comments that the rooms are depressing. On a positive note, though, the rooms are reasonably clean and functional. Another good feature is the pond on the lobby level. Very pretty. I've also been told that the Chinese restaurant is good, but I personally did not try it. My advice is unless you get a very attractive rate, or if there's no other hotel, be very wary of this place.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest", "Title": "\u201cI liked it\u201d", "Author": "BudapestApu", "ReviewID": "UR8430230", "Content": "I stayed there this July. I was literally afraid to go there after reading the so many negative impressions here. However, I have to say that only one negative point survived - the curtains really were not cleaned/changed since the inauguration of the hotel. But all personnel friendly and helpful, services ok, buffet style breakfasts and dinners meet every standard - wireless internet connection (in the lobby) working immediately and perfectly. I liked the swimming pool for relaxation. Could be opened one hour earlier, as the 7 a.m is too late for people who have to leave for business, and do not want to skip breakfast. Theoretically it is possible to eat at 6 and swim at 7, but this order is not too healthy...

On arrival I informed the concierge of my baggage mishap and asked him to let me know if it was delivered, unfortunately this never happened during my stay and eventually turned up 5 days later in Australia! I found the hotel staff to be courteous and helpful and although the hotel is a little bit out from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road, taxis were coming and going all day and night and it was very cheap to travel this way. The Hotel did provide a number of shuttle buses free of charge throughout the day and again I found these to be very clean, punctual and effificient. One disappointment was the pool which was next to a busy road and had a lot of leaves and debris in it and didnt look in the least bit inviting, having said that the sun never managed to break through the clouds during my brief stay and we did have a couple of brief heavy thunderstorms so sunbathing was out anyway.
