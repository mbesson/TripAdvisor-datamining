I called a few times before arriving to verify they would have a crib available, AC and for dirrections to the property, all times the service was great except that they sometimes would tell me they were bussy, place me on hold and would then hang up (maybe the phone line would hang up after waiting so long.) A few other times they would tell me they would grab my information and call me back bc they were bussy and they would never call back. But when they did have the time and they didnt place me on hold they were very nice, In fact I called the hotel the day we arrived and the person on the phone was giving me turn by turn dirrections, which really helped. When we arrived it was 9:30 pm. We reserved a king bed and a crib, we get there they dont have such room, its either a king and no crib or 2 fulls and the crib. I explained to her that the person I spoke to said they could make that happen (since they could move the cribs) and she said that the person informed me incorrectly and they are not allowed to move the cribs since they break easily. ( I was not very happy about this) We got our room, unloaded the car and I had to make a bottle for my son so I needed to heat the water and when I go to the front desk they were closing up. I asked the lady if she could heat the water for me and she said, \"you should have told me a few minutes ago, I am leaving now\" (which no one ever told me that when I called and I made it very clear that I was going to be arriving late in the evening.) (The person checking me in didnt even tell me she was going to be closing up.) There was another guy there (the security guy) and he asked her to open the office so that I could use the microwave and she hessitated to the exted that I asked her to foget about it). I was very upset about this because its for a baby. When we get to the room and I am unpacking I realize that both beds have mouse dropings on them and it is all over the floor. The crib also had dropings and a CONDOM!!!! (WHAT????) I gave it to the person who had checked us in (who excorted us to the room) and she put it in her pocket and appologized.) I didnt think it could get worst but......the AC didnt work (turned on but wouldnt blow cold air), there was no water coming from the sink or the shower, the beds were hard and dirty. We wanted to leave but there was no other hotel available in proximity. We couldnt change rooms since there was no one in the office. We left around 8 am the next day and the person that was there the night befor explained we should have let her know before about the water and that next time we travel we need to always what time the office closes (they should have let me know when I first called) I was so happy to be out of there I didnt bother letting her know that I had let them know.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Paso, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBELIEVE US,DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY\u201d", "Author": "pepo63", "ReviewID": "UR115106424", "Content": "we change rooms from 108 to 215 because the hotel conditions were disgusting.no water service,towels,dirty rooms and bad attention from the personnel.i talked with a female how had to lift to get a shower in her house.if you dont believe send me a email to let you know more about it.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cDestination Oasis\u201d", "Author": "Tooqt", "ReviewID": "UR114689390", "Content": "Though this place is a bit of a drive to reach - once there, you realize why you chose to come.

While the hotel was clean, the service was friendly, the grounds were pretty, everything was just kind of bland. We decided not to eat at the restaurant because there was absolutely no one else eating there. That being said, it was a Wednesday night at the end of the high tourist season. We asked the owner if there were any other places nearby to eat. When she said no we thought she was just giving us the brush off. However, after driving around in the dark for almost an hour and finding nothing but a pizza place to eat at, we concluded that she was quite right. When we got back to our room we noticed that our shower was leaking and when I tried to turn it off, the water came on full blast and I could not turn it off. I see by a few other reviews that this has happened before. I went to the office to tell the owner and a few minutes later the maintenance man showed up. He spoke no English and I tried in my limited Spanish to explain what had happened. Quite comical really. He ended up taking the shower head off and putting a temporary shut-off valve on it. It continued to drip throughout the night but we just shut the bathroom door and couldn't hear it. Since we had already taken showers earlier that night we got a lot of humor out of the situation. While this place wasn't the best, it could have been much worse and it's one of the very few hotels at this end of the island.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cStay Away!\u201d", "Author": "Seasoned_Traveler04", "ReviewID": "UR7989002", "Content": "To make a long story short, we ended up having to do our own plumbing.

I opted to stay at this hotel because I wanted to show them the \"real\" Puerto Rico instead of all the tourist stuff up in San Juan. 1st the hotel charges your credit card way in advance for your first night then when you check in, they charge you for the remainder of the nights. I thought that was quite odd. When we got to our rooms, the two beds were tiny. They weren't twins, but I don't think they were full either. The beds were hard as rocks. I did complain and the owner did go to Wal-mart and bought a cushion for the top of the bed. The shower head did not work and the entrance door lock kept getting stuck making it very difficult to get in and out. The balcony light was out. Everything was fixed or replace except the balcony light. I complained on more than one occassion about the light and got nowhere. The restaurant food and prices was a JOKE. The food was bland and expensive. I'm not the greatest cook, but I could do 100% better. Also, in July, it get's dark at 7:30 and since this hotel is in the \"hills\", there really isn't much to do after 7:30. The pool opens at 8 AM (joke because days it opened at 8:30 & 9:00) and closes at 7:00. In my opinion, 7:00 is way too early to close the pool especially if the hotel is supposed to cater to familes. The basketbal court and tennis court was a great idea but everytime we went to get the balls and rackets, someone already checked them out even though I check and I saw no one at the courts. The swing set was cute for the children 6 & under. It was a a metal swing set you buy at walmart. Two seats were broken & only 1 of the two got fixed. Now, let me tell you about one riduculous rule that really had me confused. You are not allowed to eat in the rooms. Uhh, then why do they offer fridges in the room? That's an oxymoron. The hotel staff is gone at 10:00PM. You cannot get anyone at the front desk after that time. The straw that broke the camels back was when they checked us out 1 day early. We were supposed to check out on Sunday and they had us down for checking out on Saturday. Orginally we were supposed to check out on Saturday, but I called the hotel and changed the reservation. The receptionist confirmed it was changed and even told me the price difference. Obviously, whoever changed it did not change it on the computer. I received a phone call on my cell Saturday around 4:00 pm asking me why is my stuff still in the rooms. I went back and forth with the owner and she did offer to find us another hotel becuase her hotel was full. She also stated that the other people who are waiting for our room, was already there. Total lie becuase when I went to check out, the receptionist told us no one was there to check in yet. The owner saw us walk in, and she dissapeared. Luckily I have friends that live not too far from where we were staying so we were able to crash there for our last night in Puerto Rico. Overall, my experience was not horrible becuase let's face it, Puerto Rico is paradise. I do not recommend this hotel if you are looking for something to do after 7:00 pm. Also, not highly recommened if you have kids. This hotel is more for the locals who want to travel and experience different parts of the island. One or two days at this hotel is more than enough. Also, the beach is not as near at they say it is. It's down a hill and accross the street. The beach is pebble and there is way to much coral and seagrass in the water.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice place, good food and good rates\u201d", "Author": "madambaseball", "ReviewID": "UR4602601", "Content": "My husband and I traveled to southern PR for business and found this beautiful hotel w/ a great view, tasty food and terrific service.

At first we had to request more towels and wash cloths, but after that, everything was fine. The light bulbs in the room were a bit too dim and the door lock was feeble, but all in all, we enjoyed the veranda outside the restaurant very much, and spent a lot of time there in casual conversation with the owners who were very nice to us and whom I found to be quite personable. For instance, after witnessing me scratching my ankles, one of the owners got me some cortisone cream; when we left faced with the possibility of being stranded at the airport due to the East Coast snowstorm, she recommended hotels in San Juan and told us to relay that she sent us; when I inquired about the ingredients in the hot corn cereal, she went to the kitchen to fetch the package for me. Although I've given a four-star review, I'd amend that to 3-1/2 if given the choice. The owners are seeking to improve the paradore every year and plan to add a children's activity room in the future in addition to other capital improvements.
