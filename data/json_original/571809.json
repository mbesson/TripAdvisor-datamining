From the hotel, there are magnificent views out over Tokyo Bay. The hotel lies within easy walking distance of Shimbashi station, and so benefits from extensive public transport connections. The Ginza district lies around 15 minutes away by foot, and the Tsukiji fish market is around 10 minutes away. The hotel's beds are very firm, and were as a result perfect for me. The room sizes are very generous by Tokyo standards. The showers were excellent. Five stars and a bonus star for the cute bathtub duck offered as a free souvenir.So, what's not to like? The prices reflect the market positioning of the hotel (5 star), and, to my tastes, the hotel and its environs are somewhat sterile. The service is very good, but not up to the level of old standbys like the Okura and the Imperial. This is, I think, the result of a conscious decision to have a more Western approach to service levels (e.g., no kimono-clad elevator operators). The hotel's design is so similar to other hotels built in Tokyo over the past 15 years (e.g., the Four Seasons in Marunouchi) that we joked about possible confusion. Bottom line: a good choice for price-insensitive travellers who do not mind a highly Westernized atmosphere.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR169046390", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Andlovingit"}, {"Content": "Modern and contemporary       Egg benedict", "Date": "Oct 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR626416180", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "aluminum_akiko"}, {"Content": "fantastic I stayed at the Conrad Tokyo for about 4 days in February for a business trip -- and had a fantastic experience. The guestroom, amenities, on-site restaurants and service at all levels (front desk, valets, housekeeping, wait staff) were wonderful.

The photos that have already been uploaded to the site here are accurate. The layout of the room is great -- there is a place for everything so while the room at first glance may look bare -- upon closer inspection, you'll find all these inconspicuous little containers that keep everything clean, neat and out of sight! The location was also great. I was able to take the subway from right outisde the hotel and go by myself (and i don't speak or read a word of Japanese) to other parts of the city for sightseeing and shopping.

We took the Airport Limousine from Narita, which is a very comfortable bus that goes directly to the Conrad (and a few other nearby hotels) for 3000 yen (appx $30). You are then directed inside a downstairs lobby which leads to an elevator to go to the real lobby on the 28th floor (above offices), with a great view of Tokyo Bay. After everyone bowing to me, I was directed to the check-in desk. As an HH Gold, I was upgraded to a beautiful room on the 31st floor overlooking the bay and park but denied lounge access. However my wife and I were given vouchers for breakfast in the restaurant--a nice buffet which they priced at 2800 yen to those who had to pay. The room was ultra modern and spacious with so many bells and whistles that it took some time to figure it all out. Large shower, a 37 wide-screen TV, and upscale bathroom amenities. Two free computers in the unstaffed business center adjacent to the lobby. Service was terrific. However prices are high should you choose to have dinner or drink there. Great location--very close to Shiodome subway stop; connected to the Shiodome ultra-modern office complex which has many moderately priced restaurants (which we used) along with a Starbucks, convenience store, and other small shops.

The hotel is luxurious and was mostly very enjoyable, but note a few issues below.We had room 3234 (king bed) which had the city view of other large skyscarpers, and not much beyond. I think the odd-numbered rooms have the great views of the harbor and park below, which is the nicer view. With points, I didn't want to argue, but my husband is a silver platinum Hilton member, so we hoped for better. This status at least got us free use of the pool, where there is normally a surcharge (as with many business class-and-better hotels in Japan.) There was also a relatively small discount at the hotel's restaurants, small given the expense of a typical (but very good) dinner.First the good stuff: The room was very quiet, but all of them probably are at this height. The heat and AC controls worked quietly and well.The rooms are very spacious with good storage in the closet and drawers. Very comfortable beds and lots of pillows, and there is an additional pillow menu. Essentially, there was a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows with a wall-to-wall banquette that was great for relaxing. Spotless housekeeping and evening turn-down service. Good-size flat screen TV and wireless internet connection ($15 surcharge, which I always find annoying if htels charge these prices.) Modern, Asian-inspired decor in neutral tones. Complimentary in-room tea and press coffee service. There is also a table-top ironing board and iron, which was the only time I found this amenity in my 20-or-so days in Japan at business class hotels. Other amenities are what you expect at this level: complimentary water bottles, a small box of chocolates, etc.There are all kinds of technology in the room to close blinds and curtains, turn on nightlights in the bathroom, etc. However, the set-up for internet connection could be better as this required sitting at a round table, and the chair heights and wall connections are not the easiest.The bathroom was also very spacious, with separate walk-in shower and deep bathtub. A nice range of toiletries custom-blended by Sheseido for the hotel: shampoo, conditioner, and bath gel, although the moisturizer is a watery formula that is messy to try to apply (should be re-worked.) All the other bath amenities are also here for this class of hotel, i.e. toothbrush, razor, etc.Some irksome things: The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a glass wall. While this makes the bathroom nice and light-filled during the day, the slatted blind that hides the bathroom does not block the bathroom light well. This meant that when I woke up earlier in the morning than my husband, I could not turn on the bathroom light without throwing a lot of light into the bedroom, and waking him up. (The blackout curtains on the outside windows work VERY well.) This meant that other than washing up by nightlight, I could not do much if I was going to be courteous to my husband.Also irksome and bizarre: the clock in the bedroom ticked very loudly. We moved it to the bathroom. Considering all the quiet, digital clocks I've seen in hotel rooms, WHY was this here? Did no one from management ever spend the night in this hotel room?I am also losing patience with the global trend toward heavy duvets where you have to really crank up the air-conditioning to be comfortable at night. I know the many reasons for this change, but we always ask for lighter blankets (which all the hotels have, but insist on putting the big fluffy things on first.) Since most in this style do not have additional single top sheets, it's the only way to survive without super-cooling the room to traditional Alpine termperatures.The free-access computers in the lobby are atrocious: the slowest I have experienced in a very long time (and remember: I had just traveled through Japan and stayed at hotels like the Nikko and Granvia, and their connections were excellent.) And again, there is that pesky internet connection charge in the room ($15 for 24 hours -- nominal, but stills feels like nickel-and-diming. The Nikko and Granvia in various locations have free in-room internet connections.)Even more bizarre: the concierges had to share these lounge computer printers with the guests -- they did not have their own available!! This meant that if they wanted to print something out for you, they had to wait for a computer to be free, and you were competing with them for computer time!!!The concierges were excellent, especially Daniel (I think) from Australia. The problem as that concierges were often not on duty, (or at the computer printer?) For example, the concierge did not come on duty until 10:30 on Sunday, and I often did not see anyone at the desk later in the evening. In a pinch, we relied on the check-in desk people, and they were helpful, but not of the same caliber of a good concierge. For example, when we had a question one night, we were given some information by the check-in staff when the concierge was not around. When we asked the same question of the concierge the next day, we got much better information, a brochure we had asked for (but the desk people could not find,) etc. At a Conrad, I expect real concierges who are more readily available.Also: ask specifically for the brochure from the Tokyo tourism board that should double-page information for each Tokyo neighborhood. Unlike the service I expect from other hotels, many of the staff only respond to specific questions, and operate on a need-to-know basis. Again, Daniel was the exception in trying to think about our larger travel needs.The restaurants and lounges in the hotel are quite expensive, but what can one expect when there is an on-site Gordon Ramsey restaurant, and the Chinese restaurant is Michelin rated? Drinks in the lounge are expensive, but they come with a spectacular view of the harbor that is also popular with the locals, so it is hard to compare this to grabbing a drink at a hole-in-the-wall. There is often a singer and accompaniest in the evening. However, this also makes it hard to sit anywhere in the evening that doesn't require the purchase of a drink, other than a bench by the check-in desk.We only dined at the Chinese restaurant, China Blue - expensive, but very good food, in a handsome room, and with the view. The hotel sits in a complex of offices and a subway station, with another subway station nearby. We went to the various coffee shops in this complex for breakfast (Starbuck's, Vie the France, etc.) There are also a number of casual restaurants here that service the workforce in the office buidlings, even in the evening. There are also a variety of convenience stores, bookstores, Mister Minute shoe repair in teh subway station, etc.The underground subway complexes can be confusing, but we got the hang of how to guide to our destination by focusing on the name of the building complex near the Conrad. If you want to walk to the Ginza (hardly 10 minutes,) it is probably less confusing to use the above-ground walkway. Ask Daniel.We found the subway the easiest way to get around for most trips, especially during the day when traffic gets congested. The famous fish market is only one stop away on the subway line nearest the hotel, and other notable stops -- the Mitsukoshi department store, like Tokyo's Harrods, has its own station. The other nearby subway lines were handy for other reasons and sightseeing.Finally, the service throughout the hotel was generally quite good and efficient, and very courteous.So: this was overall an enjoyable stay, but it is worth checking other locations and hotels, given the price of this hotel and some of the things that could be improved.Sooner I or later I will also post hotel reviews for other parts of our trip -- mostly Nikko and Granvia hotels.", "Date": "Jul 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR619810121", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Mme_X"}, {"Content": "Exceptional high-end business hotel       View of hotel from Hamarikyu gardens", "Date": "Jul 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR486091572", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kimmiechong3151"}, {"Content": "Nice, new hotel Located in the upper floors of a tower, the Conrad Tokyo offers spectacular views of Tokyo.

I generally avoid the Executive floor simply because the rooms cost more but it doesn't actually offer anything additional except access to the Executive lounge (which is a good place for a small breakfast but is otherwise not very meaningful).

Further, if you are Hilton Honors Gold or Diamond member, you also can receive free breakfast vouchers, making a very good deal an even better deal. We stayed five nights at the Conrad Tokyo on Honors points, were upgraded to a garden / bay / ocean view room and given breakfast vouchers. This is a much better way to use Honors points than 20,000 a night for a suburban Hampton Inn!The hotel is fantastic. The service was impeccable. The 28th floor lobby is a bit overwhelming in terms of scale and the views over the bay to Odaiba and the Rainbow Bridge. The rooms are very spacious, and high tech. In fact, for the same points per night as the Hilton Tokyo, my read of the two hotels' web sites is that the Conrad rooms are 60% larger. The rooms feature floor to ceiling windows with electronically operated blinds and curtains. The bathroom is spacious as well, with a separate walk in shower and toilet stall. That way, you can keep the blind between the bathroom and room open and still have privacy. Of course, that blind opens electronically as well!The breakfast area is very well laid out - there is much more to it than you will see while walking from the lobby to the elevator bank. There is a very good breakfast buffet and hot breakfasts are 850 yen more than the buffet (the vouchers pay for the buffet value only).We were very pleased with the hotel service as well. They were helpful in making our return airport limousine bus reservations, in making dinner reservations and directing us to various stores in the surrounding area. About the only niggling complaints I would have about the hotel are two. First, there is a very nice reading light by the window sofa, but we could not figure out how to turn out other room lights and leave only that on - which would have been a great option when one of us could not sleep due to jet lag. The second is that to call ATT USA Direct, I had to go through a hotel operator at a rate of 36 yen per minute. We probably could have bought a cheaper prepaid phone card on a Japanese network, but did not bother for the little use we had for making international calls. If you were traveling on business, this would be something to consider.The hotel is well situated. The Hama-rikyu gardens are across the street. The Tsukiji fish market would appear to be within walking distance (although we did not go there - at any rate it is one subway stop away on the Oedo line). The Ginza strip on Chuo Dori is about a 15 minute walk. The hotel is well situated for public transport as well. The Oedo line is outside the front door, down an escalator (with motion sensors and voice warnings to hold the hand rail!) and then about a 100 foot walk to the station entrance. The Yurikamome line to Odaiba is out the front door, up an escalator and immediately on your left. There are above ground and underground pedestrian walkways to the JR Shimbashi station, which also has subway stops on the Asakusa and Ginza lines. From the JR Shimbashi station, one can board the loop Yamanote line. Shimbashi is two stops south of Tokyo station, terminus for various Shinkansen (aka bullet train) lines. Oddly, while one can walk above ground and below ground, one cannot walk at ground level - there is no pedestrian crosswalk at the corner of the hotel! If you don't want to eat at the hotel, there are plenty of restaurants of all cuisine varieties and price ranges within walking distance, including several on the 41st and 42nd floors of the Shiodome City Center building, with excellent views. We particularly enjoyed the Vie de France in the basement of the Shiodome City Center building. There is a Seven Bank with an ATM that takes US ATM network cards on the 1st basement level of the Caretta Shiodome building as well. By the way, for a helpful map of the Shiodome area for your first day or two in the area, check the Caretta Shiodome web site for a downloadable pdf english map.

The hotel itself is okay and the rooms are comfortable and clean. Amenities are more than satisfactory and beds are nice.Now the problems: Some staff seem to lack attention where it counts the most. A lot of hotel staff float around the hotel, but they are not really helpful at all when you need their help. Which leads to the biggest problem, the Gordon Ramsay restaurant: The food is actually pretty good (although I think the New York restaurant was honestly one notch better). However beware because, the service is very, very slow. The waiting staff try to act courteous, but really lack attentiveness. When we had lunch there, we ordered their recommended courses, but our finished plates were left on the table for over ten minutes, dessert took 30 minutes to arrive, and another 20 minutes for coffee. This is unacceptable in a busy city like Tokyo where guests would like to enjoy the atmosphere, but not spend the whole afternoon there. (We had to delay an important appointment afterwards.) But, the real killer was that during our lunch, the waiting staff were extremely courteous and prompt to their OWN hotel staff - as we watched a manager of the hotel who was dining some friend, arrive later, receive better service and finish eating much earlier than we did! I understand that the waiting staff would like to get on the good side of their boss, but this should not happen at the expense of other guests getting delays in their service. I consider that unacceptable and this really annoyed us. So my recommendation: the rooms are nice so you'll enjoy your stay, but if you are going to eat lunch or dinner and need prompt service, eat outside the hotel.", "Date": "Jan 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR885928006", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "GlobalFoodie"}, {"Content": "One of the Best in the World!

Overall, it was a great hotel -- new and very modern, beautiful, excellent location, with fantastic service, especially on the executive floor.First, the rooms. They are quite large and well-appointed. The ceilings are approx. 12 feet high and the rooms are very open, with floor to ceiling windows and a glass wall between bathroom and bedroom. This creates a feeling of openness and spaciousness. Furnishings are beautiful and high quality, and the technology such as large-screen TV and cordless phones are convenient.In my two stays, I had one room on the executive level, and one on the standard levels. Apart from slightly different color scheme, and that the executive level is on the top floor (floor 37, whereas others are on 30-36), there was *no difference* between the rooms. If you're thinking about the executive level to get a better or larger room, don't bother.However, the executive level was well worth it for me for other reasons: breakfast service, evening drinks, and fantastic concierge service literally next door. The food was quite good, including fresh fruit, pastries, and omelets cooked to order. I thought it was just as good as breakfast buffet in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant downstairs and was much more convenient.It was the executive level service that truly stood out. I got sick one day and my wife had to to travel around Tokyo by herself for the first time. The concierge gave her extensive directions and maps and made her feel very good about her outings -- which turned out to be completely successful. Not only were we warmly greeted each time we visited the lounge, I was even called by name the first time I appeared there! Very, very classy and professional service, which made us feel right at home.I had one room on the city side, and one on the ocean/view side. There were pros and cons of each. Pro of the ocean side was a great view of the water, park, modern buildings on Odaiba, etc. Con was early morning sun (facing east), less of a feeling of being in Tokyo (dense city not so apparent), and some noise from motorcycles in freeway tunnels at night. Pro of city side was more of a view of Tokyo, no traffic noise (a little bit of rumbling train noise instead), and no morning sun. Con was that most of the view was of three big buildings next door. Between them, I preferred the ocean view, while my wife preferred city.The fitness center was very nice and not busy. My wife used it several times and was very happy. With Hilton Gold membership (and maybe with an executive level room?) it was free. As for the Hilton Gold, the advantage was primarily to get into the fitness center. On our first stay (normal rooms) we were also upgraded to an ocean side room. On our second stay (executive level), there was no additional benefit from Gold membership apart from fitness center.As for location, others have commented, so I will merely add to that by encouraging people to use the public transportation, especially the subway system. The subways are not very difficult, once you realize one fact: the Toei lines (e.g., Toei Oedo, which goes to the Shiodome station at the hotel) and the Metro lines (e.g., Ginza line) are separate. You will need to either stay on one system, or buy a transfer ticket, or -- and this is what I highly recommend -- buy a 1000 yen 1 day open ticket that is good on both systems. Once you have the open ticket, you can ride freely around both systems for less than the cost of a single cab ride. JR lines (commuter/light rail) are another matter. Once you feel comfortable with the subway (which has a lot of English posted), go ahead and try JR. Be warned, though, that you will need to get tickets for a specific fare (or adjust the fare at your arrival station), and most of the fare charts are only in Japanese. It's not difficult to figure out IF you have a map that shows both English and Japanese/kanji names. I recommend the Tokyo City Atlas for that. However, until you feel pretty comfortable with the more basic subway system, I'd recommend to skip JR for local travel.Back to the hotel -- what are the annoyances? First is that some of the design features demonstrate form over function; they are beautiful but don't really work all that well. There were lots of such things: scalloped sinks that bounce water all over the counter; glass shower enclosure that leaked water through the seam; remote control drawer whose lid closed with difficulty and slammed shut loudly; toilet controls hidden down (for city-side room) on the left hand side where they were hard to reach; a *very* loudly ticking alarm clock that I hid in the closet; and so forth. Second is that the hotel was very, very quiet on the inside but picked up a modest but noticeable amount of external noise. I've mentioned that above: freeway noise on the ocean side, and train noise on the city side. To be fair, the noise was muted and minor -- not enough to keep us awake, but enough to notice. Ear plugs would no doubt eliminate it. We also had to hide the ticking alarm clock.Third annoyance was Internet access: they do not provide an Ethernet cable and the wireless was locked down. If you don't have an Ethernet cable, they charge 2000 yen to buy one! That's not a big deal, but it's silly and seems cheap on their part. Come on, this is a luxury hotel. Why do they charge for a LAN cable?! As for wireless, it was encrypted but they didn't provide the WEP key (and asking didn't help). They claim that a cookie will unlock it after using the LAN (and paying for the cable). As an IT person, that doesn't even make sense (cookies have nothing to do with WEP encryption), and I was never able to get WiFi to work. Conrad: give folks LAN cables! I've only ever had to pay for one at a cheesy, low-priced business hotel, never at any place with more than 2 stars (except here).In short, great hotel. I'd gladly stay there again, especially in the executive level. I wouldn't say it's my personal favorite in Tokyo (I have a small preference for the New Otani's remodeled rooms) but it's top-notch and happily recommended.", "Date": "Nov 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR629377443", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "cnchapman"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Conrad Just returned from six days in this fantastic hotel.The standards were top notch,great service,great rooms.

I stayed for 2 nights at the Conrad in Ginza, not knowing what to expect because I have not read any of the reviews here. I have been trying out the hotels in Hilton/Conrad range and this hotel is definitely right up there in their line up. Finding the hotel can be a bit of a struggle at first because some of the taxi drivers in Tokyo do not even know where it is located probably because it is a new boy on the block. But once you get used to the train system, you will find that it is very conveniently located next to Shiodome station and if you use the Uedo line you could get to the many shopping districts such as Roppongi and Shinjuku easily. The Tsukiji fish market is in fact within walking distance and as are the fabulous shops in Ginza.The lobby of the hotel is located on the 28th floor and what a grand lobby it is with a high ceiling and tasteful modern/zen interiors. From the tall windows of the hotel bar which is just in front of the reception area, you get a priceless view of Tokyo Bay. The staff will make you feel like a VIP with their attentive and proficient service. What others have described in this section about the rooms is entirely true. I stayed in a deluxe room but it is of such a generous size and tres plush! Modular designer sofas line the entire window side where you can relax and enjoy the breathtaking views. The king sized bed is so comfortable I slept in after breakfast (which they delivered to the room at no extra charge) and could not drag myself out of bed until 5 pm! And the toilet is tres chic. I loved that large circular mirror with very flattering light at its perimeter. It makes you look like you are ready for your close up. Try out the toiletries which are exclusively made by Shiseido for the Conrad Tokyo. After a shower your skin will feel smooth like a baby's bottom. You can't purchase any of these commercially but you can get them from the hotel shop at a phenominal cost of US$40. So if you are smart, ask for extras from housekeeping.I did not try out the 2 Gordon Ramsey's restaurants because I was more interested in trying out the Japanese cuisine. Dinner at the Japanese restaurant was exquisite but you will definitely need deep pockets. Just 2 small stumps of barbequed matsutake mushrooms would cost you about US$300.Try out the swimming pool and the sauna. The jacuzzi comes in individual tubs where you can treat yourself to a private refreshing hydro-massage. The design for the fitness centre where these are located is zen yet quite stunning in its beauty. It feels as though you are approaching some retreat. And even service at the fitness centre is exemplary and so polite. They will give you soft Conrad slippers to replace your footwear (as if you are at an Onsen). They thank you for using the facilities when you finish swimming and when you depart. I could use these facilities for free as I am a Gold Hilton Honors member, otherwise a fee is imposed for use of the facilites (which is apparently common practice in the hotels in Japan).I recommend this hotel highly. My only regret was to check out to switch hotels to Park Hyatt Shinjuku after staying 2 nights. The minute I checked into the Hyatt, I realised what I had missed. Even the Park Hyatt which costs 50% more than the Conrad (and with no breakfast!) is nothing but hype and fairly dissappointing. The Tokyo Conrad is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in, and I have tried so many luxury hotels in so many continents.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR314064053", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lieblingsg"}, {"Content": "WORLD CLASS HOTEL I must admit I was a little surprised at the lack of reviews of this Hotel before I stayed here - it has very few compared with the MO or the Park Hyatt and I\u9225\u6a93 sure that this has something to do with it present ranking.However, having just returned from a 6 night trip I know now why there is a lack of reviews.

On the other side of the hotel are the Hamarikyu Royal Gardens \u9225?here you can also get a water bus to Asakusa.I stayed in an Exec room which has all the class and sophistication you would expect from a 5* deluxe Hotel. Rain shower, inspirational views, outstanding service, excellent range of toiletries and a huge room by Japanese standards.The room also gave access to the Exec Lounge which served Breakfast, which included hot and cold options, Afternoon Tea and Canapes and Drinks in the evening. The choice of Canapes changed every night we were there and the range of drink covered everything from champagne to beer.We met people in the lounge who had been coming to Japan for 30 years and had stayed in all the top City hotels - Hyatt, Four Seasons and said that the Conrad is now the best hotel in Tokyo.The restaurant choices here are outstanding. Gordon Ramsay has 2 restaurants, the casual Cerise where we ate the evening we arrived and the more formal Ramsay by Gordon Ramsay. There is also a Chinese restaurant - China Blue \u9225?which had the most dramatic setting of any restaurant we ate in (including the overpriced Park Hyatt American Grill where every other table seemed to be celebrating a birthday with all the candle blowing and singing that ensued- we counted 7 when we ate there).
