We were upgraded to a corner King room that was huge, perfect for adding a crib and a rollaway. We had a lovely view of the bay and ample room for the boys to spread out and play. They brought us a refridgerator and the crib and rollaway within 20 minutes of our request. They also gave our boys a backpack with lots of fun stuff. We enjoyed the heated pool and jacuzzi before heading down to McCormick and Schmick's for a happy hour dinner, which was also fantastic. We came back after a fun walk in the Gaslamp District and put the boys in the huge bathtub and headed to bed. The bed was comfy and despite the noise from the trains we got a great nights sleep. One thing that we did note was that the central air system was soooo quiet. My husband loves to have the air on all night and in other hotels it wakes me up everytime it turns on, not at the Omni.

The hotel is modern, stylish and has a solid feeling of quality all around. The rooms are standard size, well appointed and have great bathrooms with fabulous showers (no tubs in our standard room type). We were staying with our child, so we opted for the two beds/room option. Unfortunately, the Omni uses doubles rather than queens, so the sleeping arrangements were tight for my wife and I. The comment in the title of this review refers to the horrific location of the Omni immediately next to the railroad tracks. Each train (and there are MANY on a daily basis) sounds its horn repeately as it approaches each intersection (and there are MANY intersections), so be prepared to hear a series of loud horn blasts roughly every 30 minutes in the evening and night hours - apparently sounding the horn is not obligatory during the daytime. The hotel actually provides two free pairs of earplugs in the nightstand drawer, anticipating that you will need them! The concierge said the city is working on making the Gaslamp District a quiet zone for rail traffic, but who knows when that will be enacted (if ever). To be fair, not only the Omni suffers from this noise issue - about 80% of the hotels in the area of the convention center are adjacent to the tracks. So be prepared for a bad nights sleep unless you can ignore a freight train passing within 20 yards of the hotel! The restaurant of the hotel was quite good for both breakfast and dinner, and in our opinions reasonably priced for the quality. The staff was attentive, courteous and helpful. Overall the Omni experience met our expectations, with the only detraction being the proximity to the tracks.

The staff was very attentive from the front desk letting us check in early to the valet getting us a taxi, or the concierge offering us information on the area and discounted tickets to the zoo. Their fitness center was amazing and the massage I got there was one of the best I have ever had. There was a Starbucks in the lobby that closed around 7 or 8 p.m. so if you needed water, soda or a little something to eat you had to access the mini-bar ($7.00 for a bottle of water or $4 for a can of soda) or order room service. I thought this was a little outrageous, but I suppose that is what I should expect at an upscale downtown hotel. The strange thing was that showering around 7 a.m. meant getting lukewarm water, when any other times of the day it was perfectly hot. Also the bathroom had shutter style doors that did not lock and two small shutters that opened into the room, leaving little in the way of privacy. My husband also commented on the TV not being a flat screen, that didn\u2019t concern me too much but most places do have large flat screens nowadays.

We stayed for 2 nights in December (over the new year) as part of a week-long California vacation. After much research I settled on the Omni and it met my expectations in almost all areas, though fell a wee bit short in a couple. Pros: \u2022 Great location at the bottom end of the Gaslamp \u2022 Good value (premier double queen) -- The 1st night was only $159 as part of their Say No To Snow promotion (free valet; complimentary margaritas; Macy\u2019s coupon \u2013 which, technically I could have got on my own; bottle of sunscreen was also advertised, which I never got, though didn\u2019t ask for); the 2nd night I paid their $219 internet rate \u2022 First rate service \u2013 check-in staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful; when making my reservations I requested a fridge for the room and it was already set up and plugged in when we arrived; also, I knew about the SNTS promotion, but couldn\u2019t get the rate online since the promotion didn\u2019t apply to new year\u2019s eve which overlapped our stay \u2013 I called the hotel\u2019s front desk directly and the manager was extremely helpful in ensuring the promotional rate applied to my first night \u2022 Two views from our corner room #2033 -- Direct view into Petco stadium and (slightly less nice!) the city/train-yard/part of Coronado bridge; having paid extra for a premier room it would have been nicer to have a water view (which I requested when making my reservations) -- a view of the stadium is cool, but in December when baseball is in the off-season, it's really not much of a bonus \u2022 Decently-sized room that fit: 2 queen beds; a TV armoire (with 5 drawers and, yes, no flat screen but the quality was good and lots of channels); office desk and chair; reading chair \u2022 Bathroom: Very spacious with a good-sized tub/shower; 2 robes; lots of shelf space and towels (including 2 bathmats, nice touch \u2013 who doesn\u2019t hate standing on a soaking wet bathmat?!); good toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, vanity kit, sewing kit\u2014soap but no shower gel); hair dryer \u2022 Other room amenities: Full-length mirror and mirror over the desk (nice touch for natural sunlight when putting on make-up since the bathroom doesn\u2019t have a window); single-pod coffee maker; turndown service; large closet with ample hangers; laptop-sized safe; 2 luggage racks (which I loved, often you only get one) \u2022 Nice little touches \u2013 cookies at the concierge desk, iced water in the lobby, bottled water in the car through the valet service \u2022 Omni guest membership \u2013 free wifi (decent connection); up to two free beverages per guest per day (including freshly squeezed orange juice) \u2013 this was definitely a great perk! \u2022 Nice gym \u2013 The view of the parking garage is nothing to write home about, but the gym itself was very sunny and quite spacious with about 4 elliptical machines, 4-5 running machines, a recumbent bike, weights; nice little touches included free headsets to use with the running machines; a TV; free iced water and fruit; lots of towels \u2022 Outdoor pool \u2013 Since it was December we didn\u2019t use it, but I could see how it would be a great place to spend time in the summer; there was also a hot-tub and several rooms with patios that opened directly onto the pool deck \u2022 Parking: Since valet was included only the first night we did the self-park the second night which was quite reasonable; the covered garage is a 5-second walk across the street and I ended up paying $17 which was likely an inflated price given it was new year\u2019s eve ($12 overnight parking, then an hourly rate starting the next morning \u2013 we were checked out by around 10am) Cons: \u2022 Noise: I requested a quiet room, and for all I know #2033 may have been one of the quieter rooms as it was on a high floor; however, on the first night it was quite noisy from what must have been one of the neighbouring hotels or bars \u2013 sounded like there was an outdoor club with an MC egging the crowd on and cheering \u2013 this didn\u2019t go on all night, but was annoying and somewhat unexpected; also, there indeed are train tracks below, and occasionally I would hear the odd train go by \u2013 being on a high floor it wasn\u2019t unbearable and I was expecting some train noise, but want to highlight this for the light sleepers out there \u2022 While the room overall was great, just a couple of small little touches would have made it better: (1) Lighting \u2013 nice and sunny during the day since we had a corner room, but at night there is no overhead lighting so you are relying basically on table lamps and the room is actually quite dark which made reading difficult, (2) a ceiling fan and more hooks in the bathroom would have been great as there weren\u2019t a lot of options for hanging towels, robes, etc. Would I stay here again? Absolutely! For the level of accommodation and service I feel the Omni offers good value. I don\u2019t feel it quite warrants 5 stars given some of the noise challenges and minor annoyances to the room that could be easily addressed.

The location is prime, the service outstanding, and the accommodations very nice. The location is close to everything in downtown S. D. You can walk anywhere and if you're driving there is valet parking or the really handy parking lot right across the street from the hotel. You're right at the gate of Gaslamp Quarter, the historic district of downtown. You're also mere minutes from some great neighborhoods, like the mostly forgotten Little Italy (the largest in the country) and Balboa Park. Everyone from the valets to the front desk are very hospitable and friendly. There is a very handy McCormick and Schmicks inside the hotel, just off the lobby. They do a fine happy hour there with some good microbrews on tap. The views from most of the rooms (I've stayed here several times) are scenic, unless you're facing the rail yards. There is a light rail system outside the hotel that takes you to points beyond downtown, so that you don't have to deal with parking or traffic. And that brings me to my one caveat: the rail system. If you get a room too low to the ground facing the ocean, you may have troubles sleeping because of not only the light rail but the freight trains (the great offender) that come through the area regularly. If at all possible, snatch yourself one of the rooms on the higher floor and enjoy a little more quiet and a better view of downtown.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "golferinsf", "ReviewID": "UR122737771", "Content": "Stayed recently at Omni in downtown SD/gaslamp.

In fact the whole precinct seemed to be a mecca for baseball fans, Petco Park being the San Diego Padres' home ground. The proximity of the rail lines makes it very easy to get to the hotel by public transportation. I arrived on the Pacific Surfliner from LA at San Diego Union Station (the one with the famous 'Santa Fe' sign), jumped on the Orange Line trolley - a short train of light-rail vehicles running on railway tracks - and no more than ten or fifteen minutes later arrived at the Gaslamp Quarter stop which is virtually on the hotel's doorstep. Oddly, there is no train to the airport, but it was easy to get a cab there from the hotel's front entrance. The Gaslamp Quarter itself (the old downtown of New Town San Diego) has been reinvented in recent years as a glossy old-worlde restaurant/bar precinct seemingly popular with tourists and locals alike. If you become tired of eating out and crave fresh food, fruit and vegetables etc., there's the Ralphs grocery store a few blocks' walk to the north-west between Market and G Streets which the helpful front desk staff at the Omni directed me to. The immediate neighbourhood seems very neat, clean, orderly and safe (with the usual sensible precautions of course). It may be a tad glossy for travellers who are looking for a grittier urban experience, but heck, that's the Gaslamp! My room was on one of the upper levels and faced south. The view from the compact private balcony was pretty stupendous: the hotel pool directly below, then the rail ines (which I never tired of watching being something of a trainspotter - both the trolleys and 'heavy' freight trains run through here). Then, past the Hilton hotel and dockyard areas, the magnificent San Diego Bay and the Coronado Bridge. The changes in the view as the sun rises and sets are really something to see. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom well-appointed and the decor conservative and tasteful. I didn't notice any significant noise from within the hotel. Although other reviewers have commented on noise from the trains, it just blended into the general ambience for me and I slept well. The Omni struck me as pretty good value (incidentally, I got complimentary morning coffees through joining the loyalty program when booking online). It's certainly not 'budget' accommodation, and is more a business class-type place, but I'd stay there again.

The hotel is located right near a tram stop, so that was convenient if you choose to not rent a car. If you are just staying downtown, there was really no need to rent one b/c everything is within walking distance. All of the staff were very friendly, helpful, and went above and beyond to make you feel welcome. When we first got to our room on the 14th floor, I was kind of shocked to still see the old box style television. Not a big deal, but as a couple who travels a lot we haven't seen these in quite a while. Also, there was no ipod docking station/alarm clock which I have also come to expect. The first night, I was woken up at least 3 times by the tram sounding it's horn about 10 times at the tram stop located right near the hotel.It does this every time it stops! Even 14 floors up, it was loud! A staff member said they were in the process of passing a noise ordinance and told me that the location of my room (front of the building) was actually the best spot as far as blocking the noise. So we didn't even bother switching rooms! The rest of the nights we slept with the fan on, so that definitely helped and I was only woken up one other time from the tram horn. The room overall was clean and basic. Enough room for the bed, small table, and the piece of furniture that held the tv and mini bar. Mini bar prices were insane. You are better off not even taking the key! The bathroom was nice, and roomy but if you are traveling with someone don't expect any privacy. The bathroom door is a sliding door with tinted glass. There is a large gap around when it shuts. You can see right in through the gap from the desk area in the room. Shower pressure wasn't great, but certainly not the worst I've deal with. We tried McCormick & Schmicks one morning for breakfast, which was a little pricey ( I think about $14 for an average egg/toast/meat/hasbrown breakfast, and about $3 for a cup of coffee) but the breakfast was good, and it was a large portion. A better option is only a few blocks away at The Broken Yolk Cafe, where prices were a little bit more reasonable (about $9 for the same breakfast). The happy hour prices at McCormick and Schmicks were great, and it was nice to sit in the lobby and have a drink and some appetizers. When we got the bill at the end of our stay there were about $14/day more in charges than the quoted price online due to other fees, even though we were under the impression that the price we were quoted included all the taxes and fees. So make sure you get the total price quote up front. Overall, it was a nice place to stay but I think if we go back to San Diego we will probably choose another hotel that is a bit more updated.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston, ma", "Title": "\u201cGREAT LOCATION - GREAT QUALITY!\u201d", "Author": "betti14", "ReviewID": "UR121985143", "Content": "We came to San Diego on the day before Thanksgiving and left the day after - 2 nights at the Omni.

We had street parking the first night for free, and the second night $8 at the garage across the street. The hotel I believe is $32 but luckily we were able to get the other options easily. The hotel from the moment we got there til when we left was really great. The staff was excellent - they gave us a room overlooking the city, and which also looked into Petco Park. Being a baseball fan I really appreciated it! This hotel is attached to the park which is great during games, but didn't help us when we wanted to do a tour, we still had to go outside and around to the entrance of the park to enter. The room was nice - bathroom very modern - and beds comfortable. The gym was fully equipped, and the pool area was nice, though too cold to hang there the days we were there. No real view at the pool. Complimentary coffee in the lobby before 6am, then you have to pay at the coffee shop. We were so busy while there that we didn't get to spend a lot of time at the hotel, but I would have liked to use the pool and gym as they seemed great. For breakfast we got a quick bite at The Broken Yoke on 6th Ave. Spent the day at the Zoo and Safari Park, the next day at Petco Park doing a Tour, drive through Coronado Island, Quick ride to Tijuana (20 min ride), and then went to the USS Midway before heading to the airport early evening. Yes we did a lot, but there were no lines and no traffic to any of these places due to the holiday, so it we were able to do a lot. My only complaint was the front desk charged me for the large bottle of bottled water in the mini-bar - $9, which we never touched. I went downstairs and asked about it, and they immediately took off the charge. I just thought it was not a great thing to do to a guest when to assume they use the mini-bar without even checking. We got such a good rate for the hotel ($97 on hotels.com) that I didn't have a lot of complaints. It was an excellent value for what we got. The valet and concierge was super helpful, and I really felt like I was in the heart of everything. I would absolutely recommend. The Hard Rock next door looked very intriguing as well, and might try that place if I go back, but overall I think the Omni is the best value we could have gotten. We also looked at the Hilton Bayfront but I'm glad we chose Omni, it was closer to where we wanted to be (we had already done so much walking), and with the weather we wouldn't have been able to enjoy their signature waterfront pool anyway.

Let me tell you I did not stay here. I visited a friend when I was in town and we spent a great deal of time in and around the hotel. The hotel lobby doe nothing for this hotel. Yes it is nice and the front desk was very helpful, but I mean it when I say \u201cdon\u2019t judge a book \u2026...\u201d. What I noticed upon arrival and spending a great deal of time out front was the Valet service was extremely busy, maybe understaffed, and trying to ensure everything was taken care of. The problem was when they got a break in the incoming traffic, the ones and twos that came in received little to know attention. Several times I watched as elderly couples and families, unload their own cars, grab the luggage cart and fill it themselves, while several employees stood to the side (and yes they was an employee from the valet service, somewhere from inside and what appeared to be a bell hop \u2013 although I am not sure if they have them, perhaps it was another valet employee. This bothered me as at one point I felt compelled to assist an elderly woman getting out of a car as the employees stood around and conversed loudly. Given the benefit of doubt, maybe they were on break, but breaks should be done where customers are, otherwise it is not a break. My reasoning behind mentioning this is it happened several times. Moving on \u2013 Inside the hotel the facilities where nice, except I about fell out of my chair when I saw the Internet prices. I guess this is becoming the norm. But in their defense, they did allow you to pprint your boarding passes free, which my guess this day in age with the 3G/4G craze, it is all the hotel can do to make money from the Internet. Now for the rooms \u2013 Superb! Many times you find yourself in a large room with dated furniture or a small room with the latest and greatest fixtures, but the $600.00 lamp is in the corner with the 35 foot fake plant or in a place where a lamp would not matter. But these rooms were extremely well thought out in design and functionality. Many thanks to whom ever had the intuition to make a hotel room an experience, not a 70s basement room. Oh and the view, well look at the pictures I cannot do it justice. Lastly is the location. Just off the beaten path, this hotel is well placed and nestled off the strip. I recommend this hotel, regardless of the staff issues (everyone has their days, I know I have). Do let me add, this was my only issue with the staff as the remaining time I was there, they satisfied our every need. Thank you. I want to reiterate, I did not stay here but over the course of time, I was able to make a sound judgment on my thoughts of this hotel. In hindsight the amount of time I spent there, I should have just stayed the extra 3 hours and got a room.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best hotels of its type\u201d", "Author": "ADSOxford", "ReviewID": "UR120348367", "Content": "I have stayed here several times over the last few years and I will keep returning because this really is a fine hotel.

Within walking distances are scores of restaurants and shops to suit every taste and making it easy for a dine around or group off property dinner. The hotel is across the street from the San Diego Convention Center and next to a trolley station for those wanting to expand their San Diego experience. What\u2019s also nice is the hotel is only four miles from the international San Diego airport (which equates to about an approximate 14 minute ride and $15 cab fare). The hotel has easy valet access and drop off at the front of the hotel. This is especially nice as not all of the hotels in the Gaslamp area have this nice feature. The lobby is large, but not intimidating, with high ceilings and a nice sitting area. Adjacent to this area is a McCormick and Schmick\u2019s Restaurant (they also handle the in room dining). There are four large elevators to take guests to the 21 floors and an escalator to the large ballroom on the 4th level. The hotel also features a nice fitness center and a small pool area. On a practical side if you are staying at the Omni San Diego, it has 511 sleeping rooms averaging 360 square feet. My recommendation for the best view is to request the top floors as looking west you have a view of the bay and ocean (and Coronado Bridge) and looking east and north is a view of the city. Views from the lower floors are less impressive and you'll hear more of the noise from the trolley station, Petco baseball park or from the partying Gaslamp crowds.

Great workout room, friendly staff, and I loved the free breakfast brought right to our room. A couple of minor cautions: Omni is extremely stingy with their rewards program! They wouldn't give us any points for our stay because we got a \"group rate\". Thanks a bunch but you still charged us over $200 a night. They were polite about it, and it isn't the fault of the hotel itself, it is just extremely annoying. The other thing to watch out for is that the cab drivers here are exceptionally clueless and discourteous. You are really doing each of them (well, ALL the ones we used) a disservice by talking to them at all. I know that cabbies and their lack of customer service aren't the fault of the hotel.

I'll start out first with all the positive aspects of the hotel because there are so many. First off, we requested and received 2 connecting rooms. The rooms are a nice size, clean, and beautifully furnished. We also had a great view of the city, bay and convention center. The hotel is directly next to Petco Park with a bridge connecting the hotel and Park. This allows for in and out access throughout the game. Baseball fans will really love staying so close to the park. There is excitement in the air during home stays and you will see players in the hotel as well. At the pool you can hear the fans cheering and from the top floors you can catch a glimpse of the game from the hallway windows. There are endless dining options all within blocks of the hotel. You can find any type of food and choose a casual or more upscale option. The pool is fantastic and warm. The girls loved going for a swim each afternoon. The lounge chairs are comfortable and the wait staff is very friendly and attentive. The food and drinks by the pool are reasonably priced. The valet staff was fast retrieving our car and helpful with directions when needed. The doorman David was very friendly and always willing to offer directions or advice when asked. Justin the concierge offered some good food options close to the hotel and also in La Jolla. People have mentioned taking public transportation to get around the San Diego area but with smaller children I would recommend a car. We never had much difficulty finding parking. I also must note that the Omni is very family friendly. That is the main reason we choose this hotel over others. The children always felt welcome and the guests didn't seem to mind their presence. There are many families in the hotel but the children are all well behaved and do not seem to effect the stay of couples or business travelers traveling without children. Now onto the negative....having said all these positive things I hate to bring up the negative but this one experience left a lasting impression that just won't go away. Halfway into our stay we were woke up at around 1:30am by lound partying that began at the elevator and continued in the room next door. This noise not only woke us up but our daughter sleeping next door. Once it becuase clear that the party was not going to end I called the front desk. They noted my concern and immediately sent security up. After finally opening the door there was a lound confrontation with security that spilled into the hallway with yelling and screaming. After yelling into the telephone and slamming drawers the noise did die down, 2 hours later. Needless to say sleep is a major reason for vacation and there was very little sleep that night. The next morning while in the shower my husband receives a knock at the door. It was after 8am and I assumed it was management checking up on us to appologize for the inconvience of the night before. I was wrong. It was security addressing a noise complaint about our children. The security guard was very nice and understood the children weren't being loud. He knew about the incident the night before and realized it was an immature attempt at retaliation. He also discussed the idea of moving us to a new room. I immediately went to the front desk and spoke with the day manager. I wanted him to know that we were happy and well settled into our current room and that we did not want to move. I did, however, want him to know that there was no way I was going to lose another night of sleep. He assured me that the guest next door would be checking out by noon and that it would not be a problem. I do not blame the Omni for how the situation was handled at the time of the incident. Unfortunately you sometimes get a bad next door neighbor. I can't imagine why someone would think it was ok to party at the Omni. If they wanted to party the Hard Rock Hotel is directly across the street. What I was disappointed in was the lack of concern by management. No one called to appologize for the lost night of sleep I recieved. No one inquired about how the children handled the yelling in the hallway. I don't think they realized what an inconvience it was to us. It would have been really simple to leave a positive impression. A handwritten note left in our room to show they recognized our discomfort would have been appreciated. A plate of cookies for the girls saying they hoped they enjoyed the rest of their stay would have went a long way. A free breakfast for one night would have said a lot and showed management cared. None of this would have taken must time or cost the hotel more than a few dollars. Instead we got no acknowledgement of what happened the night before. No phone call, no written note. So instead of remembering all the great things about the Omni and there were many, we remember an opportunity lost. I would still recommend the Omni to a friend but I would make sure they know there are lots of other hotels with similar pricing in the area. I would tell them there are lots of employees at the Omni that are great at their job and make you feel special. I just wouldn't include management in this list.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Hills, California", "Title": "\u201cGREAT!!\u201d", "Author": "redladya", "ReviewID": "UR117078942", "Content": "Beautiful hotel!

Even though they said the wait would be less than an hour, I explained that my plane was late and I had to prepare for a meeting with two of my company's VPs , so they upgraded me to a suite with a bedroom, very large bathroom, and separate sitting area with sofa and chairs. Nice! Thanks!! The suite worked out really well, I ended up holding several meetings in my hotel room over the course of the week. The flat-screen TV in the sitting area is driven by a VGA cable so I was able to plug in my laptop and run powerpoint presentations on the 42\" TV while the VPs were sitting comfortably on the sofa. If you are thinking of using the suite to share between multiple people it might not work - the room's thermostat is in the sitting area but the AC vent is in the bedroom so if you have the door between the sitting area and bedroom closed, then the sitting area gets hot and the bedroom gets cold. But if you don't mind having the door between the sleeping area and the sitting area open then it's no big deal.

Taxi drivers know how to deal with the traffic but if you are driving your own car you might want to call the hotel to ask where to go.

I was there on business and spent a lot of time in the hotel's ballroom and meeting rooms attending various events. While the hotel is lovely, well-maintained and nicely located in San Diego, the constant noise from the train and Convention Center made it impossible for me to sleep, even with the earplugs provided by the hotel. This made for an unpleasant stay. My room looked directly onto the train tracks and Convention Center, with views of the Bay beyond. I thought it was a little odd that the hotel had placed ear plugs on the bedside table, but when I tried to go to sleep that first night, I realized the problem quickly. The train goes by regularly, even at night, blasting its horn the whole way. I was woken up repeatedly, which made for a very poor night's sleep. Then, starting at about 6am, a large crowd assembled outside the Convention Center, cheering and shouting (who knew you could get so excited about a convention starting in the wee hours?!). It was ridiculous. I got practically no sleep. The Omni really should have done a better job of soundproofing these rooms. In their current state, I could not recommend them to anyone. I don't know if the noise level is this bad in other parts of the hotel, but if you must stay here, definitely request a room that faces the Gaslamp and not the Convention Center. The noise is a shame, because pretty much every other aspect of my stay at The Omni was positive. The hotel is nicely updated and looks lovely. Check-in was quick and easy. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Food at the McCormick's restaurant in the lobby was good. Meeting facilities in and around the ballroom were great. The proximity to the Gaslamp is wonderful-- we were able to get out to nice dinners either on foot or via a short cab ride. I imagine this would be a great place to stay during baseball season, as well, given that the hotel has a footbridge that will take you directly to Petco Park. However, none of these positive items could make up for the fact that I spent several weary nights just trying to get a little sleep and being constantly disturbed by the noise.

We had used Priceline to book the room. It was only the second time for us to use Priceline and it was not a problem at all. The front desk staff was friendly, helpful and very nice. Aside from the lovely room and the pretty hotel, the other thing the Omni has something going for it is the location. It is right at the foot of the Gaslamp quarter. Nearby is a gateway to many wonderful restaurants. To the east, even connected to the hotel by a skybridge, is the beautiful Petco Park, home to the MLB San Diego Padres. We have to come back for a game. We had a full day of flying and now it was time for something to eat. We walked up the very busy street, past the bars, stores, and restaurants until we found one of our liking. We picked out the Marble Room, a former brothel, and had a great burger and beer. Another block or two up the hill and we found Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. The perfect desert. Another advantage of using the Omni as a home base is that it is adjacent to the MTS railway. We used daypasses for getting around town and out to Old San Diego. We found it was better to go to the San Diego Zoo via taxi although our passes would have taken us there for free. With all the walking you do in the zoo and Balboa park we opted for the cab. Make sure you apply for the Omni program as it will entitle you to free internet and breakfast coffee and juices. We even indulged in a breakfast bagel from room service. All was good. I took wonderful morning walks in the area. There is a Ralph's grocery store a few blocks away and the neighbourhood felt very safe. Walking along the harbour and along the sea side of the convention center was also very pretty and nice. In the evening we would have a nightcap drink at McCormick and Schmicks.which is part of the hotel. I would gladly return here. This is where many of the visiting baseball teams stay when they play in San Diego, as we were told by one of the bell hops. The roof top pool and hot tub on the sixth floor are very welcoming and warm, even in March. It would be great if they had a shuttle to the airport and about town but frankly taxi's cost the same for the two of us as a shuttle would. Also, on the Marriott side, it can be a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights when the rooftop become party central.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, beautiful hotel, & reasonably priced\u201d", "Author": "cz4ever", "ReviewID": "UR100511642", "Content": "I attended a weeklong business meeting at the Omni San Diego and was very pleasantly surprised by the venue.

How wrong we were! From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel welcome, which we didn't expect as a young family staying in what we thought was predominantly a business hotel. Luke, the valet manager, was extremely friendly and remembered my name the next few days. Oliver, the bellboy, was also extremely friendly, very affable and knowledgeable about the area. He also picked up a kid's pack for our young daughter which was most appreciated as it contained lots of nice toys for her. The room was lovely with a great view over the Coronado bay and the swimming pool below. We booked this hotel via a great deal on Travelbag, so weren't expecting such a nice room. The bathroom was salubrious and the room extremely comfortable. Tip: join their SelectGuest program free of charge before visiting to get free WiFi - it's well worth it. The swimming pool and jacuzzi area were very nice - although the pool wasn't the warmest, the attendants at the pool were extremely helpful and friendly. Unlike other reviewers, we didn't have a problem with the location. It's next to the Gaslamp Quarter (pretty much in it) and next to the Convention Centre and the Baseball stadium. It's also next to some train tracks, and the trains weren't that noisy, although one night we could hear some freight trains, but it wasn't particularly bad. Another point some reviewers have mentioned is the bathroom doors. Yes, they are a little weird. When they slide they slide across, there is a little gap, but I can only see that there would be privacy issues, if your partner was deliberately trying to look in. Which is too weird to think about really. In short, they were fine. With regards to parking, you can pay $32 for valet, or $18 dollars for self parking - all in the same garage across the street. The valet was nice, but a little inconsistent - the first time we picked up the car, it had been tidied a little bit and there were two little bottles of water in the cup holders.

The rooms are decent size, modern, and clean - I thought of it as an updated Marriott. The bed was comfortable. Staff was friendly. But overall there was a definite lack of attention to detail. Now, I don't expect a Four Seasons experience at these prices, but.... First, I signed up for their Select Guest program to take advantage of the freebies, which are generous compared to other programs. But I never did get the promised bottle of water, morning beverage, evening turn down, or Wall Street Journal (USA Today delivered instead). Second, I took advantage of the free shoe shine freebie. My shoes were picked up that evening. I asked them to leave them hanging on my door by 7am the next morning. But instead of leaving them on my door (which had the Privacy Sign up), they kept knocking away promptly at 7am until I came out of the shower to open the door. Very annoying. Third, the TV in the room did not work right. The remote clearly needed batteries. But even when using the controls on the TV itself, I had a hard time getting the guide to work. The TV would only turn on to a channel with snow rather than tuned to the set top box. And it would not easily switch. In addition, the default volume when turned on was very loud. Even after I got the TV to tune to the box, it functioned very slowly. In the end, I just gave up. Very annoying. Fourth, twice I experienced the elevators randomly missing my floor and changing directions while riding them. Have no clue how that happens. Fifth, I asked for a quite room on a high floor away from the elevators. I got most of it but their definition of a quiet room was to put me near the housekeeping area - which is not quiet at all with the staff going in and out and gossiping away. And they also put me in a handicap room without asking. That meant the closets had low hanging rods for wheelchair accessibility, bathroom had no tub, etc... And clearly it was a seldom used room because dust had gathered on the coffee machine, coffee cups and grinds. Sixth, it may be a bit unfair of me to evaluate the breakfast at the meeting since it really depends on the meeting organizer's contract, but there was no vegetarian option for the meal. They did put together a nice fruit plate which took very long to bring out. Seventh, I was planning on letting the front desk know about my stay experience, but to my surprise, when I checked out, the desk agent did not ask how my stay was. She was friendly for sure, but gave me only a quick thanks and goodbye. Finally, my stay has still not shown up on my Select Guest profile.

After scouting the tripadvisor reviews, the Omni was our selection. Our group had a mix of people wanting beach, outdoor activities, city, site seeing, etc. and downtown/gaslamp seemed like a good go-between for all things San Diego. Highlights: *Rooms: comfy beds, very clean, windows that open, large bathrooms with nice amenities. Not super luxurious or anything but comfy and perfect for our needs (we were not in the rooms that much anyway). *McCormick and Schmick\u2019s Happy Hour: OK I know this is a chain and generally we avoid chains to opt for local flavor (especially since San Diego is full of great seafood restaurants), however they seriously have a great HH at this location in the hotel. The prices for the happy hour food and cocktails were cheap and good! *Fitness Center: Super clean, well equipped (not large but has everything you could need). The hotel also provides you with a list of near-by jogging routes and their mileages and scenery along the way. We also ran the convention center stairs one morning, apparently a thing several others do as well. *If you are a baseball fan, sooo cool you can look right down into the Padre Games from certain rooms or higher floor windows. You can also hear the crowds cheer/roar. *Location: Quick drive to beaches (Coronado, Ocean Beach, Point Loma) and not much further to head to Mission and on up to Pacific Beach areas. *Tons of things to walk to, restaurants, shopping, etc. *The majority of rooms are not view rooms (but there are some that look over the bay but there are also lots of buildings along the bay). Many rooms face other buildings, hotels or the convention center. I don\u2019t think you stay at this location, however for the view so any view is a plus. If you really want waterfront/view, many other San Diego locations/cities are better for that option. *Pool and Spa were nice but not what you would see at some resort (and nor should you expect that from a rooftop/urban setting). Basic size but heated and swim able. *Size of the hotel \u2013 I think it\u2019s perfect, big enough to offer all the amenities you want but not so huge you don\u2019t get any personal service. The concierge staff was awesome! Be Aware Of/Things to Know: *This is not that big of a deal but they do have the old style televisions (meaning not flat screens) but they have a large offering of cable stations which can be unusual in similar properties. *Since they are right next door the Hard Rock Hotel (which is a large party scene especially on weekends) it tends to overflow to the Omni (the party-crowd). Lots of young, hip, beautiful, inebriated people in the streets and lobby; may not be a bad thing (great for people watching) but could be an issue for certain crowds. *Parking \u2013 Sure it\u2019s steep ($32 per day) but no different than any other downtown hotel. I agree with other reviewers, self-park in the lot directly across from the hotel, it\u2019s about half the price and the same place the valets use anyway. *Weekends are very busy downtown. If you plan to eat out in the area, make a reservation (or have your concierge do it for you), this saved us several times from 1-2 hour waits. *Higher floors will be quieter. It is a city and there is city noise (trains, people, etc). *It\u2019s dog friendly so you may see Fido in the elevator or hanging out in the lobby. We are dog people so it\u2019s cool with us but not everyone enjoys that. Check Out: *Cabrillo National Monument at Point Loma if you have never been there.

If you arrive around the same time people are arriving for a Padres game be prepared for traffic. We valet parked at the hotel for $32/night but there is cheaper parking across the street when there isn't a ballgame. I used their online checkin so I didn't have to stand in line at the desk. Unfortunately they had me down as requesting a smoking room (which I certainly did not request) which I could have had easily changed had I checked in with a human. (If I were to checkin online again I would call the hotel to confirm my preferences.) I didn't realize it until I got to the room and there were ashtrays. But the room didn't smell like smoke so I didn't ask to change rooms. Don't expect a lot of help from the concierge for Padres tickets. Despite that the hotel is connected to the ballpark via a skybridge and they have a marketing partnership, the concierge simply calls a ticket broker to see what they have available. So we went to the box office and got good seats for a reasonable price. Hint: There are ticket windows near the hotel in the old Western Metal Supply building but you'll get a shorter line if you walk all the way around to behind home plate to the main ticket windows. There is a skybridge is on the 3rd base side just behind section 118. We happened to get tickets for section 116 and not less than 5 minutes after the game was over we were already back in our room. If you are a Select Guest loyalty program member you'll get a free bottle of water on your first night, free wifi, and free coffee and juice delivered to your room every morning. You can order muffins, bagels, english muffins, or croissants to be delivered with the coffee and juice for a reasonable $3/each. For two of us, we got a pot of coffee, 2 glasses of OJ, 2 bagels, and 2 english muffins for less than $16. Compare that to another hotel we stayed at recently where it was $60 for the same thing. The only problem we had with our room is the lack of privacy with the bathroom. The doors roll shut, they don't latch, and have shutter louvers on them. There are also two tall shutter louvers on either side of the sink that open up into the rest of the room.

The hotel is beside the commercial and light rail train tracks and next to the baseball stadium so it is very noisy with the windows open; with the windows closed though I didn't hear the trains much (double-paned glass) and they didn't wake me up. Shower in room was one of the best hotel showers I\u2019ve ever had. Good water strength and it had one of those curved shower curtains rods so the curtain didn\u2019t stick to you. Don\u2019t recommend you share the room with a colleague though as there are only shutters between the bathroom and bedroom so it is NOT sound proofed. Hotel is within walking distance of the Gaslamp area, which contains a good variety of restaurants and the light rail transit is a 1 minute walk. Hotel restaurant food is good but very pricey. No breakfast buffet is available so we had room service for breakfast, which was very expensive. Those on a budget would probably not want to stay here, but if you have a reasonable expense account it's a good place to stay.

All of the above were excellent. Property is newer, so everything is modern, clean, and in good condition. Staff was excellent, from doorman to bellman, to front desk. Fantastic location, steps to the Gas Lamp District as well as waterfront. On site restaurant very good too. Btw, as far as the restaurant goes, some TA posters talked a little down on it, as being a \"chain restaurant\". Well, yes, there are multiple M & S restaurants in the country, but keep in mind, it's not a chain in the \"Applebee's or Chili's\" sense. For anyone who has been to Jake's Famous Crawfish in Portland (the original M & S restaurant, from which the chain started), you'll know it's not the typical \"chainey\" food. Food was excellent, very fresh seafood. So, what not to like? Couple things. Pretty small things, granted, considering the overall positive experience. But feel the need to mention them anyway. The biggest let down was the \"morning beverage service\", for Omni Select guests. During the entire week stay, it was never once correct. For example, I'd order a bagel, and get a muffin. Or I'd order coffee, which I'd get, but with no cream brought with it. 3 of the 6 mornings no newspaper was delivered with it, even though I had selected a newspaper. Etc, etc. All small things, in-and-of-themselves, but after a week, it added up to be more than the sum of the parts...in other words, it got annoying. The other nit-pick was with housekeeping. Not the best. Even though with leaving a tip as I always do, there was lack of stocking the coffee area, lack of vaccuming, missed dirty glass in the bathroom, etc. Again, little things in and of themselves...but they do add up. ** Two tips (or comments) for would-be stayers: (1) we loved our bay view room, but didn't love the train noise. If you are a heavy sleeper, then no worries, go for the view. If you are a light sleeper, however, then this is something to consider. You will hear trains and box car connections everynight. You may want to elect for the \"city view\" room, as it is on oposite side of hotel tower, not facing the train tracks. (2) I disagree with the post below, saying that a rental car is a must. We stayed for 7 days and visited many attractions, all without a rental car, and did just fine. Taxis are plentiful. And even though that means constant Taxi fares, consider the $25-$40 rental fee plus gas you're saving. Not to mention the valet parking of $30. So for us, being that we traveled with another couple, we were WAY ahead (money wise) by cabbing it, plus we had no headaches of traffic or parking (which almost every attraction you go to will be bring an additional parking cost), and had no worries about drinking and driving at night, if we had a cocktail with dinner.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cSoftball trip 2009\u201d", "Author": "Gman365", "ReviewID": "UR51923748", "Content": "Awesome location in the gaslamp district.

They provided us with a card to fill out for our coffee/juice/newspaper choices we would like brought to our room in the morning. It also allowed us to choose our room preference, bedding and pillow preferences prior to our stay. Definately worth signing up for. We were upgraded to a corner suite which overlooked Petco Park on one side and the Water on the other. We were on the 12th floor and also looked right below to the 6th floor pool and restaurant. The room was beautiful. It consisted of a living room with desk and tv, and a separate bedroom with tv. The bathroom had huge windows and a great sink/vanity - the only thing I would have changed was to have a seperate tub and shower. We had indicated on our select guest profile that the Omni was the first hotel on our California honeymoon and the staff were very quick to offer their congratulations. They provided us with the suite upgrade and later on in the evening sent us a congratulatory note and a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. A very wonderful gesture that we will remember from our honeymoon. The location of the hotel is right at the entrance to the Gaslamp District and everything we needed was within walking distance. We ate at the Tin Fish next door to the hotel for lunch and then Toscana Wine Bar for dinner - both fantastic. The hotel only offers Valet parking for $30 night, but we parked directly across the street form the Omni in a parking garage for $12 overnight. It was very convenient.

I was surprised to read the prior review because the hotel I saw (probably unwittingly the area my room was in) was very new, including my room, with modern decor and large stylish bathroom and comfy beds. I had requested a quiet, high floor room, and they were nice enough to openly acknowledge that and give me the top floor! And yes it was totally quiet. (I got my room thru expedia around $150, if not a super low hotwire rate). The front desk person was the friendliest I'd encountered in a while. The hotel was very busy, which made it feel a little hectic, if lively. The pool area is stylish and has great bay views. The service was friendly at the lounge, but I was quite disappointed by the quality of the food, which tried to be trendy but tasted very average. There is also a McCormick and Schmick's seafood chain outpost on site. We lucked out and found a free street parking space right next to the hotel (when there is no game at Petco Park you might luck out as well), and there is also a parking garage right across the street that is likely much cheaper than the valet service here. The location is good, at the bayside end of the Gaslamp near the Convention Center, and as I said right next to Petco Park, so its a little cleaner/newer right around this area while it is still right next to all the action (the Gaslamp is remarkably crowded on Saturday nights btw). You probably need a higher floor though to avoid all that partying or ballgame noise. The only other grumble I had aside from the food was an incorrect billing charge that I still am waiting to fix (I had prepaid for the room, but they charged me again for it.) Hopefully that will be resolved shortly. I also think that similar hotels in this class now have flatscreen TVs, and this one didn't. All in all a clean, modern, well organized, full service hotel. I also stayed at the US Grant, and both hotels have their pros and cons (the Omni had a pool/outdoor lounge area, and a larger/roomier facility and bay views, better parking options; but the food was much worse, there was no flatscreen TV, and the decor and finishes, although contemporary and nice, weren't as stunning and polished as US Grant's), but I was very happy with both.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellevue, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service with Average Room\u201d", "Author": "Off-Season_Traveller", "ReviewID": "UR40225974", "Content": "After doing a lot of research for a hotel for my wife's birthday, my first choice in San Diego was The Omni. Much of that was based on the most recent Tripadvisor reviews. However the website price was high, so for the first time I went to Priceline, as their 4* hotels were coming in around $70/night in San Diego. I was thrilled when I got to $71 and my bid was accepted by The Omni. I knew going in that valet parking would add another $30 (plus tips for each pickup) per day. This was much less than half the hotel's online rate for their lowest class of room. We checked into the hotel and the first thing I noticed was how helpful the many staff were. Although I knew the smart advice was to park in the garage across the street, it was the evening after a long day and figured that we'd valet the first night and park it ourselves after. When we got to our room on the 11th floor, the first thing I noticed was that it looked like an older hotel that had gone through a remodel. From outside you can see what appears to be old hotel and new addition. We were in the shorter, older part. A remodel doesn't bother me, however it's the how they did it that made me question the 4 or 5 star rating of this hotel. The bathroom was made larger, which is a good thing, however they used open slats into the rest of the room for some reason. There are two of them - one on each side of the freestanding sink and the two sliding doors (that don't quite meet together right) have them too. If you want, you can adjust them to see straight in (and out) of the bathroom from the rest of the room. The major downside of this is that all the sounds and smells of a bathroom will be shared even if the slats are turned down. The closet couldn't be closed without making a racket that could likely be heard in the neighboring room. We could hear many sounds from other rooms, which due to proximity to the gaslamp district, happened around 2:00 - 3:00AM. They came from many directions as we were in the middle of the floor. We did get the Select Guest benefits which included a nice beverage service and free internet, although we didn't use the internet much during this stay. For the price we paid, the hotel was what we would expect - the high point being the courteous and helpful staff. But had we paid regular online rates, I would have been severely disappointed. There are too many other nice hotels downtown to go out of my way to stay at The Omni again. I'd take a chance on Priceline again, so I wouldn't know what I'm getting.

Its also open 24 hours a day. - The pool was first class....the fireplace that is shared between the pool and lounge area was awesome. They serve you drinks and food - felt better then the Loew's hotels! - Even the hotel engineering service was unbeatable. They had to fix my a/c in my room.

Overall impression: the Omni is a very nice, contemporary hotel with clean but standard-style rooms (although the bathroom was better than average), competent & polite staff, and a can't-be-beat location in downtown San Diego. ROOMS: Basic hotel room layout with bed, desk, chairs, and TV in main room. The room was clean and the linens/pillows were good. The bathroom was fairly large with nice wood & glass shelving on both sides of the mirror. LOCATION: The hotel sits at the south end of the Gas Lamp district, which is basically several historical city blocks now filled with restaurants and shopping. It is adjacent to the Convention Center, within walking distance of the San Diego Bay, one minute from a Trolley/Train station, and literally across the street from Petco Park (home of major league baseball's Padres). Walk in any direction from the hotel and you'll find something to do or see. CONS: If it\u2019s not included with your room, it will be expensive! Liter of water = $3.99. 20 minutes of internet in the business center = $9.95. Parking = see below. HELPFUL TIPS: 1) If you're tired of walking or want to visit farther away attractions (highly recommend La Jolla beach at sunset), stop by the concierge desk for a rental car. We tried to find a last minute rental online and the minimum price was over $100. The concierge made arrangements for us with a local company (TravCar) for $39.95, and they came to the hotel and picked us up for free! 2) Parking the car can be expensive, the hotel charges $30 a day for valet parking. However you can park yourself in the same new parking garage right across the street for less than half that. $8 a day maximum charge, plus $3 for overnight parking. 3) The elevators are quick and fairly efficient, so stay on the highest floor you can for the best view. We didn\u2019t face the water, but we could see into Petco Park during the games. 4) Spend time on the 6th floor pool deck/patio. Great place to read the morning paper. The pool and hot tub are not huge, but they really weren\u2019t over-crowded any time we were there. 5) We didn\u2019t eat in the hotel restaurant (McCormick & Schmick\u2019s), but it was voted the best hotel food in San Diego by the local newspaper. 6) Join the Omni Select Guest club (for free online).

Then she didn't want to believe i have only one card. Then she advised me to go and get cash at their ATM, \"and pay as much as you can\". Turned out, the ATM is out of order. I had to go across the streets to the Petco stadion and withdraw 1000 bucks which was the daily limit on the card...my pockets bulging with 20$ bills, go back to the hotel and bear with their funny-face while counting the cash.

We booked the cheapest room, since we didn\u2019t want to spend our money here but in the honeymoon, but we did write on the comments from the reservation that it was our wedding night, so\u2026 when we got there they gave us one of the best rooms available. It was amazing. By far, that\u2019s the best hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in. It was beautiful. Location: Is located right next to the Petco park, it actually has a bridge to go there specially made for guests who want to go to the games. It\u2019s in Downtown SD, in front of the Convention Center, and like 4 blocks away from Horton Plaza. It was only like 10 bucks for the taxi to takes us to the airport, it\u2019s very near. There are tons of restaurants around the hotel. Room: It was amazing. They upgraded our room to a corner one in the 14th floor, so we had two walls of windows. The bed was super comfortable. It\u2019s super clean. The carpet was very nice and new (well\u2026 the hotel was new). The bathroom was big and nice. There is a shower and a tub. Very spacious. We had a desk and a chair, along with flowers. It had a big closet with a safe, hangers and bag for dry clean and laundry. Lobby: Very big and beautiful. I don\u2019t remember a lot of the lobby but it was nice. Right in front of the hotel you catch a taxi; they are always parked in the front. Service: Very good. As I said, they upgraded us to a better room which was nice. They also gave us Moet & Chandon champagne because it was our wedding night. When we made our reservation we said we would get there by 2 am, and we actually did like at 4 am. As soon as we entered the lobby the receptionist asked us how was our wedding and congratulated us!!!! He knew it was us! (No, I was not wearing my wedding dress anymore). We thought that was a very nice touch. We ordered pizza from room service and it was AMAZING, it was very good, and it only took them like 20 minutes to make it, even though it was like 5 am!

Positive: 1. Excellent Location in Gaslamp District. Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance (we ate at La Strada, Blue Coastal Seafood and MaryJane in Hard Rock Hotel - all located on 5th Street - we high recommend all three!). The convention center is across the street and there's a walkway connected to Petco Stadium. The Westfield mall is about 10 minute walk. 2. Signing up for the Guest Select program is a definite must - Free beverages in the morning, pressing of clothes and internet access definitely put this hotel a step above other hotels that will charge you for these. Of note - The coffee and orange juice we had each morning was great! The croissant we added to our beverage service (you pay about $4.00 extra) is enough to split for 2 people. 3. Another advantage of signing up for the program ahead of time is that you can customize your stay. Since we signed up beforehand, check-in was also a breeze since they had all our information on file. We pretty much said our name, the front desk handed us the key and that was it! 4. The room we had was clean and beautiful. We were on the 20th floor with a gorgeous view of the water. Negative: 1. As other reviewers mentioned, the train runs in between the hotel and convention center and does blow 3 or 4 distinct whistles as it passes through. The first morning, it woke me up at 5:45 AM and a second one later around 7:30 AM. For a very light sleeper (such as myself), it was loud enough to feel like the windows were open. However, my husband (who is a moderate sleeper) never heard anything. If you do have sleeping concerns, request a room with a view towards the city and not the water. 2. As everyone mentioned, parking at the hotel is $30.00 per night. We parked adjacent to the hotel (it's a pretty large structure right off K street...you can't miss it) which is $8.00/night on weekday and $16.00/night on weekend. The structure appears to be open 24/7 as there were attendants available when we arrived that evening at 11:00PM. I wouldn't recommend driving around if you plan to stay around the Gaslamp district and immediate surrounding areas since parking seemed to be an issue. There are plenty of taxis or people riding bicycles that offer rides if you're tired. As point of reference, a taxi ride from the hotel to the Westfield mall was about $7.00. We thought it was very safe to walk around at night as long as you keep on the main street where all the restaurants and bars are located. 3. I do agree with one reviewer that the walls are a bit thin. During my stay, the neighbors were quiet (I heard an occasional cough and when they used the restroom, it did sound like they were in the same room). However, I can definitely see where it can be unpleasant if you get noisy neighbors. 4. Although the bathroom was beautifully decorated, it wasn't well thought out in terms of where to hang your towels. There's only 1 towel holder inside the shower and two small hooks that barely held a towel. Though not really a \"negative\" thing in my opinion, it was a minor annoyance. If you hang a hanger (from the closet) on one of the hooks in the bathroom, that served as a pretty decent impromptu towel holder. Nevertheless, despite the \"negatives,\" these observations did not impact our stay in a negative way.

When we arrived at about noon, I was pleased to be told that the room was ready -- I hadn't even asked for early check-in. The room was clean, well-appointed, and had a decent view, although it was not a bay view. My parents arrived later in the day, and had also booked on Priceline. I don't know if it was just luck of the draw but they got a room with a beautiful view of the bay. Perhaps the rooms with king beds are on the bay side of the hall and the doubles are on the other side?? With the Select Guest program we got free morning beverages and newspapers and also were able to have two items pressed for free (which was great because we were there for a wedding and I had my shirt pressed.) I also got free internet access. Other people have commented about noise from the trains or adjoining rooms. We were on the 19th floor and didn't have any noise problems. Some people have also said the \"louvered\" panels in the bathroom make for lack of privacy. Our room didn't have the louvered panels -- it had a large sliding glass door. It was an unusual design, but wasn't a problem. My parents' room had the louvered panels and they didn't mention any bathroom privacy problems. Their room also had a small balcony with sliding doors and sculped carpet, while our room just had a window that opened slightly. All of the staff members were very friendly and helpful. Every time I called for anything, the phone was answered on the first ring and I was greeted by name -- as cheesy as this may sound, I felt like royalty. The neighborhood has great nightlife and lots of restaurants and attractions within walking distance. Follow the tips here and self-park in the garage across the street (6th and K Parkade).

I am so so glad we stayed here last. Otherwise I would have never got my kids to step foot in our other 2 hotels. I had picked each hotel based on the attractions we were going to that day. Thus while at Legoland I suggest you stay up north in Carlsbad; Mission Valley for the Zoo and La Jolla; and then move south to downtown while you tour Coronado and the downtown area. This Omni is only 4 years old and it looks brand new. It is modern without being weird or stark. The glass makes it open and airy and the large windows make the lobby and the hotel rooms feel so huge. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. Their maps were better than any I found from AAA or online. I would suggest you pay the extra for the premium room with a view of the water. We were in #1906 and the view of the water was spectacular. Each morning I am normally anxious to grab a shower and hit the town, but here I wanted to sit and enjoy the view while lingering over my coffee, juice and paper (all free and delivered to your room each a.m. if you sign up for the Omni frequent guest program). But you do need food, so by 9:30 am we would head down to the restaurant on the 1st floor for the nice buffet. $13 for continental or $19 for cold & hot choices--beverages, lots of fruit, eggs cooked to order and all of the usual 4* restaurant choices. Buffet is open till 11 am. (What a great idea.) We recommend the bed and breakfast package that included $30 valet parking and a $40 coupon for breakfast each a.m. With a full tummy, we never needed lunch till 2 or 3 pm each day. Decor in the room is very nice. Yes, there is sliding bathroom door. No big deal. In fact I grew to like it since it meant no one ever hit me when I was in the bathroom and they decided they wanted to come in. Lots of fluffy towels, 2 waffle style robes and a neat way to use shelves to give you a lot of vanity counter space. Yes, there was a train about 2 am but you can roll over and go back to sleep or use the free earplugs provided in the nightstand if you are worried about it. Milk and cookies were included with our turndown services. Of course the kids loved that. They have a backpack of kids' games if you need them but we never did. The outdoor 6th floor pool is very unique and the jacuzzi was built by a parent because he understood you want to sit in there yet keep an eye on your kids 15 feet away in the pool. There are many restaurants in walking district. Just go 1 block over and you are in the Gaslamp district with block after block of choices. The red trolley line stops right outside the hotel so that is an easy way to see the city if you do not have a car. The Convention center is across the street. The Coronado Bridge is 5 minutes away. We drove over and parked about 2 blocks from the famous Hotel del Coronado. We walked on the sidewalk, went in \"the Del\" to look for the ghost of Kate Morgan (the Del's resident ghost) and then changed in their restrooms and hit the great beach right in front of The Del. Del's ice cream shop, coffee shop and bar were easy stops for refreshments. The U.S. Midway, all of the other Harbor activities and even Balboa Park are 5-15 minutes from the Omni. So do not think you can only stay at the Omni if you are downtown for business. It is well-suited for sight-seeing too. In conclusion: we were originally WOWed by the view, but we came to realize everything about the Omni is very very nice.

Also, you are right next to the Trolley Stop and can get around town for $5.00 (all day pass) so no need to rent a car. If you do rent a car, valet at the hotel is $30.00 or you can park in the garage across the street for $20.00 overnight or $8.00 for the day. No need to rent a car if you plan to stay around the downtown area. You can even take the trolley into Mexico \u2013 you will need a car if you plan to go to Sea World. If you go to the Zoo, you can ride the trolley and take the bus to the Zoo from the stop by the community college. The $5.00 all-day ticket covers the trolley and bus.

We took the trolley to Old Town (walk-around the old city, a State Park to see what live was like back in the 1800\u2019s \u2013 free); went out to Coronado Island (Hotel Del Mar) and ate at Miguel\u2019s Cocina across from the hotel \u2013 was highly recommended and great food at a great price.

Room was spotlessly clean, comfortable and modern. I would stay there again without a second thought. We had only two complaints about the room. First, there seems to be a trend away from queen size beds. Two full beds is a little annoying and just a bit too cozy when there are two adults and two kids. But the Omni, like so many other hotels, only offers one king or two fulls. The second criticism of the room is the funky bathroom door. It looks very cool, but it doesn't offer much in the way of privacy. It is essentially a sliding barn door style, so it covers the main opening of the doorway, but leaves gaps open all the way around. My wife, in particular, was not very happy about that. We also had a pretty bad experience at McCormick & Schmick's, the restaurant located on the first floor of the hotel. Without getting into the details, they were understaffed and had not ordered sufficiently for the weekend, so they ran out of a lot of menu items early. The place was packed with unhappy diners, because the kitchen was so painfully slow. To their credit, the management handled things correctly. Ultimately, our entire meal was paid for by the restaurant.

The location at the Gaslamp Quarter was spectacular, the lobby was clean and attractive and the rooms were also quite nice. A few things to mention. I registered for the Preferred Member Services, which is free, and a wonderful value. They noted my preferences and gave me a king room, with a crib already set up for my infant daughter, cookies and milk for my kids, and turndown service every night. Internet access was free as well as a choice of newspaper and two beverages to be delivered to the room every morning. I also took advantage of the online check in which is available up to 48 hours prior to check in. So when I arrived to the hotel, my keys were already available on a side shelf, similar to a rental car preferred member service. The room itself has enough room for a desk, chair an ottoman. Everything was clean and comfortable and my room, 1505, had great views of the bay and Coronado. The bathroom door is a little weird in that its shutters. It looks neat but if you're traveling with someone you're not extremely close to, it can be odd. Also the tub is very shallow. Breakfast at McCormick and Schmicks was delicious. I ordered room service for dinner one night which was good and delivered promptly. In addition there was a business service center with printer, internet access, etc. a coffee shop and ATM in the lobby area. A walkway connects the hotel to Petco Park. All in all, my family and I had a wonderful stay here. I only wish we were able to stay here for our entire visit to San Diego but unfortunately the weekend rates ($295) were a bit much for us and we gambled with Priceline and got the Hotel Solamar. While a decent hotel, I would've much preferred the Omni and think it is worth the price.

The other reviews have already covered the important things - great location, great service, terrific housekeeping, clean, large rooms, nice toiletries, etc. Housekeeping gets a special mention from me - we asked that our rooms be cleaned each day during a 3 hour window, which they did. They do a fantastic job, and turndown service is also very nice. McCormick & Schmicks was super - great service, good food. The breakfast buffet is very nice. Valet & bell service was prompt and friendly. We had rooms 1912 and 1913, overlooking the convention center, bay and Coronado. Beautiful view. Yes, there can be noise outside - the train, planes on final approach into SAN, etc. It didn't really bother me much. If you are sensitive to noise, don't stay downtown at all, as you are likely to get airplane noise anywhere downtown due to the location of the airport. (On the plus side, such an easy drive from the airport!) My only complaint about the hotel is the billing, and it is the reason I did not give the hotel 5 stars. We visited the hotel in September 2007 and at that time we were overcharged in two different ways. (Charged for valet parking even though it was included in package, charged for \"complimentary\" room upgrade at check-in). Last year, I brought it to the attention of management, and was assured it was not typical and would not happen again. Precisely the same billing error occurred this year. It is apparent that there is a glitch in the computer system and/or poor training of employees, and I find it annoying that I have to pick over the bill with a fine tooth comb and then spend 15 minutes straightening out their errors, particularly when I have already brought those errors to their attention a year before.

You can reach everywhere on foot - dinning, shopping, and sightseeing. It is a very lively and safe neighborhood. On our arrival, we were greeted by very friendly and courteous staff, our really spacious and spotless clean room was ready on our arrival and what a VIEW. My mother and brother were staying at another hotel in Diego and once we compared their hotel with ours, we immediately decided to have them move in with us at the Omni. The hotel made sure that we got an equally nice room - despite the very short notice - and my mother and brother were given a room on the same floor as us, and with an equally magnificent view of the bay and the bridge. Service is impeccable, the staff extremely friendly and the room and the spacious bathroom equipped with all the amenities you can think of. I have to mention here two people who were exceptionally efficient and courteous: Ms. Elizabeth Marking and Ms. Kelly Craig both of whom went way beyond the call of duty to help on two separate problems that we were facing. They could not have done more and my family and I cannot be more appreciative. Would I stay there again? Is there anywhere else to stay?!

That is the best part of this hotel. If you are a baseball fan and want to watch a game at PETCO park, the fourth floor of the hotel leads to a bridge that connects to the park, only allowing hotel guests to pass in and out of. Gaslamp quarter is right around the corner along with a lot of restaurants, which is much needed. Omni, as far as I can see, only has McCormick & Schmick and the poolside bar food available for guests. I did not see a room service menu in the room. If you are looking to party, this is not the place for you. The bar at Mc & S closes at 11:30pm daily. However, there are many hotels around with clubs, bars, lounges to visit. The Omni caters to more older people as opposed to the party crowd on Saturday night. That was fine by us, my fiance and myself. We like to go out, have fun and come home to peace & quiet. The rooms were definately quiet. I couldn't even hear the trains/metros pass by every five minutes like you do when you are on the street. The room was comfortable. I you're not used to feather pillows definatley bring your own. Valet costs $30.00 daily (not included in your room rate). This is very reasonable considering other parkades charge about 18.00 everytime you park. If you do the express checkout, which is very handy, don't forget to leave your minibar key, believe me they will charge you to replace the key. All of the staff was very friendly and always asked if we needed directions. My fiance left two dress shirts in the closet by accident and I, being pessimistic, thought they would be lifted by sticky fingers, like at other hotels. I called, got transferred to the housekeeping dept (lost and found) and they had the shirts and are Fed Ex-ing them as I type this. Overall, a very good experience. My only negative issue is the lack of restaurants. This could also be a tactic to keep party folks out as well. Few meal recommendations: Mary Jane had decent breakfasts. Lou and Mickey's was very tasty. I had the Salmon. Everything was a la carte. The hostess recommended a bottle of red wine, a Meritage called The Prisioner from Napa, $70.00. Very robust and smooth with a great nose. Go to Fred's vs. Rockin' Baja. Make a desert trip to Ghiardelli for a brownie sundae. Makes you think you're in San Francisco.

We stayed over Labor Day weekend and had just stayed at the Omni LA, where the service and staff were excellent so we had been expecting the same experience. However that wasn't so. The day we checked in, we asked the concierge if there were any restaurants that had fast service as we had wanted to go to Sea World at night to experience their Summer Nights promotion. However, the concierge didn't even know that they were open until 11 because she told us \"you might want to save your money because it's quite expensive and they close soon.\" This was about 6:30 p.m. i would think that a concierge would know what time major attractions open and close. After I told her that it was open until 11, to answer my question regarding a place with fast service, she suggested a place next to the hotel that we had eaten at upon our arrival earlier that day. When we told her this, she said that she didn't know any other locations and wished us \"good luck.\" We ended up spending an extra 20-25 minutes walking around the Gaslamp District trying to find a place. With the many restaurants, I would think that there are some that provide fast service and something a concierge would have knowledge about. I guess we expected too much from a concierge after receiving such excellent service at the Omni LA. The valet was also quite slow at times. Upon returning for the evening one night, we were the only car that pulled in. I was in the car for about a minute gathering our items and the attendant didn't even come to the car even though we could clearly see him standing at the valet door doing nothing. Even after we got out of the car, it took a while for him to come over to get our keys. Again, I guess we expected too much after receiving such great service up in LA. We did let the manager know about these experiences and she did give us complimentary buffets, but it's hard to recover when these experiences were the initial experiences with the hotel. It was truly a letdown after reading all the rave reviews on here. The room was decent; nothing spectacular. The door to the bathroom was a sliding one that didn't even cover the whole door frame so there wasn't full closure; don't know who came up with that design. I guess that was better than having the rooms with the shutters. Compared to the Omni LA, Omni San Diego was definitely a let down.

The room service food was good however the cocktails (Mai Tai's) were horrible and non edible($18.00 for both). We didn't complain and just left them on the desk to be cleaned with the room. We had a semi stocked mini bar, as there were two empty bottles of Grey Goose bottles, that had the caps replaced and put back in their perspective places. I called down to the front desk to advise them and they said it happens all the time, and they will not charge our room which they didn't. There were other empty spots leading one to believe other items had not been replaced as well. The Valet was prompt all weekend except the day we checked out, we stood their with our bags in hand for a good 6-7 minutes and no Valet staff every asked us if we needed help. Finally my husband muscled the bags over to the Valet desk where two young gentleman were chatting close by and asked for someone to get our car. Not the best for $30.00 a day I thought. Nothing special about the Valet either for the price, unlike the Four Seasons or The Ritz where you get bottled water, direction basically anything & everything you can think of and things you don't think of. The reasons we continue to visit those chains over and over again. This was a very pretty hotel and had lots of nice amentities. Had we paid the hotel website rates, I would have been a little miffed on the size of the room and the lack of privacy the bathroom does not offer. It truly does bring a couple closer than you may want to be!!!! My husband was nice enough to fetch coffee when it was my turn to shower (: so I could have some privacy. We would stay here again but only via Priceline, if I was going to pay top price I would look elsewhere. There are sooo many choices in this beautiful city.

For starters, I was able to secure a very decent rate that included complimentary valet parking and a $40 per day breakfast credit (room service or the restaurant). We arrived at the hotel with our 2 boys (ages 2 and 4). The Omni has a Kids Program where they give each child an Omni backback filled with a kids cup, gummy worms, toys, and lots of other stuff. Pretty cool!!! My kids thoroughly enjoyed this. Also, they get complimentary milk and cookies delivered to their room every night. The staff went out of their way to make us and our kids feel at home. The first day we arrived, we ended up arriving extremely early and ate breakfast at the restaurant. I have to highlight the great service of the food & beverage manager - Fernando Rodriquez who really gave us great advice on where to go in San Diego, and went out of his way to make my kids feel welcome. Fernando is awesome!!!!! He was so polite each day he saw us around the hotel. The front desk staff is also very friendly. We arrived early and they promptly checked us in to an upgraded room on - Corner Harbor View on a high floor. We had a great view of the Coronado Bay Bridge. I recommend you ask for a bay view room. We were able to see fireworks from our window on July 4th. The staff also made sure we had a roll-away bed for our kids as well as a microwave and fridge to store their milk and other food items. My favorite service of this hotel is their complimentary morning coffee/tea service delivered straight to your room at a time of your choosing. Basically, you leave a card outside your door and mark the drinks you want - coffee/tea/juice/bottled water, etc, along with the time you want the delivery. They will either bring it inside your room, or knock and leave outside your door. I loved getting fresh coffee delivered to the room each morning...complmentary!!! This my second stay at an Omni property and its fast becoming my favorite hotel chain. I would equate it to a Four Seasons quality service without all the pretention and price. In fact, the entire hotel staff was friendly. It is a well run property where there is great consistency in service throughout the hotel. If you like sushi, this hotel is next door to a Nobu restaurant (we were soo surprised, since we LOVE Nobu!!!). It's also across from the Gaslap Trolly station which you can take all around town. Very convenient. There is also a Ralph's grocery store which is a few blocks away. My only complaint with this location is that it is next door to a rail yard. On my first night, I did head the blaring horns of some long distance cargo trains. But, I didn't hear any on the following nights. Overall, this was a great stay!!! Way to go Omni San Diego!!!!!!

I had requested and booked 2 adjoining non smoking rooms (one for my teenage children) which were available for us on arrival. The rooms are decorated very tastefully and the bathroom was bright (needs a towel rail). No fridge available to cool your own things down but there was an ice machine on the floor. We were on the 4th floor with views over the pool and stadium. We could not hear from either the pool or passing trains. My only gripe was the sliding door to the on-suite bathroom. I don't want to go into the details but needless to say it's not very sound proof and there is no fan. This is one of those, it looks great but functions awfully, a design flaw. The pool area was very clean and there were plenty of towels. Parking was $30 per day (plus tip) which I thought was a bit high but as a non local it was difficult to know where else to park. As the hotel is right in the Gas Lamp district you can do without the car for evening meals etc If you do go, join up to the Omni's frequent visitor program and you get a free hot/cold drink and newspaper brought to your room each morning. It's free to join and is a great way to start the day We had breakfast in the hotel once, staff were excellent but the buffet looked a bit dry. We went for fresh cooked which was great The real asset for the Omni is their staff, every interaction is positive and friendly.

Each visit has been part of a Homerun package meaning just one night in the hotel. Not a fair way to rate a hotel in my estimation. That said I have to admit I was less \"wowed\" this time than two years ago. We were four couple attending the $299.00 Homerun package which consisted of one night in the hotel, two Padres tickets, two breakfasts the next morning in McCormick's & Schmitt's, cracker jacks and a bag of peanuts in your room and free valeting parking (a $25.00 value). Not too far off the price this package was in 2004 when without valet parking thrown in we paid $179.00 (but Petco Park had just opened as had the adjacent hotel which was running a special to get bookings). Service was exceptional at check-in. Three couples were allowed to go to their rooms at 2:00 pm, my room was delayed \"up to 30 minutes.\" They called in 15 minutes. When I went to obtain the room key I couldn't help but notice the line. So while we had flown through check-in fifteen minutes earlier, not everyone was so lucky trying to check in closer to the normal arrival time of 3:00 pm. Two of us were provided with an extra freebie, \"two beers, two brauts\" from the pool bar or the restaurant. Since it wasn't part of the package I asked the gal as the front desk about it when I went to pick up my room key. There was no explanation about the inequity but to her credit she immediately got the assistant restaurant manager to add one \"two beers, two brauts\" onto the back of his business card for one of the couples. Very classy and very much appreciated. Three of us received the \"cracker jacks and peanuts\" in our room right after check in (although pretzels were substituted in two cases, chex mix in the other for the peanuts) and the fourth couple had to call to get what was intended as a cute buy in to the baseball theme. It seems they were unprepared delivering on their own reservations. Not the right product (who eats pretzels at a ball game! :)) and they had forgotten one of us. Two couples went to the pool. There was only one server bringing drinks. The prices weren't too bad. Three beers, two mojitos and a margarita only set up back $39.00. But the server had added a second margarita which was annoying...and it took quite a few minutes to get it corrected before we felt comfortable returning to the room. Now I am just belly-aching but I was aware that the first year we purchased this package the baseball tickets were on a lower level and very near the catwalk that takes you from the third floor of the hotel into Petco Park. This year we were ten rows from the top of the stadium albeit nearly directly behind home plate. The Padres are not doing well in the standings so I am not sure what to attribute the decline in the quality of tickets. I love this hotel. I like the rooms. I like the beds. I like being able to open my window over the pool to listen to the singer crooning out the oldies in the middle of the day. This package gives you just the standard room. I expect for a little more they have some really nice features. But most of all I like the package. I didn't like getting my room charges under the door in the morning and seeing a second $40.00 pool charge on there. Again to their credit they promptly removed it as I was checking out but again I say...you are a four-star hotel, this shouldn't happen. One couple tried to leave at 6:00 am for another commitment they had. Valet gave them the bad news the lights had been left on and the battery was dead. One of the valets had to jump the car with his own truck when AAA had not shown up within 30 minutes. There is just no excuse for that. And predictably (I should know better) all the large change (quarters, dimes) had been removed from my loose change pile I keep in my ash tray. I have heard the philosophical argument that valet guys think you won't miss it, feel entitled to take it, etc., etc., etc. I call it theft and am constantly annoyed that it happens. Fortunately the GPS that my wife had put in the glove box was still there so I guess I should say thanks for small favors. Great location at the base of the Gaslamp district. Handy to just about anything you want to do in downtown San Diego. Still a beautiful, generally good-service hotel after four years.

With the window cracked, we could hear quite well and feel as if we were in the grandstands. The window that looked down at the stadium even had a window seat. The room was spacious and the bed was heavenly. Amenities were nice, even supplying coffee \"to go\" (paper) mugs and a nicely appointed honors bar. Bathroom amenities included shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, a sewing kit, and of couse, soap. We did eat breakfast at the hotel since we had the certificate, but it was pricey. We each ordered a cup of coffee at $4+ a cup. My waffle was around $11 and my husband's french toast was about the same. It was good (came with cute, individual bottles of syrup), but if you are on a budget, might be best to opt for Morsel's, a coffee shop on the other end of the hotel's lobby. Speaking of the lobby, it was beautiful. The 6th floor heated pool had comfy lounge chairs with cushions and a nice supply of white, plush towels. Very nice. We only stayed at the Omni one night as we rented a car (from Enterprise -- great service) and headed north up the coast. If you're visiting San Diego, and particularly going to a baseball game, I recommend the Omni.", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puyallup, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat amenities\u201d", "Author": "cutenose", "ReviewID": "UR14701901", "Content": "Execellent hotel with friendly staff.

I made our reservation about 3 months prior through The Omni's web site. I requested a room on a high floor with a view over looking the stadium. That's exactly what we got. This trip was planned so we could see the Angels play the Padres for an exhibition game. 2 Days prior to our arrival, The Omni sent me an e-mail that enabled us to check in through our computer at home. I went ahead and checked in this way but, I was a little worried this might hinder my chances with getting the room we wanted. Additionally, the on-line check in told me I'd be able to check in at 2 p.m. and no waiting in line. Check in time was supposed to at 3 p.m. according to the web site. We arrived shortly before 2. A little side note, we took took the Amtrak from San Juan Capistrano to Downtown San Diego. Thought we'd try the train this time. No problems with Amtrak. We walked about 8 or 9 blocks from the train station to The Omni. Downtown San Diego has got to be one of the nicest downtown areas in the states. Over the past several years the city has done a great job revitalizing the Gas Lamp District. Oh yeah, we stopped at a place called Dick's Last Resort for lunch. The food was just okay. I'm not sure if I'd eat there again. Arrived at the Omni and went to the check in desk. The young people working the counter were very nice and professional. The girl who helped me told me our room was not ready and asked if we would mind waiting. I didn't mind at all because she said our room was located exactly where I requested. Had to wait almost an hour for it to be ready. The wait was a little bit of a downer but, it was well worth it. While waiting, I saw one of my favorite players from the Angels, Rob Quinlan, in the lobby. I think some of the players stayed at the Omni. I ran into the Angels owner Arte Moreno at the game. He was nice enough to shake my hand and smile. Back to the details with the room. We had room #1833 on the 18th floor. Check out my photos. It was a standard room, about 400 sq. ft. The only weird thing about the room was the bathroom door. The door was on a hanging track and slid to open and close. It didn't really give much privacy. People are able to hear you do your business. My suggestion, turn on the water, so nobody can hear you. I'd read many complaints from others here regarding the trains and the trolley. This is one of the reasons I wanted to be on the stadium side of the hotel. There is still some noise on this side of the building. It really didn't bother us though. Ask the hotel for some extra pillows and sleep with a pillow over your head. This helped me. I heard one train horn at 3 a.m., that was the only time I was bothered. Overall, I give our experience 4 out of 5 stars. Will we stay there again? Absolutely.

He told us he would try to get reservations, as it was popular on a Saturday night. He called the restaurant and made sure to give his own name....hmmm...I wonder why. We went to the restaurant, it was 90% empty on a Saturday night and the food was sub-par. Out of curiosity, I asked the manager of the restaurant what their Zagat rating was and was told...they have never been rated. Why would the concierge lie to us and push us to go to this particular restaurant, spend $150 dollars on a terrible dinner, and make sure the restaurant credited him with the reservation? I wonder.... If you don't like noise, you should also think twice about this hotel. We asked for a room on a top floor (got 15th) given other warnings about the noise, and even being that high didn't help.

If you are planning to stay at the Omni b/c of business (ie. tradeshow at the Convention Center) ask to get a room on the bayside on a higher floor (above 15th floor). Due to the location of the hotel, one side faces the bay/convention center and the other side faces the Gaslamp/ballpark. Here are the issues with both: Facing the bayside - I've heard this is very quiet if you are on a high floor. If you are not on a high floor (below approx 15th floor) you end up getting major tooting from the trolly/train that passes right in front of the hotel. People staying in higher floors don't appear to hear it as much. Facing the Gaslamp - This faces right into the Hard Rock Hotel which has an awesome, very trendy, 4th floor bar/club. The catch - the bar is all OUTSIDE so if it's Friday or Saturday, you are sure to have the music so loud that your room in the Omni will start to rumble. Very fun when you are on business and trying to get some sleep at midnight. It's so loud that I don't think a high floor is going to help. Then the real fun starts when the bars let out at 2am and people are screaming outside.... Overall fantastic hotel, beautifully appointed beds and bathrooms. Very clean and modern with great amenities. The bar downstairs has a great happy hour menu with good drinks. If you are vacationing, this is a great hotel for you as it's close to the Gaslamp, Seaport Village, shopping, etc. If you are on business, I'd consider the Hilton or Marriot which is still very close to the convention center (the Hilton is actually slightly closer than the Omni, but not by much) and you will not have a room that faces the dreaded Hard Rock Hotel.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara Falls, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat for Kids and Convention Goers...\u201d", "Author": "Luvthesun", "ReviewID": "UR12858293", "Content": "The Omni is a first-rate hotel.

Nothing about this hotel--except a handful of helpful staff--really seemed up to the standards I've experienced elsewhere. THE ROOM Our Junior Suite was certainly large enough (520 sf), but it wasn't designed with travelers in mind; it's the equivalent of a hotel McMansion--space but no useability. Want to unpack for a few days? Good luck--no dressers, no drawers. Maybe just want to keep things in your luggage? No dice there either--no suitcase stand. We ended up stashing clothes on every available shelf including bedside tables and the TV stand. There's a huge bedroom, but no closet in it, and only one chair. So strange. The couch folds out into a bed, but in order to unfold it, you need to move an extremely heavy round glass table (I couldn't move it alone) and a side chair. Not a typical arrangement at all. The bathroom is enormous (with a good shower!), but almost unusable. The pedestal sink with tiny shelves (about 6\" x 4\", full of towels) mean there is nowhere to put a toiletry bag, makeup, etc. Also, no towel bar, and exactly one robe hook, located--I counted, eight steps--across the very large room from the shower and bath. So, I guess you should leave it in a heap on the floor? Who on earth designed this mess? THE HOTEL Attractive, modern lobby. Oddly laid out (are we sensing a theme here?) The concierge desk is waaaaaaaay over in the corner where you'd never find it without signs and directions. McCormick's and Schmick's restaurant is very good. Room service was great, fast, typically expensive. The menu seemed especially limited, though. THE SERVICE Uneven. Big compliments to the bell staff and the concierge. All were full of helpful suggestions and anticipated our needs. The front desk and housekeeping staff--not so much. Read on. . THE LITTLE PROBLEMS As a Select Guest, I've been treated very well at other Omnis. Here I was denied an upgrade (even though I had a valid voucher) because of availability, though the hotel was absolutely deserted for the time we were there (Jan 1-4, trust me, no one was in downtown San Diego the weekdays after a holiday). The OmniKids rolling backpack of activities never arrived. The bedtime milk and cookies arrived twice in one night, not at all another. Morning coffee/juice was twice left outside the door with no knock, so I eventually discovered the tray much later (and colder). Sometimes there was service for two, sometimes for three. Turndown time varied wildly from 5:30 to 9:00. At other hotels, they seem to aim for a more consistent (and convenient) 7-8 o'clock. We arranged for late checkout (rare rainy day in SD meant we had a few hours to kill and couldn't really walk around in the cold drizzle), but then had FOUR separate housekeeping staff knock on the door as we packed. None of these incidents, individually, was a Major Problem, but in aggregate they made for a stay that was consistently full of small annoyances and not what I expect from a purported five star hotel. Some dining suggestions--be advised it's far from the heart of the Gaslamp district and downtown. Nearby, eat at Mary Jane's Diner at the nearby Hard Rock (casual). Dussini Mediterranian Bistro a few blocks away was lovely for dinner (upscale). In sum: This hotel may be fine for game night or a convention, but don't go here with a family or for luxury. The suites are so poorly designed as to be a waste of the extra money--maybe the standard rooms are better. Other Omnis do a great job, but not this one. I trust Trip Advisor ratings, but in this case they're deceiving--Look hard at hotels that are more centrally located and more thoughtfully designed.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "pullthetab", "ReviewID": "UR12166411", "Content": "The Omni in San Diego was fantastic (unlike the Omni in Phila - old, dark and dusty).

I stayed here for 3 nights in November, 2007 and I'm writing this review from my room at the Omni on my last night here. The hotel is very nice. As was stated previously, the valet parking is extremely expensive---$28 per 24 hour period. But the valet parking garage is in the exact same building as the regular parking, and it's across the street. What does this mean? Simple---park the car yourself and save a ton of money! When I say \"across the street\", it's not a huge city street. The street is the size of a small alley, so the walk is very minimal. If you are made of money, sure, go ahead and use valet. But if you're like most people, just park the car yourself and walk 30 seconds to the hotel's front door. I only have two gripes, and both are very minor: 1) The staff doesn't seem to know much about the San Diego Trolley system (the Trolley is San Diego's light rail system). Also, the website for the San Diego Trolley is very poorly laid out and is confusing. For example, PETCO park is not listed on the Trolley maps, and the Omni is located next to PETCO park. Trying to figure out how to get from the hotel to ANYWHERE on the Trolley system is very confusing!!! I assumed the Omni staff downstairs at the front would be able to tell me about the Trolley system--ANYTHING about it---but they could not do this. Three front desk clerks, the gentleman who opens the front door, four Valet employees, and the Concierge..... none of these people were informed about the San Diego Trolley. Unbelievable. For those who are interested in the Trolley, the closest Trolley station to the Omni is the \"Gaslamp\" station. However, this Trolley does not run into Old Town--it requires a transfer. If you have no disabilities and are able to walk okay, all you do is walk out the front door of the hotel, turn right, walk to the right around PETCO park, and start looking for the big clock tower. At the foot of the clock tower is the Trolley station called \"12th and Imperial\". This is about a 7 minute walk, walking at a normal and comfortable speed. If you look at the San Diego Trolley website, this station looks very confusing. Why they make something simple look so complex is incredibly stupid. Even though it looks like two different stations at \"12th and Imperial\", there is only one station there. To get to Old Town, you get on a BLUE Trolley. It really is as simple as that. 2) The hotel did not honor my request for a non-connecting room. This is very minor, so I don't want to make a big deal out of it. I was actually upgraded to a \"junior suite\", but it was a connecting room. I actually would have preferred a normal room that did not connect. But they put me into room 1820 which was very nice, but I could also hear every sniffle, every sneeze, and every phone call of my neighbor in the next room. Why do hotels have SO MANY connecting rooms? Do people actually request this type of room on a regular basis? I don't know anyone who has ever requested such a room. As I said earlier, those two gripes are very minor and would absolutely NOT prevent me from staying here again. Everything here is wonderful. The turn-down service is wonderful also. In addition to turning down the bed, they turn on classical music, put mint-chocolates on the bed, and a card with hand-written information for tomorrow's forecast. If you are an Omni Select Guest member, they also put a door-card on your bed so that you can choose your morning beverages and newspaper (a free service). One small comment.....a lot of folks have made comments about the odd bathroom door and the shutters between the bathroom and the bedroom. I have to agree here. Although I am traveling alone on this trip, I think it would be weird to have more than one person in the room when using the bathroom. There is no \"sound-proofing\" at all. Closing the door is just to block the view---it does not block the sound at all. And as someone else noted in another review, there is no fan in the bathroom. So you can get a mental picture on your own---no sound blocking and no fan. What were the designers thinking?????? I am looking forward to my next trip to San Diego so that I can stay at this hotel again!

There was never a wait for the car, room service, etc. The rooms are big, with nice modern decor and great views. The large bathrooms stock the typical Omni products and two decent robes. The beds and linens are great. If you are Omni Select you get complimentary drinks and your choice of newspaper in the morning--- which is a nice touch. It also comes with complimentary internet (high speed- no wireless). I think you can get the free internet even if your aren't Omni Select. It is also worth it to join Omni Select for the express check-in. You can check-in the day before online. You get to the hotel...and you are already checked in and your keys are waiting for you. It really does save a lot of time. Literally---NO WAITING! You just go right on up to your room. The pool and jacuzzi area is very pretty. There are lots of lounge chairs. On a game day Saturday, the pool was packed. On game day Sunday it wasn't crowded at all. The pool has a very adult feel. However, both days there were several children playing. They seemed to have a good time. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for children, and it isn't necessarily a place where you are guaranteed a relaxing adult afternoon. The pool towels are great and serviced regularly. Room service happily provides service to the area. The gym is a nice size and has plenty of cardio equipment. They provide plenty of water and a nice fruit bowl. The gym is just off the pool area and does have a shower. You can easily check out...stay by the pool...and shower in the gym before your flight. There is only one-shower in the gym...so plan ahead if you are with a big group. The location is great for the downtown area. There are lots of restaurants, stores, etc. within walking distance. Horton Plaza is about a 10 minute walk. Seaport Village is about a 15 minute walk. There are also lots of pedicabs in the area. Here are some tips that will help your trip. If you are a light sleeper---bring ear plugs. On Friday and Saturday nights it is possibly that you will hear your neighbors and the train. Call the hotel before and get directions to the hotel on game nights. Downtown San Diego has a lot of one-way streets and many of them close on game nights. It is terribly frustrating trying to get there with Mapquest, Google Maps, etc. The bathroom doors are not typical and you can feel exposed in the bathroom.

The concierge with constantly helpful with directions, maps, restaurant suggestions (Rama, the Thai restaurant, is a MUST for an outstanding lunch). When one of our bags was waylaid by Air Canada, two toothbrushes, paste, and other assorted essential toiletries appeared in our bathroom. We were impressed. The cleaning was impeccable. The room was well cleaned daily and the pool and fitness areas were also tidy and well cared for. The pool water, when accidentally ingested, was a little reminiscent of pee, but I think that was probably unavoidable due to the conference resulting in tons of kids in the pool at a time. Finally, the proximity of this hotel to all things important and exciting in San Diego CANNOT be overemphasized. Due to the layout of the convention center, we had a shorter walk to the conference (maybe 200 yards) than our colleagues staying at the Marriott (which is actually ATTACHED to the convention center, but at the far end of it). We were on the edge of the famous Gaslamp District with its excellent shopping and restaurants, a short (10-15 minutes) walk to Seaport Village, the dock, and the fabulous Horton shopping complex (complete with Nordstrom's and many high-end small boutique stores), and a moderate walk (30-40 minutes) to famous Balboa Park and San Diego Zoo. The hotel location is conducive to pedestrian travel. Of course, no review is complete without a critique or two. The elevators were so slow as to be the subject of many amused (and not-so-amused) comments by guests. On our longest trip we made a full NINE stops between the lobby and the 19th floor where we were staying. We were told that this was related to the unusual volume of conference traffic. The restaurant/lounge was a little expensive even by San Diego standards (we didn't try it as a result). Our \"conference rate\" for the hotel seemed somewhat exhorbitant at $USD 239 (although comparable to other local hotels at that time).

Check-in was quick and courteous. My \"premium\" room on the 12th floor was quite large and on a corner, with a view of the bay out one window and of Petco Park out the other. While I felt close enough to the stadium to practically touch it, I was not high enough to see into the stadium. I did go to a Padres game--it's very convenient because there's a skyway on the 4th floor of the hotel that leads directly into the park. The view of the bay is somewhat spoiled by the convention center across the steet (see photo). I could hear the trains passing a couple of times a night below; I might suggest a room facing San Diego's downtown skyline (very pretty at night) for those bothered by that. The room was nicely decorated, with attractive use of wood and modern furniture. The king-size bed was extremely comfortable; however, I felt the sheets could have been smoother. The flat-screen TV was great. I agree with other reviewers that the bathroom is different--the door closes by pulling two doors together (but no gap problems that I could see). I liked the louver arrangement others have commented on--when I opened them, it felt like having windows in the bathroom; I could see the bay as I was getting ready in the morning. I ordered room service for dinner, and the food (salmon) was excellent though expensive (about $40 including service fees). Amenities in the room are of excellent quality--especially loved the scented soap. One tip - I first thought there was no coffeemaker but then found it and coffee and tea supplies in a cabinet under the TV. I felt that the hotel doesn't have enough elevators--there was often a wait at busy times.

Booked on Expedia in the UK 3 weeks before and got room only for 3 people for \u00a375 ($150) per night. Our experince of this hotel was very positive indeed. I have read alot of the reviews and I have to agree with the majority of reviewers - this is a well run, clean and conveneint hotel. Our room on the 9th floor overlooked the convention centre and yes, there is train noise (this seems to be due to there being a crossing at 5th and Harbor and train drivers seem intent on sounding the horn repeatedly as they approach). Did it spoil the stay? No. The room had 2 double beds, the linen being clean and the beds were comfortable. All of the decor was tidy and clean and the coffeee maker was stocked up daily. The bathroom is great - ours was clean and everyting worked well - the decor is very contemporary and there is a great stock of soap, shampoo etc - even a small mouthwash and sew kit. The door is a bit odd but the gap isn't a problem (but you cannot lock the bathroom door). Ate breakfast in the onsite restaurant which is OK but a bit pricey. Morsel's coffee bar is good and sells Starbucks! Only real gripe is room service - pricey to begin with but prices do not include extras such as 20% service and $3 delivery charges! A cup of Starbucks delivered to the room is something like $14!!! We found the staff were very friendly during our stay - to the extent that the doorman would greet you on your return with a \"welcome back!\" We did use the valet parking and it isn't cheap but I had no problems (the 4 nights we were there coincided with 4 evening Padre games - when a game is on, downtown is chaotic and self parking a nightmare). Close by are all attractions (valet will give you a map and offer directions) and it is a 10 minute walk to Seaport. Lots of resturants etc close by incluing Hard Rock on 4th - about 15 minutes to walk. Overall, do not be put off by some negative reviews.

This hotel was not my first choice but my first choice was booked. I agree with everyone on the location, it is centrally located and you can walk or take a short cab ride to many area attractions. However, there are several better hotels in this same area. I booked a non-smoking king room and was given a smoking room with double beds. I knew the second I opened the door to the room and my throat was on fire from the second-hand smoke. The bell captain called the front desk to see if I could switch and was told the hotel was completely booked and there were absolutely no rooms available. I went to the front desk myself and was told the same thing. When I asked to speak to a manager, he left me there waiting with no explanation and then returned 10 minutes later saying they had a non-smoking room. Magic perhaps? I am not sure why I had to go through 2 other channels and escalate to a manager before being given a non-smoking room. The room was still a double but I was fine with that, the smoke was the main concern. Anyway, the decor is rather old looking, internet access is hit or miss, the bathroom is odd and there is not much room on the shelves for your personal items. I ordered room service and the french dip sandwhich was salty and the french fries cold. There was also a lot of noise in the outside area and difficult to sleep. Another thing I did not like was the bathroom door. It is this funny styled door which does not close completely.

I had this opportunity at the Omni San Diego this past week. I almost did not stay here due to parking and location issues but was glad I made the decision to be an Omni guest. Two very qualified concierges manned the information desk at most all waking hours and they were full of suggestions and could field an answer for almost any need. The housekeeping and front desk and valet parking people were equally helpful and always friendly. The lobbies, public spaces, pool and gym were all very attractive and well maintained. The rooms were very comfortable with perfect mattresses, better sheets than I have at home, robes, supplies, etc. I liked the \"louvered doors\" which slide open to make the bathroom sort of a part of the room, (but I can understand the reasons some reviewers might feel this compromises privacy). I did notice, that even though the hotel is pretty new, it must be getting used a lot by the baseball and convention crowds (Hotel sits between the baseball stadium and the convention center) and there was some minor carpet wear, tiny hole in comforter, and wear on the chair. Hopefully the management will catch these things before they begin to drag the place down. There are a couple of other glitches but none would stop me from staying here again. As most people mention, paying $26 for parking is a drag. However, I must say that the valets had my car to me in no time and in-and-outs are included in the bill. Some friends paid $15 for a parking deck a block away but could only take the car out once a day. The nearest free street parking looked to be about a 20 minute walk away, up by Balboa Park. The other problem mentioned by members of my group is the blowing of a whistle or horn by a nearby freight train in the wee hours of the morning. I heard it but quickly went back to sleep. You might discuss this when making reservations and ask for a room facing away from the train location...but then this might also knock you out of a view of the bay. If you have one, you might consider taking along a battery powered \"white noise\" machine which masks out sounds of the night. I forgot mine this trip. (You can get these at places like Sharper Image). Despite these glitches, I heartily recommend this hotel. It was a great experience. My rate was $131 (but it was a group rate for my conference/class so I can't comment on the relative value of normal rates).

Unfortunately, my second time staying at this hotel was not so great. This past weekend, I stayed at the Omni for one night. The room and the service were great. Everything was in working order and prompt. There were two major problems happened during my stay except the following: The first problem was the noise issue. I had room 1601. It was one of those room that connects to the adjoining room. Nothing was wrong with that arrangement until two AM in the morning. There was a bunch of young women (think sority) talking and screaming loudly. It was as though they were in our room. I called the front desk (or the \"immediate service\" or something like that) but there was no answer. I came down to the front desk and explained to them the problem. They said they can send security up. I told them that would be a possible solution. However, I also told them that those women were talking loudly but it was in their room. I needed my sleep but at the same time, I felt that those women should be able to talk as it was \"their\" room. Instead, they gave us another room to sleep in without having to move my things. I thought that was a very nice gesture of them. The second problem had to do with the valet parking. The valet parking costed me 27 dollars per night with in and out previleges. There was no self parking. There was so much scratches and chipped paint damaged to my car. My car is relatively new. I knew that the scratch must have taken place during the my stay at the Omni because I had washed and waxed the car right before I left for San Diego. I did not use my car during my stay at the hotel. I called the manager and explained the situation. He was then informed me that the parking manager would call me. The parking manager called me two hours later and explained that they contract with Ace Parking. Furthermore, they will pay for the repair. The damage to my car was not that major. At the same, when you handed them your car, it is expected that they would take care of it. It just principle of things. If you need a place to stay in downtown San Diego, the Omni is a fine place.

The curtain was so dusty to the point that it looked disgustingly stained. There were holes in the shower curtain and hair on the bathroom floor.

First, the positives: staff were uniformly friendly and helpful; check-in was easy; and the building is beautiful. The room was pleasant enough (although the sheets were scratchy and the mattress was uncomfortable, and there were only two pillows on the bed). The gym facility was great. But helpful staff aside, the hotel -- at least during our stay -- missed some of the small details that better hotels wouldn't let slip by. Valet attendants, while friendly, didn't offer to help with luggage. Our room was missing a hotel information guide/room service menu. Our package rate was supposed to include the parking fee, but it appeared on the bill nonetheless, requiring a trip to the front desk to get it fixed. A note left on the bedside table promised that the bedside clock would change automatically to reflect the \"spring forward\" daylight savings time change; it did not. Individually, these small things weren't a big deal at all, but cumulatively, it seemed like the hotel didn't quite have its act together. And as noted by many reviewers here, the bathroom door design is just ridiculous -- there is literally a one-inch gap between the door and the wall, giving anyone sitting in the bedroom a clear view directly of the toilet. If you're not extremely comfortable with your traveling companion, this is not the hotel for you.

We were also able to walk to Balboa park and the zoo (which is spectacular and well worth a visit) - this took a bit longer (maybe 30-45 mins) however there is a tour bus which operates near to the hotel which does pick up/drop off along a lot of the tourist routes including the zoo. The Omni is also right next to a tram stop and the tram is a cheap way to get about (if you arrive in San Diego by train you get door to door service with the tram for $1.25! The only potential downsides for this hotel were as others have said. Firstly, I do think the design of the bathroom was a little odd with shuttered sliding doors which doesn't quite close fully. It wasn't a major issue but I think it's a little different! Also, noise is definitely an issue as the hotel is right next to a freight rail track with a road intersection and there was a lot of noise coming from trains during the night/early morning which did wake us (we were on the 12th floor). There is also a fair bit of building work going on around San Diego and our room was quite close to a building under construction and there was some noise from that in the early mornings. The Omni was so great in other aspects I wasn't really bothered about these downsides but I imagine if you're a light sleeper it might be worth asking if they have any rooms which are quieter than others.", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cA perfect start to our honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "EllieC", "ReviewID": "UR6339851", "Content": "We spent the first 4 nights of our honeymoon at the Omni San Diego and could not have made a better choice.

From the moment I walked in I thought Wow! The lobby is modern and beautiful. We booked a premium room which guarantees a view of the bay. I thought the guy at the front desk was very professional and friendly. Our room was really nice and the bathroom was spacious and trendy. I will have to agree with the other reviewers on the sliding bathroom door. It doesn't close all the way, so it's slightly ajar. It was a big problem for us. If your shy it might be an issue. Even though we were on the 20th floor I heard the trains passing by. It was terrible, but I don't think it matters what floor your on. You can't get a way from the trains. Unless, maybe you book a room that faces downtown. Not sure. The view from my room was spectacular and worth the extra we paid. Since the hotel is right next to the convention center, you never know what's going on there. Thanksgiving morning I was woke up at 7:30am with bluesy music playing really loud. I thought maybe it was the people next door. I called the front desk and they said it was a concert going on at the convention center. I felt like I was about ten rows back from the stage. They apologized and offered ear plugs, which I gladly took. Thank God I was able to go back to sleep. So check the convention center schedule and maybe let that determine which side of the hotel you book the room. Again everyone was really nice. Oh, the beds are to die for. It was super comfortable and more soft than firm. I usually prefer firm mattresses but this was pretty nice. Slept really well except for the situation I mentioned earlier. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants. Everything is in walking distance of the hotel. Bars, restaurants, movie theaters, shopping. We didn't get into the car once. We parked across the street instead of valet which was $24. The parking structure was $8 per day. So if you're going to stay longer than two days with a car. Price compare and see which is more cost effective. I would definitely go back, but I'd probably just make sure I'm on the other side of the hotel. It was good times though!

First mistake made, our room wasn't ready. We spent time at the hotel bar and each had two drinks - which should have been comped and wasn't. At least the bartender was very attractive and friendly. Since we had two rooms - and somehow not next to each other or even on the same floor - we each had different views. My room had a view of the convention center and in the distance you could see the bay. My friend's room had a view of the bay and Petco Park. The room itself was nice (and small). None of us liked the bathroom door. It was a sliding door that did not give total privacy due to the sides of the door being always open and the door itself was mostly frosted glass. We complained that the room did not get nearly as cold as we wanted and we called 3 consecutive days until finally we found a note from maintenance on the 3rd day telling us that the air unit was working properly. We did not understand how we could set the air at 70 and it would only get as low as 74. The hallway felt like it was 65. Perhaps the sun in the windows kept the room too warm and the air just couldn't keep up. That was frustrating and uncomfortable as we like it cooler. We ordered breakfast for 2 the first morning. After taxes, numerous surcharges and tip = $75. I only ate half of mine as it was not very good. We didn't make that mistake twice. Valet parking is outrageously priced so we had to drive around the block, pay for parking and walk back to the hotel every day. That was annoying. A hotel of this class should have it's own garage. The positives - the hotel is very clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. Good customer service saved them from a lower rating. The hotel location is great as we went to the Gaslamp Quarter almost every night. Lots of good places to eat and drink there. Stay away from the hotel food, save a few bucks and get a better meal. We had tickets to the Padres game and the private entrance to the stadium on the 3rd floor was very nice. Would I stay here again? Only if my company paid the bill. There is no way that I would spend that much for a hotel like that. One restaurant, one bar, no entertainment and lots of extra costs. I have stayed in far better hotels for the price.

The next day while we were out someone came in to clean our room......and did a horrible job. I am not a neat freak....so for me to even notice is saying something. Counters in the bathroom were not wiped down, all the curtains were left closed, there was wrappers from things we hadn't even used on the floor, bathroom supplies were not replenished.....apart from making the beds up, very little was done. This in no way ruined our stay at the hotel, it really is a minor thing.

Firstly, I tried to get the speciaI rate $129.00 by booking online at their website with the special promo code, but when I entered the whole 4 nights of my stay it didn't show the $129.00 rate at all. Therefore...I then emailed Omni reservations direct and had a prompt reply from Joshua in Reservations, stating he could do the 1st three nights at $129.00 and the last night at $279.00. Which I was really happy with and when I replied to that email that the web booking didn't allow more than 1 night at the cheap rate, I was advised to email Reservations my credit card for booking confirmation and my booking would be processed. THEN I receive another email stating that he (Joshua) made a mistake and only the 1st night was at the $129.00 rate. The emails then went back and forth as I replied that he DID in fact quote me on the 3 nights and if it was a mistake, thought that the quoted price he supplied in his email to me should be honored by the Hotel. Next thing I get another email stating ALL the rooms within the special rate of $129.00 ARE SOLD OUT. But get this, I then immediately went back to their website to check, and there are STILL rooms available at $129.00 for the 5th April (which I think is when the special rate ends) I think the management don't want to honour the quoted price that Joshua made to me of $129.00 for 1st three nights ( 5 to 7th April and then 8th April @ $279.00) Very dissapointed with MANAGEMENTS decision, as I do have the emails from Joshua quoting the special price for the first 3 nights of $129.00 my 4 night intended stay in a Premium room with Bay view & 2 x double beds increasing to $279.00 for the 4th night (staying in the same room) Thats my winge about this hotel Hotel may be in good location etc but when it comes to honouring their quoted prices their service is at rock bottom.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot as good as it thinks it is\u201d", "Author": "Ed L", "ReviewID": "UR5924166", "Content": "I booked this through Hotwire and got a rate of abot 250USD over a weekend, a big saving on the usual 500 USD price tag.

Highlights: The pool area is warm and inviting with music that plays undewater-my son got a kick out of that. and yes, the hotel is kid friendly. The service seemed to be on par and not overly patronizing in that phony way one sometimes finds in hotels. There is the now-requisite outdoor fireplace that all west coast properties seem to have these days but it is mainly for display as no real heat was generating from it but who needed it this time of year anyways?? We got tickets to a Padre's game and Petco Park is worth seeing even if you arent catching a game. We were, and really enjoyed the skywalk which takes you directly to the park from the hotel. All you need is a room key to enter. For baseball fans, this may be \"the place to stay\" in San Diego. As for the room, well I am not one to nitpick a very nice place, which the Omni certainly is but I have to say that the bathroom door which in our room was part clouded glass, while visually pleasing from a decorative standpoint, did not lend itself to alot of privacy nor was there a fan in the bathroom. Now, being married for twelve years, I can say that wasnt really an issue, it still wasnt practical and I can imagine that some couples might find the design uncomfortable for their stay. In addition, the coffee maker had to be taken out of the wall console and plugged in at the desk where my laptop was situated. Again, not a huge deal but an inconveninece none the less. And since the tv/stereo had electrical hookup, a little forethought, could have remedied this design flaw. The conference rooms were quite adequate. I believe the service was good as well and the temperature was not below freezing as is the case with many hotel meeting rooms. As for food service, the meals at the conference were quite nice and above the average that I have had. We did not eat in the hotel restaurants due to a plethora of places in the surrounding area. But I did see the buffet for breakfast at McCormick and Schmicks and it did look enticing and a good value. Conceierge was busy but helpful.

When signing up as a Select Guest, there are a number of choices that you can pick from, for example, we chose a high floor corner room that ended up being an amazing room! The views of the bay and gaslamp quarter were gorgeous. There were a few things that could be a tiny bit better, parking was $24 a day but there is a lot that you can park in across the street, so it wasn't that big of an issue. The pool was kinda small also, but there is a great patio for sunbathing or just eating and relaxing. The location was great, on the southern tip of the gaslamp quarter, literally attached to Petco Park, across the street from the convention center and the bay and about 15 minutes driving distance from Mission Beach or Pacific Beach.

The rooms are large and pleasant, I was lucky enough to have a corner room with a balcony overlooking the open air pool on the 6th floor and also a view of the trolley stop and the convention centre. It is the freight trains in the middle of the night honking their horns that can be noisy. The pool is lovely and the gym OK, bit basic - no rowing machines. I had no problems with service. Although food is good the restaurant is functional, not what you would call a four star fine dining experience. The Gas lamp quarter with lots of restaurants and bars is nearby. There is a small bar next to the restaurant. The coffeee bar has a small shop for gifts. The free wireless internet connection in rooms is a real bonus. I was able to have a free video conference with my kids at home in the UK through a wireless laptop, Messanger Live and a cheap web cam, cheaper than phone calls from a mobile!. The safe in the room is handy for storing laptops, cameras or other valuables. There is also a business centre with full interenet and printing facilities. There are some seats in the lobby but no other public seating areas, apart from the outdoor pool area, even the bar doesn't have many seats. Just outside the hotel, near the tram stop are some water jets in the paving that the kids love playing in. The hotel is very chic and modern and can be very busy but overall is a good hotel in a great location. San Diego is a great city to visit;; the Gaslamp quarter, the harbour, the USS Midway aircraft carrier, the Old town, Bilbao Park, San Diego Zoo, La Jolla, The Dell Coronado Hotel were all worth seeing.

But the real problem was in how they handled the second problem. The night before I was to check out (at 6 am to catch a flight), I called and asked for a wake up call. Someone answered the phone and confirmed the time that I would be given a call. The alarm clocks in the room give you the option of either radio, CD, or natural sounds (who wakes up to the sound of the ocean??), but no buzzer. So I was counting on that wakeup call. I didn't get it and ended up missing my flight as a result. When I went down to check out at a little before 8am, the manager on duty confirmed that I didn't get a call and apologized. He put me in a cab to the airport at the hotel's expense, so I was happy about that. The strange thing though was that he wanted me to leave my bags at the hotel. I asked why and his explanation was that they would be there in case I couldn't get on a standby flight. I asked what if I do get on standby, what happens to my bags? He said they would drive them over. Apparently the manager has never flown on an airplane because that makes no sense. By the time you get confirmed for standby, there isn't time for bags to be shuttled to the airport, come back outside security to get them, go back inside, etc. etc. Anyway, aside from the bizarre recomendation to leave my bags, I was still happy that they did whatever was necessary to get me to the airport ASAP. My real beef is the next thing that happened... When I got back to Dallas, I saw a huge second charge on my credit card, to the tune of about $150. I called to ask what it was and left several messages that were never returned until days later. While waiting for the callback, I called again and asked to speak to the hotel desk to see if someone could tell me what the charge was for. I finally spoke with the manager on duty and he researched and told me that it was from the mini-bar. I said, \"WHAT?? I never even opened the mini-bar, I certainly didn't take or consume anything from it.\" The manager then began to argue with me over the charges, as if I was a liar and thief. He was unbelievably rude. I spent a huge amount of money to stay at the hotel, they then tack on some other wrong charges, and *I'm* the one who is being given the second degree?? He starts listing the timeline, \"Our records show you checked out at 1:30pm, we checked the mini-bar at 2:00pm....\" etc. I say, hold on, you don't even have these times right. I checked out at about 8:00am, and I can prove that I was in another city eating lunch at the time you have me checked out. He goes on to say that's all irrelevant, the charges are still correct [because his computer tells him so]. I said, no, your records are demonstrably incorrect on many aspects, you can't tell me that despite all the other errors, you are certain that the charge is correct--someone obviously inputted someone else's data to my name or room or whatever. He continued to argue with me and that's when I lost it. I finally told him that they either fix the charges or I'm disputing them with my credit card company, I took nothing, and I refuse to pay for something I didn't take. He finally said in a huff that they would remove the charges, but there was no apology, no acknowledgement that the mistake might have been theirs. There was never an offer to look into it or investigate, etc. He was only doing it because I refused to pay it, as if I was just some scummy person trying to get away with something. I refuse to let some manager impugn my character when the mistake was the hotel's. I've left a message with the general manager about the manager's terrible attitude and haven't yet gotten a callback.

The Omni actually has ballpark view which allow you to see into the stadium. That's pretty neat. Definitely the place to stay if you're going to see a Padres game. There are actually about 5 tables with seats on the 6th floor that allow you to do work and look into the stadium. The 6th floor also has a decent and quiet seating area to do some work (across from the fitness center). Pool is nice, a bit small for the size of the hotel, but heated. There is also a nice little hot tub. Not a big pool area though, compared to the Hyatt Manchester Grand down the road. Hotel is very clean and has a nice, modern look. It looks brand new actually. Rooms are nice and are cleaned efficiently and quickly. Turndown service with some chocolates at night are nice (for Omni Select Guests). Select Guests also receive free coffee or orange/grapefruit juice in the morning along with their choice of newspaper. It's delivered right to the door. A nice touch.

There are even cracks in the side so anyone walking by can see. The Omni might has well have hanged a sheet or piece of plastic in between the bathroom and bedroom. It was so annoying. There is a complete lack of privacy and you have to essentially tell people not to get near the bathroom when you are in there. Bathroom is nice, with nice shelving, but the door needs to go! Also, the $24/night valet parking is outrageous. The valet guys are annoying as well and aren't very efficient. I would prefer a lot to park in where I could come and go as I please. Also, due to the location being in downtown, and there is a lot of construction all over downtown, there can be banging throughout the day.

That was a plus...it took us 5 mins to get from our room to our seats! All of the Omni staff we came in contact with were incredibly cordial and helpful. We decided to do the $24/day valet parking after all, just because of the convenience and the in/out privledges (even though we didn't even need the car the whole weekend!). They do park the car in the same lot as the $9/day self park lot across the street, but I didn't mind paying extra for the convenience. Upon check-in we were given a 20% off coupon for the McCormick and Schmicks restaurant in the lobby...quite a good deal!! The food was good and actually, even if you are not staying at the hotel and eat there, you can use the convenient pedestrian bridge to Petco Park. We reserved a King room. The room was not super large but definitely fine and cozy for 2 people. It was a busy weekend so unfortunately we couldn't get an ocean view room and instead got a view of the city. There is quite a lot of construction going on so we did hear some of that on Fri and Sat, but the windows are pretty thick so it wasn't too bad nor an issue for us. The bed was extremely comfy, and the bathroom was huge considering the overall size of the room. We didn't have those wierd slats like others have complained about (between the bedroom and bath) but I must agree the hotel walls are quite thin. This only bugged me the first night..unfortunately I could hear the couple next door having a \"good time.\" But, earplugs were the easy solution and I slept like a baby. There were no noise issues for us the second night at all. Unfortunately the bathroom doesn't have a fan, we thought that was a little strange. But we did like the fact that you can open the bedroom windows. We used the gym both days and really liked the setup. The orange water, apples/oranges, towels and spotless facility were definite plusses. The pool area looked really nice, but we didn't use it due to the cool and gloomy weather that weekend. Do register for the Omni's Select Guest Program....the room was set up to our specs (extra towels, turndown service, get fit kit) and we really enjoy the complimentary morning beverage service. The other great advantage is late check out! We left by 230 but Select Guests can stay as late as 5pm. All in all our stay at the Omni San Diego was great.

We did not have a view of the water or ballpark but the bellman did arrange for us to be moved to a higher floor so we were not looking directly into the parking structure.

I was given no satisfactory explanation except that they were very busy. OK, I thought, I will go for a late lunch with friends. I ended up staying out till around 5pm, when I arrived at the hotel and asked for my room. The check in person looked distressed and seemed to be searching for an available room. The manager on duty was called, and he also seemed to be searching for an availble room. Finally, he snapped his fingers \"voila\" that he had found one. I was directed to the room. This turned out to be on the 7th floor, however, only one floor above the pool and large terrace area. There was a large party with loud speakers just under my window, and needless to say, having booked a high floor, I refused the room. I called the manager back and was told that: 1. \"there were no other available rooms of this type\"; I asked why this was the case when I was holding a confirmed reservation. I was told that others had booked since I booked and had arrived before me so this was it. I told the manager that I was dissatified and considering I had called ahead I thought this was unacceptable. I also asked why the room I had booked was not available. He then admitted that there was a guest in my room who was a \"select guest\" and they were therefore entitled to a 5pm checkout. I asked how it was that I could pay for a room (3pm check in) and have another guest be allowed to stay in my room. I was then told that, as soon as the \"select guest\" was checked out and the room was cleaned, I would be allowed to move up and could I please be patient. However, by 6pm, my room was not availble.

It was a local getaway splurge, so we went for a junior suite with the \"Night on the Town\" package. It is an expensive hotel, but the package offers a better value, including dinner at McCormick & Schmicks and valet parking for much less than the standard rate for the room only. Our junior suite was a true suite with a separate living room with couch, desk, TV, etc. divided by a sliding door from the large bedroom with a view of the Coronado Bay Bridge. We've stayed in many so-called suites that were simply slightly larger rooms - not the case here! The bath had none of the problems described in earlier reviews - it was large, with a separate tub and shower enclosure and a regular door. We had no noise problems what so ever! As mentioned in other reviews, the location is great, especially for our purpose, attending the Padres opening game! The bellstaff and front desk staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. The food and the service in the restaurant were excellent. Also as already mentioned, definitely sign up for the \"Select Guest\" program.

My wife ordered standard fare while I liked to try different things. The food was well presented, however it was not anything too special. The seafood restaurant was standard as well. We had dinner our first nights stay and although the service was good, the food was not exceptional. Its not that I am not recommending that you eat there, just beware that its not comparable to what I experienced at the San Francisco's Omni. The cookies we ordered one evening from room service were huge, but sorta tasted like something from a box. I would stay here again for my next visit.

For dinner, the kids menu is only $5. and the shrimp, e.g. are large prawns, not that frozen popcorn shrimp. The rest. specializes in seafood and the fish is so fresh that they post the catch date on the menu. Beware the preparation, though, which overpowers the excellent fish.

I chose the property based on 2 reasons: great Expedia flight and hotel package (which gave me $1,400 in savings) and of course, reviews from Tripadvisor. We stayed in room 1733 : corner room on the 17/f, 2 double beds, with a great view of the Petco Park next door. We were very thankful that the Omni had accommodated these requests -- and were even able to check in as early as 7:30 am, as we took the first flight out of San Francisco. The room was simply elegant and modern. From the cool alarm clock that my daughter was itching to play with, to the funky sliding bathroom door which did not pose a problem to us. In fact, my daughter had a blast peeking through that 1 inch gap whenever me or my husband would be in the bathroom! While I loved the plentiful shelves in the bathroom, my husband was impressed with the nice balcony (not an open one) that you can just gaze out endlessly to the game next door. Again, this is while my kid goes on and off the weighing scale in the bathroom, which is also a nice touch. Housekeeping did an excellent job in maintaining our rooms spotless throughout our stay. Room always smelled fresh and new, and even in the hallways as you come out from the elevator. Equally good was the turndown service that you get every night -- mint chocolates with next day's weather forecast on your pillow, dimmed lights, plus a soothing Omni channel on the TV that plays as you enter your room at night. The doormen in the morning and evening (Dave and Anthony, respectively) were very friendly and would always ask us where we are going for the day or where we have been. The valet guys (though we only used the service for a night) also had smiles for us whenever we come back to the hotel. Concierge, as expected, was courteous and knowledgeable with just about everything we needed to know about the area. The Front Desk were all very pleasant. I was surprised though at check-in that I was not asked for identification when i registered. Being a Front Desk agent myself, I found that kinda strange since my reservation has already been prepaid. Oh well,... =) My 2 complaints -- which are not much: 1. we were not able to get our complimentary morning beverage as shared by other TA reviewers. Though I signed up for the Select Guest membership prior to my stay, I was informed by the Front Desk that I need to have stayed previously in an Omni property to enjoy that particular service. Funny, but we got the other amenities/service (late checkout, morning paper, turndown service) that came along with the Select Guest membership. 2. fee to rent a fridge is $25/night. since we were staying for 8 nights, i don't think i can afford to pay $200 just to keep my daughter's milk from going stale. so we just made do of the ice bucket to serve that purpose. Overall, the hotel was an excellent base for our sightseeing activities in San Diego. Initially, we thought we were out of place seeing all the convention people staying in the hotel! But then we realize that we made the right choice and we are very happy to have stayed in one of the best hotels, if not the best, in San Diego.

I have stayed at many hotels all around the world, and this is the first to do anything like this. It was awesome. Some tips about staying at the hotel: 1. Make sure you register for the Select Guest program!!!! It gives you the opportunity to have complimentary beverages and a newspaper in the morning, as well as a late check-out up until 5pm. That was a great help for us since we didn't want to leave until the evening. Also, the select guest membership gives you deals and special rates for later days. 2. I highly reccomend the Valet parking ($24/night), due to the unlimited in/out privelages. Make sure to call down to the valet on your way down, and when you get outside your car will be there waiting. 3. The breakfast Buffet at the restaurant is also very good.

We liked the location at the tail end of the Gaslamp Quarter. Since there were no games at Petco during our stay, I decided to park our rental car on the street. With the exception of having to get out of bed early on Saturday to feed the meter till we felt like really waking up, it was relatively painless-- just remember that once meters aren't enforced (after 6 pm, Sundays, holidays), you can park in yellow zones (and there are a lot of those around the hotel). The room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable. The pool area was stylish. The concierge was quite helpful. We nibbled at happy hour at the McCormick and Schmick's in the lobby and were generally pleased-- be warned that it's not the same happy hour menu as at the M&S in downtown Los Angeles. I've also stayed at the Sheraton in downtown San Diego and felt that the Omni had better service, better rooms, and a better location.
