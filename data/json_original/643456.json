The balcony doors and curtains block out all light and most of the noise and we had no problem sleeping through the city sounds. La Rambla really stays awake until 6am.

It's a 2-star hotel but it's cheap, clean, has internet/WiFi and is situated right on the Pla\u00e7a Reial, next to las ramblas. the hotel is about a 5-7 minute walk to either the Metro station Liceu or the Metro station Drassanes. At this particular spot you are surrounded by bars, restaurants and the Gothic District (Barri Gotic) of Barcelona, close to many of the city's main tourist attractions. Once here, you hardly ever need a taxi or a car! Another advantage is, you can walk 12-15 minutes to the Pla\u00e7a Catalunya to take the Aerobus to go to the airport. This hotel is perfect for those who are looking for a budget-hotel or who are just going to use the room to sleep and put the luggage down. It has no air-con, so in the summer the room will be hot, even with the fan on. The room is small but clean, they change the towels and soaps daily. But because you are on the Pla\u00e7a Reial, you will hear some noise when you sleep in your room, but hey it's a 2-star hotel, so that's ok! Only thing to be careful is that the reception desk does not like it when you take your room key outside the hotel, so always leave your key at the desk when you go outside the hotel. Security wise, the hotel is safe. Payment can be done by credit-card or cash. It has it's own online reservation on the internet, but you could also reserve your room via the online reservation that is on the Turisme Barcelona's website.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cPlease do not make the same mistake we did.. - do not stay here!!!\u201d", "Author": "SydneyCooza", "ReviewID": "UR38737416", "Content": "Our first mistake was arriving in Barcelona and not having pre-booked accommodation, we walked down Las Ramblas and stumbled across the Hotel Fornos, just set back from the road and in a great location. This was the only good thing about this hotel. The man at the desk was rude, didn't give a toss about our requests, the internet didn't work (and again the guy behind the desk just shrugged his shoulders), the room was foul, the fans in the room didn't work and the bathroom was not safe to wash in for fear of catching something.

You're right in the heart of a main street, where it's super busy and no one seems to sleep-- at all. I was in Barcelona the same time everyone from Manchester, England seemed to be as well, watching the futbol match, so it was super loud with the partyers on La Rambla--and every other nook in downtown Barcelona, no matter what time of day or night. The hotel room is small-- for a single, after all-- but it was clean and served its purpose. It's a no frills place-- ideal for college students and backpackers. NOT for the high maintenance! It's value for being on La Rambla was great, too. The hotel smelled like cigarettes that have permeated through the walls for years, so I often propped the door to the balcony open to let in fresh air.
