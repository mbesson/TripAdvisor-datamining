Everything about The Kayana is of a high standard from the hotel design, beautiful contemporary decor to the staff and service. It is better in reality than the photos on its own website which is rare.In fact the service was the best I have experienced and I have travelled far and wide including places such as Japan and the Maldives which are renowned for their customer service. The staff were very polite, helpful and genuine in their manner. We were even invited to the hotel ceremony with an explanation of the customs. They had the right mix of giving guests privacy but at the same time no request was too much.The complimentary car shuttle service is a bonus as it meant we could go out every evening for a meal or even alone without worrying about how to get back. The airport drop off also made our holiday stress free. Other complimentary services such as a candle lit evening meal by the pool and a his and hers massage were great. In fact the spa is fabulous and although more expensive than elsewhere in Bali it is well worth it for the relaxation room with waterfall shower and great ginger tea after the treatment. We also enjoyed a free mini bar for the first couple of days and free evening snacks.  The hotel had only been open 6 months so the delux villa we stayed in was spotless and room service did an excellent job twice a day. The attention to detail was amazing - we appreciated the small touches such as leaving flowers in the rolled up towelled and by the side of the bath. The four poster bed was comfortable and the TV and DVD/CD player were much appreciated when my husband had to stay indoors for a couple of days due to sunburn. He watched back to back James Bond movies!The fans outside in the garden above the table and sofa made breakfast outside the villa and reading on the sofa very comfortable. We usually put on our own music whilst having breakfast which was very relaxing. The villa was also very quiet and private with staff ringing on the intercom before entering.We spent our honeymoon this year at a five star resort in the Maldives where we paid three times as much and the accommodation and standards were not as good as The Kayana. The Kayana is great value for money as it is truly luxurious. The only negative I can think of is that it is a 5 - 10 min walk to the beach and probably better to eat outside the hotel to take advantage of local prices and variety.We did say several times if Carlsberg did villas.... it would be The Kayana.S  JSeptember 2007", "Date": "Oct 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR686756958", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SandJTaylor"}, {"Content": "Honeymoon heaven! We were wanting a little bit of luxury for our honeymoon and the Kayana definately didn't disappoint! The whole place is immaculate it is only 18 months old which helps but the level of cleanliness was very high.The actual villa was stunning - very private with private pool and we even had a waterfall!! We had a huge 4 poster bed with flat screen TV and Bose speakers for the ipod - every little detail had been thought of.We had breakfast included in our package which you could have served in your own villa or by the main pool. The food was fabulous... platters of fresh fruit, scrambled egg, fresh croissants!The thing that really made this place was the service. The people were sincere and very smiley - nothing was ever too much trouble! One night we even bumped into one of the butlers who had been out to the 24 hour supermarket to pick something up for one of the guests!!In terms of location well for us it was perfect. Seminyak itself is very busy and whilst it has some great restaurants its not very relaxing, so we were thrilled that the Kayana is situated just north of seminak (5 mins drive away in the free hotel shuttle) in a quieter area where there are loads of little cute places to eat and have a drink. The beach is only a 5 min walk away and is very quiet (if you turn right onto the beach you wont see anybody for miles!) apart from at sunset when the beach fills with local families - one of my favourite moments!I cannot praise this place enough - it really was perfect and excellent value for money!", "Date": "Aug 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR693666924", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "twoonetwo"}, {"Content": "Fantastic villas, great service I have stayed at a lot of great properties but none matched this.

The hotel is just beautiful. The villa is private, secluded and so spacious, it felt like being in a house. The private pool was just amazing. Minibar items were complimentary and there were also complimentary afternoon tea. Location is nearby to local attractions - including restaurant and cafes. The hotel provides transportation to these nearby places and should the cars run out, they are willing to pay taxi fares for this. The only complaint is only on food. Breakfast was so-so, if not tasteless and choices were not much. Ditto on room service menu - whose list is very limited and when the food came they were basically tasteless. This was substituted by the fact that there were many good restaurants near the hotel so we did not feel this lack of good food created any hampers on our stay.", "Date": "Apr 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR270918856", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Rafaya"}, {"Content": "Stay in your dream villa... We arrived without a hotel reservation and checked out several properties before booking a villa at the Kayana. I was hoping to stay closer to the beach but now I think staying at the Kayana is perfect. There is complimentary transportation. So, you can head to the beach or town (just a few minutes by car) then go back home to your own luxurious villa. Open in early 2007, the property was immaculate. Do remember to bargain for a lower rate. We ordered food from the restaurant which was fairly good but nothing special. Great location away from the crazy scene in Kuta.", "Date": "Jan 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR569444860", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "sylin2"}, {"Content": "Affordable luxury, romantic escapade The experience at the Kayana was wonderful from the time we met the chauffeur at the airport. He was very pleasant and friendly. Was pleasantly surprised to get a welcome snack (delicious nuts), an apple and a chilled drink in the spacious car that was used to pick us.When we arrived at the reception, we were greeted with a warm welcome. Check-in was very smooth. We were brought to our villa by the butler in a buggy...first impression was that the villa was very luxurious, peaceful, and well-planned. Landscaping was immaculate, and villa was private, perfect for a couple. Was impressed that they looked into small details like providing an iPod dock and some free snacks/canned drinks in the mini-bar. In all my years of travel, I had never come across a hotel that provided free snacks and drinks in mini-bar. That was a small 'bonus' that exceeded my expectations.What also exceeded my expectations was the unlimited 'a la carte' buffet breakfast served at the restaurant (or in the comfort of yr villa). We ate at the restaurant every morning as we enjoyed the view and the excellent service provided by the waiters there. We were also 'allowed' to order anything from the menu with no limit. The waiters were most willing to serve and were very attentive to our needs.Did I also mention that they provide free shuttle to nearby areas in Seminyak? They also provide free pick-up service if you call the front desk to tell them where you are.What I loved most about the villa was the comfortable four-poster bed, the huge rain shower, and the heated pool. However, the villa was a bit small even though it was 200 sq metres. Would have been perfect if it had a separate kitchenette.Overall, my husband and I had a great, romantic stay at the Kayana, and would not hesitate to recommend this to our friends. For the price we paid (about US 180 for the 1 bedroom pool villa), it was a steal! Keep up the excellent service and affordable luxury, folks at the Kayana! =)Mrs Mel LimSingapore", "Date": "Jan 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR899721824", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "darlenemel"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u55d0\u4eef\u9287\u71b4\u501e\u95ac\u5e9b\u4ec8\u9287\u6d96\u4f28\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(20813737, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR211727439", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "\u9288\u5908\u4eef\u9287?> \u9288\u5908\u4eef\u9287?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "\u5a13\u546e\u7d8c\u9287\u0441\u4eb6\u9288\u5c7b\u4e9c\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19221212, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR393001186", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "michelina34"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u581b\u4eb1\u9287\uff43\u4ee7\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(19955517, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR854824521", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d814073-r22793329-The_Kayana_Bali-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "814073", "Price": "$312"}}
