Crossing Mockingbird Lane to get to shopping at Mockingbird Station or the light rail station or SMU campus is just plain dangerous. We are savvy travelers who regularly navigate NYC and other busy cities but, found Dallas traffic at this corner location significant. We were so thankful for the courtesy hotel car and used it to drop us at SMU and Northpark Mall. Also, request a pool view room as these are the most quiet. Rooms facing Mockingbird Station are the noisiest. Fantastic service and hotel design with a very nice small pool area and evening outdoor fire pit seating area.

There was a courteous car always ready to take us to great shopping nearby, and the wine and snacks hour was a nice touch. Our suite was ample, and when our Kuerig didn't work in our room, not only did they replace it, they sent up a complimentary pot of fresh coffee and cream for the inconvenience.

This is not just a waste of energy and resources; it also detracts from the quality of the experience. I could do without the zebra-patterned bathrobes, the shampoo and lotion whose tubes are unreadable because they come in colors ranging from off-purple to bright orange with lettering in similar colors, and the jarring elevator music (not quite rap but might as well be). The staff are friendly enough, but in my several stays I've encountered a few male staff members who seem to think customers like to be addressed in the same jaunty and over-familiar tone that has been adopted in recent years by 23-year-old call-in customer service representatives. (\"Mr. William Faulkner? Hope you're having a super day, Bill. How can I help you today, Bill?\") An obsession with coolness often goes hand-in-hand with a tendency to be self-congratulatory. When I checked in on my most recent visit, the reception desk employee told me I was in a \"one-bedroom suite\". But my surprise and gratitude were fleeting, because when I got to the room it turned out to be a perfectly ordinary hotel room with just enough room for two beds, a desk, and a television set. I have encountered many hotels that will call a room a \"junior suite\" if it has an extra little corner or two, but this is the first time I've heard a room called a \"suite\" with no modifier and no extra corner. In fairness, I don't know whether it's the hotel's policy to call all of its rooms \"suites\" or whether this was just an exaggeration or a mistake on the part of the individual employee. On top of all this, the standard rates at the Palomar are in the same range as much nicer and more traditional hotels -- Hiltons, Sheratons, even the Intercontinental -- and there seem to be better discount/promotional rates at the other hotels. On the good side, all Kimpton hotels give you free internet if you join the Kimpton frequent traveler program, and the Palomar has free wine and hors d'oeuvres in the lobby from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. every day. I may well stay at the Palomar again if I need to be very close to SMU. Despite some of the irritating details I've discussed in this review, it's a perfectly good hotel.

The room was well appointed but the one that I had was not over the top, there was no soaker tub, things were scuffed up a bit and the bed was just ok. Pillows where really lumpy and hard and my room was facing a major freeway (noisy) so getting a good nights sleep was a bit tough. Mini bar was well stocked and toiletries were very nice. Internet costs $10 extra-which is a pet peeve of mine when you pay a good price. I did not have a chance to use the pool or gym but a colleague did and said three of the cardio machines were broken so she went for a run outside. The hotel allows pets which I enjoyed watching, they were all pretty well behaved- I could see this being a real bonus for people with dogs.

The nice touches in the room were upon entering soft lighting with soothing music played and the bed was turned down - since there were two beds in the room and only one guest the first night it appeared you put thought into the fact that I was coming. love your tubes of shampoo, conditioner, bath wash and lotion - how refreshing not to try to get it out of those awkward bottles seen in most hotels. The downside to this hotel is parking and the Hot tub. The only parking available is valet. My goodness this is Dallas Texas not NYC - Dallas is spread out for over 50 miles and public transportation is not readily available - it appears there is a location adjacent to the hotel for a parking lot - I wish you would provide self parking spaces - the cost $20 per night plus tax seems crazy in Dallas Most of the other nice hotels provide this option in this city. The Hot Tub and pool were located outside on the second floor. Nice area with cabanas and comfortable chairs but the hot tub is very small for a hotel of this size - similar to a home unit - sits about 5 people comfortably - the biggest problem is the the hours it;s available. Closing at 10 pm is very early. I like to visit the hot tub just prior to bedtime around midnight. Since the pool area is not monitored by staff and it's only accessible by a keycard - why would you restrict it to certain hours? The staff were wonderful! Michael at the front desk, Daniel and Jamie who carried my luggage were names I remember but really every person I came in contact with was super nice and professional - it's very apparent they are focused on customer service! The maid who cleaned the room was professional well dressed and very attentive. I believe the people are your greatest asset. In summary - the people, location, amenities and atmosphere were wonderful. The smell of the lobby was particularly pleasant - never noticed this nice touch in other hotels but it was apparent every detail had been considered.

My son had pretty major surgery on his knee and, as a student at nearby Southern Methodist University, needed a few days of care before starting second semester classes. We have stayed at the Palomar before and loved it, but this time, we needed a little more help. We needed to move to a different room in the middle of the night. We needed two huge buckets of ice three times daily to keep the ice machine on his knee working. We needed every person, housekeeper, waiter, or other staff, to tap lightly on the door so as to not wake the patient. We needed prescriptions filled, and other items from the local CVS. We needed trips to my son's dorm room to pick up clothing and sundries. We needed middle of the night trips for other items and errands. Most of all, we needed compassionate and understanding folks to change the hotel room into a private hospital room. In no particular order, I wish to personally thank the general manager, Andrew Wright, for gifts and conveniences offered to my family. I wish to thank Kristy and Beverly at the front desk for helping me find the right room a couple of times, sending toothbrushes, a large garbage bag with rubber bands to my son could keep the bad leg dry while showering, delivering numerous other items and coordinating other support staff for my every request. I wish to thank Darin and Nick for setting up balloons and other stuff I really can't talk about to cheer up my son, not to mention the constant ice delivery at all times of the day and night. And finally to Michael who helped coordinate all of these efforts. The room was kept spotless thanks to the efforts of two really sweet housekeepers who coordinated the cleaning of the room while we were at dinner, and managed to do this while moving two machines necessary for the physical therapy on that knee. In summary, if it sounds like I'm stroking this hotel and the folks who helped me with me stay, I am. They deserve accolades, and did all that I asked and more to make this last difficult week as enjoyable as possible. I'd stay here anytime - these guys never got lost like folks in so many huge properties.

I value the attention to detail paid by their staff from the moment you arrive through checkout. For instance, before our arrival, I asked and received a great email within a day from the concierge about nearby things to do with our toddler and our dogs. We were flying out of Dallas with our dogs straight to Germany and decided to stay at the Palomar vice other big-chain hotels near DFW that claimed they were pet-friendly. We stayed here for a couple of days before our move from TX to Germany, so we had a lot of luggage (Family = 2 adults, toddler & 2 dogs). We drove up from Houston LATE in the evening and were greeted promptly at the door, with a smile! The Lobby: The Palomar, like the other Kimptons I've stayed at, has a wonderfully appointed lobby complimenting the style of the building as well as that particular area of town. In this case, mod, chic and warm (loved the fireplace and comfy seating at the front door). The seating area behind the valet is also tres chic and welcoming! (I wish I'd thought to take a photo!) The Room: I'd opted for a $15/night upgrade from a deluxe double/queen room to a corner king suite and am glad I did because the L-shaped layout was perfect for us. The rate was still nearly $100/night less than the airport hotel that allowed pets. The sofabed was tucked under the corner window and was large enough for our 3 yr old that we never did make it up as a bed. Plus the wonderful down comforters and pillows made it very luxurious and comfy for her! Lots of space for all of our luggage AND the pet carrier. For the Dogs: There was a great big dog bed and biscuits to greet our travelhounds. Don't worry about dog bowls; they are provided! For dog walking, there is a dog area behind the hotel that isn't well-lit at night so keep to the front of the hotel. Other hotels charge non-refundable pet fees; don't worry about that with the Palomar. They truly are pet-friendly with no extra fees. It almost feels like pet friendly staff are also a pre-requisite! The Minibar: Definitely join Kimpton InTouch; their Raid the Mini Bar was much appreciated after a long drive ($10 credit!). Also, I was able to reserve a yoga kit (yoga mat, block, DVD) in the room upon arrival--not every Kimpton has this as an option, but all Kimptons have an on-site or nearby fitness center/gym as well as spa arrangement. The Palomar has an arrangement with exhale, the spa next door (and a coupon for % off on a visit). Room Service: Room service was prompt on both mornings and yummy (our tot loved the homemade whipped cream that came with the fruit & the waffles). The waitstaff, ACTUALLY ALL THEIR STAFF, are incredibly attentive. (I mentioned my daughter really liked the whipped cream and could I get it as a side with her dinner; voila! there it was) MISC: The business center has a printer and 2 computers. Faxes are at the front desk. (We used both) The quieter rooms are towards the back, which is lovely for late wakeups (the other side is the freeway). There's a lovely outdoor pool (too chilly for this visit) and hot tub too.

Not only was every need met before asking, the valet, front desk, and concierge all remembered my name all weekend. I never saw a guest that was not greeted with a smile and a hello. There is a great sports bar right around the corner, which was great for Saturday afternoon. The pool / hot tub area is beautiful, and you can have food or beverages delivered there. There is also a complimentary wine tasting every night in the lobby, which was delightful. The lobby bar was busy both nights, yet service remained friendly, fast and accurate. The property is right off the highway, and easy to get to and from. Valet parking only. Hotel Palomar got it right!

When we drove up to the hotel we were impressed by its design and style. Check-in was fast and efficient, as was the valet parking of our vehicle. We were greeted warmly at the reception desk and everything the package offered was gone over, including the unexpected treat of \"raiding\" the mini bar of up to $10 of goodies. We were impressed with the sleek design and comfort of our room and appreciated the choice of TV channels on the HD TV. We got directions to the metrorail for our evening at the fair. Afterward, we spent a comfortable night in a very quiet room. In the morning we asked the manager and hostess at the restaurant if our state fair ticket stubs would work for breakfast as we would not be around later for dinner. Without hesitation, they agreed, and we enjoyed delicious waffles and an omelet as our meal(s). We would have liked to stay longer to take advantage of the fitness center and the pool, but we had to head back to Austin.

This hotel used to be a Hilton, where I stayed several times. The Hilton was a nice hotel, but this new Kimpton is even nicer. The decor is modern but attractive and welcoming. Check-in was smooth and fast. My room was large, with a king bed, desk, flat screen TV, comfortable chairs, and attractive bath. The wi-fi worked well, and a business center was available for printing boarding passes and the like. The room service menu offered interesting choices for both breakfast and dinner. I was a little disappointed that no selection of Texas wine was available, but some visitors would probably mark that as a bonus! One nice touch was the chilled peach iced tea offered in the lobby every day. As the natives know, iced tea is the true table wine of Texas. The hotel is located at the intersection of Mockingbird Lane and Central Expressway (I45). That location is near SMU and convenient for tourism or business in the northeastern part of Dallas. However, pure tourists might be better off to stay in downtown Dallas, which would be closer to the principal museums and historical sites. The one negative for the hotel is that only valet parking is available, and it is rather expensive.

Having stayed at Hotel Palomar in Chicago(which is also the best!) we decided to try the Palomar in Dallas. The location was perfect for our needs and the rate was comparable to other hotels that we looked at. From the time we arrived to the time we left, we could not have asked for better service in any area of the hotel. Although we drove, we still took advantage of the complimentary car service at night so that we could have fun and not worry about driving. The temperatures were in the 100s, so we really appreciated that our car was parked in a garage, not a lot. There were plenty of taxis there when we needed one and the valet service was very prompt. It's the extras that the Palomar does that makes it stand out. The morning coffee,the blueberry water always available and the flavored tea in the lobby after being in the heat and of course the wine and hor d'ourvres at 5:00. All complimentary along with bottles of water at night by your bed. I dropped a glass of tea in the lobby and the response was \"totally no big deal and lets get you another one.\" So accommodating!! The rooms were spacious and very clean. The bathrooms also very clean, well lit and there was undercounter storage which I really like for all of my \"stuff\" We did join the Kimpton group before arriving, so that gave us free wifi in our rooms which was really nice because I just had gotten a new ipad! We did not use the spa, fitness center or pool, but we did check it out and it all looked very nice. The staff was polite, professional, and gracious, without being stuffy.

I was absolutely amazed when the Palomar accepted our bid! Fast forward to the day we arrived. Several valets were at attention and one came to the car in seconds with a smile and greeting. An eager and friendly Jean Paul rushed to greet us inside the beautiful lobby and asked to help me with our luggage. Our front desk attendant was Michael Frankel, and although I was worried about the \"Priceline stigma\", he was discreet and upgraded our room upon request for free (I believe this is based upon availability). We took our keys, turned back for our luggage but it had already been placed on a cart and Kaye (sp?) was extremely friendly and followed us to our room to assist with the luggage. Let me tell you, we felt like rock stars! We had been expecting the smaller, deluxe King room, and now had a corner window seating area with a great view, plenty of square footage, and decor to die for. When Kaye left, we actually did a happy dance at our good fortune! The hotel is nonsmoking, but there are two smoking areas (that we know of), one by the pool on a different floor than the lobby (the pool was closed for maintenance while we were there and so these doors were locked, but keep in mind if you want to slip quietly out for a smoke, you can do this without going though the lobby and being \"seen\", so it would feel more private.) The other smoking area is located outside of the hotel in the front valet area, is very nicely appointed (think huge, lit candles, fluffed cushions and high-backed, private seating areas), and it was very relaxing to sit, watch the activity, take part in conversations and meet some wonderful people, to boot. For the non-smokers, rest assured, this does NOT interfere in any way with the hotel and will not affect your stay at the least. I think the design was carefully planned for this reason. The room service menu was to die for, including Chicken and waffles, and some slightly risque \"naughty\" sides that sounded absolutely sinful and scrumptious. Options like the Kobe burger and ribs were, I believe, also offered on the late night menu and surprisingly affordable for those (like us!) who are tired of the same old salad or club sandwich late-night staples. The bedding was heaven. Don't expect to wake up, unless you set the alarm. Oh, and about the alarm clock. When we arrived, the soothing sounds of the ocean filled the room. There is something special about a place that offers little details such as this. The next day, we shyly called the guest services line and asked about a late checkout, knowing that we had already received a bargain.

Though I had several ideas to make the weekend special, Konni Godley and the concierge staff (Karena, JonPaul and Eloy) went the extra mile to design in some unique features (rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart, candles around the spa tub, champagne and truffles, massages at the adjoining Exhale spa, etc.). Needless to say, my wife was totally blown away! The hotel staff was very attentive to our needs and genuinely enjoyed being a part of our celebration. The valets called us by name (Mike was especially helpful) and the front desk personnel (kudos to Michael, who helped me select the best room for our needs, and to Rachel and Jordan) were all smiles. We breakfasted at the Central 214 restaurant and had a nice relaxing meal.

The property excels in every category. At the outset, the staff throughout the property is professional, thoughtful and caring. The high level of service starts with the bell personnel - whom are guided by Billy and Michael -who come to assist me as I get out of my taxi. It continues at the front desk where I am greeted by a warm and friendly member of Front Office Manager Jerry Lui's fine staff. The lead concierge JonPaul Barnes ensures that all my special requests (chilled wine, extra towels, etc.) are accommodated so that everything is just right when I walk into my room. Housekeeping does a nice job of servicing the room (while one would expect that it is a given that a room will be cleaned well, that is not always the case, even in the classiest of hotels). As to the room, I typically stay in a Grand Luxury Suite, which is spacious and well appointed. The bed and its linens are very comfortable, the iPod clock on the night table allows me to play my own music, the bathroom is huge, the deep jacuzzi type tub seats two and the separate living area has a comfortable sofa and an excellent work area that has plenty of power outlets. The hotel is situated at the busy intersection of Northcentral Expressway and Mockingbird Lane, but the heavy duty windows keep any traffic noise out such that the rooms are quiet and peaceful. (Also, at times that the Grand Luxury Suites have been unavailable I have stayed in regular rooms . . . while they are not as large, all the excellent features associated with the Grand Luxury Suites are found in these other rooms.) The hotel also affords a wonderful dining and bar experience. Chef Blythe Beck of Central 214 - the cool restaurant on the property - turns out creative and extremely tasty dishes that are loaded with butter and calories, which is not necessarily a bad thing (the well equipped gym on the second floor or the hotel - it's got LifeFitness cardio machines and a more than adequate set of weight machines and set of free weights - is there to work off the calories). The servers in the restaurant and the bar staff (including Dave and Gabby) are friendly and attentive. The food that is served in Central 214 can be delivered to one's room through Inroom Dining, which features prompt and professional service. The hotel also features the spa Exhale. I have had some excellent massages and pedicures through through this spa, which were nice treats. Also, the hotel has a large heated outdoor pool that is surrounded by plenty of comfortable lounge chairs, whcih is a nice place to hang out on a warm sunny afternoon. The hotel is located just across from the SMU campus and Mockingbird Station. It is conveniently located to the downtown business district (which is a roughly ten minute taxi ride during the morning rush hour) and there are plenty of good bars and restaurants in the area that are either within walking distance or a short taxi ride away. Love Field is about 15 to 20 minutes away and DFW is around a 35 minute ride from the hotel. In conclusion, the Hotel Palomar is great! I am a regular customer so I likely get extra special treatment, yet I observe the staff treat all other guests in a conscientous and professional manner, so I think that I would provide a similarly stellar review even if I had visited the propoerty just once (actuallly, when I first stayed at the hotel three years ago, my experence then was as good as the experiences that I have now).

We visited the pool and hot tub- very nice area- we lounged on a large sofabed lounger in the cabana area. Not much sun- it could have been the time of day and the shade from the surrounding area building so it was slightly cold. Got some fruity delicious fresh cocktails from the bar downstairs (pool bar was closed on a saturday afternoon- great weather day) and was locked out of the pool area- a hotel employee tried to help but couldn't so had to go back through the hotel the long was around to get back to the pool deck.

Some thought we were crazy to go to Dallas and stay at a hotel other than \"the W\" but they were eating their words later. There are two guys who stand out as far as making our experience better. One of the drivers who took us around several times became like our friend for the week, very friendly and nice. The first impression of the hotel however was a guy (Mike?) who helped us get our bags, took us to our room, and made us feel at ease (since hotels.com screwed up our reservation completely, thanks guys). We got an incredible deal through hotels.com BUT next time I'd probably just keep an eye on the Palomar's website because they offered something like 30% off of room rates for an advanced booking. The room was wonderful. Very nice bed, linens on the bed, couch, tv, etc. My wife forgot a curling iron and they were able to provide her with one. I was able to charge my iphone daily with the provided iHome dock. The wifi was free because we signed up with a free service with Kimpton hotels. They delivered strawberries and champagne for free with a note welcoming us to the hotel for our honeymoon. They were able to recommend incredible restaurants and things to do as well as drive us to many of them (within 3 miles of the hotel, for free). The pool was incredible (we spent a lot of time there): An infinity edge pool, free water, restaurant service available, private cabanas with comfy bed/couches, hot tub, great music, and giant towels. Also, daily they had a wine tasting in the lobby and one day they even had an ice cream bar! My wife and I were very blessed to have found such a great deal for our honeymoon. We've been thinking of excuses to go back because if you stay in a Kimpton hotel 10 nights in a year (I believe it was 10) then you get 2 nights free when you sign-up for the free service (that gets you the free wifi as already mentioned). Complaints, there had to be some! Overnight parking: unfortunately $10/night, but necessary. The restaurant in the hotel was insanely priced. It was our honeymoon and we could have splurged on the restaurant, but instead went shopping and bought more stuff. If you have the money, it looked very very nice, but I'm enjoying the coat I bought instead! The same goes for room service. PB&J shouldn't be $15. Lastly, the spa attached to the hotel leads you to believe you will receive a free massage session just for staying at the hotel when in the fine print it says you'll receive a free one with the purchase of like a 2 hour massage. Instead we went to a massage place a few miles down the road and got an hour long couples massage for less than one hour for a single at the hotel.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBetter Than The Best\u201d", "Author": "keejrd", "ReviewID": "UR80651709", "Content": "Modern customer service expectations are so low that to experience the warmth and support of the staff I felt this past weekend at Hotel Palomar initially felt surreal.

In the meantime, we can now bring her to dinner with us at the local Kimpton property here in Scottsdale, Arizona. Coincidentally, we recently attended a wedding at the FireSky Resort in Scottsdale and never realized this was the very same chain of Kimpton properties. So back to our love affair with the Palomar, here are just a few of the many reasons why we loved staying here: 1) Nightly welcome reception with complimentary drinks and appetizers. (during our stay they served a refreshing white sangria, chardonnay and a great red wine with the most delicious deviled eggs with shrimp) 2) Super friendly staff who cannot do enough for you! 3) the ULTIMATE BENCHMARK in pet friendly hotel properties, we loved meeting some of the interesting guests along with their well behaved pets during the cocktail reception. WARNING: If you don't have a dog, you'll want one after staying here! 4) Plush towels ~ in fact I would say that their towels should win an award for best hotel towel in America. 5) Comfy bathrobes 6) Bathroom Menu of various things one often forgets, so if you forgot to pack your toothbrush, etc., they offer everything at a super low price, (2.00 average) so not only are they super thoughtful, but the hotel is not trying to rip you off on these amenities. 7) L'Occitane shampoo - conditioner - soaps - body lotion 8) Magnifying mirror 9) Adjustable gooseneck bedside reading lamps 10) the most comfortable sheets I have ever slept on~under~between 11) the most amazing mattress, we hated to get up to leave our room 12) Large Flat Screen television 13) On site spa and salon 14) FABULOUS restaurant - don't miss their dessert menu!!! (shout out to our lovely server \"Medley\" who recommended the chocolate fudge waffle, with caramelized bananas and peanut butter ice cream. ~ WOW, I am still thinking of that dessert days later...LOVED IT. 15) Large rooms - you will have plenty of room to move around in their standard room, without paying for an upgrade. WHY DOESN'T EVERY HOTEL GIVE YOU ROOM IN YOUR ROOM??? They all need to take lessons from Kimpton. 16) Beautiful pool area and hot tub 17) Dog run with large grassy play area 18) SUPER QUIET hallways and rooms ~ NO PET SOUNDS or smells could be detected anywhere on the property, which is an amazing feat in itself. I guess all the dog guests are on their best behavior ~ they know how lucky they are! 19) FREE WI-FI in your room 20) Need I go on...? This place is so wonderful, we cannot wait to return with our little dog Lucy. And all these great amenities are at no extra charge, and they don't even charge a pet fee. We have stayed in various hotels where there is always a pet fee, usually 30.00+ per night, and you must have your dog with you at all times. Here if you want to go out, they will even watch your pet for you, walk your pet, etc...UNBELIEVABLE SERVICE with a smile. We paid a low nightly room rate, but I won't mention the rate in this review...as no matter what you end up paying, it is well worth ANY price to stay here!!! PS) they even have a website dedicated to their fabulous amenities, it seems I am not the only one who wanted to purchase the bed linens. check out: KimptonStyle . com By the way, you might read this review and think I am associated in some way with this hotel chain, I assure you I am NOT. My husband and I were just so thrilled to discover this hotel on Trip Advisor (THANK YOU, Trip Advisor!) that I wanted to write an indepth review so that everyone can \"experience the experience\" before they step foot into the hotel.

I called again (on my cell) and again they offered to send someone up right away. I said no. I am going to go to sleep. The next day after work, everything worked fine.

There were 4 other wedding blocks staying at The Palomar that weekend but you certainly couldn't tell any signs of chaos! We stayed in the Presidential Suite for the weekend, which is a great treat with the huge living/dining area and 3 separate bathrooms.

I have always wanted to stay here and was not disappointed. Check-in was SUPER fast, literally less than five minutes. We were sent to the wrong room though, a regular room when we had splurged on a luxury suite. I didn't mind though because I was able to see if the price difference was worth it. My husband went down to get the new room key and was back in less than five minutes. The normal rooms are very nice and I would be happy to pay for one, but if you can swing the price difference the suites DELIVER. We got a huge living room with TV, sofa, huge closet, a REAL plant and their quirky mini-bar. The bedroom and bathroom however were the highlight. The bedroom contained a sofa and chair in the corner, desk, a beautiful bed, and the bathroom was amazing! HUGE soaking tub for two, separate shower, beautiful vanity, etc, etc. We had dinner there at Central 214 and we each got the tasting menu. It was excellent the wine pairings were good. We really enjoyed the food, good service, etc. It was just a good solid restaurant. We also ordered room service both mornings. I wanted eggs Benedict which was not on the room service menu, and they were more than happy to accommodate. The room service breakfast was satisfactory, but it wasn't outstanding and came practically cold. At that price you expect a little more. One thing I would complain about is the traffic noise from the highway. I am a very light sleeper, and the first night I didn't sleep well at all. A simple remedy (which I plan to use if I go back) is to request a fan from the lobby or ask for a room not facing the highway; that would definitely do the trick for me anyway. My husband, however, slept just fine. The things we most enjoyed other than the room and restaurant were the lobby, which is modern and yet very inviting (that can be a fine balance), the free wine hour, complimentary newspapers, coffee, and tea in the morning, and of course the goldfish which we requested. We also asked for a small coffeemaker to be sent up to the room, and it came in less than ten minutes with coffee, creamers, sugar, etc. All in all we loved the hotel.

The Hotel Palomar Dallas is conveniently situated alongside Southern Methodist University (Highway 75 at Mockingbird Lane, approximately 3 miles outside of downtown Dallas) and although an older property, it has been renovated to the typical funky feel that one expects from a Kimpton property. I stayed in a \"Luxury King Tall Room\". The room itself was just over 400 square feet in size, featuring a King size bed that is 18 iinches longer than a normal King bed, plus a 37 inch LCD television with high definition picture. The room was clean and maid service was excellent. Like other Kimpton hotels, the Hotel Palomar Dallas is dog friendly and we saw several pooches during our three night stay. Wireless high-speed Internet was provided free of charge (you must be a Kimpton In-Touch member to get free Internet -- Kimpton's free loyalty program), as was a daily newspaper at my room door each morning. My only negative comment is that parking costs $20 per day (I am a strong believer in free parking for hotel guests). Concierge's Karena and Jon Paul were very helpful, arranging golf at nearby golf courses, hockey tickets (Dallas Stars vs.Ottawa Senators) and dinner at excellent restaurants (Capital Grille for Texas style steaks on Thursday evening, Toulouse Restaraunt for French food on Friday evening and Texas de Brazil for Brazillian churrascaria on Saturday evening). Car hops were on the ball and everyone seemed to have a smile on their face and a desire to help. Service at the Hotel Palomar Dallas was, simply put, second to none.

On to the room. It was a very nice room with great bedding and stylish decor. The bed was not the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept on, but it was just fine. The building itself is pretty old (early 1950s) so the layout was a little different and that also caused the actual bedroom space to be a little small. There is a very large entry way at the door to the room which has a half wall separating it from the rest of the bedroom. So instead of opening the door and stepping into a large, open bedroom, there is a good bit of seemingly wasted space. The bathroom was nice and large. However, at a hotel of this level we are used to a bathroom with a separate shower and soaking tub instead of a rather standard shower/tub combo. It just didn't seem to come up with the l'occitane bath products that were supplied. We had a very good time at the Hotel Palomar and enjoyed it very much for our anniversary celebration.

If you're driving to the hotel, it is right off of the Central Expressway at the Mockingbird Exit. It can be tricky to cross Mockingbird on foot, so be careful! The hotel staff is extremely friendly, from the doormen holding the front door open for you to the front desk staff quickly explaining to you the amenities of the hotel. This hotel used to be an older hotel (an old Hilton I believe), but it was remodeled well and looks contemporary. The rooms are decent size. The pillows are a bit soft, so I had a few restless nights when I was trying to sleep. The bathroom has L'Occitane toiletries, which I love! I took a few extra bottles home with me. There is also a zebra striped bathrobe that you can use after the shower, which is pretty funky. Oh, and there is complimentary internet and wi-fi service in the room.

The gym doesn't have a huge variety of equipment, but there are good options. There were about 5 treadmills, 2 elliptical machines, 1 stationary bike, free weights, and a leg machine. There were plenty of towels and water in the room as well. When we checked in, I was giving a complimentary coupon to try out a Core Fusion class at the spa in the morning. I thought I would try it out with a few friends of mine, and it was worth it! Albeit my body was sore for two days because I had never done this type of class before, this class was very intense. The instructor was wonderful! She had a very calm and soothing voice that made you work hard, and she also offered alternate exercises if the exercise was too extreme for someone. It was a very rewarding class, and I recommend that you experience it at least once! We ate at Trader Joe's, just outside the hotel but on the property, and the food was decent. I recommend Margarita Ranch across the street at Mockingbird Station for good Tex-Mex food. The beef fajitas and white queso were phenomenal! It was too cold to swim in the pool, but I did visit the pool area. It was a very comfortable atmosphere and had a lot of chairs. Overall, my experience at the hotel was great.

The bed was extrememly comfortable and extra long since it was a California King. We had drinks at the hotel bar one night and it was very nice. Not overly busy, but a nice place to talk. Great Chocolate martinis! My husband booked us a couples massage at the hotel spa and it was amazing. The spa itself is quite small with not much but a locker room and steamroom, but the service was incredible! Best massages we have ever had. Overall our experience at the Palomar was top notch. Some extras I forgot to mention about the hotel are the free glasses of wine in the lobby of an evening, and the free bottles of water in the room each day and also water available for joggers in an ice bucket in the lobby.

There was one step down from the hallway to the living room and bedroom areas and one step up to the bathroom. Each room was good size with a black and pale yellow color scheme and very nice flat screen televisions with some of the clearest pictures we have seen.

Although we slept well, there is a constant noise level that we think would bother some guests, especially if they are on a vacation. It was also a shame that the owners of the hotel built a residence building to the south of the hotel, blocking a nice view of downtown and taking sunlight away from the pool.

There is also a mini bar in the room, which is stocked with great (some healthy) snacks and drinks - of course, you pay for what you use. The large flat-screen tv was great. Another appreciated feature was a DVD/CD player, which I used to listen to my music and watch movies we brought. Before I made the reservation, I signed up as a Kimpton member, so I am not sure what was standard treatment and what the hotel provides for their frequent travelers. Whatever the case, I loved the personal touches: personalized stationary, turn-down service with chocolates and bottled water, fresh fruit with a small canvas, paintbrush and paint if you are feeling creative. The business center charges for internet use, but is equipped with some nice iMacs. The guest rooms also have internet access for laptops. Room service was delicious and on time. Exhale spa is attached to the hotel, which was nice because it was cold and rainy when I was there. I had a massage, which was pretty good, but the better thing was the steam room - really relaxing. The spa facilities seemed very clean, modern, and smelled great. Book before you go because they were busy. I would definitely stay again and would try their other locations based on the good experience I had in Dallas.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cHotel Palomar is a Must Stay!\u201d", "Author": "arkansastiger", "ReviewID": "UR12497186", "Content": "Fabulous property - most everything was wonderful about the hotel.

Wife needed a razor for legs, and it was brought with in 3 minutes of the phone request. Did breakfast room service,, quick and tasty. This was a Hilton back in the late 60's. It was closed and Kimpton totally redid it and it reopened in Sep 2006 as the Palomar. It reminds me of a -W- type of property. They had a nice 1 hour free wine/champagne happy hour in the lobby, along with free coffee in the morning. Small touches,, but those build a repeat visit. Small things but... in room desk area had a --4-- port electrical plug in for computers/phones. etc. Free internet, bioth wired and wirelss. 2 phones (1 handsfree), 2 line telephones. Great LG HDTV/flat panel LCD TV's... Nice radio, and cool reading lamps on bed so wife could sleep while I worked (sorry, we are married)... Another thing.... so many hotels now use compact flour. light bulbs. They put off a stange color, but at the Palomar, true incadesent bulbs, bright enough for reading/working. Lots of dimmers for lighting. Also, nice bathroom shampoo/soaps. Wife did yoga at the Exhale spa.. Free workout equipment access. Overall a great experience and highly recommended.

The Review: The hotel lobby is so stylish, the pool is subdued, but kind of cool. The desk clerk was terribly rude, I was really excited about my stay and she could have cared less. I got to my room and it was just claustrophobically tiny. The bed hit the tv stand. I went back down to try and get a larger room which I was even willing to pay for. Rude Desk Clerk Girl told me I had to go to spa, through which I booked the room to get a room change. I thought this was incredibly poor service. Regardless, I did it. The spa manager could have cared less as well. I went back to the hotel front desk, told Rude Desk Clerk Girl that the spa manager had nothing for me and she told me there was nothing she could do. I asked for her boss, he was incredibly nice and accommodating and upgraded me to a larger room. I must admit the room was still quite small. The decor in the rooms was interesting, modern Kimpton style. The spa experience was terribly average. Dallas has a ton of spa/hotel experiences and this one is just so not up to par with them. The massage therapist didn't listen to what I wanted or my requests. The facialist was just fine. The manicurist/pedicurist tried way to hard to sell stuff to me. The manager of the spa just wasn't a welcoming/inviting person. They really made me feel like a nuisance (which I might have been), but regardless, I was still a guest and should have been treated as such.

The hotel is in a good, central location and within easy walking distance to SMU. The hotel underwent a first class refurbishing before opening as the Palomar.

My only complaint is that the front desk and valet staff appear to be understaffed during peak time periods (e.g. on Fri/Sat nights), even though the staff seems eagar to please. The valet staff at first forgot to retreive and then \"couldn't find\" both my and separately my friend's cars. It took each of us almost an hour to finally get our cars out of valet, and that was after notifying the head of valet. Another surprising problem is that I called to place a wake up call at around midnight on a Saturday, and I was unable to reach ANYONE at the hotel (that is, no one picked up when I repeatedly dialed lines to the wake up desk, front desk, valet, concierge, etc...) I even called Kimpton's main number and central reservations tried for 15 minutes to contact the Palomar directly to no avail.
