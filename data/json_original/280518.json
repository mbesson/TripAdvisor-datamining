All in all the hotel is average. Nothing more and nothing less. The service at the reception was okay, as was the room. I stayed in a single room which was equipped with all necessities and nothing more. The bathroom was clean but really tiny. The doors and floor carpeting in the hallways looked cheap. The fitness room is let's say \"not well equipped\". The bar is small aswell. It would be quite nice if the breakfast tables could be used as a \"Bar extension\" as soon as the lobby bar is full. If it comes to location, the hotel is a bit off the centre but the public transport is quite close. The plus side of the hotel is the pricing.

A call to reception requesting something would see it brought to the room within minutes. The room was more like an apartment with living room, double bedroom, small kitchen with fridge and cooker, but with no crockery, cutlery untensils etc, and a bathroom. The bathroom was very clean but on the whole the apartment was a little shabbyand tired, with grubby paintwork, and walls. The bed was comfortable although had two single duvets on a zip together mattress. The living room had a round table with four chairs two faux leather chairs and a sofa bed. TV with only two English channels both news. It was not too noisy but I was on the 5th floor. Breakfast was not included in my room rate and is charged extra at \u20ac17.00. This is over priced by about double. It is the usual buffet style serve yourself with a selection of cold meats, cheeses, cereals and pastries and bread. The hot alternative is poor quality produce and poorly cooked. e.g. only scrambled egg offered and it had to be SLICED! If I stayed again, which I might, I'd have my breakfast elsewhere. The coffee however was very good and plentiful. My other major criticism was WiFi or internet connection. Business package cost \u20ac5.95 per hour or \u20ac17.95 per 24hours or \u20ac75.00 for seven days. An economy alternative started at \u20ac10.95 (24hrs) but was much truncated. This is a rip off and would discourage me as a business traveller, after all I am out most of the day and only really need WiFi early evening and first thing in the morning. I think \u20ac5.95 per 24 hours would be a fairer price, or make it 24 hours during the stay not a 24 hour period.
