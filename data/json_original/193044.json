Check in was easy and the receptionist was very polite and helpful. Although this hotel does not serve dinner we were offered dinner at another Thistle hotel, the nearby Royal Trafalgar in Whitcomb Street. In the event we settled for an excellent dinner at TGI Fridays which was just the other side of the theatre. Our package didn't include breakfast but we paid a very reasonable \u00a310 per head when we checked in for what turned out to be an excellent \"Full English\" the following morning served by very pleasant and attentive staff. We were allocated room 708 which, along with the rest of that floor, had very recently been refurbished. The room was spacious, had been very tastefully decorated,and had good quality furnishings and fittings, wide screen TV, leather swivel chair at desk etc. There was a freshly decorated smell and I wouldn't be surprised if we were the first occupants since the refurbishment. The surrounding area, like much of the tourist parts of London, is undergoing extensive modernisation ready for the Olympics but we didn't experience any undue noise from this nor from the St Patrick's day crowds.

Only 1 of the 2 lifts was working all weekend though! The bed was enormous and bedding clean. So far so good! As many people have stated, the rooms are long overdue a rehaul, particularly the ancient bathrooms! No main light in the room, and insufficient light from the 4 lamps - common trait with energy saving bulbs! Upon walking into the bathroom, I immediately slid across the floor due to an enormous puddle of water on the tiles. Upon closer inspection, the water was a longstanding problem with the radiator in the bathroom. It had been switched off (obviously to try and rectify the issue) and there was a dark brown stain on the tiles where it has clearly dripped for some time. I called for someone to fix it/move us. We were going out about half an hour later, and still hadn't had anyone to look at it, so mentioned it again at reception, where we were assured it would be fixed 'shortly'. We returned from the theatre about 11pm to an even larger pool in the bathroom. Again, I contacted reception and received a call back from the night manager. He advised that there was no record of my previous requests, and that he couldn't move us due to the hotel being fully booked. He did send someone up with more towels, and provided a bottle of complimentary wine, and assured me that it would be resolved in the morning. Great. Had a brilliant nights sleep - bed MEGA comfy! About to leave the room at 11am, when we received a call saying they couldnt relocate us, as the hotel was still fully booked, so they sent a man with a spanner to fix it instead. When we got back, the dripping had stopped but the radiator still didn't work, which led to the bathroom still being very cold. Anyway - another fab night's sleep, but sadly, when we went down to breakfast at 9.45 (breakfast served til 11), half of the food wasn't available, there were 6 empty tables, but we still had to stand and wait whilst they prepared one for us. The food was being replenished as we were finishing what we had. Shame really, as the previous day, the breakfast was excellent! All in all, it has the potential to be brilliant, and you can see that there are works taking place to make the hotel pretty in time for the olympics, however, these works are years overdue, so the hotel should stop using it as an excuse for the state of the rooms!", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but poor quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "unitedlegend", "ReviewID": "UR124585641", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location but the hotel is in need of redecoration and the quality of service was lacking.

The room was tiny, in dire need of redecoration. The bathroom was awful although the shower was, if old, effective and the towels were very good.

I did find it odd though at midnight that the front door was open, the reception in darkness, with no visible security - possibly one security guard - in an area that would in my view require very tight security at night.

Also we didn't want travel on the underground late at night, in the cold. The hotel was within easy walking distance to the theatre and there were two tube stations nearby. As it's in the centre of Piccadilly, there's plenty to see and do. We didn't buy any drinks at the hotel as there are plenty of bars and plenty of restaurants nearby. The hotel seems nice from the outside and rather posh, until you walk in your opinions begin to change. Checking in took long although the staff were helpful and friendly. As you walk up the corridors you begin to realise by the sight of the doors of the other rooms how dated the hotel is. There's bits of paper peeling off, and the skirting boards could do with a lick of paint. Our room was on the 4th floor, it was spacious with an enormous bed, the bathroom was rather dated, with baby pink tiles. There was a bath with a shower curtain around it, and there was a shower over the bath. The shower head had limescale on it and the basin taps were very dated and the plug holes were dull and rusty coloured. In the room there was no ceiling lights, however there were two bedside lamps, a floor standing lamp, and another lamp on the table, still made the room rather dim. It felt like a room from the 70's. Don't get me wrong it was clean. The only modern thing was the flat screen TV and the electric kettle. It felt cold in the room, the windows weren't double glazed, however there was a radiator in the room. Fortunately our room was on the 4th floor and situated at the back of the hotel, so we didn't notice the noise. However there was no view out the windows as all we could see were roof tops, just as well that it went dark at 4pm. The breakfast was nothing special just the usual standard buffet type, not a great deal of selection. The dining room was rather small and neatly laid out. For the price we paid it wasn't worth it, you're paying for the location.

For that, this hotel is ideally located, you really couldn't ask for better. It is right by Leicester Square (about 50 metres away), so is right in the middle of everything. Most theatres are less than a 10 minute walk away (we were seeing Avenue Q at the Noel Coward Theatre, a very direct 5 minute walk away), and there are restraunts, bars and clubs galore in the area. Outside is a McDonalds on one corner of the cross-roads this hotel is on, and there is KFC on another corner, so fast food is close at hand, as are 'proper' restraunts with a wide choice in the area. It's easy to find the hotel, just off Coventry street one road over from Leicester Square, opposite McDonalds. On entering the hotel the reception staff were polite, friendly and efficient. Really could not be faulted. We arrived at 11am on the off-chance we could check-in. We couldn't, but we were able to do all the paper work so all we had to do later was pick-up the room key, which made things easier. They also offered a luggage storage facility, but we were travelling light (just a small backpack), so we didn't need it. They offered the same service again on Sunday when we checked out, so very handy if you travel with suitcases and want to make the most of your days. Unfortunately, the rooms let the hotel down. We were in room 506, which had a nice view over Coventry Street below and wasn't too bad for room noise, though being this central there was a decent amount of noise during the evening, mostly muffled by the secondary glazing. The room was definately a bit on the small side, as are a lot of hotel rooms in these older buildings. The bed was huge, actually being two large single beds bolted together to form one 6ft wide double bed. However, this didn't leave room for much else in the room. There was a desk with a TV on, plus desk chair, plus a second table with two easy chairs. The problem was the gap between the bottom of the bed and the desk was about 30cm/1ft, barely enough to get through. The bathroom was a reasonable size though, although definately showing it's age and in desperate need of a re-furb. Depsite looking a bit old and tatty though, the room was spotlessly clean. There were no funny smells or questionable stains. If you didn't investigate, you'd miss the fact that they supplied a kettle, mugs, spoons and glasses, and tea, coffee and biscuits, as these were all stored away in a cupboard under the TV, pressumably to save space in the already cramped room. There was a built in wardrobe in the corner of the room by the window, with a full length mirror as well. There was a room service menu in the room which seemed decent enough, though not cheap, but also not a total rip-off. There was bar down stairs, and you could also have drinks delivered to your room. We weren't in the room any where near enough to make use of these services though, so can't comment on how good/bad they might have been. Oddly, the light switch by the room door seemed to do nothing. All the lights in the room worked indepently, it just seemed odd that the main light switch as you entered the room had no effect. Also, when we arrived on the 5th floor, we found the corridor had no lights on, and no light switch visible. Our room was only the third room down, and within 5 minutes the lights had been switched back on, so no real issue. Overall, we were happy with our choice of hotel, but only for the convienience. Would we stay here again? Probably, but we'll be trying a few of the other hotels in the area first before we return to this one.
