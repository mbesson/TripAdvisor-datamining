We took a Duplex Suite, though it was more a loft concept than a Duplex. We arrived at 1530 and the room was not ready, this happens many times as we have all done late checkouts and so we can understand this. We were told to wait 15 minutes, and many apologies were given. The apologies are nice, but they could have offered a drink (at least water and soft drinks or coffee while we waited). Within 1/2 hour the room was ready. I had read from the comments about the modern sense of lighting and visible bathroom set-up, so was not surprised, but still a few things were disappointing. Open bathroom with no doors, even for toilet area. This is strange. I have stayed in rooms with totally open bathrooms, but the toilet area has been divided and with a door system. Very minimalist bathroom, but a great drawback was that next to the washbasin there was very very limited space to put things (toothbrush, toothpaste etc). Excellent that there was a toilet down which helped to solve many problems. We had had a long trip so we all decided to go to the room early and get in bed and order food. We were told that as it was a Holiday (Easter Friday) that the limited menu was not fully available, so we ordered a chicken sandwich and a spanish omelette. The chicken sandwich had a terrible presentation, though the taste was acceptable. I decided no more room dinners. At night as many times when we travel with our son it was my turn to sleep on the sofa bed. This was far to hard for an adult to sleep in. Its meant to be a new hotel, but a lot of the furniture in the rooms and in the main restaurant (breakfast room) looks old!

The floors however are dark, dim and just poorly lit by indirect light. Kind of Sci-Fi spaceship flair, which I personally adore.

Always clean and good bedding.

There is not much going on in the hotel but for me it did the trick as it was very clean. Staff was helpful. U can walk a bit to Del SOl but the bus stop is just there. They have 2 computers in the lobby that u can use.The lift broke down and was repaired in no time.The hotel is almost opposite El Corte. If u r lucky enough u can bump into Posh Spice shopping next street. . We booked a room for a family of 4 but had our 3 year old as the 5th guest. U cannot really ask for much. The hallway leading to bedrooms could do with more light. Definitely recommend it and I would go back there. We were given small hampers on new year eve. It would be complete and excellent if breakfast is included. If u are expecting a visitor to come to your room, have your shower and other business as the doors of the bathroom are transparent glasses.", "Date": "March 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cLong Stay Review\u201d", "Author": "30Countrytraveler", "ReviewID": "UR5512923", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for almost 20 consecutive nights. Why did i chose this hotel to stay ? 1.-I believe it is a good option if you are tired of traveling to Europe and staying in \"Historic\" \"Traditional\" hotels that smell old , have Luis XVI Style-unconfortable furniture, and ipod sized tv\u00b4s. 2.-The free internet access from the room works great, not like in other hotels where the network stops suddenly or works slowly . frequently in your room via LAN or WI FI , 3.-The LCD tv\u00b4s are also a Plus. 4.-For travelers that like working out , this hotel is also a very good choice because of its location 800 m away from \"El Retiro Park\" where you can see a lot of Runners, Cyclists, Rowers and Skaters early in the morning til late in the afternoon. 5.-Convenience Right Across the street you can find a \"Corte Ingles\" Store that has , in the basement , a supermarket section where you can buy Groceries in case you are tired of the multiple amount of restaurants available nearby. Cons: 1.-Room Service In my opinion too expensive (12 Euros for a Ham and Cheese Sandwich!) 2.-Breakfast Buffet is mediocre. 3.- Sometimes the cards used as keys are erased too easily. 4.- I believe the rooms are not suitable for kids (due to the naked-lady siluette/picture in the Glass Door of the Bathroom) I believe this hotel is a great option (a lot of Bang for the Buck), and i would stay without hesitation here again.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201chmmmm...Definitely go for the rooms with terraces\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5355492", "Content": "By the way the rooms with terraces are 610 and 611. I went for 609 and it was the \"tv on desk with no workspace\" variety. Also bear in mind that all the rooms on the 6th floor are smoking rooms. Although the ones with terraces don't stink of stale smoke, the other ones on that floor do. All in all quite a pleasant experience, however, think twice and have a good reason for changing room as you may be met with a fairly hostile staff at reception, as I was. On the one hand a cool, trendy place to stay but on the other could also be viewed as slanting towards the male customer - \"stylish\" pictures of naked women printed on the shower screens and most of the furniture could be found in a batchelor pad, let alone the suited and booted clientele. Lastly, for those of you who like sunlight you could probably find a better place to stay as it goes for the space ship neon light look which in my opinion tries a bit too hard.", "Date": "June 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel: good price and quality\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4456138", "Content": "I stayed already various times in this hotel that was opened at the end of 2005.
