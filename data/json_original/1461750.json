Every room has its own air conditioning unit (mini-split), but as mentioned in the previous reviews the windows are sealed. The restaurant only serves breakfast , a cold breakfast with -fruits -juice -cereal -pastries is included in the price of the room, however there is a hot bar which you have to pay extra for. There is a better hotel by this brand right next to the Reforma 222 mall, which is a few blocks closer to the city center. Checking in and out can be a hassle, the guys at the reception desk do take their time, so if you need to leave in a hurry make sure to factor this in.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201csuffocating\u201d", "Author": "Tundish N", "ReviewID": "UR124809464", "Content": "On first sight this hotel doesn't look bad. The lobby an the breakfast space is nicely designed, and look fancy. The rooms are also ok as far as design and even spaciousness goes. However, for people who can't stand rooms that are not aired, this is a horrible experience. The windows are huge but cannot be - not even slightly - opened. The air in the rooms is humid, stuffy and if you are staying here for 10 days like I have, it could become a really serious suffocating experience. Also, the building looks more like a business tower than a hotel and is next to the too busy and noisy Paseo de la Reforma Avenue. From my room, I could here the elevator system running all the time, next to the noise from the street. I'm sure there are so many places in Mexico DF whit a more quiet and natural surroundings, and a possibility to open a window and feel like an inhabit an of the Earth.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWorst experience in a Mexico City Hotel\u201d", "Author": "bizworldtraveler1000", "ReviewID": "UR123339005", "Content": "Please consider going to this property.

I needed to change my reservation to one night earlier and they gave me such a run around i decided to fight it on principle sake. They wanted to charge me a 100 dollar cancellation fee to move my reservation up one night. The room cost $95 dollars. They made me get expedia on the line and then hung up on us 5 times I was on the phone for over and hour and a half. When we asked for the fax number so that we could fax the change request they told us the fax was broken. Finally I got the right number and was able to make the change after two hours. The nasty attitude and general unfriendliness of the staff has made this reservation my last at this hotel chain. It is unfortunate because it is a good location. The fact that I am writing this review shows how ticked off I am that they would try to screw me for $100 bucks.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service and Great Location... Need improvement on breakfast!!\u201d", "Author": "Happyhare06", "ReviewID": "UR84181473", "Content": "I always stay in Centro (Close to Alameda Park) when I travel to Mexico DF for business. Staying in Centro you lose some time transporting yourself to places since DF traffic is awful, unless your customers are near Centro. Taking this into consideration, I choce to stay in City Express El Angel on this trip. Hotel is perfectly located right on the Independence Monument known as El Angel in Reforma Av. Sharing the same avenue with some other international branded hotels. On the \"back\" of City Express there's a zone known as Zona Rosa which is full of restaurants, clubs and malls. You will not have problem finding your choice of food. The hotel is also surrounded by banks and exchange houses. Right now due to anti money laundry policy, most bank don't offer exchange services unless you are their client. Exchange houses offer lower rates. But since hotel is surrounded by them, you can always compare and then decide. Personally, I don't mind the few bucks of difference. City Express is a local branded hotel chain which offer standard room (without \"luxury\") at a reasonable rate. I wasn't offered anything out of my expectation and of course nothing less either. Room was clean with a minimalistic modern design. My room was equipped with a 20\" Flat Screen TV which was enough since the room wasn't large. The shower was not as confortable as I would like, but it did the job. In order to safe water consumption, the shower was a pressurized sprinkler. Personally, I don't like that. My stay included continental breakfast. The continental breakfast included fruit, yougurt, cottage cheese, bread selection, cereal, coffee, juice and milk. This is enough for a good nutricious breakfast. However some items are not put available constantly therefore you had to wait for the waiter. The breakfast area wasn't cleaned constantly either. I was not happy with the breakfast experience. The gym is a guest room, instead of furniture they have 3 exercise machine. Running, Cycling and Orbitrack. With a TV and water fountain. Not much but good for 20 minutes exercise after eating a 300 oz arrachera. It is appreciated to have this small gym available. Besides the location I was very satified with City Express El Angel service. Their service was more than what I expected. Since my departure flight was late in the afternoon, I requested a late check out. I requested to check out at 15:00 and was offered until 16:00 which was just what I needed. Most of my requests are met without any hesitation. All staffs were nice and friendly. Over all I enjoyed my stay. I will definitely go back again!!", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "City Express Reforma El Angel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d1461750-Reviews-City_Express_Reforma_El_Angel-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$101 - $116*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Av.
