The rooms are decent enough and clean, although the shower/bath seems to stem from the 1980s and the hose for the shower is too short and basically makes it difficult to stand underneath the shower head.

Now I don't mind paying 11EUR per 24 hour period of internet (although it is still an insane amount of money if you are staying in this hotel three weeks), but the least you should get is unlimited internet, or at least an internet service that does not cut off skype calls every 25min.

We also had the option of having a freshly cooked breakfast prepared for us daily at no extra cost. internet access was free to all guests and hotel reception provided us with vouchers for use of same whenever we wanted.
