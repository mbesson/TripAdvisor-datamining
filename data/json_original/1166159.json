{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good location for the price I really enjoyed my stay at the Trianon hotel. Checkin was a breeze, even though we arrived rather late in the evening. The room was VERY small, but more than sufficient since you don't spend much time in your room in Amsterdam anyway! There was an even smaller bathroom, with a strange stepped tub (watch your step). The room was clean, although certainly not spotless (there were some stains on the carpet). The hotel is rather noisy as well, so if you are looking for a quiet stay you might look elsewhere. I should also note that the stairs are really steep (but I think this is common in Amsterdam).There is a tram stop right across the street, so getting around is no problem. It is located very near the Van Gogh museum and Vondelpark, so it is a bit further from the center. But we were still able to walk to anything we wanted to see without much trouble.They serve a very simple continental breakfast in the morning, which saves a bit of money on food.Overall, I was very satisfied with the experience.", "Date": "Oct 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR817721644", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "eobri"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1166159-r20547513-Hotel_Trianon-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "HotelID": "1166159", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
