The staff at the hotel are wonderful, and gave great advice about the surrounding area and attractions. Nothing seemed to much for them. The room size was not a problem for the two of us, and the bathrooms were lovely and clean. The mini bar was very handy, along with space in the fridge for our own purchases. Breakfast was good - the coffee was great and there was enough variety for everyone. Location wise, I thought it was very good. It was probably a good 10-15 minute walk to some of the popular sites, close enough to stroll to, but far enough away to escape the crowds and tour groups. Plus there were plenty of smaller things to see just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel and the Forum was just 5-10 minutes at the bottom of the road. There were plenty of places to eat around the hotel, and an Irish Bar at the back - for those who wanted a pint! The hotel had just completed the roof top bar, and we were given vouchers for a drink. They also serve an evening meal, which we would have tried if we had stayed there longer. We are already planning our next trip back, a 4 days/3 nights is not long enough! When we return, we will be staying at the Hotel Artemide again - just longer this time! Thanks to all the staff, especially our Maid, for a welcoming and stress-free stay.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a Great location\u201d", "Author": "jmak4", "ReviewID": "UR128219431", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Artemide Hotel for three nights in March. The staff were friendly and helpful for a big city hotel. There were several amenities that were very nice and that would make me recommend this hotel to others. The most important of which, was that everything in your room mini bar was complimentary. The mini bar included juice, water (sparkling and still), a beer, and a variety of snacks. This was really helpful for our long days of sight seeing. We would take the bottles of water and snacks with us as we explored Rome and didn't need to stop and buy food and drink as often. Also, on check in at the hotel, you received a voucher for a free prosseco or espresso in the hotel bar. The bar tender let my husband use his voucher on a beer instead, because that was what he preferred. Also, one of the best things about this hotel was its location. It was very convenient to the Rome Termini train station (5 minute walk) and the ancient Roman ruins (about a 10 minute walk). We even walked from our hotel to Vatican City. That was about a 30 minute walk, so maybe too much for some people, but we found the walk easy and allowed you to explore more of Rome along the way. The room was clean and the bathroom was spacious by European standards. The two main negatives to this hotel were that the breakfast was only fair, but most importantly, the street noise in our room was very loud. You cannot sleep with the window open because you hear loud trucks and people outside all night. If you closed the window, it was much better, but then the room was a bit stuffy. I would definitely ask for a room on the back side of the hotel if I were to stay here again.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel, odd location\u201d", "Author": "SKCTokyo", "ReviewID": "UR128214894", "Content": "An \"odd\" location, not a bad location. Easy walking distance to the train station. The hotel seems situated in a kind of Bermuda Triangle. Equally far from the main attractions, which might be considered an advantage to some travelers. The always busy street on which the hotel is located has no real identity, nor does it have any charm. The street has the usual array of hawkers, beggars, cigarette and other refuse, and dog leavings. In general, Rome (and Italy) would be much nicer if some effort was made to address these annoyances. The hotel public spaces are quite beautiful. The breakfast is, without question, in the top five of all the hotels in which I've stayed worldwide. That said, it might be that in the evening the restaurant is run by management independent of the hotel. I went one night and ordered lamb. The waiter failed to ask me how I wanted it cooked, took it to the wrong table where it was inspected at length by the surprised diners there, taken back to the kitchen, and then brought out to me. Worst lamb I've ever had; a description liking it to leather would be generous. Because of my lengthy stay, I was \"upgraded\" to a room on the top floor. The room was nicely appointed, but quite dark. It faced the inner \"courtyard,\" so it had no view, which contributed to the lack of light in the room. This may be an advantage; rooms facing the street are likely to be noisy. Except for Mario, who procured a Galleria Borghese reservation for me, entailing four telephone calls, the rest of the front desk service was indifferent. All in all, a good place to stay in Rome for the first-time traveler, such as I was. Would I stay there again?

I booked the hotel because of the reviews on Trip Advisor and whilst it was a very good hotel it some how didn't quite come up to all the fabulous reviews it has had particularly when you take into account the cost of the rooms. Yes the \"free\" minibar, toiletries and tea and coffee are a nice touch but surely nothing is free and it is reflected in the price of the room. The room was not a bad size for the 3 of us but it was very dark and to be honest a bit claustraphobic. It had only 1 window opening onto a small courtyard and you had to nearly hang out of the window to see any sky. We got the complimentary fruit bowl but not the 50% off the cost of a meal voucher that would probably have been more useful. We did hear several other residents referring to the fact they had this offer and other reviewers refer to it. We did get a voucher for a free glass of prosecco each in the newly opened roof top terrace bar but as we were the only people there it did lack a bit of atmosphere. I am sure it will be much better during warmer months. I sound a bit negative and don't mean to be. We did have a wonderful break it's just it wasn't quite as exceptional as I was expecting and I have stayed in equivalent hotels at a more reasonable price.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel, not as good as I was hoping for\u201d", "Author": "scottSD1", "ReviewID": "UR128005780", "Content": "We stayed there the first few days of April.

I am returning today and thought I should write out my review as I found it through TripAdvisor and I owe it to them for making my trip to Italy such a pleasure and hassle free one. Central Location: It is very centrally located - just a short walk from the Repubblica Metro Station (line A), 2 stops from the Spanish Steps and more importantly, very close to the Basilica Papale di Santa Maria Maggiore or Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major which is also the largest Roman Catholic Marian church in Rome, Italy. Saint Mary Major is one of the only four that today hold the title of major basilica. Central location also allows for free pick ups and drop off from all major tour operators. Service and Staff Uber Good - The rooms we stayed in, had free Wi-Fi, free minibar and newspaper. The staff from those at the reception to the porters are all uber friendly and helpful. In particular Sirajul was spectacularly helpful resourceful and helpful with his advice around the city. With my twin tykes and elder lady in tow, that is a very major benefit to have. They recently opened their roof top garden bar and restaurant which is quiet nice as well. Shuttle service to/from the Fiumicino and Ciampino airports, is available and subject to charges [we were charged Euro 70 for a six seater to Fiumicino]. On the downside for those staying there for a longer period [like us for a week] - the food options can get limited and are not the best. However, there are plenty of food options all around the hotel - with a McDonald and a Burger King nearby, should you need it but I would recommend the plethora of local choices in the cafes, and restaurants within walking distance. Overall, I have had a very pleasant stay for my family of five with a staff that made us feel at home everyday of our stay. Happy that I choose it and will definitely recommend it to my friends and family should they go to Rome. To sum up - it was the perfect confluence of central location, clean rooms and considerate staff that makes for a great stay.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aarhus, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cWas pleased a second time.\u201d", "Author": "Jean R", "ReviewID": "UR127870436", "Content": "This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel.

When I do give it the earth shakes a little. The location was also the best as far as I can see. Breakfast was also perfect. However the Barman / Manager (rooftop) in the restaurant is what really made the place and Rome special to us. He is such a lovely man and his staff follows in his showing of friendliness and service. The interesting thing was he looked very much and had mannerisms similar to one of my biggest adversaries. I did not get this till I was leaving and my wife was also struck by this when I told her. So what does this mean? Now because of this man I even look at my adversary in a better light. It is amazing the power of proper service and a good attitude (Genuine) can do. It can actually impact other parts of your life. Make sure to visit him on your stay and tip him well.

Also, staff gave us breakfast doggie bag on our check-out since our return flight was early in the morning and we would have to skip our breakfast. They also helped us book tours and directions. Nothing but compliments to the staff. For reasons that I did not give 5 star rating. For a four star, hotel room was a bit smaller than I expected as it had no couch (just a king size bed, desk, mini-freezer, and small tv). Also, hotel amenities (shampoo, bath soap, and rinse) could be better. Also, room lacked air circulation and felt stuffy. Lastly, room needs better sound proofing since we were able to hear our neighbor's TV sound throughout our sleep.

A taxi to Villa Borgese or the trevi fountain cost approx 6 euro. Our room overlooked the busy main street which meant when we opened the windows it was extremely noisy. We were unable to use the air conditioning as to help the environment in Rome it cannot be turned on until April.However the reception staff kindly offered to put a fan in our room and this solved the problem. Our classic room was a little small and short of storage space(no drawers and not enough hangers)The bathroom however was good sized and very well stocked with toiletries replaced daily. Via Nationale is a main shopping street with Max Mara next door and many other high street shops. However there are very few restaurants on this street so if you come in from a rather tiring day you may find you need to go back to the trevi fountain area to find a better choice of eateries. We would have loved to try the hotel's roof top restaurant but unfortunately it is closed and in the process of refurbishment . The breakfast room is also being used as the restaurant for the time being. If one turns left out of the hotel and walks for around 4 minutes there is a small street on the left (about the 2nd turning) and at the end there is a chinese restaurant and a pizza place called Ricci est est est.

I can happily say that Hotel Artemide lived up to the hype and helped give us a wonderful time in Italy. From the moment we checked in when we were greeted by the gracious Valentina to the moment we checked out with the friendly Alessandro, we were treated with class and warmth. The hotel manager even sent us a bottle of merlot and mixed nuts as a honeymoon gift! The hotel itself is an older (like most facilities in Rome) but well maintained building and we did not experience any technical issues. Our suite #402 was splendid and had a balcony overlooking Via Nazionale and, although it overlooks a busy street, we did not experience any issues regarding noise because we are heavy sleepers and generally not bothered by noise (that's what living in a city does to you!). The room had many amenities including sweets, mini-fridge with complimentary water/beer/soda, and plenty of space. We also did not feel unsafe in the hotel nor surrounding areas. The neighborhood is very urban yet safe. There is also actually a McDonalds down the street for anyone who truly craves American food but there is also a mini-grocery store across the street as well. The nicest restaurant that is closest to the hotel is Doverali, which is also across the street next to the grocery store. The food there is good and the service is pleasant. However there are plenty of trattorias and less fancy ristorantes with good food nearby too. Via Nazionale is a major street so there are also shops and sights nearby as well as a major museum that had a Guggenheim exhibit while we were there. If you stay at Artemide, you are literally no more than a 15-20 min walk from many sights such as Trevi Fountain, Via Veneto, and the Colosseum so the location is good. The only thing that is somewhat far away was the Vatican, but you can take a taxi there for about 10 Euros if you don't feel like taking the 45 min walk. We did not use the Metrorail in Rome and hired a car to pick us up at the airport when we arrived to take us to the hotel (it was an excellent limo service with prices comparable to a taxi). When we were leaving to go home, we tried taking the Metrorail to Fiumicino Airport from Termini Station however we found it to be very confusing and not user-friendly so we just grabbed a taxi instead from Termini. If you do decide to use the Metrorail, the hotel is about 3-4 city blocks away, which isn't too bad but just be prepared to not get lost because it can be confusing if you are unfamiliar with the area. Also the only thing we feel we missed out on was the Terrace Restaurant/Bar on the roof of the hotel.

Generally most hotels do not let you check in but we were made to wait only 10 minutes during which time, they gave us additional complimentary drinks vouchers so that we could enjoy a glass of Prosecco each. We were also given a complimentary breakfast voucher and would advice that that it is better to book a room with breakfast as the quality and variety is good. The room was small, but well arranged and neat and clean. The mini bar is free which is amazing considering that most hotels rip you off with the prices on the products in the mini bar. The bathroom had a bath/shower, WC and a bidet, was kept spanking clean and was well stocked with toiletries. The only downside that I can think off is the shower curtain in the bathroom that did not effectively prevent the water from spilling on to the floor. Unfortunately, we did not have time to try the sauna or gym but the location of the hotel is such that you can get good exercise walking to all the sights in Rome. In fact, we did not need to take the taxi even once during our whole stay and the hotel staff were very helpful with directions. Shopping on Via Nazionale where the hotel is located is decent, especially for ladies dresses and shoes.

To be balanced, I'll get a couple of slight negatives out of the way first. The Hotel is not as grand as some photos's might suggest. It's a relatively modest 4* hotel in terms of the specification of it's reception, lounge & restaurant areas. Also our room was very small, just a bit of space to get around the bed. We booked a standard room so it's hard to see how the cheaper \"economy\" size rooms we saw available when we booked could be any smaller. I note others have referred to the standard rooms being a good size at this hotel, therefore sounds like we got a bad allocation & so moral of the story is to try and get reception to move you if you get put in a very small room, as clearly the standard rooms must vary allot. Also the roof terrace bar you may have seen advertised is closed at the moment for refurb just to be aware. In terms of location, the better shopping & restaurant area's can be distant from the main historical attractions dotted around the city and this kind of sits in the middle of it all. So whilst the area immediately around the hotel is fine but without any great selling point (apart from maybe proximity to the main station), it is however a very good location to leave most things (Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Forum, Pantheon etc) all within 15/20 mins walking distance. The big plus with this hotel is that they have so many nice touches you really feel like you are being looked after. Free mini bar, free wifi, movies in the room only 5 euros, complimentary drinks when you arrive, helpful staff - the general culture at the hotel is one of good value & service.

The entire walks were pleasant and safe - no dodgy areas to walk through which is a major plus. The Hotel itself is smart and well kept. The rooms are a good enough size for a City centre hotel. Staff are helpfull and friendly. A major bonus the hotel offers is the free mini bar in your room.

Anything used was replenished every day, including the mini bar - juices, water and a couple of Peronis too!!!!! The staff were very polite and helpful and seemed to really like doing their jobs. I am mildly agoraphobic and when the restaurant manager realised I had a problem with feeling trapped at certain tables, he made sure the staff were aware and every morning they found us a table where I felt comfortable. I also admired the extreme patience with which one of the reception staff treated a very nasty American lady who actually snapped her fingers at him, demanding that her room be ready in five minutes!!! I wanted to kick her, but he just continued to be polite and helpful. The food was delicious and at breakfast there was plenty of choice and lots of everything - cold meat and cheeses, fresh fruits, yoghurts, different types of bread, eggs, bacon, several types of juices, pastires, etc etc. The dinner menu was a little limited, but as they served the best lasagne I have ever tasted, this didn't bother me. On my birthday we were given wine and strawberries in our room - compliments of the management - a lovely surprise. Location was excellent, we didn't use public transport once, you could walk to everything you wanted to see easily. We even walked up to St Peter's Basilica and back. I can honestly say that I have only ever stayed in one other hotel as good as this one. Admittedly I have not stayed in a five star hotel ever, but who needs one when four star standard is this good?

The hotel is located approx 20 minutes walk to the Colosseum/ Forums and 15 minutes from the Spanish Steps area. Even though, the walking times are not long to many of the main tourist sites , however if you are travelling with young children it may not suit you due to the extra foot time to get to them. If your interested in going to the Vatican you can avail of the underground (close by), taxi or bus. Walking is a good 45 minutes-hour (for adults). The area around the hotel is fine; it is on a street with small stores and a few bars. There is also a small supermarket and pharmacy across the street. Although, there is not a huge selection of restaurants in the area and require some hunting down. I booked this hotel based on the amount of positive reviews on Tripadvisor and I would have loved to give this hotel a 5 star review, however a few things let this hotel down and stop it from been the top class hotel it could be. So what are the positives? 1) Nice and well decorated hotel. 2) Extremely friendly and helpful floor staff (staff in the blue jackets) 3) Helpful check in staff. 4) Nice rooms, a bit small (for more than 2 people). {We had a triple room} 5) Excellent breakfast area and very helpful breakfast staff. 6) Free mini bar! 7) Welcome Fruit in room on arrival. 8) Welcome drinks. So why not 5 stars? We were travelling with 2 children, 1 is a toddler and therefore we had pre-ordered a cot. The cot was perfectly prepared on arrival. However, the following morning the baby blanket in the cot was replace with a towel!! Yes - A TOWEL! It was not a mistake as it was under the bed sheet! This was totally unacceptable! I did request another blanket and one was quickly sent up. However, for a hotel in this calibre, it is just inexcusable! I would not expect this in motorway hotel let alone a 4 star hotel! Few other small points, the toilet supplies (shampoo, bath foam etc) were not topped up each day, the bar staff could be a bit more polite and the room service menu is very limited. Rome can be expensive in relation to hotels (especially at the upper end), so is this hotel worth the cost? We got a 3 for 2 deal which was fantastic, however if I'd paid full price I would have been disappointed especially with the size of the room (for the cost) and the incident with the baby cot. Others have said that the rooms are spacious, possibly for a couple, but the triple room did not appear to be much larger. I assume suits are larger and therefore maybe more suited if you\u2019re staying with children. Would I stay here again? As a couple yes, especially if the main tourist sites are not the main focus of your trip.

Admittedly we do like to walk to explore a city anyway but this certainly felt central enough for this to be no problem at all. Breakfast was plentiful at all times, no running out of anything, so no need to worry that you are going to be left with a dry roll and a random yoghurt if (like us) you like to slope up 15 minutes before they stop serving! There was a varied range of choices and they were all of good quality. Service was prompt and of course friendly, even to the point where one of the waiters would remember my coffee order from the day before and come to offer a second round during the meal, whilst also humouring and encouraging my learner Italian :) We are a couple but the room we stayed in could have been used by a family as the sofa in the seating area was a double sofa bed, and there would have been a decent amount of room given that this is a central location in Rome. I have already recommended it to friends of mine with a child, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again the next time I go to Rome. Tip: on arrival at Fiumcino we were a bit hesitant to book the Leonardo Express train to Termini given how much of a walk the guide book said it was at the other end from the arrival platform to getting to the front of the station. The guy at the ticket booth said the same thing so we took a shuttle bus in which dropped us at the side of the station. On the way back we took the train and the platforms it departed from were right at the front of the station so I think there may have been a platform alteration at some point recently / a bit of disingeniousness from the ticket booth people.

As mentioned by a lot of people here, the rooms are a bit on the small side, but that is common in most major cities, and when you are there to see the attractions of the city, how big do you need?.The rooms all have free wi-fi, flat-screen Tv and that most rare of all things in a hotel, a free mini-bar -- no wines or spirits, but water, Coke, juices and beers. The breakfast was very good as well -- not that different from what is on offer in many decent hotels, but the range on offer was wide, and nothing ever ran out. I mailed them in advance to request one double and one twin for our rooms and let them know we were in Rome for my daughters 18th birthday, and when we got to her room there was a birthday card and a huge plate of fresh fruit. Rome was hit by their first major snowfall in 30 years whilst we were there, but nothing was too much trouble for the staff at the hotel, including free umbrella's for all guests who ventured out whilst the snow was falling. The little touch's are the things that usually make the difference and that sum's up the Artemide. We didn't see as much as we would have liked because of the snow, and we will definitely go back. When we do the Artemide will be the first hotel that I look to book.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood all rounder in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Sharon M", "ReviewID": "UR124193918", "Content": "The hotel staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to help with any requests that we had.

I had a regular double room (not economy)... a bit on the small side, but that is pretty standard for european hotels. Bed is foam mattress that is pretty comfortable. The sheets are nice and soft. There is not alot of storage space (drawers, closet), so if you are staying in Rome long, you might need to live from your suitcase a few days. Bathroom is large... very roomy which was a pleasant surpise. Everything is upgraded and the bathroom amenities were nice. Location: About a 10-12 minute walk from Roma Termini. Taxi should cost 10-15 euros unless they give you a tour of the city. Be very careful with Roma Taxis. I try to avoid them as much as possible as they know every trick in the book to take money from you. I had a taxi charge me 5 euros extra for baggage. Have exact change. Gave 20 euros for a 10 euro ride, taxi driver said I gave him 5 euros. Eventually he said \"oh you wanted change, I don't have change.\" If you like to take public transportation, metro republicca is only a few blocks away.. 5 min walk. If you like to be around Piazza Novana/Pantheon area and don't want to use the bus, then I wouldn't recommend Hotels up near Roma Termini, unless you like to walk 15-20 minutes one way. Rome is also not flat. Roma Termini and Via Veneto areas are sort of at the top while Coloseum/Forum, Pantheon, Piazza Novana are at the bottom.

A variety of newspapers is offered in the public rooms. If the hotel were in the Pantheon or Navona square areas, my favorite places to stay in Rome, it would have been perfect. The problem is that the hotel has received so much publicity that, this year, the prices have risen dramatically. In fact, I believe that the hotel, in spite of the prices, is sold out for the period we shall be in Rome next October. Our request for a room went unanswered. I suppose it's inevitable that a lot of publicity and praise will cause higher rates and a sold-out high season! Therefore, we have made reservations elsewhere, in my favorite part of Rome. Incidentally, and this might be a coincidence, I had an allergy attack while staying at the Artemide. At first, I thought I had caught a bad cold, but, then I realized that it was an allergic reaction that I have gotten in one or two other old European hotels. It rather spoiled my stay in Rome a bit.

It was our cultural trip and we stayed 3 nights at Artemide after doing a lot of research into hotels, location and attractions. This is a great hotel!... it is on Via Nazionale which is like Oxford Street/Knightsbridge in London, a lot of shops, fashion and restaurants on side streets. It's also 5-10 minutes\u2019 walk from the main train station with a direct line to Fiumicino airport and where all the buses and coaches come in too from both of Rome\u2019s airports. I recommend you take the coach from the airport not Rome... A company called Terravision charge \u20ac4 each way, it is the cheapest way (train is about \u20ac14 each and takes 30 minutes, taxi \u20ac40) and takes 45 minutes. They leave every 30 minutes. You can buy a return ticket for \u20ac8 there, or you pay \u20ac6 if you wait to buy it at the Rome end coming back. We flew with Alitalia from Heathrow and it was good flight times and all-round good flight, they serve drinks and biscuit snacks, but don\u2019t expect a hot meal. They have their own coaches that come back from Rome, which we used... that was \u20ac7 and it was less crowded than the Terravision one. (Their coach service is not well advertised) You can get around Rome on foot, bus or taxi. We mostly walked and you can walk within 20-25 minutes from here to the Trevi Fountain, Spanish steps, and Trajan's market. Also 25-30 minutes or two tube-stops to the Coliseum, Palatine and Roman Forum (which are all in the same area). The No. 64 bus gets you to the Pantheon - which is a must-see in a very picturesque old square. You CAN walk to the Vatican City but it would be 30-40 minutes, or you can take the tube and get pretty close. Beware the queues for St Peters Square are MASSIVE... buy your tickets online FIRST. The last Sunday in the Month is FREE entry so it gets very busy with locals. Unlike Paris and London getting around Rome is cheap... they are not out to rip you off... an All-day anywhere tube ticket is \u20ac4 per day... a ticket that lasts 75 minutes is just \u20ac1 to anywhere in the city. Buses operate similar all-day tickets which you buy from Kiosks or Newsagents, you CAN\u2019T pay on the bus... we didn\u2019t know this so we got a free ride un-wittingly, they don\u2019t really check it\u2019s too crowded. Watch your pockets on buses and tubes as when you are sandwiched in you are vulnerable to pick-pockets. Attractions are also quite cheap to get into - average \u20ac8 per adult. Children are usually half-price OR FREE up to aged 18 if you are an EU citizen (take proof e.g. passport with you at all times). The Coliseum ticket is FREE for up to 18 and also gets you into the Palatine and Roman Forums and can be used over a 2 days period. We paid for the guided tour at \u20ac5 and it is well worth it!... don\u2019t get scammed outside there are street sellers as you wait to go in selling \u201cticket tours\u201d \u2013 they are NOT cheaper, and DON\u2019T allow children in FREE either... buy your tickets INSIDE! Restaurants are mainly small side-street very quaint (some quite basic in decor but with very good food) - prices can be high though, allow \u20ac30-\u20ac40 Euros per head, and ask at the hotel because some of the restaurants in the busy tourist areas are not great. This hotel is very clean and well maintained and the staff are great. The rooms can be a little on the small side but are well equipped.. this is not un-typical though for an inner city hotel in a historic building. Rooms have free Wi-fi, tea/coffee, air-con, TV (only English channels are Sky News, BBC World and CNN but we weren't there to watch TV). The Minibar is FREE and restocked every day... you will find water, 2 cans of beer, and fruit just cartons in there. Our room also had free dressing gowns, and slippers. Beds are firm (very firm) - you either like that or you don't. Breakfast is buffet and pretty comprehensive, juices, fruits, yoghurts, pastries, boiled eggs, toast, even sausage and scrambled egg. The Hotel has a roof terrace bar/restaurant which is lovely, and you get a voucher when you check-in for a free drink of Prosecco or Coffee. There are parasols and patio heaters up there and luxury wicker furniture. Wear comfortable shoes... you will be doing a LOT of walking!

The email communications with Mattheo at the hotel before we arrived were very helpful, thorough and friendly. We were very warmly greeted after some 36 hours of travel and given discounts on the Roof top restaurant and other useful bits and pieces. The Hotel is a beautiful, historic building with a charming, graceful atmosphere. Our room was very quiet, peaceful, easy to completely darken if you wanted to and roomy with well appointed with lots of storage room, lots of coat hangers, and very well appointed and perfectly functioning bathroom. You are able to open the huge windows for fresh air if you wish to. The free mini bar is delightful, thoughtful and very convenient for tired travelers. The location is fantastic. Very convenient to all the Roman icons and great for shopping. We did a day trip to Venice during our stay and were able to easily walk from the hotel to the train station. I would suggest travelers consider taking the train to Florence and/or Naples rather than a tour bus - very easy, comfortable and fun. Venice is a long fast train trip but well worth it - we were back at the hotel before midnight. We took a tourist coach tour to Florence on the second day of our stay. We loved Florence and made a friend on the bus but overall decided that independent travel for day tours and to see all the fantastic sights was most comfortable and best value for money for us. Taking a hop on, hop off bus tour is a good introduction to Rome on your first day or so if you are a bit weary. We bought three day Roma Passes for the metro but only used them once to go to the Vatican. Walked all the rest of the time - fantastic! The housekeeping at the Artemide is of an astounding standard - congratulations on this to the management - far better than in any 5 star hotel I have stayed in. The breakfast buffet was consistently excellent and our room service was also good. We enjoyed the Rooftop Terrace garden for New Year's Eve dinner and celebrations. Christmas and New Year is a fabulous time to visit Rome. The Christmas decorations are elegant and an absolute delight everywhere. It is not too cold - lovely and fresh - and the crowds and queues are manageable especially before 9.30am in the morning or late afternoon.

Yes, the hotel has a grand entrance, nice waiting-lounge area, marble flooring, but this dies down as soon as the elevator(very slow)opens to your floor. I expected \"Grand\" room as like the hotel is rated, and it felt like 3 star. We paid $145 USD a night for this hotel- I felt it was overated. The beds were softer, but again, we expected a grand room. The sheets, were clean. The bed was a queen size, took major part of the space. No iron, you must request at front desk. The UPSIDE is that it is close to the train station. About a 10 minute walk with luggage. Not bad at all. We expected complimentary breakfast during the three nights we stayed. Was not the case, we received a voucher for one free buffet breakfast for the entire stay. We wanted to try before deciding to pay for the extra two. We woke up early, turned in our vouchers, were seated by great & polite hostess. The buffet consists of eggs, sausage, mini pancakes, hot chocoloate, cereal, cold meats as well as salad. There were pastries, cookies, fruits. A variety of things to choose from. This is a buffet breakfast that charges 15 euros pp per day. We decided not to purchase breakfast for the other two days. There is sooo much to explore out there! The staff is great. They will cater to your every need! This is a plus. The airport, they say is about 45 minutes, but if there is no traffic and if the driver paces well, you'll be there in 30. It seems we were overcharged for transportation. 50 euros. Call front desk to make the reservation. Snacks are free. Coffee, cookies, water, and juice in fridge also free. But i don't think so, they of course throw that in the price of the hotel.. which i still think was overpriced, even considering location. The hotel is walking distance to Spanish steps and Trevie Fountain( about 15-20 minutes) i don't mind walking. The Vatican from the hotel is a good four miles roundtrip. Taxi about 8 euros. But they get pretty ticked off because they loose place in line to take you somewhere so close. Tip'em well if you cause them this incovenience.

Next time I am in Rome, this is where I will be staying. We had a room on the 4th floor (403), on the street side (Via Nazionale), with a balcony. I had requested a street view, so this was perfect. I have read a lot of reviews about the noise from the street, but to be honest, we did not have any issues. The window has a outdoor shutter that will completely cover the window if you so desire. I slept like a baby. No complaints. The bathroom was the largest out of the three hotels we stayed at in Europe. Lots of counter space, and lots of free toiletries, and very clean!The complimentary mini bar was excellent. Bottled water and soda seemed to be so expensive, it was nice to be able to take a bottle of water with you everyday, and the mini bar would be restocked by the time we got back. This front desk staff were awesome. Valentina, Matteo, Alessandro, and another gentleman whose name escapes me right this moment, were very helpful and accommodating. They assisted with restaurant recommendations, confirming our guided tour appointments, and contacted our travel arrangements to make sure they were correct. ( they weren't.. which could have been a disaster trying to get to the airport..but Valentina was on top of it.) Breakfast was included with our room, and it was very tasty. It was nice to be able to tour the city after a nice meal. One of the days, our guided tour was picking us up before the breakfast was served, so the hotel delivered to our room a take away breakfast. Very nice! The location of this hotel was perfect. We walked to a lot of places, but were lucky that our guided tours would pick us up and drop us off at the hotel. We were also right up the road from the \"hop on, hop off\" stop, and were about to get around to all the major attractions this way. Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay at the Artemide Hotel, and would def recommend to anyone visiting Rome.

The hotel was as described by many other reviewers. Good location (just 15 minutes walk from Termini, the first station from Fiumicino airport), the staff were excellent and the rooms were perfect. The bed was firm (I think this is common to all rooms in the hotel) but I don't mind that. My room's window faced into a non-descript couryard but that didn't bother me since all I cared about was having a quiet room. Some people have suggested that rooms that face onto Via Nazionale can hear the street below but the windows are quite hefty so I think any noise would be minimal. Food-wise, the buffet breakfast was unbeatable, probably the best I've had in a while. Plenty of choice and a great start to each day. I tended to be out all day photographing and then come back to the room late-ish. I don't use the restaurant (I hate eating solo asides from breakfast) and usually use room service. My only criticim here was the room service menu for evening meals was rather disappointing. Breakfast and snacks are good but evening meals was limited to 2 unexciting pastas, some beef dish and lobster. No matter how hard I stared at the menu options, I couldn't entice myself to order any of the meals and I ended up popping out to get takeaway pizza, and using an Irish bar nearby to get food. There needs to be a few extra meals to make me want to use the evening meals menu. Finally, the bar on the 7th floor was interesting. I like to be anonymous and mind my own business. I'm not into meeting strangers and having a swell time. As I want is to wind down, have a glass or two of wine by myself and reflect on the day. However, as soon as I walked into the relatively small 7th floor bar, it was packed, full of couples, with random people in dressing gowns on the outside part. It felt like I'd walked into a bad episode of Friends. I reversed walked out of the bar immediately. Overall, it's a really good hotel and I'd come back again. The 7th floor bar weirded me out a bit but that's just me. I'm sure other people would probably love it.

Indeed it was even better value because of the first rate buffet breakfasts and the generous free mini bar - restocked daily with beer, soft drinks, juices, bottled water, mineral water, nuts, crackers, wafers,biscotti etc. The rooms are clean, modern, comfortable and spotlessly maintained. The hotel is in a great central location on the via Nazionale in a nice part of town with clothing shops, souvenir shops, ATMs and even a Despar mini mart close by. It is only a 10 minute walk from the Termini Railway station, about 5 minutes walk to the Metro at Repubblica and less than 10 minutes walk to nearby attractions such as Colonna Traiana and the Fori Imperiali, the Palazzo del Quirinale, Palazzo Barberini and Santa Maria Maggorie. The hotel roof top bar and restaurant are top class with nice touches such as a welcome drink on arrival and we were also offered 50% discount on food AND wine for dinner at the restaurant one night. It was actually one of the nicest meals we had in Rome. We had pre dinner drinks and an antipasto platter on the terrace, a three course meal in the restaurant (including lobster and steak) wines by the glass for each course, and finishing with liqueurs and coffee for a total cost of 66 Euro for two. Amazing value and superb quality.The hotel also arranged for a car to collect us from Fiumicino airport at an acceptable rate (60 Euros) which was much appreciated having arrived in Rome at 7AM after an exhausting 30 hours flying time from Australia. We were also offered an additional breakfast at that time while our room was being prepared.

You have to be very carful with pick pocketers there, but everywhere we went looked like a dump, especially near the central station. Try and avoid staying there! The Artemide hotel is centrally located (Republicca - one stop from Termini on Metro A) so the metro and buses were easy and so economical, yet miles from the dump of Termini. Avoid taxis as they rip you off! There are lots of nice shops and eating places in the area with a lovely wine bar across the road, who do the best Pina Colada's I've had.

I don't regret staying here and agree with many of the nice things people have said, but thought it would be useful to list some of the things I don't think are worthy of rave reviews. First, the room we had was very small--so small that it was something of a challenge to place our our three pieces of luggage where they wouldn't be in the way. The free Internet access was extraordinarly slow--almost uselessly slow at times. I didn't find the location to be as wonderful as some other reviewers. It's a 20-25 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon, and that includes a pretty steep hill. It takes 25-30 minutes to walk to the Coliseum and the Forum. Finally, $1,223 for four nights (including breakfast) during the off season isn't exactly a bargain. But all of that said, this is a nice hotel with a very friendly and accomodating staff, the free minibar is a nice amenity, and we found the buffet breakfast quite good and the service in that dining room to be outstanding.

The location is absolutely great for shopping and sightseeing - many of which are walkable or you can hop on various run-around buses from outside the nearby station terminal. Inside the decor to the common areas is very presentable and tasteful. Same comment with the bedrooms - but we found the latter rather small (we had three twin rooms) - even for a capital city. Fine for a long weekend stay but not for any longer period where you might be in your room for more than an overnight sllep. Shame as the bathroom is very nicely tiled and fitted out..Breakfast which was included is a perfect start to the day with good service and wide range of varied food options. There is a small bar/restaurant on the top floor which we ate in the first night. Food very average and little or no ambience which is a shame as the outside addition bar seating are on the roof garden is pretty nice. Although there were heaters for the evening they struggle to be effective so you need to wrap up to really enjoy this outside of the summer/early autumm. Overall enjoyable but doesn't quite get top marks for the rooms size and roof garden restaurant. Also wasn't too impressed when the bellboy came into the downstairs lounge while we were watching a sports match to put an alternative channel on with his favourite team - without even asking if we minded first - that wasn't clever.The cost of our three nights varied massively for each night, so some careful choice of dates might provide better value for money. Final note, can there be a worse airport ever than Rome's Fiumicino? We allowed two hours to get from Terminal 2 through check in, security and passport control - and we only just made the gate an hour and a half later. The three lines of security dropped to two when one team went off for a 20 minute break - just as the queue reached it's peak.

Each time I begin writing, I remember one more pleasant thought that must be said about the Artemide. I need to simplify ... The hotel: The facilities are clean, stylish and more than adequate. You'll not find a lot of wasted lobby space but you'll not find yourself wanting for a specific facility, e.g. restaurant, health club, bar, etc. The rooms: Guest rooms are the same. Filled with amenities, it's clear that the Artemide wants you to feel comfortable. The staff: They could not have been more attentive and friendly. When they (somewhat accidentally) learned of a birthday in our group, they sent a fruit basket to his room with their personal wishes for a happy birthday. No one asked them to do it, nor did they try to take credit. Only when we asked did they own up to their generosity. The location: Excellent. Walking distance to many sites. Close to both Metro station and Termini. Via Nazionale is a main traffic artery and one doesn't feel unsafe walking it. The value for your money: Could not be better. Rome can be expensive yet the Artemide offers reasonable rates and includes almost everything a traveler could want, e.g. breakfast, mini-bar, etc. Summary: It's often little surprises that turn average into good. The Artemide was so filled with these little surprises that I can only think of it as excellent. Our family could not have had a more pleasant experience.

We enjoyed having a street view and whilst there was a small amount of traffic noise at peak times (it IS a city centre hotel after all) it was hardly noticeable due to the efficient double glazing and didn\u2019t bother us at all \u2013 we had no problems sleeping and I enjoyed waking in the mornings to the hubbub of the city gradually stirring itself into life. Things that we liked: - the location \u2013 plenty of interesting attractions within easy walking distance - very convenient for the Termini and for nearby subway and buses - friendly and efficient staff (always a smile and a friendly greeting) - clean and comfortable room and bathroom \u2013 not the largest of rooms but well equipped with everything we needed - the complimentary mini-bar (much appreciated) and tea/ coffee making facilities - the breakfast buffet \u2013 plenty of staff on hand and a very good selection to choose from \u2013 even for late-comers like us who struggle to get up in the morning - the complimentary glasses of sparkling wine in the rooftop bar \u2013 a nice way to sit and relax after a tiring day. Although there is nothing about the hotel we didn\u2019t like, we found that some of the restaurants in the near vicinity were of a very poor standard - on reflection we wished that we had tried out the hotel restaurant on at least one evening of our stay.

Allessandro in reception, is particularly helpful and sent us a number of emails prior to our stay to help us with airport transfers which they kindly arranged at a cost of \u20ac60 euros to be picked up and \u20ac45 euros to be dropped off at the airport. The pick up and drop off service is very efficient with Mercedes being the mode of transport. The transfer takes about 45 minutes. WARNING - the 3 night stay was booked in the UK via Expedia. The fee was paid as described BUT there was no prior warning of The Rome 'Room tax' that all visitors have to pay in top of their agreed package. Neither was it made clear on booking that the hotel will charge you different rates for each night you stay with them. For the three nights there were three different room rates. The middle night was as much as \u00a3100 more expensive than the the previous night. This is not what is expected when you have confirmed and paid for a hotel stay. Their explanation was that this is because of 'supply and demand' - this is a strange logic. Once a fee is agreed on a B&B basis it shouldn't vary because of 'demand' as you have already booked your nights at the hotel.

Do not know where they eat but having traveled extensively and have eaten at 1 star and 5 star hotels, there was nothing to complain about here. If you wanted something, just ask the dining room manager Pasquale. FYI we had room 516 which was designated a \"Superior Room\" . King bed, a second single bed which we used for clothing staging, frige, free WiFi, bath with tub/shower combination and double or triple paned windows/heavy blackout curtains/fabric covered walls creating a dead silent sleeping environment. Will stay here everytime we come to Rome.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cFree mini bar & wifi all day long!\u201d", "Author": "Thor11", "ReviewID": "UR119597784", "Content": "Still staying in this hotel while writing this review. Honestly speaking, I'm missing my favorite hotel chain ie Park Hyatt and Grand Hyatt. The room is quite ok. The decor looks quite outdated and needs a major uplifting. However, the service in this hotel makes up for it. Staff are very helpful and efficient. My clothes from the laundry were returned to me on the same day even though it was stated that laundry sent before 10 am will only be ready the next day. The front desk officer did not even bat an eyelash when I requested for more pillows ie 3 extra pillows. The mini bar was great and free of charge! Furthermore, the hotel provided a kettle in each room! That's very uncommon in European hotels. But it was greatly appreciated. I need not pay \u20ac5 for a pot of hot water like I did in Westin Paris! What a rip-off! I also appreciate the wifi here.

The hotel location was fantastic and is a few minutes walk from the Rome Termini train station (or even less from the Repubblica tube station). It is on via Nazionale, which is a busy street so don't expect total silence if you get a room with a street view. On arrival we were warmly welcomed and checked in very early, about 11am. We also were welcomed with a bottle of wine in our room which was a nice touch. The location also provides easy access to all of the major attractions either by walking or using the buses that stop just down from the hotel. There is also a pharmacy across the road if you need anything and fruit stands just around the corner for any late night cravings. The free minibar is very useful (as others have mentioned it is water, soft drink and beer) for water bottles for daily outings (although the fountains in Rome have the best water to top them up with) and it is nice not to have to worry about additional charges at the hotel. In the bathroom you will find conditioner which is very rare for Europe and Italy in general! The bathroom was big and had probably the largest range of products I've seen in a hotel. The rooftop bar and garden is a great place to go and relax. It is also very good value for money, we had a few drinks and the sliced meat platter and being 'foodies' didn't expect too much from a hotel, however, we were pleasantly surprised and it was a big serving and great quality and value for 10 euro. The room was very clean - and if you stay there make sure you look under the bed! (Spoiler alert: there is a little card under the bed saying they make sure they check everywhere!) Each day the cleaner personally leaves a card with their name and the two we met were both lovely and friendly and seemed to really enjoy their jobs which is in contrast to some of the other hotels we have stayed in. The breakfast has a really wide choice and the double espresso's kept coming! Good products and everything was fresh and tasty. On their website, the hotel say you receive 'complimentary smiles'. This doesn't sum up the hospitality you receive in this place. All of the staff, without exception, were lovely, friendly, helpful and genuinely did everything to make our stay as great as possible.

The bed was a little harder than I would have liked but big enough for my wife and I. The staff was great form the front desk to the folks working the breakfast room. Rooms were always cleaned and the mini bar restocked every day. Breakfast was very good with a decent selection and probably the best coffee in Rome. The location is selling point of this hotel. A couple of blocks from Termini and walking distance to main reasons you go to Rome - The Pantheon, The Colosseum/Forum/Palatine Hill, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona and all the museums and galleries. The kicker was that on our way out to catch a car to the airport at 6:00AM they presented us with 2 bags of fruit and water and other items so we could have breakfast on the way to the airport. I've never heard of any hotel ever doing that. It was a very nice touch. Whatever hotel you decide on be sure to visit the Galleria Doria Pamphilj on Via del Corso. It is a private art gallery with works by Carracci, Caravaggio, Bernini and a most astounding portrait of Pope Innocent by Velazquez. Unlike some other galleries in Rome there are no crowds and you can really take your time and enjoy some real masterpieces.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampere, Finland", "Title": "\u201cArtemide\u201d", "Author": "Jarno L", "ReviewID": "UR119042547", "Content": "Great hotel and service!

We certainly weren't disappointed, although our \"Classic Room\" was smaller than we'd expected. We had just enough room to move around the comfortable king size bed, but the bathroom was nearly as big so plenty space there. Furnishings and decor were good and everything was nice and clean. Our room was on the fourth floor and overlooked the main road (Via Nazionale) but we weren't troubled by traffic noise at all because of the effective double glazed windows. All the staff were friendly and helpful, so full marks to them. I'd mentioned in our booking that we were arriving on my wife's birthday; it was a nice surprise for her to find a birthday card and bottle of Chianti in our room. The \"free\" mini bar was a nice touch, although it didn't contain much of a selection: beer, cola, orangeade, water. Breakfast was very good, with a choice of fresh fruits, salads, pastries, cold meats, cheeses and nicely cooked eggs, sausages, mushrroms, bacon, etc. Slightly disappointing was having my coffe served in a large jug so by the time I poured my second cup it was going cold. At just over GBP700 for three nights in late September/early October we were hoping for something exceptional, but perhaps everywhere in Rome is this expensive, no matter what time of the year. Our flight back to the UK was in the evening and we were able to leave our cases at the hotel after the 12 noon check out. We were also able to use the gym shower to freshen up and change before final departure. The hotel offers a limo service to and from the airport at 40Euros that we booked for the return after having to pay 60Euros for the tatty cab ride from the airport. I'd read that the fare should be 30Euros but the cabby at the front of the line said that it was \"on the meter\". Not wanting to argue and with people queuing behind us I reluctantly agreed. For some reason our hotel limo didn't turn up when we left (probably because I only booked it 30 minutes beforehand!) so the receptionist hailed a cab and made sure we only paid 30Euros.

When we turned onto Via Nationale on the beautiful the cobble stoned street we marveled at how old and anticient Rome was. So imagine our surprise when the cab stopped at the Artemide Hotel smack in the middle of a beautuful area. The doorman chearfully welcomed us and when we walked through the doors we felt like we were home. The desk manager was very nice and he gave us a couple of complimentary drink vouchers for the rooftop resturant. The bellcap led us to our room which was small but very clean and sunny. The bathroom was very well stocked with soaps, lotions, shoe cleaners and other essentials. The mini bar was also stocked with juices, waters, sodas, and local beer. It is all complimentary. The style of the hotel I would discribe as boutique. While I'm sure that there are much larger and more modern hotels in Rome, the Artimide Hotel makes up for it in service. Free wi -fi in every room and cable TV which did have a couple of English speaking channels. But I really enjoyed watching an old Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet film dubbed in Italian. Fun. Our 4th Floor room offered no view other than an old wall of the next building 20 meters away but it was very sunny. We wasted no time in visiting the rooftop resturant and as the sun was beginning to set if offered up beautiful views of the Vatican routunda. After exploring the neighborhood a little and dining on some fantastic Italian food we decided to get some rest and sleep off our jet lag. The bed and linens were very clean and confortable. When we got up the next morning we discovered another fantastic aspect of the Artemide Hotel. When we upgraded our room to Superior the deal also included free breakfasts. In the states what they call a \"continental breakfast\" usually includes pastries, fruit, and coffee. The Artemide Hotel offered a very bountiful bufet breakfast that included everything one could wish for...eggs....bacon, wonderful breads, cheeses, meats, yogart, pancakes, Italian pastries, fruit..fresh juices, and coffee. What you didn't see you could ask for. Italians love their coffee and it was easy to see why, expresso, cappachino, and a pot of coffee all served with a nice small pitcher of steamed milk. It was always a wonderful start to our days in one of the world's most beautiful cities. The hotel is centrally located to most everything in Rome and is within walking distance to many of the main sites and good resturants and shopping, and just a short walk away from the central terminal.

We have been here for five days so far with five more days to go and I am very impressed with the level of service, cleanliness and food at this hotel. Nothing seems too much trouble for the staff. Every request we have made from wanting extra pillows, hangers and a problem with the WIFI has been dealt with within minutes of the request. I had emailed the hotel in advance of coming to ask for a walk on terrace for our superior room and a room away from the lift at the back of the hotel which does not have a view. Thank you to other tripadvisor reviewers for giving us this tip. On arrival we were warmly greeted and told that we had a room on the 6th floor with a walk on terrace and away from the lift - that is very good service. The room is a decent size and well furnished with a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival. The wall between us and the next door room is padded so I assume it is sound proofed. Is is very quiet in room 624. The furniture is in excellent condition. All the usual toiletries, slippers, bathrobes, tea and coffee (with biscuits and nuts on a tray) are in the room not to mention the free drinks in the fridge which are topped up daily. The bed is extremely comfortable (king size) with good pillows and the sheets are changed every other day. The bathroom is a good size with a full size bath with a shower and also a hand shower. The towels are changed daily. I must compliment Alina the room maid on her excellent cleaning of our room with lots of extra little touches. Please be aware that if you are in your room then the afternoon maid will not come in to tidy your room and leave sweets as they are forbidden to enter the room if you are in. Breakfast is excellent with a great buffet - please note that you can order omlette, fried or poached eggs at no extra cost if you prefer. I must commend Admir, Lara and Pasquale the head waiter for their attention to detail in the breakfast room. The food on the 7th floor terrace restaurant is excellent as is the italian coffee! The prices are very reasonable. Reception staff are amazing and have many suggestions for trips and can seem to arrange absolutely anything you want to do. I cannot single out one in particular as they are all so good. They organised tickets to La Traviata at the Salon Marguerita which was excellent. If you do not want to go to a full opera then the episcopalian church next door to the hotel holds opera aria evenings at various times. I would recommend this hotel. It is not the usual seaside luxury large chain hotel and does not have a pool. It is an excellent city centre hotel very close to all the attractions. Beware of buying drinks and food at restaurants close by to the main tourist sites - their prices are very high. Walk a little way down a side street and the price for a cold drink is half the amount.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c5 Days in September\u201d", "Author": "BobMerc", "ReviewID": "UR118559263", "Content": "I researched this hotel before our trip and was not disappointed.I booked well in advance and got what I considered a very good price.

Our first stop was the Hotel Artemide. This is a great place, and we heartily recommend it. It got off to a good start, because the upgraded us from the `classic` room to the `superior` room, which was spacious and comfortable ...surprising for a European hotel.The staff were friendly, efficient, and speak just about any language their clients speak. That was a bit disappointing. I was hoping to practice my Italian, but the entire staff seemed fluent in English. I got lost of chances to practice later in our trip. The all-you-can eat buffet breakfast, which was included in the price of the room, had HUGE variety, and was excellent. I defy anyone not to find something they like. Everything from bacon and scrambled eggs to fruit, yogurt, cheese, sliced meats, a variety of breads, sweets .... you name it. Oh, and great coffee. The hotel has a wonderful roof-top terrace/bar/restaurant where we usually ended our day. The service was exceptional, and they offered a variety of antipasto-style dishes as well as classic Roman main courses. Both were delicious. Good assortments of wine, beers, mixed drinks, and liquors as well. Speaking of which ... free mini bar in the room. Location wise, the hotel is close to many attractions without being so congested on the street you can`t move. If you like to walk ...which we all did in our party.... you can get to the Trevi fountain, Forum, Coliseum, etc. etc., in less than an hour (we could have made better time, but it was HOT while we were in Rome, so we were more inclined to stroll slowly). Good restaurants are all over the place near the hotel. They are also near the main train and bus stations as well as the metro. Two minor nits. The hotel elevator is VERY small. A maximum of four people, or two people with luggage. Also, the room we staid in had no view ...basically a wall. The last was no big deal. If we wanted a view we would go up to the terrace.

Breakfast is included, good selection of food for all tastes. Free minibar in the room, which gets restocked daily. We must have saved a good few euros by taking the water with us every day rather than buying it! Free Internet Complimentary drink on the rooftop bar, which was a nice way to start an evening before we went out for dinner. Very nice staff. The day we picked up our hire car (which was the biggest hassle ever), we drove back to the hotel to pick up the luggage. The hire car people, even though they were around the corner, didn't tell us it was a controlled zone and that if you don't register your vehicle you have to pay a fine! The hotel very kindly told us this and registered our car, so we wouldn't be fined! Reasonable location. Not near the Vatican, but plenty of buses and metros nearby. Very good for the colosseum, palatine, roman forum etc. Even the pantheon is only about 15mins walk. So not too far! A couple of negative points The rooms are on the small side. However you don't really come to Rome to stay in your hotel room. So this wasn't a big issue. We did find the walls paper thin. The first night our neighbours were so noisy that we had to call down to reception and ask them to sort it (something I've never done before).

We were upgraded to a superior room (not sure what that means) and it was roomy and clean. My only complaint was it smelled of cigarette smoke for the first few days. The room had a large bathroom (with bidet) and a king bed with a very, very firm mattress. The pillows were a bit on the thin side for my liking but there is an extra one in the closet. Like other guests, we received a voucher upon check-in for a free glass of prosecco on the roof-top terrace (which is very nice). We went back to the terrace at sunset a few nights for the great view. We did not eat there as it was very expensive and there is a ton of great food in the area. The breakfast is great. Lots of variety. Fresh, quality food. Coffee and / or espresso-based drinks are included in the price. The danger is to not eat too much! The toiletries, much heralded by other guests, are a nice touch. They look great and were replenished daily, as were our towels. Like many hotels you have to enter your key in a slot just inside the door to power the lights and the indicator outside your door that says if you are in your room or not. The good thing is this device does not control the air conditioning, so your room will be nice and cool when you get back from a long, hot day of walking. There are three elevators on the property. They are small and slow, but effective. The in-room TV was fine. A fairly new flat screen with good reception and sound. The staff is very friendly, helpful and all speak English - no complaints here. Our room was made promptly daily (sometimes before we returned from breakfast). For those arriving from the airport, the hotel has a private shuttle that is \u20ac45. This works out to be able \u20ac5 less than a taxi. You might want to arrange to take it if ou can. All-in-all a very good stay in a very accessible location. My complaints are small and I think you can do better or comparable for the price (our stay was \u20ac1,400). Next time I think we'll rent an apartment. NOTES: WI-FI: Ask for a code for each device you have that requires a connection. These are available at no extra charge and are necessary as the codes cannot be shared amongst devices. We had three devices and needed three unique codes. Wi-FI #2: The wi-fi is very good! We found that we could stream video and download movies from iTunes with no problem at all. You'll want to bring a tablet or a laptop (see tour note below) Iron: Bring you own. As with most hotels (I gather) in Rome, irons are not available at all. Anything you need ironed has to be sent to their ironing service and it's not cheap! Irons, however are. We bought a little travel one around the corner for \u20ac16 and it paid for itself many times over. Promoted Tours: The hotel will give you a pamphlet at check-in recommending a few tours. Be smart and do some research on any you might be interested in. We found that many of them have exceptionally low scores and you might want to avoid them (like we did).", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glen Ellyn, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "kristin-tom", "ReviewID": "UR118161639", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Hotel Artemide in May 2011, as Rome was the first destination for our honeymoon.

It was on a busy street with cafes and shopping. There is also a super market across the street that we bought snacks, wine and water (much cheaper than purchasing from street vendors) We decided to have a picnic in the park near Villa Medici, and the hotel lent us a wine bottle opener, napkins and such. We were able to walk to every site we wanted to see within the city from the hotel.

The first impression was very nice as the hotel is stylishly decorated and we got tickets for a welcome drink from the reception, very sweet. We chose to have coffee (a perfect one!) in the hotel bar next to the lobby. The location of the hotel is very good - Colosseo, Trevi fountain, Palazzo Barberini and Palazzo Venezia are all within walking distance. We took a taxi to Vatican, of course, but Rome is a huge city, you just can't have everything round the corner. We travelled with the kids so had 2 rooms, not connected, but on the same floor. Rooms are not very spacious, however when in Rome you don't spend much time in the hotel. We usually came back at about 5-6pm, had a little rest and then went for dinner outside. Breakfast here is pretty good, but I wouldn't say so about dinner. We had it there on the very first evening being exhausted after a long day, it was OK however slightly overpriced and basic, nothing to write home about. Since that we went to different place every night, most of them recommended by the hotel staff, and really enjoyed our meals there. One day we wanted to try the Roman specialty \"coda alla vaccinara\" which is a slowly braised oxtail, and the receptionist booked us into a tiny Italian eatery somewhere in Trastevere. The food there was truly yummy! The other day we had a problem with a taxi driver who was trying to deceive us. We had to pay 14 Euro for the ride when somehow he swapped 50 Euro we had given him with a 10 Euro note (perhaps he was a part time magician) and kept asking for more money. After 10 minute dispute I asked the hotel porter to sort the problem out, and he was very efficient, I must admit, the incident was solved within a second and we got our change back. But the worst happened when on the evening prior to our departure we got the news that the icelandic volcano had erupted. Our flight next day was cancelled, so we had to spend long hours on the hotel Internet trying to book train tickets for the way back, and we got the Internet access for free on the night, so we managed to book everything we needed. I am very grateful to the hotel staff, they did their best and came in handy every time we needed them. It's been more than a year since our visit however I keep thinking about the hotel.

For the dinner on our balcony, we thought we would have to wait for the staff to come through our room. Next thing we know we had a phone call saying that food would be brought out to our balcony shortly. When we went out to our balcony the candles were all lit and set up. Staff has a separate entrance to the balcony. The setting and atmosphere was great. Unfortunately the food was not that great. The restaurant redeemed itself at breakfast, as the breakfast selection is quite large. For some reason my husband and I thought we would try them again for dinner.

Our room is quite small (the tiniest bathroom I've ever seen) but very nice and that's probably why they gave us complimentary breakfast for our entire stay which is very nice.

Our room was a superior triple, it was clean and quite spacious, we had a free mini bar which was re-stocked everyday and the room was very quiet. The hotel included breakfast in the price which was a buffet style, with plenty of choice.They even had Earl Grey tea! We could easily walk to all the places of interest, except the Vatican. We caught a bus from the Via Nazionale. It took about 15 minutes. The buses get very crowded, you have to buy your ticket from a tobacconist first, then once the bus arrives get on at the back of the bus and validate your ticket. There is a yellow machine in which to do this. You can be fined if the ticket is not stamped. We had an early flight to Crete and had to leave at 4.00am. The hotel organised the pick-up to the airport, The car was waiting for us when we came to check out. The bill was ready and a surprise, 3 little carrier bags with a take-away breakfast for us all.

I wasn't blown away by it but after walking past some shabby looking 3* hotels I definitely wouldn't settle for less than 4* in Rome. My last two holidays were in America and I guess the standards there are quite high so I suggest no less than 4* if you like the same. We had the larger double room and I imagine this was a good decision as it wasn't overly big so the standard (small) double must be tiny. Free mini bar was stocked daily with cans of cola, bottles of water and fruit juices (couple of each), which is a nice touch. TV channels in English are only Sky News and BBC News and 5 euro movies (about 25-30 to choose from). Bathroom was always clean but on the last two days there was quite a bad smell when the toilet was flushed- not from us! I imagine there may have been a leak or something somewhere. It wan't so bad that we chose to report it but if it hadn't happened on nearly the last full day we would have. The staff were all friendly and helpful when approached but otherwise don't bother you or make conversation, rather they just say Hello- which is fine by me. WIFI access via the TV was free the first day then 5 euro an hour which was a little steep and also I don't think it allowed you on all sites.

We got nowhere trying to get info about when we'd get our bags back. The hotel staff were genuinely concerned, said this happened a lot and that the bags would be in the airport somewhere. They rang the airport and shouted at them on our behalf, demanded the bags were found and delivered pronto and as if by magic they were couriered to the hotel within hours. Phew! Breakfast was good, hot/cold buffet selection, fresh fruit and freshly made hot choc and cappaccino. The hot drinks are waiter service.

The hotel is near enough to the Termini station to be good for bus and train transport but far enough away from the station as to be safe. The street that the hotel is on is safe to walk on at all times of the day.The hotel is very well maintained with friendly and helpful staff at all levels. Our room was a moderate size, comfortable and spotlessly clean and the air conditioner worked quietly and efficiently - very important if you're visiting Rome in the summer! We had a room at the back of the hotel which didn't offer a view but which was quieter than facing the very busy Via Nazionale street. The bathroom was fully equipped with good quality towels and all sorts of toiletries and slippers etc. The TV had all the English news stations (CNN, BBC World, Sky + more). One very pleasant surprise was to find that everything in the refridgerator could be taken free of charge - fruit drinks, beer and bottles of mineral water - and it was all restocked the next morning. There was a kettle and a free selection of teas,coffees, biscuits, crackers and nuts. A buffet breakfast was included in the price and offered a good selection of hot cooked food, cheeses, meats, cereals and fruit etc. The position of the hotel made it possible to travel to anywhere in Rome so we purchased a 3 day pass for 11 Euro each which gave us unlimited travel on all public transport. If you purchase a ticket don't forget to vaidate it on your first journey as, apparently, they don't accept ignorance as an excuse!! If you ask at reception they give you a code and you can have 15 minutes free time on the computer in the foyer - enough to check on emails etc. The day before we left I wanted to print out our boarding cards and they opened the business centre up for me - again free of charge. If you want to use your laptop in the room then you can, apparently, pay a fee and receive that service. The hotel has a rooftop restaurant which is very attractive and which serves very good food. It's a few Euro more than you could possibly find in the city but after spending a full day sightseeing we appreciated not having to go out searching around. On the day we left we ordered a cab though the hotel which cost 45 Euro (inclusive of luggage) and was downstairs waiting for us at 6am. As we were missing breakfast we were presented with 2 full bags of crackers, jams, fruit, biscuits and mineral water to take with us. This is a hotel I wouldn't hesitate to recommend or return to ourselves. Not the cheapest but the service and standard was worth paying out for. TIP ONE: If you are a UK senior citizen (or any EU country) and over 65 years, take a photocopy of your passport with you when visiting the main sites in Rome. It's not shown on any of their entry price boards, but when you get to the ticket office show them your passport copy which shows your age and you will get a free entrance ticket. TIP TWO: Almost opposite the hotel is 'Doveralu', a restaurant that serves good food at a reasonable price. However, it was their icecreams that we found addictive and which became a daily dessert!!!! TIP THREE: ALWAYS check your restaurant bill as on 2 occasions we were charged for food we hadn't had or for two items when we'd only had one.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ipswich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Fifty Birthday Trip!\u201d", "Author": "Tracy190725", "ReviewID": "UR115538663", "Content": "We have just got back from a trip to Rome for my sister's 50th Birthday and we couldn't have stayed in a nicer hotel.

We are traveling in Italy with 6 adults, ages 20-nearly 80 (the trip is for Grandma's 80th birthday!) and what a great way to start it off! Check out my pictures for an example of the beautiful rooms, one of which was upgraded to include a small patio. Air conditioning was a must, as June in Rome is hot and muggy! The beds comfortable, the room exceptionally clean, free basics in the fridge, safe in the room, satellite television for when it was just to hot to go out, and a lovely, full-out breakfast the downstairs (which was the best money spent I think as it got us off to a great start and allowed us to put off eating until later in the day). The people working there go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and well taken care of. Cabs arrive within minutes of being called, which was nice as Grandma's knee tends to limit her long-distance walking. When one of our party injured her foot, the men working at the front desk kept us supplied with ice packs filled with ice. I could go on and on, but really, this is a superb hotel. I've stayed in places across Europe and the Americas from hostels to 5-star resorts and everything in between, and the Artemide Hotel has it all, plus it's in a great location. 10 minute walk to the Colosseo and ancient Rome, even less to the main train terminal, and much else is within a short hike.

All food served by the hotel was well presented and of a very high standard.

We informed the receptionist before going out for a walk, and came back to find everything in order. - The bathroom was very nice - spacious and with the combined shower/bathtub you're hoping for when you see the pictures on their website. The ok - Service was good, can't complain, can't say we were amazed either. One of the bell boys and one of the receptionists (young guy who tipped us on local markets) stood out a bit from the rest. - Beds were ok, from reviews of other hotels they seem to have been the usual Italian kind. - Breakfast, which has been raved about in other reviews, was unfortunately also just ok. The selection was adequate, the quality was ok, but it didn't live up to our expectations as it seemed to be a high point of this hotel judging from other reviews. - The location isn't bad, but not ideal if you wish to mainly be walking between the different sights. About 10 minutes from Termini, 10-15 minutes from the Fontana di Trevi, 15-20 minutes from most other sights like Piazza Navona, Piazza di Spagna etc. The not so good - The TV in the room (yes, it's a minor detail) suffered from an incredibly long latency.

Firstly, the hotel is on a busy road which made me worry that the rooms would be noisy... I had no need to fear. The rooms were beautifully quiet and I had no problems sleeping (I can be a light sleeper). Secondly, at check in we were told that the card we'd secured the booking with had expired (we booked months and months in advance and hadn't realised) and that they would have resold our room if we hadn't turned up within the next two hours - not the best welcome - and this is despite us emailing the week beforehand to confirm our reservation and receiving a response from them that all was fine and they were expecting us. Apart from these two early worries, the hotel was wonderful. The room was spotlessly clean, the bed was very comfortable, the toiletries were of a fantastic standard and plentiful (the hair conditioner was particularly good) and the free mini bar that was replenished every day was a great bonus - there was beer, coke, fanta, water, salteens, biscuits, peanuts, wafers, tea and coffee. There was even a bottle of wine to welcome us. They did a turn down service two of the three nights, with chocolates on one night and mini Easter eggs the next with a 'Happy Easter' card from the manager. A lovely touch. We also had the free welcome-glass of prosecco at the bar. Very nice too. However, the very best thing about this hotel is the breakfast... It has to be seen to be believed. The selection is astounding. At least five cakes, pastries, cheese, hams, salamis, eggs, bacon, sausages, mushrooms, tomatoes, breads, jams, mozzarella, yoghurt, fresh fruit galore and you simply must not miss the freshly squeezed orange juice. Oh my. That was good. They bring you a cappuccino to your table and ask if you'd like another when you've finished. The staff are so polite and incredibly efficient, the food is replenished regularly and it is all orchestrated by the wonderful breakfast manager. He was our favourite member of staff - the best at the hotel. He was very welcoming, had a great sense of humour and somehow managed to keep the busy breakfast time ticking over brilliantly whilst still having time for a smile and a joke with us.

Staff at breakfast were much warmer, efficient and brilliant selection at breakfast. We had dinner in the hotel two times during our stay. First time, the food and service was great, the second time however it was like we were in a different hotel. The food was not great and we waited 50 mins for out dinner with no acknowledgement that this was a long wait, despite the fact that there was only about 3 other tables. This was our last night in Rome and it was hard not to be sad that we didn't have a nice last dinner experience. The room are large, but be warned that they are very warm at night. Nice touches with chocolates and mini bar.

The Hotel: Very clean and well presented with an art deco theme throughout.

The breakfast was varied and catered for most tastes. Drinks in the hotel range from 6 euros for a beer to 10 euros for a cocktail, upon arrival every guest was given a coupon for a free cappuccino or glass of champagne free at the bar. A very good map is provided by concierge of all the sites and they have a buzzer to hail a taxi whenever you need it. The Location: It is walking distance to all the major attractions however I would suggest either best walking shoes on or cab a little way. A cab to the vatican or spanish steps or colosseum is 8-10 euros. There was a problem with the TV and after reporting the problem to the repair man fixing it and leaving elapsed all of about 7 minutes so really good customer service.

Hotel Artemide exceeded our high expectations (based on all the positive reviews on this site) and provided a very comfortable, friendly, central base for our sightseeing. The hotel itself is just the right size -- big enough to provide all the services you might need and small enough to be friendly and personal. The staff is superb -- everyone we met was helpful, efficient, and friendly no matter what the request or need. In particular, our son woke up the first morning with a case of allergic conjunctivitis in his eye. With just a few days in Rome, we did not relish the idea of spending half a day in an emergency room to get medicine. The front desk staff helped us arrange a private doctor (via the Roma Pass -- get it, it's worth it!) to come to the hotel. But in the end, we didn't even need the doctor because the hotel recommended we check with the pharmacist across the street (who speaks English) -- so we did just that, got the medicine (which is usually only available by prescription in the US), cancelled the doctor appointment, and were able to enjoy most of the day as planned. The front desk also helped with dinner reservations, airport transportation, etc. and were also extremely prompt in their email correspondence leading up to our visit. We had two rooms for five of us (a standard double and a triple), which was perfect. We all appreciated the free mini-bar (especially the excellent chocolate cookie wafers), free WiFi, and free newspapers. The hotel also gave us a lovely bottle of wine and a nice note for my husband's birthday. Very clean, elegant rooms -- not very large by US standards, but large by European standards. The location was perfect for exploring most of the ancient Rome sights -- we walked almost everywhere except the Vatican. With three kids, it was essential that we have a place to rest in the middle of the day if we needed to. Via Nacionale is a very busy, central street, but our rooms were very quiet (it faced away from the street). We ate at a few neighborhood restaurants, and all were very good. The breakfast buffet was a huge hit with all of us -- there was something for everyone (a big plus for people with children), and ensured that we had a lot of energy for all the sightseeing we were doing. In fact, after eating a breakfast, we wouldn't really have to eat lunch. The freshly squeezed blood orange juice was amazing -- even the kids loved it! All in all, Hotel Artemide provided a great value and really helped make our first visit to Rome very memorable and enjoyable.

We could also have free drinks from the mini bar. The hotel is near to the main train station - Termini. One tip we realised is that if you get the Leonardo Express from the airport, don't leave the train station at the first exit you come to, onto Via Giotti - this means you have a long walk around the outside of the station, over very busy roads whereas if you go through the station itself to the main entrance/exit you safe that dangerous walk.

Due to our overnight flight, we arrived several hours before check-in time. Alessandro at reception told us that our rooms would be ready in about an hour and sent us to the \"restaurant\" for complimentary breakfast. As noted by other reviewers, the complimentary breakfast was a delicious feast of pastries, fruit, juices, coffees and teas, eggs & bacon, cheese/meats, etc. After breakfast, we were escorted to our rooms by the porters who explained the particulars of the rooms. The hotel is, indeed, quite central and a ten minute walk from the main tourist attractions - except for the Vatican. Around the hotel are neighborhoods with excellent family-owned restaurants. Right up the street is the train station and Piazza della Republicca. Right down the street is Trajan's Markets. Rooms were serviced in the morning and tidied in the afternoon. Beds were turned down and a little piece of chocolate placed on the night table each afternoon. Requests were addressed quickly and competently. Each of our mini-bars was restocked daily and it was nice to have beveraages and snacks available after a long day of sightseeing. The staff was friendly and courteous at all times. Alessandro, Matteo and Pino were all gracious and efficient hosts. Overall, Hotel Artemide is a great place from which to base your Roman adventure.

It's a mere 15 minute walk to the Coliseum / Ancient Ruins, Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps and right around the corner from the Opera Theater to name a few. If you rent a car, park in the garage behind the hotel. Unfortunately, it's 17 Euros/night to park, but it shouldn't be a surprise to pay a premium for parking in a major city (Europe or US for that matter). During our one night stay, we found an excellent restaurant across from the Opera Therater called La Matriciana. If you're looking for non-tourist cuisine, you will really enjoy this restaurant. The nice perk about the hotel was the complimentary drinks in the mini bar and small assortment of cookies/crackers next to the coffee maker. When you arrive, you also receive a coupon for a free glass of Prosecco or coffee. Having said that, breakfast is not included (and is 12 or 14 Euros, I can't recall specifically, but it's a little steep). This hotel seems to cater to a lot of business travelers as there is an area for meetings. Unfortunately, I can't comment more on that since I didn't use any of those services and merely noted upon passing. Our room was second to least expensive, so it may feel on the smaller side for those who are not used to European sized rooms (it was essentially a standard European room). The room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The bathroom felt in size to be on par with an American sized hotel. We didn't take advantage of the breakfast or the restaurant, so I can't comment on that. The only negative comment was that our room smelled of cigarette smoke. I tried to briefly air out the room by opening the windows, but the weather was rainy on/off, so I didn't want to leave the windows open while we were out sightseeing. Nevertheless, Europeans smoke and the smell wasn't too bad after a few minutes. I probably could have asked the front desk to see if there was a non-smoking room, but I didn't, so I suppose I am to blame. We stayed during low season and enjoyed a very nice discount on our room (We paid 209 Euros for a room that can cost upwards to 450 Euros during high season). As much as I did truly enjoy staying at the hotel, this hotel is definitely worth staying at the price we paid. Having said that, my review would probably be less favorable if I spent 450 Euros/night (I think I would draw the line at 280 Euros for the next to smallest room).

Since traveling in mid-march must be considered as low season tourist wise, we book a superior room at the Artemide Hotel. I'm filled with superlatives about the quality, the service and the location of this hotel. Since this hotel is so close to the Termini station, you save a lot of taxi money, by just walking. Not far at all. The complimentary mini bar was also positive. It's not too much in the refridgerator, but enough to satisfy your needs. 2 beer, 2 pack of limonade, 1 coca cola + 1 fanta, water bottles. The breakfast at the hotel was superb. The red orange juice became fast a favourite for us along with the cappucino. The food selection was good. Bread, fruits, ham, salami, cheese, eggs, bacon etc. The reception clerk was helpful with pointing out the direction the fastest walk to desired sight. The free Wi-Fi connection was also great. My overall opinion about this hotel would be: Fantastic Walking to the hotel (10-15 min) from the Termini Station. From Termini, follow the platform (5 min walk) to the main entrance/exit, otherwise you would have to pull your luggage up some narrow streets up hill. Next door irish pub/ Flann O'Brien You can watch champions league soccer (Sky sport) matches on many of the big screens. Best bus \"Hop on and Hop off\" by my opnion. Due to all the critism of the \"Hop on and off\" bus companies on tripadvisor, we checked out one of the companies with positive feedback. The yellow busses offered by Roma Cristiana was for us as perfect as it gets. They were on time, not major waiting at stops. The only problems which may arise is bad signal to the headphones. But you will probably find this problem on any bus in any town. The best thing was that this was a cheap way to travel around the city. We paid only Eur17 for 2 days. I'm not sure if this is the normal, but this was how it was for us.

The hotel also made a special cake (see photograph) to celebrate the 150th anniversary for the unification of Italy which was a nice touch. We had a lunchtime snack from the bar menu and the food was mediocre & the bar man was very miserable. Perhaps he was having a bad day. Did not eat in the hotel during the evening but I noticed the restaurant opened at 7.30pm. We ate in an excellent restaurant called Strega (turn left out of the hotel, first road on your left). The hotel is located in a very good location close to the main attractions such as the Colosseum, Trevi fountain & Spanish Steps. The Vatican is further away but there is a metro if required.

You are close to the Barberini Palace, Quirinale, Trevi Fountain and various other sites. The Via Nazionale consists of many stores and several good restaurants (bordering nearby side streets - near the Opera). We opted out of the breakfast at the hotel and headed each morning to Castroni, a charming shop/cafe, down the street for our morning cafe and pastries.

(At this point I didn't realise that check-out was noon!). Anyway we were provided safe-haven to leave our bags, whilst making use of the complimentary vouchers in the bar to have a coffee or wine. I believe our request for a hot chocolate for my son, to go with the 2 coffess wasn't strictly in the deal (as the book price was a bit more expensive) but the bar-tender quite happily gave us one. The pastries offered with these drinks were a nice surprise, but I was fully expecting to get a bill for those! No they were part of the deal too. In fact because we had arrived early, reception gace us 2 lots of free vouchers (so we used the second set whilst awaiting the taxi to pick us up). We got to the room and it was, for us, perfect. Large, and very very comfortable king size bed, and a larger than double size sofa-bed for my 13yr old son. But please don't think of an ordinary sofa-bed. It was huge, substantial, solidly built and as per my son - more comfortable than the new bed we'd just bought him. Everything was clean and crisp and to be honest I was thinking at this stage that the reservation I had made, and total price MUST have been either for each of us or only one night, instead of 3 people for 2 nights. Especially when the nice touches like a FREE selection of drinks in the mini-fridge (beer, water, coke,fanta,orange juice,nuts etc) and slippers, bath robes, a huge selction of bath creams, gels, shampoos, conditioners, sponges and stuff all manner of assortment of tea & coffee options were there in abundance and re-stocked.

Well apart from the fact we went in early to beat the rush (based on experience of other hotels) the hospitality of the staff was exemplary, and the options of food was huge. I can recount freshly squeezed orange, apple, grapefruit, pinepple, boild & scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cold turkey, chicken, a selction of salamis, cheese, an assortment of bread rolls, bread slices, sweet breads, fruit breads, croissants, fruits and at least 5 different cereals. No limit to the amount you could have - the only restriction was the amount you could fit in.

Thanks, everyone. This hotel is an absolute gem! If you can find a nicer hotel for the money in Rome, I'd be very surprised. The location is fantastic -- super easy walking distance to just about anything. There is even a nice little grocery store right down the block. I never took a cab the entire time I was in town. I arrived early in the morning, around 6:30 a.m. Obviously, I was not expecting to check in at this hour, but the desk staff was extremely helpful -- allowed me to store my bags, offered me a bottle of water and a free city map that was great. I was told to come back at 11:00, long before the normal check in time. I got back at that time and my room was clean and ready. The bellhop was extremely helpful and showed me all of the bells and whistles. He clearly did not expect a tip for this, either, although I made sure to give him a nice one. He was great. I booked a double room (for one person). It was very large (by European standards), with a king-sized bed, excellent furnishings, a free mini bar stocked daily, and an outstanding bath with every possible amenity you could ever want -- robes, slippers, you name it. The room was very modern -- this is not an old-style hotel, but an up-to-date model. The bed was very comfortable and had really nice pillows, sheets, and a duvet. Definitely not the standard gross hotel fare. My room was facing the street, but I slept like a baby -- it was very quiet. For business travelers, they have free Internet service in the rooms, and a nicely stocked business center. Use of the business center -- which has everything from computers with microphone headsets to a printer -- costs 12 Euros per day. The front desk staff was kind enough to let me print my boarding pass for free. No hassles whatsoever. That's what you call service. The also have a gym and a spa, but I didn't have time to check it out. If it's like the rest of the hotel, it's top notch on all fronts. It's been mentioned here many times, but I'll mention it again -- the breakfast has to be one of the finest meals in all of Rome. Wow! I couldn't believe you got all of this for free. I've done a lot of traveling, and this has to be the best free hotel food of all time. Eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh squeezed juices of all varieties, fresh fruit, cereals, every time of bread, plus all of the usual pastries, croissants, muffins, and other goodies. That barely describes the extent of it. You will not possibly go away hungry, although you may have to tear yourself away from this massive feast. Yeah, it's downstairs from the lobby. Big deal. The breakfast service staff was amazing, and you just will not believe the quality of the food! What a pleasant surprise. The entire experience was amazing -- I felt like a Roman king!

The Artemide Hotel was a good choice as the location is really convenient - easy to find, in a great neighborhood, and centrally located to many attractions and also the metro and buses. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the free buffet breakfast was good with plenty of choices (although a bit of a tilt towards UK tastes in the hot choices). The room itself was somewhat small, although well appointed. At check-in, the room was made up as a double bed, which needed to be adjusted to two singles by the staff - which took a while and was annoying because the reservation request was so clear about that. Also, the free minibar, while certainly a nice touch, wasn't refilled on a daily basis, leaving me to wonder if that was really an oversight or not. Overall though, these minor flaws were just that, and both Rome and the Artemide deserve another visit. Also, we used the Roma Card for transportation and museum entries and felt it was a good bargain. Try to get a good metro and bus map if you can - it is easy to get around once you get the swing of things, but we were never able to find an easy-to-read bus route map, which would help since the hotel is on a street with several major bus lines on it.

Service - Booking via the website was very easy. They emailed confirmation, and then again a few days before. They were very helpful, and gave directions to get there. They offered a taxi service too. Location - The location is perfect, its walking distance from the metro, just 5 mins up the street. Getting from airport. Its 45 mins in a taxi from Campinon airport. Taxi (booked by the hotel beforehand) was 60 euros, and they will stay there til you arrive. Expensive, but the easy option. Its only 40 euros from the hotel to the airport as there's no waiting involved. If time isn't important you can get the bus 8 euros one way, run every 45 mins, or you can get the train into Termini station for 18 euros return. So the taxi is expensive, but it meant we didn't waste any time! Check-in - Quick, we were early(11.30am), and had to wait 15mins for our room, but they give everyone a complimentary glass of sparkling wine etc so it was not a problem. The staff are exceptionally friendly, all of them were superb, so helpful. Room was lovely, very warm, clean, we were shown to our room and everything was explained to us. Room contained a safe, which was free to use. Lots of toiletries, free slippers too. Mini bar is completely free to use, and refreshed daily, inc beer, water, nibbles etc, very nice touch. Sauna (big enough for 4) and gym (treadmill, cross trainer, bike and one other i cant remember) were small but perfectly formed, lots of clean towels, a nice clean shower in a private room so you can get clean afterwards. Breakfast - Fantastic, so much choice, self service, hot bacon, eggs, fresh fruit, cakes, you will be spoilt for choice. Dinner - The menu looked nice, but I didn't try it so cant really comment. - I went to Est Est Est Ricci on Genova street, turn left out of the hotel and its the 2nd or 3rd street on the left, fantastic place. I think there was internet access, i could see a room with 6 PCs in it, but i didn't use it.

There were shutters, insect screen, double glazing, blind and heavy curtains to each window! Enough to provide even the lightest sleeper with total peace.

All the food was really well displayed and looked very appetising - everything we had was of the very best quality and kept at the correct temperature.

We had a triple superior room which even with the extra single bed in, was still spacious. Our room was at the front of the hotel, and as other people have said, the road can keep you awake. The hotel is in a great location with most of the sights within walking distance. The only trip we made on the Metro was to the Vatican City. The staff were very helpful recommending restaurants and sorting out a car to take us to the airport. The breakfasts were very good, everything from eggs and bacon to fresh fruit and yogurt and the restaurant staff very efficient. We really can't say a bad word and look forward to visiting again! Visiting Tips (hope they are useful!) Roman Forum/Palantine Hills/Colosseum:- When you are visiting these buy a ticket that covers all three (we bought ours at the Roman Forum entrace) you can then walk straight in the Colosseum without standing in line for hours. Also if you have under 18's with you, take their passport with you as they get in free! The toliets at the Roman Forum are shocking, there is not even anywhere to wash your hands afterwards, so make sure you go before visiting. Metro:- We took the metro to the Vatican and was amazed at how easy it was. The trains are clean and spacious, much nicer than the London Underground! You can buy a 1 Euro ticket that is valid for 75 mins and allows you to hop on the Metro as many time as you like in that time. For 4 Euros you can buy a 24 hour ticket. There are also weekly and monthly passes available. Car to Airport:- We took the train into Rome from the airport. Whilst it was no real hassle we regreted not getting the hotel to send a car. They kindly arranged this for our return to the airport at a cost of 45 Euros. This was great value when you consider that we paid 42 Euros for the train and then had to walk from the Termini to the hotel. Airport:- We flew Heathrow to FCO. We had no problems coming in, but cannot say the same about flying out. We reommend you leave plenty of time for going through security. The organisation was terrible and it took us over an hour and a half to get through. I can only liken the experience to being like a rugby scrum. People were pushing, Italians were screaming at each other and tempers definately got out of hand. My husband, daughter and I got split up due to all the pushing and shoving and people from the back kept trying to queue jump. In the end my husband, who managed to get through way before my daughter and I, called a police officer to come and help us as our daughter was so distressed she started crying. By the time all three of us were through, we were soaked in sweat, physically shaking and pretty distressed by the whole ordeal.

When we arrived at our room (401) it was a very pleasant surprise with a big spacious bedroom (basically a studio size) and a large well appointed bathroom. The bed was one of the most comfotable we experienced during our European vacation.

The room had all the little things that you may not see everywhere (eg, do not disturb switch next to the bed). Service was efficent and hasslefree (although hotel policy of not being able to supply an iron was a little unusual) and when TV was not working there was someone up in a matter of seconds to rejig the connections and cables. The inclusion of free mini bar and breakfast lessened the price aspect and ultimately this was not an issue. Location was a little \"out of the way\" in terms of mainstream attractions but certainly not too far and meant an extra 5-10 min walk was required.

He agreed to do so, and although I could not understand what he was saying, it was obvious he was angry.

The location was great- central to all the attractions we wanted to see. The breakfast was a very nice \"American style\" breakfast. They even gave us a coupon for a couple of drinks up on the roof bar. Lastly, we enjoyed the free snacks and drinks in the mini bar. We would highly recommend the Artemide for your visit to Rome! So if you want a stuffy, elite, overpriced hotel with a rude doorman, look at \"those other ones.\" If you want a friendly, welcoming, warm and comfortable place in which to enjoy Rome, the Artemide is you place!", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norman, OKI", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, location, and staff!\u201d", "Author": "bconwayOU", "ReviewID": "UR76020159", "Content": "While I realize there are some negative reviews of the Artemide we booked it for 3 nights in August based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Trip Advisor.

The rooftop bar was open during our stay and it was a great place to hang out and drink wine after a busy day roaming around. The location is perfect as it is about a 15 minute walk from the train station and 5 minutes to the nearest hop-on hop-off (Ciao Roma) office/stop. It is also a short walk to the Repubblica metro stop from which you can get to many other locations around Rome. There are many great places to eat and drink around the hotel on Via Nazionale. The front desk staff were very knowledable and helpful and went out of their way to help with any questions I had. Breakfast was great- not sure why there are all the complaints of the \"unsafe spiral staircase\" as it was really no big deal. Wireless worked well in the rooms.

The bathroom was wide and very well decorated, and the 33\u00ba C of Rome weren't a trouble, for the air conditioning made the room a small paradise (I had many bad experiences regarding temperature control in big hotels).

This hotel was great, and I thought a very good value. First off the location, I thought it was a great location that can get you whereever you want to go. It's realistically probably a 10 - 15 min walk to Central Termini if you're hauling around luggage. It's definitly doable however the taxi rate from the airport is a fixed fee of 40 Euro. You can look it up on the internet and you'll find info about it. We took the train in and it was a pain hauling the bags around and then getting out of the station and trying to find the hotel. The train was around 12 euro per person if I remember correctly. We ended up taking a cab back to the airport, well worth it. Anyway, once you're settled in, from the hotels location it's very easy to get around, the subway entrance is just a few min walk up the street and it's very inexpensive. One way trips are 1 euro per person and they have stops pretty much at most major sites. The front desk can tell you where to get on and off, it's really easy. We took the regular bus 1 time, it also has stops right on the street by the hotel. The Open Bus tours are just up the street, I recommend it if you're a first time visitor, it gives you a good oversight of the city and sites. The hotel is also pretty close to some major sites if you want to walk to them, it's nice to do because you'll walk by a bunch of shops and stuff along the way. I read someone else's posts about restaurants in the area where they said they couldn't find any that were that good. Not true, what you want to do is walk down \"Nationale\" (which is the street the hotel is on) towards the Coleseum, and then on the side streets on the left, you will find a bunch of great restaurants. Also here's a tip for gauging prices on food, look at the price of a margharita pizza, if it's over 7 euro, that restaurant is probably on the high side. You should realistically pay 4-6 euro for a margharita, it's one of the easiest things for an Italian restaurant to make. The hotel itself I thought was fantastic. Free minibar, there's not a great amount of stuff in there but it's still nice for some water, pop, and a couple beers. The breakfast for an was great in my opinion. They have eggs, bacon, pancakes, fruits, cold cuts... now don't get me wrong, it's not like an American breakfast spread but it's still good and it's included in your rate. Our room was a triple, decent size and comfortable beds and the bathroom was fair size also. They have slippers and bathrobes in the room. They have free wifi, if you have an Ipod touch or Iphone, and you can also get on the computer downstairs free for 15 min if you want to check email at home or whatever.

Fridge stocked daily but items were tepid at best. We really only drank the water as the juice was always \"pear\". Breakfast was adequite - mostly continental fare, lots of fruit (though mostly canned) and a small roaster of scrambled eggs and bacon (which never seemed fully cooked) and lost of coffee to pick from. Bar staff were very professional but not engaging -very hard to chat to staff at this hotel. They all greeted everyone but not much on the conversation side. I enjoy talking to locals when I travel so this was disappointing. The location is along a shopping street and there was not many restaurants to pick from in the evening. Unless you wanted to hoof to the Trevi or Barberini area, it was limited. We did eat at the Irish Pub that is about 20 meters away. Not bad, but not great. We only had fresh pasta once while in Rome -very strange-we expected it all to be fresh and not boxed.

Rome can only be seen and understood on foot, the Hotel Artemide is in a prime position toward one end of the via Nazionale, and ideally situated to walk in any direction to discover the numerous treasures of Rome. Time flies by when taking in the splendour of Rome and Roman, life so it is with much relief to return to the hotel and totally relax in the bar, lounge or the quiet ambience of our room. If, like us, there is a very special occasion then somehow the hotel Artimede seems to have a natural ability to provide some of the most memorable and unexpected experiences to make that occasion so special.

I emailed the staff to ask if they could do something special for my parents on their anniversary as a surprise. I could not believe just how friendly and helpful the staff were! They went out of their way to make their day special with flowers, wine, fruit and a card delivered to their room and a special meal in the evening in their lovely restaurant. They emailed me daily to update me with how their 'secret' plans were going and seemed genuinely as excitied as I was about the surprise. I have never had such a positive response and was very impressed with their enthusiasm to make my surprise possible. My parents were overwhelmed with the hotel's generosity and how much effort they went to to make it a truely memorable experience. I really could not thank the staff enough. I would highly highly recommend this wonderful hotel which is not only friendly and welcoming but has excellent facilities and is centrally placed for all of Rome's top attractions. I honestly cannot fault it. Both my parents and I hope to visit Rome again in the future and would not contemplate staying anywhere else!!

Whilst the facilities at the hotel were OK they were not what I was lead to expect. For the benefit of the reader of this review I know through my experiences of travelling the levels of quality of surroundings & service to expect with the whole range of hotels from B&B's to 5 star. The hotel itself for a 4* was not unpleasant but was just average if that. It did not wow me by any stretch of the imagination. It was clean and tidy and the location was OK on a main road through the town. It was about a 30 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps and the same to the Colosseum. Maybe a list of likes and dislike might help. 1. Breakfast served on small plates with bread cut into 4 slices as one slice would have been larger than the plate. It was all done on a miniture scale and was just OK. Scrabbled egg & quite fatty bacon. fruit selection, cereals and pasteries. Tea, coffee etc just the normal kind of thing. 2. Put a suit, shirt & 2 dresses in to be pressed after getting creased in the suitcase. The 24 hrs service turned out to be an almost 30hr service and I had to go to recepotion twice to remind them I had my dinner table booked for that night. 3. Shower was not powerful enough and getting the right temperature was a bit of a struggle at times. 4. The hotel gave us a complimentary drink in the bar which was nice - Thank you! 5. The roof top terrace was not formally open although you could go and sit up there under the stars. It does not open for drinks until late June. 6. The bed was hard where as my bed at home is more cosy. This might be great for some but not me or my wife. 7. The view from the window? Sorry no view except into the office building opposite. Maybe my fault and I should have upgraded as not all rooms can have a good view. 8. The hotel did have a bag holding area after we checked out and they did provide a special safe deposit box for my wifes Jewery - Thank you! Be careful of the taxi's in Rome that they put there meter on as we go ripped off by one who did not. It was only a 15 euro fare but it should have cost 5 euros. If you are looking for a very special meal we had dinner at the Eden Hotel. The views were spectacular on a hill top across Rome. Its quite pricey at 165 euros each with wine for a set meal or you can go alcarte. we ahd a drink after we settled the bill and My Gin & tonic & my wife Voka and orange was 38 euros. The service however was fantastic and the food was very good. I would go there again but would have to start saving now. Another good place which was recommended to us (by an Italian Friend) was Alredo Scrofa on Via Scrofa which is down by the Pizza Navarone. The menu out side looked good but we opted to dine in the sun that night and did not want to be inside. There is probably lots of other things which I am not putting down on this review as I am running out of time. One last thing is that there are loads and loads of hotels in Rome. Almost every street has hotels so have a good shop around. And remember no matter how nice the reception looks you will not be sleeping there so make your decissions wisely.

Another plus was the free wifi in the room which meant that we could hop online with our iPhones just before heading out and research locations of restaurants or whatever. We chose to book our Vatican museum tickets online and the staff at the reception desk were very helpful in printing out the voucher for us free of charge. Another freebie is the Internet room which offers 15 mins casual surfing. There are several computers so never a need to wait. Our room was maintained every day by a sweet charlady.

We stayed at a B&B in Venice, an apartment in Florence, then finally at the Hotel Artimede in Rome before coming home. My husband wanted us to be pampered in style on this last leg of our trip, so we chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. We were very happy with our choice! We had one of the four junior suites in the hotel. Our room overlooked the Via Nazionale and had a terrace where we could pull chairs outside and watch the people and nightlife below. The traffic was a little noisy, and the police sirens were distracting at all hours of the day or night, but overall the sound was minimal. The location far made up for this. The staff were wonderful in every way. They provided umbrellas our first day when ours were still locked up in our luggage. We bought a bottle of wine to take back to our room and the bartender in the lounge let us borrow a bottle opener to use. Any request was met with courtesy and a smile. We felt very pampered with the tons of free bath amenities - lotions, tissues, bubble bath, etc. - even bath slippers! We had a wonderful whirlpool bath that felt great after a long day of walking. The safe in the room worked like a charm. I used the tea kettle to make a warm cup of chamomile before bed each night, while my hubby enjoyed a beer from the complimentary items in the fridge. The breakfast was the best we had anywhere. There were hot scrambled eggs and sausages, with tons of fruit, pastries, yogurt, cereal and juices. Hot tea and cappucinos were provided endlessly with attentive service. On our last morning there we had to leave very early - before breakfast service - and we were met at check-out with two large bags of food to eat on the way to the airport (yogurt, apple, juice, cheese, crackers, water bottle). The only complaint I could give is that our bed was very hard compared with what we are used to at home, but that was the case EVERYWHERE we stayed in Italy, so it's no fault of the hotel. It's just a cultural thing I guess. We would highly recommend the Hotel Artimede to anyone.

From the first day to the last day our experience was excellent. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet was very good with a good selection of fruits, juices, cold cut meats, pastries, eggs, and bacon. We were able to eat enough there to hold us over until the evening especially with the free snacks in the room. The room itself was very clean and comfortable. Since we were in the back of the motel we didn't have much of a view from our window but it was made up for by the fact that it was very quite. Also as I mentioned above there were free snacks and drinks in the room that were refilled every day. This helped us a lot since we didn't have to go looking for a place to get water we had 2 free bottles given to us every day. The hotel is centrally located in the city and is about 20 or 30 minute walk from most major sites except the Vatican (though you can still walk to it in about 45 or 50 minutes if you don't take all the little back streets like we did :)). It also has a metro stop about 5 minutes away and the Termini Station is 10 minutes away so your option for getting around the city are about as good as you can get. Finally to get back to airport we took advantage of their shuttle service. It was ready and waiting for us at 6:30am even though it was only supposed to be there at 6:45am. The driver was very friendly and spoke good English. Even though it cost a bit more then a taxi I found it to be worth it for us.

Both my partner and I were escorted to our room and shown the facilities upon arrival. They do not lurk around for a tip but are thankful if you do. The rooms are on the smallish side, (based on Aussie standards), but are reasonable by European standards. Like most old building establishments, the lifts are slow and small but at least there are two of them. The stairs are fairly wide and accessible so not a bad option if you want to burn some of that Roman food. The bed is comfortable and you have all the mod cons well placed and in ample supply. The bathroom is relatively large and the shower works really well (fast hot water). Good soap and shampoo and ample soft new towels. There are large windows that can be open with a shutter. Did struggle with the aircon and to this day do not know if I switched it on or not? High points are the LCD TV, good quality free wireless internet (even on the 5th floor) and free mini bar drinks which are replenished daily. The breakfast is real treat in terms of quality, variety, ambiance and again staff friendliness. The staff are very child friendly and able to communicate in a number of languages. I would highly recommend Artemide as a good quality well rounded destination that gets most things right.

Firstly, location: The hotel itself is a short 5-10 minutes walk from Termini Station (dependent on amount of luggage you have with you!) in a safe, if relatively un-eventful area - Via Nazionale is a busy shopping street with a metro station 60 seconds walk away in Piazza della Republica. Pretty much everything worth seeing on the east side of the Tiber is within walking distance from the hotel - the only time we used the metro was to get to the Vatican, although this probably would still only have been a 45 minute walk away. The staff at Hotel Artemide are great - really friendly and knowledgable - from the front desk to the bell boys - especially the guys in the breakfast room - great sense of humour and service (it's great when someone remembers how you take your coffee on the first morning and has it ready for you every day for the rest of the trip!) On the subject of breakfast, this was also great... big selection of pastries, cereal, juices, yoghurts, bread, cheese, salami/ham, eggs and bacon and homemade cakes - so good and plentiful that we sometimes didn't even need to stop for lunch! The hotel also wrote a personal greeting to my girlfriend who was celebrating her birthday and had a nice bottle of chianti waiting for us in the room when we arrived - a lovely touch. The room itself was great with just a few points that i felt warranted the less than perfect score... on the plus side, it was very spacious with nice high ceilings, good sound proofing from the street noise, a free mini-bar re-stocked daily and a big modern bathroom with robes/slippers etc. We did however feel that there wasn't enough hanging/storage space in the room. The TV was terrible - only 2 english channels, very bad signal and it kept switching itself off intermittently - although we, and I don't imagine many people travel to Rome to sit in the room and watch TV - so only a minor negative. I'm not sure the air-conditionning was working that well... but still only a minor inconvenience. Overall Hotel Artemide was everything we were looking for in a hotel and more, and I believe could be considered 5 star if the very small details were attended to.

Also have to comment on the breakfast which was really good, excellent choice of fruits, cereals, cold meats, bread etc. that set you up for the day. We are already planning to return to Roma and will most definetly stay at the Artemide again, I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel. Should also say it is only 15min walk from the Termini where the bus from the airport drops you off and picks you up.

The staff at the front desk and in the restaurant were always friendly and fluent in English. We arrived well before the stated check-in time and because the room was not ready upon our arrival they upgraded us to a Superior room free of charge. The location of the hotel is only two blocks from the Metro stop at Piazza della Repubblica which made getting to the major sites much easier and faster. The breakfast buffet was included with the room and the food was very good everyday we were there. There was a cold bar with meats, cheeses, fruit, and yogurt. There was also a variety of coffee cakes, breads, cereals, eggs (they were a bit runny for me but still tasted good), and bacon. When we arrived for breakfast we were greeted with the choice of coffee, tea, or cappuccino which were all excellent. The superior room we were given was very large and very nice - clean and quiet. The mini-bar in the room was restocked everyday and was included in the cost of the room. The water bottles were great to take while sightseeing. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel was the Wi-Fi did not work with the MacBook that we had with us. The staff did everything they could to solve the connection problems - I am not sure if it was the hotels fault or ours but they were accommodating and let us us the computers in the business center free of charge all week.

We had an excellent stay, and would recommend it to anyone visiting Rome. Rome is a big city, so no hotel is going to be near all the sights, but the location on Via Natzionale was fine for us. It was in a busy part of town with plenty of places to eat and drink. The Irish Pub next door was a great way to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel is near all the stops for the hop-on, hop-off bus tours, so we jumped on ours every morning right near the hotel and got around the city very easily. There are also a few sights, but no big ones, that are within easy walking distance of the hotel. If you want to stay within walking distance of any of the major sights, or in a more touisty area, this probably isnt the best place. The staff at the hotel was extremely helpful and polite. Everything we asked for was delivered. The hotel accomodations were also very nice. There is a nice hotel bar and lounge area with big-screen TV. This was nice for early morning or after a long day of touring. There is also a computer room with internet. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant for any meals, though, so I'm not sure about that. The rooms were better than average. We got a discount on a very small room, but our friends were given an upgrade to a very large room with a terrace. It was extremely nice.

We were married in Australia (in March) before moving back to Ireland so we didn't have a chance to have a honeymoon straight away. What better place than Rome! Due to our finances we'd booked into the hotel for 2 nights in a Double Room and 3 nights in the Honeymoon Suite. Imagine our delight when we arrived and Mario advised we'd been upgraded to the Honeymoon Suite for the full 5 nights as a gift from the Hotel. We were welcomed with Moet Chandon and strawberries. Our room had an attached conservatory and a large terrace to sit/eat outside. I know this is not a standard room but to anyone on their honeymoon - I'd really recommend this suite as it was lovely to relax on the couch in the conservatory after a hard day walking. The nitty-gritty: I found the room to be very clean, the staff very accommodating and the breakfast OK. The cappucino each morning was actually very good. We ate at the hotel twice and I found it quite nice (especially when you consider the price and it being so easy to get to:-)). The location is superb - 2 mins walk from Rupubblica station (so only 5 stops from the Vatican on the Metro) and walking distance from everywhere else. Also, the cleaning staff are very quiet and the air-conditioning good.

It may be hard to think of a $400+ room as a bargain, but those are the facts of visiting Rome.

Their \"American\" coffee is EXCEPTIONAL! The hotel has its own rooftop restaurant, a very nice place for an early-evening drinkbut with unexceptional food -- if you're tired from your day, it's OK, but the neighborhood offers much better choices for less. Via Nazionale is a very central location and has lots of restaurants and major attractions within easy walking distance (1/2 mi. for restaurants, 1 to 1-1/2 mi. for attractions). The area isn't a high-end district and opportunities abound for you to see how middle-class Romans handle life in a sometimes-chaotic city. We had a junior suite facing the street -- be aware that the windows are not soundproofed as most American hotels are, and that the street is very busy at all hours of the day and night.

Our first night in Rome we walked to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Campo d'Fiori, ate dinner, then walked to the Colessium and back to the hotel. It was not a struggle at all, even in the middle of summer. Though not situated in the \"heart of historic Rome,\" its location provides easy access to the different parts of the city and is on a nice, clean, safe street. The Hotel sits on Via Nazionale, which is a large street with its fair share of shopping. A taxi ride from Termini station will cost only about $8 euro. A mere 5 minute walk North on Nazionale from the Hotel brings you to Piazza del'Repubblica and its Metro station, which is on the same line as the Spanish Steps and Vatican City.

Visit the Nazionale Romano Museum near the hotel, Museo Altemps near the Piazza Navona and the Capitoline Museums near the Forum to get a real feel for the greatness of ancient rome. These museums and the Vatican Museums go well with the visits to the ancient sites themselves. It was very hot in Rome during our stay so getting back for a rest in the late afternoon was great.

We occupied two adjacent rooms on the sixth floor, one of which had quite a nice patio. The rooms faced the courtyard, so there wasn't any view; however, the patio proved to be a wonderful place to relax after a long day walking all over the city. Additionally, facing the courtyard, rather than the street, it was extremely quiet. By and large, hotel rooms in Europe tend to be considerably smaller than most travelers from the states are accustomed to. This was not the case at the Hotel Artemide. The room size was comfortable, especially when one considers that most of the room usage is for sleeping. It may have been nice to have a bit more storage space for unpacking; but, this was not a problem, unlike some much smaller hotels we have stayed at - especially in London. The rooms were kept sparkling clean throughout our stay. The bath was a shade less than sumptous; still, the equivalent of most high end hotels. Great terry robes, slippers and high quality bath products. Plus, unlike another review I saw here, we had wonderful water pressure and absolutely no lack of hot water at any time during the day or night. The stocked refrigerator (included in the room rate) was a real plus! A couple of beers, waters, juices, crackers and other nibblies. Also, a fine selection of coffees and teas to start your morning. We had breakfast included in our room rate and although on most of our vacations we opt for a quick bite on the run at a local street shop or vendor, we actually ate at the hotel most mornings. The breakfast was nothing short of magnificant! Fantastic coffee and a wide variety of pastries, meats, cheeses, juices, fruit and on and on. What a wonderful way to start the day! The Hotel Artemide is absolutely perfectly located for those looking to tour by foot all the magnificant sights of central Rome. Even better is the proximity to many trattorias for lunch and dinner. We did take the subway to the Vatican one day - the entrance to the subway was only a couple of blocks up the street - very convenient! Another day, we took the train to Pompeii and easily walked to the train station in about ten minutes. Last and certainly not least - the hotel staff... Each and every staff person we came in contact with was smiling, gracious and appeared to really want to assist us in making our vacation as escellent as it could be. The front desk staff arranged for us to be picked up at the airport upon arrival and taken to the airport the day we left. Both times, we were met by the same very nice driver in an immaculate Mercedes sedan who delivered us to our destination rapidly, yet without giving us a concern about safety. Unfortunately, tripadvisor only allows up to five stars; otherwise, I'd give the Hotal Artemide many more in all categories.

The hotel is in a great location about two blocks West of Plaza Repubblica on a main street. We requested a quiet room on a high floor and got a room facing the inner courtyard on the 6th floor. Since there is basically a view of the building across the street from the front of the hotel and there is street noise, you are better off with a courtyard view quiet room in the back of the hotel. Our room was very quiet however it was a bit on the small side. There was a little room on each side of a King bed. But the room was newly renovated, modern, plenty of storage and has a safe, and a free mini-bar. I was surprised to see that it had beer, soda, still and mineral water, and juice and snacks which was restocked each evening, all at no extra charge. The bath was full sized, with marble counters but the water pressure was non-existent. Overall, very clean and well kept. We paid an average of about 140 Euros without breakfast which was a good deal for the quality of the hotel and the great location. We booked it directly from the hotel website. There's a cafe next door where we got Capachino and pastries for breakfast for about 5 Euros each. So save the 20 Euros for the hotel breakfast and go there with the locals. It took us 15 minutes to walk to the Coliseum and about the same to Trevi Fountain. There's a bus stop a block away and about 10 buses go down Via Nazionale towards Termini station. So we got the 3 day Roma Pass for 21 Euros and we took buses everywhere. The Metro station is two blocks away at Repubblica as well. We took that to the Vatican and the Spanish Steps. The hotel also has a great deal on wireless Internet. It was 12 Euros for the entire stay (regardless of how many days). There's also a business center with about 6 desktops for the same rate. So we were able to research places to eat and dine on the go. There's a nice rooftop restaurant and bar. You get a good view of St. Peter's and the menu looked nice but we only had drinks. The biggest negative was the elevator. It was about the size of a coffin. It held 4 people. We ended up walking down the stairs and only using the elevator on the way up. There were no problems, it's just very tiny and claustrophobic. So the perfect room would be on the 2nd floor in the back facing the courtyard. It would be quiet and you could avoid the elevator. The front desk was very helpful and made several reservations for us and got us a taxi for the ride to the airport.

It's a nice gesture, but all of these items are dirt cheap at the local supermarket so don't let it influence your decision greatly. Internet was not free although wifi is available. They do offer a shuttle service to the airport which was about the same price as the Leonardo Express, but being picked up in front of the hotel was much more convenient than the Leonardo Exp.

These rooms are very quite but have no view at all so keep the shutters closed. The bar is expensive - but you are in the middle of 2500 years worth of history. Its not a \"Buy one get one free\" drinking culture so expect it to be a little pricey. If you want a cheap alcohol fuelled holiday go to Ibiza. This is for people who want to see works by Michaelangelo, Raphael, Caravaggio and so on, Its great if you want to explore the Palatine Hill and its archeology, its right next to the Colosseum.

While on a very commercialized street, it is close to many sites and walking distance to some good restaurants. The hotel is decently appointed for the price range and the breakfast is great. The rooms themselves are adequate, not large but not terribly cramped. While the beds are hard, the pillows are plush. The day service is truly friendly and attempts to be helpful. Upon our arrival, we were offered to join breakfast as we arrived the morning of our arrival day. Upon our 6:00 a.m. departure, we were provided with a nice bag breakfast. The evening bartender is very good, always ready with our Prosecco. Some challenges we faced: I would not recommend room #115. Upon booking the reservation, we asked for two quiet rooms. Around 11:00 in the evening, one quickly discovers that room #115 is anything but quiet. Located on the other side of the wall, is an Irish pub. We could hear people talking, music, items and doors being slammed. In addition to this, you could hear water in the walls (pipes) every time someone in the hotel flushed a toilet. The night desk person informed us of the pub next door and was unable to move us that night, but the next day we were relocated without fuss to the 4th floor. Ironically, an hour after being relocated, my husband identified 10 sounds we could hear through our window in our new room: cat meowing, crow, seagull, water rushing through pipes, horn blowing, ambulance siren, church bells, baby crying, people talking, dog barking. However, this was no big deal and our nights were peaceful. The fitness center was another challenge. There is a sauna located within the small room that accompanies the 'gym.' When I began my treadmill run, the temperature read 28.6 celcius (83.5 F). I had to call 3 times to get someone to adjust the temperature. When the bellboy finally arrived, he informed me that there was no AC, only heat at that time of year, and he shut the system off. This did nothing to cool the room down from the dangerously high temperature for working out. I could not complete the run. Just a note if having a gym is important to your travels as it is to mine. Tours: My mother and her friend booked a half day tour through the hotel. They were very disappointed because the audio equipment was full of static and they could not understand most of the tour. The other group members verbalized the same disappointment . My mother felt it a waste of money and time. The map the hotel hands out free is the best map we came across. Don't waste money on purchasing another one. For the best pizza in rome (truly) go to Il Forno at Campo di' Fiori. Also a great wine bar MaterMatuta run by a great guy with great food (5 min walk). Amazing seafood at F.I.S.H. (10 min walk).

We started in Venice for two nights followed by three nights in Rome. I started looking for places to stay 2 months before our trip and after a long decision process decided on the Hotel Artemide based on plenty of favorable reviews, a pretty good rate, and photos that made the hotel look really nice. However, after a fantastic stay in Venice at the Hotel Bucintoro (see my review), coupled with high expectations I was a bit disappointed. I booked directly through the website for their rate which didn't include breakfast but was essentially the same otherwise as a standard room rate. Breakfast cost 14 euros per person per day, so over a 3 day stay we saved nearly 80 Euros. Our rate was 108 Euro per night. For starters, the location of the hotel is one of its best attributes. It is literally a 1-2 minute walk to the Republica Metro station and only about an 8 minute walk to Termini. This made it easy to quickly get to many of the city's sights. We could have walked to many places easily, but with temperatures being in the upper 40s felt we might as well use our 3 day unlimited use metro pass (which came with the Roma pass and I definitely recommend buying it). Being on Via Nazionale was good for reasons mentioned above, but also there were quite a few restaurants nearby if you knew where to look. Gallina Bianca and Quadrifoglio were two that we went to based on Eyewitness Rome recommendations and we weren't disappointed. Both were within a 5-10 minute walk. However, as discussed next the street presented some problems. Upon arrival we were given room 104. I had read in several reviews about the noise levels from the street being high, but decided I would see for myself how bad it was. Upon entering our room I noticed that street noise was very loud and I could easily hear traffic and pedestrian noise. Figuring it wouldn't be too bad at night I decided not to ask to switch rooms quite yet. This was a mistake as the first night resulted in constant tossing and turning and little quality sleep. There was just enough noise from the occasional cars to keep me awake. Also it seemed as if the windows were super thin and did not close properly. The next morning I asked if we could move to a room in the back of the hotel and was told by a helpful Alessandro at the front desk that this wasn't a problem. We packed our things and they moved us to room 107 on the back of the hotel. Upon returning in the afternoon to the new room the lack of noise was immediately clear! The room was extremely quiet which made the next two nights sleep better. Unfortuntely the room felt quite hot (the thermostat said 24-25 degrees). I had to frequently open the window to let cool air in but couldn't do so for too long due to seeing a mosquito or two enter at night. So for no noise I got a room that was much too warm. Aside from that the room was nice although not as large as pictures led me to believe. But it was sufficient. The bathroom had good soaps and shampoo. The shower in our first room leaked tons of water onto the floor but this didn't really occur in the second room. My girlfriend like some previous reviewers noticed that the hair dryer was merely blowing cool air. The complimentary minibar was a nice benefit to grab a snack or drink from after a day of sightseeing. As far as hotel ammenities go it was nice to get a free glass of sparkling wine at checkin from the bar. I glanced at the menu and was shocked to see such high drink prices though. Also while it was nice to receive 15 minutes free per day of internet access, after having essentially unlimited access at the hotel in Venice, it was annoying to feel rushed to check news and take care of travel logistics. You could pay 12 euro for unlimited use for your stay which is however a pretty good value. Also as others mentioned the only English channel was CNN, and while you're not there to watch TV after 5 days of nonstop sightseeing we wanted to relax one afternoon. There was a good deal for 24 hour access to movies and webtv though which we used. As mentioned already the staff were very professional, helpful, and fluent in English. They also booked a private car to take us to the airport early in the morning on our final day which cost 40 euro and sure beat the hassle by metro/bus to Ciampino airport. All in all, my opinion on Hotel Artemide is really mixed. Perhaps my opinions were skewed by the exceptional Venice hotel, but the issues such as street noise, a warm room, and the flooding shower marred my stay. However, the hotels superb location, the professional staff, and the overall niceness of the room made up for these problems. I'd like to think that we just had an unlucky experience and other rooms don't have such a problem with noise/heat as evident by the overwhelming positive reviews. If returning to Rome I'd probably be willing to give the hotel another try as it was quite hard to find a nice hotel at a reasonable price.

Georgio had carried our bags across the construction outside the hotel - there was no where to stop except on the sidewalk. Sympathetic to my concerns about driving alone in Rome to find the Hertz dropoff, Georgio jumped into the passenger side, and together, after several false tries, we managed to find the 7 storey car park for the drop off. Overall, hotel was great. Free minibar was restocked every day. Georgio would arrange for taxis, and watch outside for the correct one.

After reading quite a few reviews on here, a friend recommended Hotel Artemide, and so we made a booking direct with the hotel. It was a little more than we wanted to spend but thought what the hell, and booked a Superior room for 3 nights for \u20ac777. Once my booking had gone through, I emailed the hotel direct with a few questions, room requests etc and I have to say they were always very prompt in getting back to me. So much so that about a month before we were to leave, I checked their website and found that the room rate had dropped to \u20ac678. I emailed them immediately asking if I needed to rebook to get the lower rate and I got an email straight back saying the new rate had already been applied to my booking. Excellent service. We arrived at the airport and had originally decided to get a taxi, but in the end got the train to Termini instead. The map on the hotels website stated that they were not too far from here so we thought this would be quite easy - and it was. The train took about 30 mins and then it was a 10-15 minute walk to the Hotel. We were given room 409 and I was please to see it was a high floor and very quiet, which was what I had originally asked for. Initially I was a bit disappointed not to have a view out onto Via Nazionale, but as there was quite a lot of roadworks going on directly outside the hotel this was in fact a blessing. The room itself was exceptionally clean and larger than I was expecting. The bathroom was great with a really large mirror and fully tiled in marble. I was however glad I had brought my own hairdryer as the one provided in the bathroom gave nothing more than a slight breeze and I would have spent all weekend drying my hair if I had used that. There were toiletries. bathrobes and slippers also provided. The bedroom itself was a little on the dark side, and even by opening all the shutters at the windows didn't do much to alleviate this. TBH though, I do find hotels rooms all over the world a little dark. We had plenty of closet space, and even though we had an initial problem with the safe (and the door sticking) someone came straight up to sort it out for us. The fridge was stocked with a couple of can of Peroni beer, a couple of bottles of water and a bottle of coke and sprite. We also had a TV and I was a little disappointed to find a distinct lack of English speaking channels - there was only CNN. Now I know you don't come to Rome to sit in your hotel room watching TV but we did come back for a couple of hours late afternoon most days, before showering and venturing out for the evening, and it would have been nice to have more of a choice. Minor niggle I know. Breakfast was included and there was a great choice., everything from boiled/scrambled eggs and bacon/ham (not made to order though) to croissants, pastries, cheese, meats, cereals, fruit etc. This was served downstairs and I was a little disappointed to hear the roof terrace was not open. This was one feature I was looking forward to, and when we enquired about it was just told it was closed. Not sure if this is for good as it is no longer mentioned on the website (although it was when we booked) but there is still a picture of it on there. Location of the hotel was very good, and apart from the Vatican city (which we used a taxi) we walked everywhere. The public rooms were very nicely decorated and I would have liked to have used the bar a little more but I am afraid the prices were just a little steep for us. We did get a voucher when we checked in for a free glass of Prosecco, or coffee, which was very nice, but a quick look at the bar menu showed us that a simple G&T was \u20ac10 - a bit steep I think. All in all, even though I may have pointed out a few things that were a little disagreeable, I would say that I would stay here again, and recommend the place. The positives far outweighed the negatives. I think Rome itself was quite an expensive city and the hotel merely reflected this. One last thing - the reception staff could have been a bit more friendly. They were perfectly pleasant but we were never asked how we were, how our stay was going, or in fact had any communication apart from when we checked in and out, and this was very business like.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot as good as we thought it would be...\u201d", "Author": "cindymouse", "ReviewID": "UR19810134", "Content": "We booked a room at this hotel based a bit on reviews we read here and the fact that the hotel could schedule a driver from the port of Civitavecchia and set up a guide for our day in Rome after a 12 day cruise. We thought the room was okay for the price we paid. It was pretty pricey and the staff really did nothing to make our stay anything special. It would have been nice to have the mini bar restocked when the room was turned down in the evening. Only one can of soda and a couple of bottles were in the fridge which we drank after a tour of the city. The room itself was clean and pretty large. It took a bit to figure out how things worked (lights and tub drain) My daughter thought the lighting system was awesome and a great way to save energy. Bed was hard. It was not a bad room or place to stay, just over-priced, we felt it was not worth the price. The driver the hotel provided us was awesome - the best part of the stay. He was waiting for us at the port when got off the ship. Got us to the hotel in record time and provided details of interesting places we drove past. The guide that hotel provided was awful. He did not speak very good english and seemed more interested in taking us to places he wanted us to go than the places we requested seeing. We were VERY disappointed in him. We were specific in where we wanted to go and had many, many emails to the hotel in what we wanted to do. This was very expensive and not worth it.

The beds are typically European (i.e. hard), but the linens are soft, the room is immaculately clean and the bathroom is huge. The minibar is truly free and is restocked every day.

The breakfast buffet is generous and much more varied than most European breakfasts and is also included. Also included is fifteen minutes a day of internet on the computer in the lobby. The air-conditioning struggled a little to overcome the heat, but did succeed. The only disappointment was that the roof terrace was not yet open (in July?) The location is very convenient, one block from the Metro which zips you right to the Spanish Steps or the Vatican. The Trevi Fountain is an easy walk, the Forum is a longer one, but scenic. You can also easily take the Metro to the Colosseum. The restaurants in the area were rather disappointing, but maybe we just picked the wrong ones. One great find was the National Roman Museum, which is just a few blocks away right off Piazza Republica, near Termini station. It contains amazing exhibits of Roman mosaics, frescos, sculpture, jewelry and coins. It is not a usual tourist spot and very uncrowded.

I have two negative comments about this hotel. The first is that if you are a light sleeper I would suggest asking for a room away from the street. I didn't have a problem but my husband did. The hotel is located on a very busy street of Rome. You will hear traffic! The last problem was that the restaurant that the hotel is somewhat connected to does NOT cater to English speaking tourists. I was very surprised to see that there was not an English menu and there wasn't a server that knew English. I understand that I am in a different country and not everyone needs to know English.

However, I managed to find available rooms on 3 other websites (all at differing costs for the same room) and went for the cheapest (a twin room). I paid for this at the outset and received a voucher to present to the hoteI. I then contacted the hotel direct and asked for a quiet, non-smoking room on one of the upper floors and we ended up in room 511 with a lovely view over the courtyard with potted plants. We had the hotel arrange a private taxi transfer from Ciampino airport (\u20ac60 pick up and $40 return ) and we were pleasantly suprised to see a Mercedes 7 seater car turn up with blacked out windows! Fab! Maximo, our driver, then proceeded to point out all the sites as we entered Rome so we had a mini guided tour. On arrival, we were handed a voucher for a free coffee or glass of sparkly in the bar - great start! We had clean towels each day and the mini bar was refilled each day. They also left sweets on our bedsite table as a goodnight treat. The breakfast was superb - crispy bacon, boiled eggs, fantastic pastries (just avoid the scrambled eggs-not sure what they tasted of but I had a mouthful and that was enough)! The location is good- the hotel is at the top end of Via Nazionale but it is really only a 10-15 minute walk to the Colosseum and Forum and about 15-20 mins to the Trevi fountain and Pantheon. Tip 1 - We booked an open top bus tour through Viator.com. It cost about \u20ac13 but was valid for 24 hours from the time you embarked so we had it from 1.00 on Thursday until 1.00 Friday. Tip 2 - as other people advise, book your Colosseum tickets in advance on their website. The guided tour was excellent and can be booked at the same time as your ticket for another \u20ac3.50 each and was well worth it. Just take your email confirmation to the \"reserved\" desk and you will receive a ticket and sticker for the tour. Tip 3 - We booked a tour of the Vatican with MyVaticantours.com. You pay a little bit more than other guided tours but we only had 15 people in our group and it was a fantastic tour! Highly recommended. You avoid the horrendous lines of people queueing to get in and learn so many interesting facts. The Sistene Chapel is NOT to be missed!!! Fantastic!!

In contrast to the room, the marble floored bathroom was of a good size and had nice amenities. This is a very busy area, so perhaps it was quieter on the shaft, but I would recommend a street side view if the traffic noise doesn't concern you. Getting ice means a trip to the bar and a tip. The front desk personnel were a bit cold at first but warmed up eventually and gave us good recommendations for dining, although we did have our camera stolen by professional thieves as we dined in the outdoor cafe at nearby Target Ristorante.

There are also some nice, slightly less touristy restaurants nearby that give you a chance to give the hectic centre a miss if you want to. I loved Rome but wouldn't recommend going in July. It was too hot to enjoy walking and queues were manic for the Vatican. We tried the guide book's early morning recommendation and the queue was worse! However, I totally recommend the guide book trick of buying your Colesseum ticket inside the Forum. Go to the Titus arch in the centre and walk round a bit more, its in an archway under the Palatine. There was 10 people in this ticket queue and we bypassed a queue that went halfway around the Colesseum.", "Date": "August 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cReally a terrific hotel\u201d", "Author": "bethrandy", "ReviewID": "UR8521647", "Content": "This is a really lovely hotel.

Without the upgrade I think we might have found it rather expensive.", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, better than most\u201d", "Author": "ExplorerIreland", "ReviewID": "UR6060510", "Content": "Nice hotel, perfect location along the bustling Via Nazionale with easy access to Rome\u2019s, albeit very limited, metro.

Hotel staff were pleasant, compared to Romans in general, it was a rare source of pleasantries for our stay. Easy walking distance to the Forum and Coliseum, about 15 minutes at a leisurely stroll, and some good restaurants in the area. The free minibar is a nice touch, although it contained no more then 10 drinks, 2 of which were beers and 4 bottles of water. Better if they gave you free internet access (which cost 10 euro for 24 hours access).

Imho it's an averge hotel, definitely not the best you can get for your money. The good - The best about this hotel is that it's located in the city center, most of the main attractions are just a walk away from Via Nazionale. - Reception desk and bellboys were friendly and helpful. - Complimentary drinks are a plus. - The rooms are pretty small but clean. - Food quality (breakfast) is pretty good. The bad - Restaurant was closed when I was there. It didn't bother me too much since I had no intent to eat there anyway but still...a four star hotel without a restaurant? - Free internet access is great but requires a working computer. The one they have has an ugly CRT that hurts your eyes after five minutes; half of the time the computer was out of order and nobody seemed to care about getting the computer to work again. The ugly - While food quality was great, the breakfast staff flat out refused to do their work. It's the old \"we already have the money in our bag so let's not hurry too much\" problem. Save one male waiter the staff down there was busy ignoring the guests (they were rather chatting). They seem to lack organisation, everybody was busy refilling the juice carafes but I always had to actively approach them just to get a coffee. I was never asked if I wanted a refill and when I politely asked for one, I got a face as if I had seriously insulted the waiter. Quite frankly, if I were in charge I'd fire the entire staff and get some ppl who know how service is done. So, this hotel is average; if you can get good rates I'd say go for it but don't expect a four star hotel. It isn't and I'm bewildered they actually have a four star rating.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loughborough, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "corja", "ReviewID": "UR5964625", "Content": "When we evenutally found the hotel (we decided to walk from the train station, and discovered that the hotel isn't quite where the map on their website says it is - it's far nearer the northern end of Via Nazionale than the map makes out!) we checked in without a problem, despite arriving quite early in the day. The staff were really friendly and helpful, and we were given a voucher for a free drink of sparkling wine in the bar that evening!

Since it was on short notice, most hotels were booked full but we were able to get the Artemide for $300/night. I thought that was expensive for the type of hotel it is but Sept is peak tourist season so that was probably in line with what other 4 star hotels were charging. The staff at the front desk were generally friendly but not outstandingly so (except for the kind hearted Paolo). The room was a decent size (by European standards) and the bathroom was modern and clean. We had some problems with the shower head water spilling out onto the bathroom floors at first (quite annoying) but after maneuvering the shower curtain a bit we managed to keep the floor dry for the next few showers. There is a computer terminal in the lounge area where you can access the internet and printer for free. The breakfast spread in the mornings was decent, with lots of different pastries to choose from. The breakfast room though, being in the basement without windows, was a bit dull. The location of the hotel was good in terms of being close to the termini train station (we caught the leonardo express train to the airport when we left) but we actually took cabs to see most of the sights since we didn't have much time. If we had known about this trip earlier, I would have tried to find a hotel closer to the Spanish Steps or the Pantheon. A side note: we had a fabulous dinner at a michelin-starred restaurant called L'atro Mastai one night, the food/service/ingredients were wonderful and we just wanted to mention that to anyone who might be looking to splurge for dinner when they're in Rome. The restaurant is close to Piazza Navona.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Artemide Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d205044-Reviews-Artemide_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$198 - $454*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Nazionale 22</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "205044", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7f/2c/7f2c33546fcb634a9d8204a2f039a1395large.jpg"}}
