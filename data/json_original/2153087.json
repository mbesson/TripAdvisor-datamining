I like the hotel, the rooms are fair and the staff are very nice. They really need to invest in some proper curtains, I did tell the manager that! The location in the city is very good and in walking distance to all the main sites. The rooms are nice, but the bathrooms are on the small side, first time I stayed there, the bathroom was a decent size. The second time was in a different room and the bathroom got smaller! But everything is there that you should need, getting a good nights sleep might depend on the room location. There is the side of the hotel next to the train station, but that is generally not that noisey. The lift is loud, but they will have to change that when Turkey update their rules on what most of Europe deem an illegal life! The resturant is on the top floor and has very nice views. The breakfast is decent but could have a little more selection but it should suit almost everyone. So you should have a decent stay.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muscat", "Title": "\u201cDecent\u201d", "Author": "Ali D", "ReviewID": "UR122970981", "Content": "Pro: It was one of the few available within my price range so I got it. The rooms were nice and staff were generally very nice and polite. You also get fantastic views of Istanbul from the breakfast terrace, with an extensive selection of breakfast food, which we haven't found in any other place. Con: There was a very annoying sound you can hear from the room (level 3), not sure if it was the train station outside or from the elevator but we kept hearing it throughout our stay. Another thing was one of the reception staff, an older guy who looks to be chewing up every time u talk to him, was very annoying. He would always try to sell you things to get commission, found him quite rude at times.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baku", "Title": "\u201cfriendly staff...\u201d", "Author": "st_petre", "ReviewID": "UR120197845", "Content": "We selected this hotel because of its location.

First of all, it is pretty tricky to get to the hotel if you don't have a good GPS or good driving directions (if you come by car) as most of the streets are pretty small and one-way. Having problems with getting to the hotel we called the reception and they immediately sent someone to show us the way. The hotel is very clean. Rooms are not large, but very chic and clean. Bathroom is also a bit small, but extremely tasteful and clean. Internet access is very good and free of charge. Another very good thing about the hotel is the fact that it has parking spaces. Breakfast wasn't very varied but ok. The greatest plus of the hotel is it's location. It is very close to Topkapi Palace and Sultanahmet, Gulhanyie Park, the train station is exactly across from the hotel. Shops, restaurants, tram station are very close and very accessible. All and all, it is a very nice hotel with extremely helpful staff. Very close to the main sights to see in the European part of Istanbul and also to many nice restaurants and shops.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel with very friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie H", "ReviewID": "UR117060982", "Content": "The rooms are small and the bathrooms are compact, but how much time do you spend in the room during the day anyway? It is a very clean hotel, breakfast is included which is great! The staff were always more than happy to help with any questions. Very friendly people (they returned money to us when we gave too much for the room). The hotel is in a great spot, at the end of a street so there is no busy traffic but is a 30 second walk to the centre of everything. There is construction out front of the hotel but it was never once noisy and there were no problems with it.

The manager was friendly and very helpful with a map to our restaurant in Kadikoy and arranging a reasonable rental car right to the door. Breakfast is on the top floor with the great views. It's the usual Turkish breakfast. Our room, however, was so small, that there was no place to put the second suitcase and barely any room to move around. The bathroom was large but the sink was so tiny (baby powder room size) that I bumped my head constantly on the little glass shelf above trying to rinse my face. There was no place to put my cosmetic bag and hardly room for a toothbrush. The decor is new but nothing special and the lobby is not attractive. There is a bit of construction in that area both for the tunnel and street improvements so there is a lot of mess outside and the power cable was cut twice while we were there. No noise, except an occasional toot from a train but not to disturb your sleep. It's a good backup as you will do fine there if you book late as we did.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Best Town Palace", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2153087-Reviews-Best_Town_Palace-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$59 - $150*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Hocapasa Mah.
