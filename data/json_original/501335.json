My husband and I stayed on the second floor canal view room, the Rembrandt room. The room is on the small side, but has everything you need. A comfortable bed, a mini bar with free water, drinks, beer, snacks, and they restock it! There is an awesome coffee maker in the room and it is just great to wake up and have an espresso while getting ready. The room is decorated very well, with some prints of rembrandts paintings, a small flat screen tv, and sitting area by the window with a vase with lovely tulips/flowers. The bathroom shower is great, good pressure. They supply nice shower gel and hand soap, although do not supply shampoo. The canal view is great! We were so pleased with this hotel. It was located on the end of the canal so it was less busy and not too noisy at night. The room did come with a white noise machine. The stairs are steep and narrow, as are all canal house stairs, but the owners were nice and brought our suitcases up for us. We arrived very early in the morning, so left our bags with them, and then did a little exploring nearby and came back at 10am and were able to get up to our room earlier than expected. The hotel is very close by to central station, and was not a problem walking there with our luggage, its about a 10 minute walk be we left the station on the wrong side and it took us longer as we had to walk around. Be sure to have a map handy! There are so many cafes, restaurants and coffee shops nearby. This is the best location! We walked everywhere. Its about a 25 minute walk to the museum area, but very close to the Redlight and Dam square. Don't be scared of the Red light district, there are some great bars and cafes, and I never felt unsafe here. If you walk left out of the hotel there is an outdoor market, and lots of cafes with outdoor seating about a block or 2 away. We spent a lot of time having a cappuccino in the sun while watching the market people here, its very nice! Breakfast here is superb! Breads with jams, jellies and spreads, musile ceral, granola, yogurt, fruit, croissants, and they will cook you up some eggs and bacon. You also get a platter of 3 cheeses and a dish of sliced meat and a cappuccino! What a great start to the day! I highly recommend this hotel! I can't wait to return!

We woke up each morning to Rachel and Pepijn preparing breakfast in the kitchen below. There was a nice assortment of coffees, teas, juices, pastry, fresh breads, fruit, local cheese, eggs, and cold cuts or bacon. Through Misc, we arranged for a private car to bring us to and from Schiphol Airport for appx 38 Euro each way (super convenient). And on our second day there, they arranged a private canal cruise and packed a little picnic for us with champagne- it was an awesome way to sit back (avoid the bike and trolley traffic) and see the city. Rachel and Pepijn also offered recommendations on excellent area restaurants- Cafe Bern and its delicious steak fondue was our favorite. We also enjoyed night caps of warm anise milk at Cafe Russland around the corner from the hotel. And lastly, as a final testament to the hospitality we experienced at Misc., we had a friend from back home meet up with us in Amsterdam, who wasn't staying at Misc, and each morning Pepijn or Rachel would let our friend up to our room and even invite her to stay for breakfast with us. While Misc might not be a perfect fit for travelers with disabilities (no elevator), or those looking for a gym, or 24hr Room Service, it was an absolute perfect fit for us and we wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else in Amsterdam.

We had a canal view room which had plenty of space and some quirky features. I had read reviews where people had complained a bit about the noise- we were a little disturbed the first night, but this was a Saturday night and it didn't bother us as we realised if you want a central location then Amsterdam on a Saturday night isn't going to be quiet. Apparently the garden facing rooms are quieter, but it was really nice to look out over a canal so I think it is worth it! We slept fine, was just a bit noisy whilst trying to get to sleep. The rest of the stay was fine and we didn't hear a thing. The location is excellent- Anne Frank house is 15 mins walk, Centraal Station 10 mins walk, Dam square 10 mins, Van Gogh museum half hr walk, Red light district 2 mins! We didn't use the trams at all as everything is within walkging distance! We hired bikes from the hotel, which was at a competitive price.

Every morning we had a choice of cereal, fresh baked bread, a selection of Dutch cheeses, ham, homemade jam, eggs, bacon and croissant!

We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and, as Rachel and Pepijn mentioned in an earlier reply, the proximity of the Red Light District is truly a non-issue. You need to walk several blocks to get there and we had no problem avoiding it save for a brief curiosity-satiating visit. Rachel and Pepijn were gracious and helpful. Our room was large, light and clean; contrasting with the tiny room we had stayed in in London the day before. We stayed in the Rembrandt room which is in the front on the hotel and while there was some noise from the street the bed was so comfortable that sleep was tough to disturb. Misc also provides a white noise machine, but we really did not need it. We did visit one of the back rooms and, if you are sensitive to even minimal noise, that would be the way to go. The breakfast was excellent, particularly the breads and pastries. After the canned orange juice that seems to be everywhere in Europe, the fresh-squeezed orange juice at Misc was a pleasant surprise. While the common area is a bit cluttered we know from past trips that this is Amsterdam; space is at a premium and I'd rather have it in my room than in the entryway! As mentioned, the neighborhood is somewhat youth-oriented. There are four coffee shops ( where the pot is more important than the coffee) on the same block and it is only a few doors from University of Amsterdam but we felt perfectly safe and despite being in our 50's enjoyed the vibe.

We asked her some questions about the city and she answered all of them patiently. Pepjin was also very helpful. When we asked him if there were any dangerous area that we shouldnt go he actually smiled:) They serve delicious breakfasts with dutch cheese, ham, bacon, eggs, jams, butter etc. Delicious! And when we came back to hotel on the second day's night there were new flowers in our room which matches the room colors. The location may look a little scary if you've never been to Amsterdam because it's parallel to Red Light District. But Amsterdam is a very safe city.

We bought tickets for both the Rijks and Hermitage, and this really saves the queues, enabling to take the \"fast lines\" right to the entrance.

It's on the edge of the Red Light district, but if you feel strongly about it, the Red Light district can be easily avoided. Rooms We stayed in the Baroque room which is on the top floor, over looking the back of the hotel. It's described as a garden view, which puts a slightly positive spin on it, as there isn't really the space in Amsterdam to create gardens worth looking at! However, we didn't go on holiday to spend our time in the room looking out so it wasn't a problem. The room was a good size and nicely furnished, although showing a few minor signs of wear and tear e.g. a small tear in the wallpaper. The bed was large a comfortable with pristine white sheets and covers. There was room for two seats and a nest of tables along with the fridge and nespresso coffee machine. The fridge contained a range of drinks (water, orange/apple juice, smoothies and coke/sprite) and some snacks (crisps, chocolate, cinnamon rolls) which were all included in the room rate along with a couple of fresh chocolate buns and a welcome note from the owners which was a nice touch. The bathroom was clean and functional, however, apart from the rain shower, the bathroom wasn't decorated to the same standard as the room. This isn't to say there was anything wrong with it, it just didn't have that wow factor. A plus point was that it had proper windows which could be opened, which is unusual in many larger hotel bathroooms. Food The hotel is small, with only six bedrooms, so just serves breakfast. The breakfast is a good continental style, with fresh bread and croissants, ham and cheese and an egg in the style of your choice plus tea, coffee, water and freshly squeezed orange juice. It's served between 9-12, earlier upon request. This seems to fit in with the general laid back style of Amsterdam though - we found shops and attractions where relatively late to open. Value for money The hotel is nicely presented and well run, we found the owners Rachel and Pepjin to be very helpful with advice on where was good to eat and information on flight delays (we were there during the closure of some UK airports due to snow). Amsterdam seems to be quite expensive for accomadation, and this is emphasised by with the poor exchange rate between sterling and the euro.

Prior to it, I had been planning a week in a beautiful European town. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give it as a present to my 75 year old, young!, mother for she had already told me she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to fly on a plane, before being too late in life, to meet a different culture. There were some limitations though: both can\u00c2\u00b4t stand extreme heat, partly because of our low blood pressure; she has a spine condition that prevents her from walking more than 10 m (very slowly) without making a break. So I looked for some cool Northern European spot not further away than a two hour flight. Amsterdam would please us too because of what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d watched on TV or read about. An historical city of which we loved the canal house architecture, flat for easy walking, monuments and museums for us to visit, and also the paradise of bikes, which as far as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m concerned is the cherry on the top of the cake - I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a town biker in a Portuguese flat town by the sea.

That name - which makes it sound like some kind of capsule hotel or backpacker hostel, rather than what it is - a wonderfully individual, romantic hotel right in the centre of Amsterdam. Rooms are delightful, individually decorated and overlooking either canal or garden. All are equipped with good coffeemaker, toiletries, robes, big comfortable bed, good lighting and a gratis minibar - no alcohol (a small bar downstairs provides that) but chocolate, snacks and soft drinks, all included in the room price - a first for me, but typical of the way the place is run. The owners are friendly and extremely helpful without being in any way overpowering - all in all the place is a perfect example of what 'customer focus' should really mean (and very rarely does). Downsides? Some people might find the canalside rooms a little noisy - if so, then ask for a garden room. And the stairs are very steep and narrow, but this is a traditional Amsterdam house and that's the way they work. I can't comment on the breakfast as I was leaving too early in the morning, but if the plate of fruit, bread and local cheese that was left in my room was any guide, I'm guessing it would be better than acceptable.

The hotel location is perfect for exploring central Amsterdam on foot, with many attractions only a short walk away.

Breakfast was freshly prepared, delicious and plentiful, and its certainly a big plus that they serve it until midday. We took full advantage of this, not by having long lie-ins (there's too much to do!) but by browsing the local flea markets and then returning for breakfast at around 11.

The hotel is located overlooking one of the many canals of Amsterdam and next to Nieuwmarkt square which hosts a small market every Saturday. Calling Hotel Misc a hotel is a little bit generous considering its size and number of rooms (6). Infact due to the narrowness of the building we walked past it twice before finally seeing it! However, that is not to say the size of the rooms was affected by this. We stayed in one of the cheaper, and apparently smaller garden view rooms, The Retro room. The bed was huge but even still there was plenty of room around and at the bottom of the bed. The en-suite bathroom was also a good size. Due to renovation work being carried out in the dining area on the second day of our stay, we also had the liberty of seeing one of the canal view rooms which had been temporarily converted to a breakfast room. This room ( I think it was The Design room) was also of a good size and nicely decorated. The mini bar was a very welcome addition to the room and was restocked daily free of charge. A very nice touch I thought. Towels were changed daily and toiletries replenished. The shower was one of the best I've ever come across in hotel accomodation, very powerful and never a shortage of hot water which can be a problem later in the evening in some hotels. The only flaws I found with the room wes the thick layer of dust that was clearly visible on the screen of the television. I also have a huge dislike of shower curtains and felt that a shower screen could just as easily have been installed. Breakfasts consisted of muesli's, fruit, cold meats, cheeses, croissants and bacon and eggs served to your liking by Rachel and were very tasty. Rachel was an excellent hosts and upon our arrival presented us with a map and gave us an idea of the scale of the city. This was very helpful. It was the little touches like this that made our stay enjoyable. I would give this hotel 5/5 except for the fact that we were not informed that the aforementioned renovations would be ongoing during our stay.

However, I will try to describe our experience with words, mainly because by doing so I will re-live the experience and all the beautiful feelings associated with it... Having been in Amsterdam before, it took me a long research to find the perfect hotel for my wedding trip. Deciding factors were: location, reviews and communication with the hotel. The hotel scored excellent in all areas. So, after seeing the pictures and considering my options, I decided to book the Rembrandt room, since both me and my wife love art, and the museums would be one of our major sightseeings during our trip. First, the location of the hotel is perfect - right in the middle of the city's center, just 5 minutes from practically everywhere: the Dam square, the Central Station, the Koningsplein & the Flower Market, the Rembrandtplein, the Waterlooplein, or even the Leidseplein and the Jordaan if you're like us and don't mind walking a bit more to get where you want. Even if you don't like walking, the hotel is next to the Nieuwmarkt, which means there's a taxi stand right across the street, to make up for the loss of a nearby tram stop. And for those who feel a little uncomfortable with staying at the edge of the Red Light District, it doesn't feel like that at all. You should be able to forget you're near the RLD just by using your common sense, like you would do in any big city. The hotel itself has only one drawback - the steep stairs. But of course this is Amsterdam, stairs are steep by default, and it's really not that bad once you get the hang of it. Other than that, our room was much more beautiful and convenient than I expected it to be, with fresh flowers on the table and a lovely view over the canal, a fridge with snacks & soft drinks, all toilet/bathroom necessities and the most comfortable double bed I've ever slept on. Each day we had a delicious late breakfast, and while we were out exploring the city, our room was cleaned/restocked for the day. Communication with Rachel and Pepjin couldn't have been better, from the beginning of the booking until the end of our trip. They both went out of their way to, not only accomodate us, but help us with everything we possibly needed, from providing & helping us customize boat tours, to offering us a laptop to use with the hotel's wireless Internet connection. It is because of their help & understanding that the surprise I planned for my wife was a huge success, and it is because of their hospitality that we will both remember this trip for the rest of our lives.

The lobby was a long narrow area with benches and a bar that i assume was used in the summer (we were often one of two rooms used in late Feb) Past a sliding yellow metal door, there was an extremely steep spiral staircase in front of us-as per usual. Fortunately our room was on that floor. I had requested the back and smaller room 1- because it was cheaper, 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they had cooler d\u00c3\u00a9cor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 3) I thought it would be more quiet overlooking an empty courtyard. I was happy to see we were given the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wonders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room that evoked a lush middle eastern feel. It was small, but had very cool lighting and fabrics over the bed. The bathroom was a manageable size with no shelf toilet, fancy toiletries and a rain head shower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a welcomed change from being forced in the past to use the handheld sprayer and desperately try to keep the water in the tub or shower, and usually failing. The real selling point of this hotel, however, was the full FREE minibar and Nespresso Maker. It also had a safe underneath the refrigerator. I was under the impression it was filled once during your stay, but any time we opted to have our room cleaned, it was refilled with sodas like sprite and fanta and coke light, of course in .22Litre glass bottles. Also a Toblerone bar, a Snickers bar, pretzel sticks, etc. For our Nespresso maker, we had three varieties of pods with pre-packed espresso grinds and teeny little espresso and cappuccino mugs and tea glasses with tea, glasses, and teeny spoons. The breakfast the next morning was exceptional - there are only spaces for perhaps four couples in the small area next to the sizable professional kitchen. As later risers, we were grateful that it went until noon. Upon arrival (at no pre-designated time- yet another non-b&b plus) we were greeted pleasantly by Rachel who we finally concluded was American. Friendly without imposing, she asked if we wanted espresso or cappuccino (BEST EVER!) and were given breads, handmade jams, fresh squeezed orange juice - done right then for your glass, yogurt, muesli, ham and three cheeses sliced on your own personal plate and then was asked if you wanted freshly baked croissants and or eggs with a thin bacon. Dramatic fresh flowers and kiwis were next to us most mornings. We never felt obligated to chat with Rachel, but we wanted to because she was so interesting but never offered up information we didn't ask. She never made us feel like we were putting her out, that we had to tell her what we were doing that day, but was ready for any questions about places to go. Her partner, a polite Dutch man, loved giving restaurant recommendations. Be wary if you ask for traditional Dutch, though, and know ahead of time what you are in for! We spent the last four nights in the top front room - we were offered a free upgrade since we were staying so many nights and there was only one other room used that week. We were also given a sound machine to block out the street noise. The African styled room had amazing canal views and was much larger. All in all this is one of the most enjoyable stays we have ever had anywhere.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cA jewel in the heart of Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "tayloia", "ReviewID": "UR14324432", "Content": "If you want to spend a few days in Amsterdam without the hassle of getting around by public transport, Hotel Misc is a jewel. The central location is great, the hosts welcoming, the rooms suitably quirky and the breakfasts sublime. Yes, the stairs are steep and the hotel is on the edge of the red light district, but this *is* Amsterdam, so you should feel short-changed if they weren't. We stayed in the Wonders Room (overlooking the small, rear courtyard) which was more than large enough (the en-suite in particular) and quiet. The free non-alcoholic minibar, coffee/tea maker and capacious safe (presumably in every room) are good touches, but nothing compared to the breakfasts (9am to noon): enough to keep you going until the evening. Then the hotel's location really shines; it's ideal for heading out into the under-explored eastern parts of the city centre for dinner and drinks alongside the locals.

Was very impressed. The breakfast was excellent. Yes, you get fresh juice, eggs, cheeses, meats, coffee, bread, but Rachel's homemade spiced rhubarb jam was simply...heaven! While we were out exploring, they kindly moved our things to the room we had booked(Wonders) which is at the back, overlooking a really sweet garden courtyard. It was a very comfortable room, had all the amenities of a small hotel, and a good sized bathroom to boot! Misc definitley has location, location. It's about a 10 min. walk from the train station, and we did not need to take public transport at all. We walked every where. While we took the train in from the airport and walked to Misc on our arrival, we choose to take a taxi back to the airport for our departure because it was really, really, early. When it didn't arrive as planned we simply called Pepijn, and it was there in 10 mins. Rachel and Pepijn are excellent hosts and do their very best to make sure you enjoy your time at their place.

It was nothing short of spectacular. My travel mate, Allison, and I stayed in the Rembrant Room, which overlooks the lovely Kloveniersburgwal canal -- right in the heart of the city. The room was spacious, clean and charmingly decorated with beautiful wooden furniture and framed Rembrant and Vermeer prints on the walls. It was quiet, save for the church bells ringing periodically in the distance. The room was perfect for resting or reading by the large windows after a busy day of sightseeing. It instantly felt like home. My favorite part of our stay was definitely the superb breakfast lovingly prepared for us each morning. In addition to freshly baked breads, homemade jams, fresh fruit, coffee and tea, guests are treated to an assortment of excellent cheeses and ham. Bacon and free-range eggs are made to order and served with the flakiest, most buttery croussants imaginable. Oh, and I forgot to mention the freshly squeezed orange juice. It was the perfect way to start the day -- truly heavenly. The minibar in our room was tuly complimentary. The delicious goodies inside (chocolates, cookies, sodas, water, potato chips) were restocked daily and, best of all, included in the cost of the room! I could not believe it. The minibar was very much appreciated when the late night munchies struck (a very common occurrance in Amsterdam)! The best part of our stay, however, had to be the warmth and hospitality with which we were welcomed by Rachel and Pepin. It is so clear that they love what they do. That love was evident in every aspect of our stay at the Hotel Misc.

Yes, the stairs are steep by North American standards, but if you've been in other old buildings in A'dam then you know they are all like that. Unlike other reviewers, we didn't find the canal view rooms excessively noisy, and the garden view rooms were very peaceful. Rachel and Pepijn were both fantastic hosts, and no request was refused. Breakfast was top quality, with fantastic breads and cheeses etc. The location is one of the highlights; very close to Nieumarket Square, which has some wonderful restaurants and coffee shops. Easy, easy, to get anywhere on foot, or use the very good trolley system. If you are a traveler who enjoys staying in places that give you a local flavour, as opposed to those that insist on 'the north american experience', then I highly recommend Misc.

If you're flying into Amsterdam I'd definitely take the train to the city rather than a taxi, unless you have loads of luggage. We thought the hotel was very reasonable (compared to other Amsterdam hotel prices). The room was clean, had all the facilities we required and had a nice view of the garden. I would book a room on the front of the hotel in the future (the \"retro\" room we booked was more \"student kitsch\" - but was absolutely fine) Breakfast was excellent and we really liked the breakfast space - really friendly and informal.
