{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Really great value in Beijing I loved this hotel. Great value for Beijing. The room was a reasonable size. The air conditioing worked GREAT, bathroom has it's own hot water heater, i would say about 15 minutes of hot water. No english t.v., except the Chinese station has some english programming. The room was clean, carpet slightly worn, but not bad at all. Room smelled fine.The location isn't the most central, but it's about a 10 minute walk to the Shuengjing bridge Subway station. (when exiting, be sure to use Exit B). That subway line will probably you to change to go to most tourist places, but it's not too far out. A taxi to the Forbidden City area takes about 15 or 20 minutes, and was very cheap. There is a Carrefour shopping center about 10 minutes walk away, which also has a KFC and lots of other restaurants/services. There is a McDonalds's near the subway station. I had most of my meals at the nearby Renaissance Hotel, 5 star, reasonable prices for their buffet, which was great. So stay cheap at the Super 8, and eat well at the nearby Renaissance hotel. There is a 7-11 about 8 minutes walk away, and a few other nice looking restaurants. It is in a residential neighborhood, which was nice and quiet. It was easy to get taxis, at any hour, in front of the hotel. It was tricky finding the hotel the first time. It's near Ring road 3, by that Shuengjing bridge... if you go by taxi, bring the hotel's phone number, so if your driver gets lost he can call them. The bed was slightly hard, but acceptable. they give shampoo and bathgel packets, toothbrush, comb, even daily condoms. The staff were really nice and friendly. They would deliver bottled water, (cold) to my room at any hour for 3 RMB, about 45 cents, or get it at the 7-11 for 1/2 that price. There is a small restaurant, i didn't use it, but it smelled good. The hotel is near that big flea market, begins with the letter P...I saw lots of tourists staying here, not just business people. There is a free internet terminal in the lobby you can use. On the street you can buy fresh fruit. There is no refrigerator in the room, and there is no safe in the room, and the lobby doesn't have safety deposit boxes. They stored a bag of mine for a week at no charge, with no problem. When I went to retrive it, the manager made me show proof it was mine, she was really checking to be sure, so that's a good thing. This hotel is not the Ritz Carlton, but it was perfectly fine, quiet, clean, decent location, great value.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR233928524", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pattayainsider"}, {"Content": "Not the best INN choice I saw the place on the web and booked directly by phone for a single room (RMB320). The room was right next to the ground floor reception desk, very small, and looked really worn. They couldn't give me a double since they were full. I then was given a suite on the 6/F. Prices was RMB460 after a little bit of bargaining. The room was nothing special and reasonable clean. The free breakfast was a joke. The only western option was toast (but no butter provided).Instead of my planed 4 days in this Beijing hotel I moved after the first night to Days Inn Joiest, which is in all aspects better, and even cheaper!Pro:About 10-15 Minutes walk from GuoMao Subway stationLocation relatively quietClose to Soho restaurant areaClose to nearby small restaurants and a hutong style areaNet access free and fastCons:Rooms run down (specially carpets)Too expensive for what you getTerrible breakfastI would not stay again.", "Date": "Apr 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR281292311", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jensimann"}, {"Content": "Good value I spent about 4 nights here at the end of Sept 2007 and was booked in by a Chinese contact. I would describe it as a Chinese businessman's hotel, and it is located in a non-tourist residential area with modern flats down the road. I found it very clean and comfortable, and good value for money. The staff were friendly and helpful, and there were some English speaking receptionists. The food was good, though I should warn that there is only a Chinese menu.There was free internet for residents in the lobby.My only downside was that it was a little bit of a walk to the underground station (12mins?), not so good when one is tired and laden with shopping! However, one can always take a taxi, and it is only a short ride to/from the centre.", "Date": "Dec 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR294950342", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "perlen"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d610132-r19044156-Super_8_Beijing_Guo_Mao-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "610132", "Price": "$49"}}
