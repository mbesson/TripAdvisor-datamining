Check in was easy enough even though there was language barrier. Breakfast was atrocious and we left after trying the juice. I would like to add that we have travelled extensively in all ranges of hotels and only wanted somewhere to sleep and shower so we are not fussy. BUT and this is a big one we had no hot water but carried on as it was early and figured everyone was prob using it. We returned in the evening to more of the same. I went to speak to staff and he didn't give a crap and told me it was tough. This was after he did something with the fuse board. I returned to my room prepared for another cold shower and after 5 or so mins the water was warm!! Clearly they isolate the hot water to save money and only turn it on if you complain?? Another cold shower the next morning. I don't have an issue with a business trying to save money but I do with being spoken to like an idiot! It is basic and having seen the abundance of hotels in the same road I wouldn't recommend it. It was barely adequate for us a we are a couple who travelled with one carry on for the two of us so you can appreciate we are not high maintenance. On another note be aware of what your paying for in cafes we got over charged even when standing at the service bar.

The rooms were small, but who cares? I was there to visit Rome, not to stay in the hotel all day long. I had a little problem with the breakfast because there wasn't any ham, cheese or vegetables to eat. For 4 days i ate only croissants. Another advantage was that i could walk to the colosseum and other attractions on foot and I was there in about 15 min.

We had a triple room.Have to be honest after i had booked this hotel i seen more reviews, bad ones and was like i hope this place is alright,but we were pleasantly surprised I imagined our room to be a tiny box, as some of the reviews had said that and the bathroom but the room was fine there was a double bed and a single plenty of space for us, the bathroom also had plenty of space, i did notice one person in reception saying she had no hot water and i think she had been moved to another room already and still no hot water.but you just have to let the shower run for about 3 mins then the waters lovely and hot.There was also a mini bar in our room,tv with sky and hairdryer in the bathroom and also a safe in the wardrobe.As for breakfast i already had said to my mam and sister look the reviews on brekkie are really bad,When we went down our first mornin we got lovely fresh cold orange juice they also had cranberry juice. They had 2 cereals which i didint have as i dont drink milk but every1 else there seemed to like it.There was croissants and these little pastrys with jam i had them every morning they were lovley.It was a grand breakfast to start u off for the day, also a coffee machine you could get different coffees think my mam had the cappucino and she said it was lovely.Only thing was when you look at the hotel terminal website it says 35 rooms smoking and non smoking and most with balconys so we requested a smoking but when we got there were informed its all non smoking and our room had no balcony we were on the third floor i dont know if any of them have but the website did say subject to availability.Staff were really helpful throughout our stay free maps at reception and they mark places on the map if you wanted to see them.They told us about mamma mia that was on and we went to see it it was brill even though it was in Italian but we enjoyed it.Location is excellent when you come out of the hotel go left then next right then your at termini station.We only went here once as first day we got on a train my mams bag a girl tried to get her hand into her bag twice only for my sister seen her but it was a scary experience in that station we practically ran out if it!There all over the place them pickpockets.Especially the train station is crawling with them ready to pounce.So we decided safest way round Rome was the sightseeing bus we went with glt (green line tours)which is straight up from the hotel 17euro for the day or 21euro for 24hours brings you to Colosseum, Vatican city, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and 6 other spots,and SAFE,Beware of them people dressed up as Romans at the Colosseum they will be like we will take a photo and then try to demand 20euro off you ha!!Even though they take it with your camera but you just give them a euro or whatever you want but not 20euro.But if i went back to Rome i would stay in the Hotel Terminal again :) Maria Dublin", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBad !

There was a flat screen TV with Sky tv and a really good shower. There were certainly no bed bugs as an earlier review said, intact, the bed was so comfortable I wish I could have taken it home. Breakfast was served in a room in the basement and was fine, ok nit bacon and eggs but enough to set you up for the morning and better than some I have had in Paris if you want a comparison. The reception staff were very helpful and informative though busy. On my last day I was invited to leave my bag in a locked room whilst I went for a last look round and I was told I could use a bathroom in the basement on my return. The area is a bit rough at first sight bur this is normal for areas near main station now, just look at Kings Cross in London. although obviously virtually blind I had no problems when walking around but just be aware. You are very close to the tourist sight seeing buses, about 7 minutes walk away and the metro is nearby too. Also of note is Alfredos Resturaunt, virtually opposite the hotel which is also very friendly, the waiter spoke excellent English when my Italian faltered and you can get a good three course Italian meal for 20 euros but there is a NacDonalds near the station if funds are short. To sum up, the hotel is good, clean and safe. Be aware when walking around but you are not under siege just because you are a tourist and enjoy yourself. Would I go back to this hotel?

There was no adequate bar in the hotel, the carpets needed replacing and the windows did not cut out the noise of the city (very close to Termini Station). It seems they claim to be a 3 star hotel as the rooms have a mini bar. Doesn't do it for me. This is a fairly shabby 2 star hotel and I would avoid it.

It is in a really good location, right next to the train station and a short walk to the Metro. If you enjoy walking round cities as my wife and I do then many of the main sights are walkable. We arrived in the late afternoon and having booked a double room, were given what was basically a single room with a double bed shoehorned in. There was barely any room to walk around the bed and nowhere to put suitcases etc. The shower was tiny and barely big enough for me to fit in. It was on the first floor and very noisy at night. Other reviews make mention of the the grumpy night receptionist and he wasn't particularly helpful in moving us, but did pass our request on to the day shift who did move us to another room, which was much bigger and had a small balcony overlooking the street on floor five, which was much quieter. This room was in need of a lick of paint, but was clean and was a decent sized room. The shower screen was broken but usuable. The staff were generally helpful and friendly and spoke good English and even the grumpy night man spent quite some time on the phone for us trying to get a taxi on a stormy night. Breakfast is the usual continental affair and if things sometimes ran out, the staff would happily replenish these when asked. If you are looking for a base only, and your expectations aren't too high, then this hotel might be for you. If I went back to Rome I would try elsewhere next time. Our guidebook spoke worryingly about the area the hotel was in, however, we found the area to be absolutely fine and the street it is on consists mainly of hotels, shops and restaurants. On the subject of restaurants, avoid the tourist areas - expensive and mediocre quality and get a taxi into the suburbs to a 'local' restaurant.

Perhaps it was because I was a single traveller that I was put in room 503- and maybe all the '03' rooms had the same problem- but apart from the beautiful window, it was awful. A double bed had been put in and there was little room for anything else least of all luggage! It seemed that the marks along the walls were testimony to the variety of ways previous visitors had tried to 'store' their suitcases etc. The bathroom was ok tho' the shower was extremely small and it's sliding doors were falling to pieces no doubt because people over 90lbs had tried to shower there! The free packaged slippers were a necessity as the carpet was filthy I was sure the floor had never been vaccuumed, and how could it? No room to swing a cat let alone a vaccuum. I stayed the five nights but the rude, unwilling and unhelpful gallic- shrugging male night receptionist, compelled my inner sanity to seek help from the Hotel Igea next door. There, the staff were so nice and helpful, the place looked so good, and the eating area was on the main floor and very pleasantly laid out.. So I asked the price and immediately booked myself in for the following Saturday ( after my stay in the Cinque Terre) prior to flying back to Canada. It was a joy. My single room really was meant for a single. The place was tiled , spotless and very attractive. The shower was larger and therefore in excellent condition and the TV worked! The breakfast offered an abundance of breads and sweet rolls already in a basket and on the table, plus the coffee was real, not from a machine, but delivered to your table by a blazered staffmember. I paid 70 euros for this, inclusive of breakfast, in contrast to the $118 I would have had to pay at the Terminal. In addition I saw that there was a special deal offered online if a person stayed several nights, but I'd missed that treat. Incidentally.

Its a very busy area no more than 200 meters to the main rome trainstation, which makes it not only buzzing with activity, but also very very useful for your stay in rome. Even an nights the area is fine, its just a busy area when all the shops and little restaurants are closed. The hotel itself upon first sight seemed ok, building was fine and neon lights worked! The lobby area was completely under renovation when we went, so there was very little else in there except the reception desk, and tools in the corner that the buliders and plasterers were using. The elevator was tiny, and as it didnt arrive we took the stairs. Each floor appeared to be under differerent stages of renevation, and then 3rd floor, (our floor) was recently completed. The room was basic but all new, bathroom was fine and all water was hot etc. televison worked but we had to get a remote from reception. Breakfast was pretty poor, cereal and a croissant in a wrapper. It had a coffee machine that made ok coffees, but i was suprised they didnt make their own. they also had a juice machine. Staff were always friendly whenever we spoke to them or asked anything of them. In summary, this hotel when finished will be a good cheap stay, with everything you need. when finished.
