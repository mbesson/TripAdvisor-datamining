Given the TripAdvisor reviews I had high expectations but was disappointed. The room and bathroom were basic, very little space on the floor in the bedroom for a suitcase; the bathroom had lighting and a mirror but neither was well positioned for shaving.

Around the plastic hand basin were two cigarette butt burn marks (room 625); I appreciate they are not the fault of the hotel but they need to be sanded and polished out; there were no tissues. Trams run near the hotel for much of the night; whilst the hotel appears new and has double glazing the soundproofing (perhaps in the walls) is insufficient such that you can hear the rumble as trams pass by. A new multi storey building is being built next door and the hotel has thoughtfully put foam ear plugs in the bedrooms to minimise that disturbance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d asked for a quiet room but needed the earplugs to shut out the noise of the trams \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when one earplug came out during the night I woke up and had to put it back in before I could sleep again. I booked via hotels.com and paid UK\u00c2\u00a3110.96 however on arrival I was advised by the hotel that a local Amsterdam tourist tax was not included \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after they had checked internally I was forced to pay this additional tax. I took exception to this additional charge of 4.60 euros as my receipt listed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taxes and Fees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and quoted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Total Price\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The staff in the restaurant plentiful but spent their time talking amongst themselves instead of providing a good service.

Our only gripe would be the breakfast staff. They were so busy chatting to each other that we ended up clearing our own plates to a nearby table to make room and the plates were cold which meant the cooked breakfast was rather unpleasant towards the end. I know I am short (5ft) but I couldn't even find - let alone reach - the butters and spreads as they were placed so high up on a shelf - also the sauces for the cooked breakfast were almost impossible to reach.

Great size bed with a high ceiling, airy, bright and warm...love the bathroom, convienient and nice shower cabin. Breakfast has a great choice but mainly geared for continentals with cheese, ham and breads.....self service and coffee machine on hand with good quality coffee. We had dinner and it was superb. The reception informed me the chef was a finalist on a Dutch TV cooking programme and he certainly gave us a great meal. I had a seabass starter whcih was coated ina salted vermicelli and some green asparagus tips to dress, excellent and all those in the group had similar excellent starters. My main course was a wild mushroom risotto and the seasoning was perfect. To finish a fig mille feuille and ice cream, delicous. Service was professional and very hospitable. The bar was fine, its on the 1st floor and a cosy atmosphere with a good selection of beers and drinks...bar staff friendly and efficient. Overall a great hotel, not pricey for Amsterdam standards and we had a rate of 125 euros including breakfast......so recommend this hotel and hope to go back soon.

One thing that bothered me about the hotel was that although there seemed to be a thermostat for cool/hot air it was not working. Being a typical European hotel room, it's not the most spacious and the only window was a very narrow window that only allowed a slit to open. That barely gave way for some ventilation and I felt claustrophobic at times. The train station is quite close but maybe not close enough for my liking.

We flew into Scipol arriving just after 8 in the morning and headed for tourist information where we were warmly greeted and received excellent direction as to how to get to the hotel, very simple by train with one change. They also told us how we could get back to the airport using the night bus service (we flew out at 6) which again was very easy. The hotel is very close to amstel station, though its not obvious when you come out onto the street, however ask anyone and you'll be pointed in the right dirction. First impressions of the hotel, it looed huge, bright neon lights outside but definitely not in a scenic position. The staff were friendly and we booked in very easily with access to our room. There is a 5% tax payable to the hotel if not included in your price at time of booking. The elevators to the rooms worked once you had swiped your room key, this was a nice safety feature. The room itself I thought was great value, huge comfortable bed, flatscreen tv which worked great for charging our phones as we'd forgotten adaptors, a mini fridge and clean modern bathroom with consistantly hot water. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on that though the menu looked decent but not much variation. Perhaps my only gripe would be that the walls are paper thin which for the most part isn't a problem, unless its 5 am and your neighbours decide to party...however a quick phonecall to reception sorted that in minutes.

The train, metro and bus station is only a three or four minute walk from the hotel, and the trip to Central Station takes less than 10 minutes.

There was also a large tabletop running along the window that would be great for business. The free Wi-Fi had a strong signal and worked great. The bed was incredibly firm- a little too firm for my taste, but my husband loved it. The aforementioned chairs, however, were horribly uncomfortable- fine enough for sitting it to put on your shoes, but not for long periods of time. The TV was also a little frustrating- it took 3-4 seconds to flip from channel to channel- long enough that you wondered if the TV had gotten the signal or not. The bathroom was lovely- a sizeable counter and a large-for-Europe shower. We were a bit put out when staff entered our room only moments after we'd gotten there. There was a knock and the door, and we were so surprised that it took a moment to get up and open the door; by the time I'd reached it, the staff member was opening the door. He apologized and said they were just checking which rooms were still free.

We were looking to stay in a hostel but left it too late to get anything in the centre of town for less that $50 each a night so we decided to look at hotel prices and saw a good discount for a last minute stay here. The rooms were a lot nicer than anything we would have got from a hostel - basic but clean and nicely set out and new feeling with tea and coffee facilities. I didn't find the hotel noisy at all. It is not difficult to find if you print off a map or directions before you come and get the metro or train to Amstel station. We decided to hire bikes from the hotel and this was the best desicion we made - cycling in Amsterdam is an amazing experience (especially when you are used to UK cities) and being in a hotel a bit far out (about 5 minutes on the bikes) was the perfect excuse to cycle. The cycle hire is a little expensive by Amsterdam standards but the convenience and underground storage at the hotel make up for this. On the Saturday night one of our bikes broke and when we got back to the hotel (at about 2am) we thought we should tell someone on reception - this man was extremely unhelpful!!! We decided he wasn't worth trying to talk to and we'd to sort it out in the morning. The next morning we spoke to a lady who was also very unhelpful (and quite rude!) but we asked to talk to someone else and the next lady we talked to couldn't help us enough - she sorted everything out for us and gave us a good discount on the bike hire (the lady we previously talked to had told us that we wouldn't get any money off and that we would have to pay a lot of money if the bike was broken!). I would stay here again - the cycling into and out of town again made us feel like locals and we saw a lot more of the city than we would have done on foot.

I also had a small purse with 300 danish crowns (DKK) in bills and some more in coins. I thought for myself, who would steal 300 DKK?

When we came back the housekeeping person had cleaned the room and moved everything, the purse, the cards I had put on the desk, my little papers (useless for anyone but me) and my make up that also were on the desk. I thought it was peculiar, because normally housekeeping people don't move anything they just take out the garbage, make the bed and clean in the bathroom. I didn't check my purse, though. The day after we checked out and made our way home by car. As we crossed the danish border I discovered that only the danish coins were left in the purse. Also conveniently for the thief, the yellow plastic bag with the receipt from forex. With the receipt you can exchange back without paying a fee. I feel really disappointed. Not as much for the money. I can live with losing 300 DKK. The memory of the trip is not as pleasant afterwards. I also suspect that somebody working at the hotel took the money, since I at all other locations had everything with me at all time during the trip.

The metro station, train and tram are a 2 minute walk from the hotel which is great. The city centre is 3 stops on the metro about 5 mins. Although i would not advise to walk to the town centre from the hotel, it would probably take about 55 mins and everywhere looks the same, the maps make amsterdam look smaller than it is! The trams are reasonably cheap and sometimes they didnt make us pay, they let us get on as it was late at night. We fealt very safe walking around late at night. Although you have got the 2 main attractions (red light and cafes) its also worth taking a trip to the -8oc cafe where everything is made of ice and anne franks house is very interesting to, also the torture museam. There are some amazing shops if you go further out of the main centre, quite expensive though. BUT YES i would reccomend this hotel, its very cheap and reasonable, we were a group of 21-25 yr olds and it was just right for us. I would advice to get a taxi from the train station to the hotel if you dont feal comfortable getting a metro as its quite difficult to find unless you know where your going, its tucked away, will cost about 15 euros. But you can get the metro from central to station amstel and the hotel is 2 mins walk from there.
