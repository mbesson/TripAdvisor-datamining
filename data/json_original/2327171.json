The rooms were clean, the linen was okay, and the bathrooms were manageable, if somewhat impossibly small. However, this hotel is ideal if you are staying in Barcelona for more than two days. It is not exactly central, but it is within a reasonable walking distance to many attractions (i.e. a huge shopping mall, La Barcelonta). Also, if you are traveling by public transportation, there are many very convienent stops right by the hotel. There is a huge club right by the hotel too, which can be nice. Some cons: our towel warmer did not work :(, the bathrooms are so small with no shelf space (if you are a girl, you know this is important :) ), and the AC did not work! It was really hot in our room. And if you attempt to open the window, expect it to be noisy. Also, the clerks are not especially good in English, and that can make it difficult to get the WiFi code. But, all in all, this hotel worked out well for us, especially being that we did not want to be on La Rambla.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exmoth", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "Devonlodge", "ReviewID": "UR123633582", "Content": "The hotel was new, the room clean and comfortable and the price appeared good. We took the optional 'all you can eat' continental breakfast as the price was reasonable if you prebooked and you could eat enough so you did not need lunch. The only negative points was no tea and coffee in the room and the hotel was a bit far from town - 15 minutes walk to the nearest metero station or 50 minutes to town if you had the energy. Barcelona is a lovely city with the Sagrada Familia the jewel in the crown. It was not too crowded in January so we did not have to queue for anything. The weather was warm and sunny during the day but cooled as the sun went down. We would love to go back but would be willing to pay more for a hotel in town next time.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cDodgy neighborhood but otherwise good hotel.\u201d", "Author": "RustyCanuck", "ReviewID": "UR123428494", "Content": "We booked this hotel online with a special weekend package. The price was right so we figured why not spend the weekend in Barcelona. The hotel is brand new <12 months and as you can expect quite nicely decorated. There was very low numbers of guests while we were there which probably explains the good rate 130 euros per night or so. The BIG problem wi the hotel is the Location. Not close to anything and the area is pretty dodgy, industrial type zone.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cTheives Operate Freely in this Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Fiona C", "ReviewID": "UR122279235", "Content": "Do not on any circumstances stay in this hotel. It is clean and modern as mentioned in the other reviews. However, theives operate freely within it to an extent where one can only assume that the hotel can must be either compliant or negligent. My handbag was stolen from the breakfast table by a couple who had been allowed to remain in the dining room long after it was known to the waiting staff that they were not staying in the hotel. The manager, Emilia Barroso, offered no appology to me and was more keen to racistly prove the origen of the theives was foreign than to address the total lack of security in the hotel. Evidence of the crime does not exist as the hotel only has one cctv camera that only offers partial coverage of reeption.

Room facilities are excellant with spacious rooms and big bathroom with all mod accesories and towel warmer and they even provided all the tooth brushes. Mini bar and air con in room are a big plus and all drinks from mini bar are priced at 1.85 euro which include the beers - nearest metro stop is bogatell around 4/5 mins walk away and on way to metro theys a petrol station and few cheap shops selling cheap grocies etc. 2nd nearest stop about 7/8 minutes walk is Marina of which both these stops will take you to the centre within around 8 -10 minutes. Glories shopping centre is only a short walk and consists of a wide range of shops on its indoor and outdoor complex and a further 10 minutes walk or 2 minute tram ride from there you will mind a huge shopping complex which has a big primark and the stop for this is EL Maresme. Also a 10 minute walk away from the hotel is the very clean beech which if walking along to the centre consists of some excellant resturants and bars - the quickest way to the centre from this hotel is to walk to Bogatell and take the yellow line L4 to Jaume I which is located in the gothic quarter. Also cheapest way to get to the hotel from the airport is to buy a t10 ticket (10 journeys for 8.25 euros and take the renfe train to passeig de gracia and then a 8 minute metro ride to bogatell this trip will only take 1 of your journeys aswell you then can use this card for journeys from your hotel to the centre and given the fact i paid less than 40 quid a night for this hotel offers excellant value for money", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel at a great price!\u201d", "Author": "jrferreras100", "ReviewID": "UR121419856", "Content": "Totally Brand New Hotel in the Poble Nou area with a great Shopping Centre (Glories) just 5 blocks away and the Metro 4 blocks away and in less than 10 min every major attraction! The Hotel lacks decoration, entrance clean set-up all due to how brand new is the Hotel, but the Halls and the rooms are finished product and an excellent one I happen to get an under 60 euros rate which is amazing for this type of property and its location! I see a great future to this very nice Hotel! Caution!! Although for me it was a plus, but there is the hottest NightClub in Barcelona accross the hotel in the corner so very busy Fri/Sat nights! Again, this was also a plus for my stay!
