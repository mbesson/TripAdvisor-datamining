Staying in its Minerva room type really didnt give us a pleasant stay. The most terrible was its bathroom, I never found any hotel separated its toilette and shower room. The shower room was so tiny (the width is as small as cupboard) and it was separated with toilette, meaning that after took shower you have to towel in bed room or run into toilet by passing the bed room. The wall was thin that you could hear people walking outside the corridor, definitely not a hotel for light sleeper. Breakfast was bad, 2 selection of cereal, milk, 2 selection of cakes, 2 selection of pastries, egg, ham, bacon and bread. Though they served cereals, but they didn't give cereal spoon, so we used tea spoon. The breakfast attendance staff couldn't speak english properly.

Literally on the doorsteps of the Pantheon which is a great way to walk out o the hotel every morning. The room, however, is very small and the toilet and shower are so close together it's difficult to go to the bathroom or take a shower because it's very petite. The restaurants around are very pushy so if you're not planning on eating at them I would suggest you not make eye contact. The horse carriages outside will probably try to tell you 150 euros and when you walk away (which I hope you do) they'll keep lowering the price or try to tell you 70 euros one way to the Colosseum which is literally about a 10-15 minute walk so don't take it unless you just feel like burning money. Realistically, you could walk to all sites, the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Vatican City, etc, but it doesn't cost too much by taxi either so if you're not in the mood for a stroll I'd suggest doing that. I only had a problem with one taxi driver who tried to have the meter running before we even got in and also tried to charge a \"bag\" fee of 4 euros when he took the bag out of our hands as we put them in ourselves so be careful. I thought the food in Italy would have been more appetizing, but had a really hard time finding quality food so you may want to research that before you go.

The room was incredibly small you had to turn sideways to pass by the bed, there were no drawers or shelves in the room and the wardrobe was a single and each garment had to go in front of the other and on those dreadful fixed and difficult to use hangers. non hanging clothes i placed on a chair as the suitcase did not fit anywhere - we had to keep moving it to the bathroom and out again. The bathroom was tiny a one person only room, a shower was in a separate cubicle in the room hidden by a broken shower door and broken curtain. The room curtains didn't close properly either. I asked if other rooms had better wardrobe facilities i.e. shelves and bigger and was told every room had the same - I know this is not true as our friends had a slightly bigger wardrobe but still no shelves, there must be better rooms and I would strongly advise getting a better one. Tea and coffee facilities in the room but once used they were never replenished until I phoned down. Staff were lovely, well most of them!

The bedroom and shower room, although small, were adequate and immaculately clean. Feather pillows did not suit us because of allergies, but they were instantly changed for non-allergenic ones. Breakfast consisted of cereals, fruit, ham/cheese/breads, bacon/scrambled eggs, preserves, pastries which we enjoyed. The Reception staff were very helpful, although it would have been advantageous to know that on visits to some of the tourist sights eg. Colosseum, age 65 and over or under 18 could have paid a reduced entrance fee on production of identity card or passport.

I panicked a little reading the reviews just days before we were to stay but I had nothing to worry about. I arranged wine and fruit to be in our room when we arrived, this was done and both were lovely. The airport transfers we asked for were arranged and both taxi drivers were on time and very helpful with carrying my bag and opening my door for me. We arrived before check in and our room wasnt ready but our details were taken and so were our bags. We arrived back later to be handed our key card. We got a little stuck finding the right corridor to our room but a member of helpful staff took us to the right room and showed us the use of the key card. There our bags had been taken to our room for us, lovely. The shower is in the room which i found different but actually my partner and I just smiled at the novelty of it and the shower space was fine as my boyfriend is a broad shouldered 6ft 3 bloke and had no issues. He had more space in that shower than our own at home!!! The smallest bit of space in the room was between the end of the bed and the wall but i even struggle to call that a negative. Plenty of room for our bags and hanging space available similar to he space you would find in any Holiday Inn in the UK. the mini bar was fully re-stocked each day and the rooms were cleaned and tidy. Even the floors cleaned, as we often came back from breakfast to find our room had just been done and you could see where they had mopped up. Talking of breakfast, it's not quite like we would have in the UK but then again we werent in the UK! It was nice to have the ham and cheese and the sweet cakes they had. My boyfriend had their bacon eggs and sausages and as someone who travels every week as part of his job he knows a good breakfast when he has one, he enjoyed it all, and the coffee was lovely. The staff at breakfast were very helpful and the room was not in a closed sticky smelly room. It was in the room you see on the website. All staff were more than helpful in my booking and during our stay. Even when I needed a corkscrew for our wine the member of staff who didnt speak much more English than I did Italian was most helpful in finding me the corkscrew. We had no issues with levels of noise from rooms next door and yes you could hear people if they passed your door and were talking but not any different to again any other hotel or being at home in my semi-detached and I sometimes hear my neighbour. The biggest noise would be the cleaners but they only started cleaning at the sort of time we were getting up anyways so this was not a bother. The restuarant just at the right served great food and we hadnt realised on the special discount, but when the restuarant staff saw which hotel we returned to then came after us to give us back the money we should have been discounted. The wireless was brilliant and we were able to skype our parents and give them a guided tour of our room and our view!!! Our jacuzzi waqs much needed after walking the sites of Rome. Location was fabulous and yes their were the street musicians and singers in the day and night but we found this added to the atmosphere and really enjoyed it. The windows did keep out the noise when time for sleep and what a comfortable bed to sleep on. I could go on with praise I really could. Will recommend the hotel and will stay there again.

Of course we didn't pay 280 , we paid the price that listed in the other hotel but this took our 4 hours with stress. Poor attitude of staff and management. Annoying thing was they thing they are right to charge 280 Euro per a night that we DID NOT STAY in the hotel.This was done in a very unfriendly and rude manner. The staff walked around with an attitude. Staff did not deal with problems effectively as we complained and no response. Bad points of this hotel: *The breakfast was absolutely awful. Worst coffee I've ever had The food is not served hot and freshly cooked. Low quality, limited choice, no fresh fruit, cakes were not fresh.and a very limited range of food on offer,waiter hopeless *Too much money for a room with No outside windows, and the rooms had paper thin walls.15m2 rooms *Deluxe room pantheon view had half a window - don't be fooled by their photo. A very narrow strip of room leading to it. The rest of the room was behind a wall so you couldn't even see the room from your bed. *You can't see out the windows at all and there was no natural light. It is like being in a windowless room which felt a little claustrophobic. You had to have a light on at all times. *The bathroom was unbelievably tiny and cramped, not even 1 metre wide. You couldn't even turn in it and a large person would not have fit. *The employees should know how to communicate with customers.Staff uniform untidy dirty. *The restaurant that was advertising 15% discount charged 5 euro to use 2 serviettes for lunch which almost negated the discount.Avoid restaurant below despite pasta uncooked & overpriced for quality. *General cleanness was poor. *Wireless internet is available but the signal is not strong as it should be, and difficulties with access to internet. *Hotel had not even a name outside. *Room insulation poor could hear people in room next door. At the end we stayed 3 stars hotel (Albergo Santa Chiara) instead of this horrible hotel and it was half of the price of Pantheon Royal Suite.We had a big room, and excellent breakfast.

The first thing that makes this hotel stand out is its location. Right in the Pantheon square you are staying in a place where all sorts of visitors are coming to see. You can walk in any direction to see almost all the sights of Rome. I booked the Round Room many months before coming and had forgotten about it. Nice surprise upon arrival The room is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting. You get a private lift to the top floor of the building which is dedicated to the one room. It has two terraces, a nice TV, and the mini bar is complimentary. For the money, it was the best value I think we got in Europe. The WiFi in this building was very good, stable and fast. Best I had experienced on my trip until this date. The staff was helpful and friendly. The breakfast was pretty good but not as good as some of the other hotels we stayed at on our trip. The two negatives I had for this hotel were the mediocre A/C for the room we were staying in and the lack of toiletry amenities. The room was a bit warm at most times even with the A/C fully cranked. This was a typical thing we experienced all over Europe but definitely wished we could have kept the room a bit cooler. For the bathroom, they provide no bar soap or hair conditioner and didn't refill our used shampoo and shower gel bottles after the first day until we called to request it. Still, it gets 5 stars since we really enjoyed our time and the room.

We were dropped off by the shuttle service arranged through Expedia. We managed to get a fairly priced package, round trip between Paris and Rome which included air, lodging and transportation. Its a good thing the shuttle driver knew exactly which door we should enter for the hotel as there is no signage beyond #7 Piazza Della Rotonda to indicate you have found the place. That settled, I like the anonymity this provided. Our room was spotlessly clean, the bed very firm and the shower very tiny. My husband is 6' 210 lbs and it was impossible to get the soap off the floor (this was also hilarious). Our view of the piazza fountain and the Pantheon was PRICELESS. There were a couple issues with the card key entry so we were initially given a regular key. A day or so later we lost power in the room, we were provided a card key to install in the wall when you are in the suite and from then on zero issues. We no longer needed the real key for entry. Breakfast was fresh with espresso on request, juices, pastries, lunch meat and cheese. I got a little tired of salami sandwiches after 3 days and wanted my usual oats, but all we were served was very good. Make note that the restaurant at the foot of the entry to the hotel is rather expensive, even with the 15% discount you receive as a hotel guest. After carefully reviewing the bill I noticed that the restaurant had not given us the discount, after bringing this to their attention the situation was rectified. Made me wary and I didn't eat there again. The room service at the hotel is provided by this restaurant, but with so many phenomenal places to eat in Rome, why eat in the room? My thanks and gratitude go out to Elisabetta at the front desk for her assistance in setting up shuttle pick ups, tour reservations and having terrific customer service skills. We never had any issues with her even though we speak zero Italian. She was terrific. I would love to return to Rome and would stay back at this hotel in a heartbeat.

We did not notice any of the building works in terms of noise and the builders kept the stairs very clean while working on the sidelines and the stairs as such were save. Reception is on third floor and they were always very friendly and helpful and even arranged for a very late checkout on the Sunday. On arrival, they immediately apologized for the stairs/absence of lift and were quite astounded to hear that I knew about it. Lift is being installed sometime November apparently. All further questions regarding Rome or the room where dealt with immediately and a free water bottle was replaced straight away as the seal seemed to be broken. Room 304 is with Pantheon view, a deluxe double room, not huge per se but big bed with a firm mattress, but all very clean and new and enough space for two, clear design nothing to annoy the tastebuds. Bathroom not huge, particularly the showertray is tiny, so might feel a squeeze for some. Plenty of towels and good water pressure and lots of hot water. No plug for handbasin, so not sure what people do if wet shave. Good hair dryer and very nice Mila Schoen toiletries (plenty, including two toothbrushes). Safe in warddrobe worked and the fridge was stocked minimally (which means you can stock up yourself) but all clean and new. Could have done with more hangers but forgot to ask. The bedlinen is very nice but if it is getting cooler the bed throw will not be enough to keep you warm. Air con in room but did not use. The pictures on the website show the room as it is. Sensational view which really is quite breathtaking at all times of the day. A full moon over the Pantheon is quite something! Good double glazed windows but if you like to leave them open at night, bring ear plugs as the piazza is very busy and therefore noisy until the early hours of the morning and at about 5-6am the street cleaners come to empty the bins. All fine with windwos closed though! Adding to the streetnoise is the running water noise of the beautiful fountain outside the window! Next time I bring ear plugs. Good Samsung flat screen TV and Sky channels. One negative point: The hotel needs to do sth about the badly insulated wall to our neighbours and the keycard buzzer to our neighbours door. It is quite loud and you can hear most of the conversation in the other room which was the annoying part (one night out of three). Again, ear plugs would have solved the problem. Breakfast is in the bar/coffee shop/restaurant downstairs (does not belong to hotel) and has improved somewhat from previous reports: super coffee, hot chocolate or any hot drink, buffet with different baked good (rolls, croissants, cake) one variety of cheese and ham, cereals, milk, yoghurt and fresh fruit basket. You can eat inside or out. If you return to eat another meal during the day there you will get a 20% discount in this place. Location: you cannot top the location, that is for sure. Everything is in walking distance from there: Piazza Navona and Campo dei Fiori round the corner, shopping district/Corso, even the Vatican or the Castle St Angelo is very close 10-20min. We did two guided tours with Angel Tours (one of which was the tour on a golf cart/buggy) and both were sensational and very informative but fun. (see Angel Tours Rome recommended on TripAdvisor). Shame we did not have time for their Vatican tour. We also use the red open top bus company (which was good for a general overview on the first day) and they were good and not as bad as some reviews on this site. If you have kids and want to show them a lot, Eur15 well spent for 24h. We will definitely stay again at the hotel, next time in one of their family appartments which have kitchenette and sleep 4. The lift will be a massive improvement. More rooms are being done in different styles - one apparently with a jaccuzzi. If the management keeps up the cleanliness and friendlyness and the general basic concept of a good unfussy hotel in a superb location with all the right basics, then this is a place I am happy to return to time and time again. Around the corner is a very well stocked Spar supermarket (next door to it is the best ice cream shop - and cheaper than most of the big name ones! Try the Lemoncello variety) with a good deli counter, so ideal to self-cater for some of the stay. They even had glutenfree produce/breads/ snacks which was fab. They also sell earplugs I noticed on my last trip. ;-).", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hoogland", "Title": "\u201cA unique location that you will never forget!\u201d", "Author": "Reiziger71", "ReviewID": "UR46849324", "Content": "The greatest thing about this hotel is it's location! It is situated at the Piazza della Rotonda, one of the most intimate piazzas of Rome. We stayed in a deluxe room, with view right at the Pantheon. If you opened the window in the morning after waking up, the Pantheon was right there, how unique is that?! It was great to see the piazza changing through the day. When you looked out of the window in the middle of the night the piazza was completely empty. In the morning during breakfast the piazza was slowly waking up, in the afternoon it was crowed with people and not until late at night it was slowly getting more quiet. Disadvantage of this unique location was the fact that it was noisy from very early in the morning. At 6.00 a.m. they started to clean the piazza, to collect the dirt (also the empty bottles, which made a lot of noise) and to deliver to the restaurants. During three nights of our five night stay there arrived a truck at 6.00 a.m. to deliver construction materials for the renovation that was taking place in the building of the hotel. They left the engine running. But the construction workers were very polite to the guests and tried to do there work as quiet as possible. During the day I did not really notice that there was work in progress. We were staying at the 3th floor, where the reception is located. Sometimes late at night or early in the morning you could hear the telephone ringing rather loud, but it was always picked up quickly. The staff at the reception was very friendly. The hotel consist of only rooms. There are no facilities like a restaurant or bar. The hotel is not indicated on the outside. But the Piazza della Rotonda is not very big and when you have seen the pictures on the internet, you will find it easily. There was no lift at the hotel, so we had to carry our luggage up and down three floors. But all this was forgotten when we saw the view from our room! The rooms are very new, so everything looks new an clean. The decoration is very modern and fresh. Its great, especially when you compare it to many other hotels that I have seen on the internet. The room is not big, but big enough as we spent most of our time in the city. The bathroom is rather small as well, especially the shower. But I understand that is normal in most Italian hotels. Towels were changed every day. It was nice to have an airco and a safe in the room. The beds were great, although it was too short for my partner, who has a length of 1.90 meters. The location is great as well because it is really in the center in Rome and right in the middle of all the important sites that you should visit when you are in Rome. The Colosseum an the Vatican are most far away, and even these places can be walked to in 15-20 minutes. Breakfast is being served in the restaurant that is situated downstairs. Breakfast indeed consists of only a cup of coffee (a very big one!) or tea, a glass of orange juice and one croissant. But I learned that this is a normal Italian breakfast. We could use our breakfast on the terrace in front of the restaurant, right at the Piazza della Rotonda, only about twenty steps away from the Pantheon. Really breathtaking! Before breakfast we walked into the Pantheon for a minute, when only a very few people were inside. While later on the day it is crowded with people. Disadvantage was that breakfast is being served from 9.00 a.m. So if you want to start your day in the city early, you will have to skip breakfast. Even though there were some disadvantages, our overall opinion about this hotel is that it is great!

The one good thing about the hotel is its location which is amazing for seeing the sites, but i would still advise anyone to change hotels if its not too late", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cfantastic location\u201d", "Author": "jetsetter86Scotland", "ReviewID": "UR43885949", "Content": "this hotel is probably in the best location for all the major sights with everything within easy walking distance- the vatican and colusseum around 15-20 mins at the most and trevi fountain less than 5 mins. the hotel is in piazza della rotonda, with the pantheon and lots of restaurants right outside. it's not clearly sign posted and doesn't look like an obvious hotel from the outside. if you're facing the pantheon, the hotel is on the right hand side, in between 2 restaurants. it looks like an entrance to a block of flats and reception is on the 3rd floor. they are still doing renovations to the lower floors but there was no noise and we barely noticed it. the hotel consists of only rooms (no public areas eg a bar) and breakfast is served in the restaurant downstairs which is a lovely setting- sitting outside in the square with a view of the pantheon- our room was brand new and immaculate. we had a view onto the square and pantheon which was lovely. the room was small but not tiny and had a king size bed, safe, T.V, minibar/fridge and a built in wardrobe. the bathroom was spotless and modern and was cleaned every day. the reception staff were friendy and helpful. there was no lift that i could see. i could find no fault with this hotel and it's location was definately it's best asset. it's a perfect base from which to explore the city. i would definately invest in a map and guidebook so you don't miss anything. the best pizzaria in rome is around 5-10 mins walk from the hotel and is great (and cheap) it's called Baffato's and is worth a visit. we had to queue but turnaround is very quick so we only waited around 10 mins. similarly, the ice cream place beside the trevi fountain is fab - try the chocolate orange flavour! overall, a great stay in Rome and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Pantheon Royal Suite", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1529760-Reviews-Pantheon_Royal_Suite-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$184 - $407*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piazza Della Rotonda 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00186</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1529760", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/a3/74/fd/exterior-pantheon-royal.jpg"}}
