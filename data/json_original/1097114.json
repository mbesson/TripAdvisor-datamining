Downstairs was very shabby- a definite turn off and the kitchen which was in the basement, was shared by guests. People can cook for themselves and can make complimentary use of eggs, bread and milk. It seems a generous and great idea, but the reality of cooking with other residents of all kinds wasn't practical or inviting. I can't imagine hygiene is great, so we gave that a very wide berth. Fortunately, the bedroom was clean and tidy, though sparsely furnished. The shower was efficient. We found the toilet wouldn't flush- we had to lift off the lid and push down on the 'controls' inside. Also the plug wouldn't work, but rather than have someone coming into our room, we reported both on departure.

The room was small \u2013 but not stiflingly so. The bathroom was larger than some we\u2019ve seen in our journeys throughout the UK and on the continent and the shower just missed winning the \u201cbest shower\u201d award because it could have used a shower wand head rather than a fixed position nozzle \u2013 the water pressure and temperature was great though. The bed was very comfortable and we even had enough plugs for our electronic equipment in the room \u2013 no easy task and one that most rooms fail. The room was a bit hot even with the furnace off but we were happy to use the supplied fan to cool it down. We were gone from very early to very late in the evening and so we did not use the available kitchen very often but when we did we found it perfect \u2013 with everything necessary supplied and the free bananas, cereal, and toast in the mornings were fantastic. The kitchen had a stove, oven, toaster, and microwave along with all cookware and dishes needed \u2013 perfect! We also loved the fast and free wifi access that we easily reached from our room and were happy to find that the hotel actually set-up multiple routers to ensure connectivity. Our room was cleaned thoroughly every other day which was perfect for us because I don\u2019t believe it is necessary more frequently and is just a waste of time, money, and energy. We also loved the location \u2013 on a major street in between the Bow Road underground stop (about two blocks away and accessible by the District Line and Hammersmith & City lines) and the Bow Church light rail station right next door. Our room was on the interior of the hotel and away from the street, so we had no street or light rail noise.

The staff greeted us and were friendly and helpful and showed us round. We had to pay upfront, but were able to look at the room first. The room was very small, but we have stayed in smaller, and it was not too cramped. The ensuite bathroom - toilet, washbasin, shower, wall cabinet, handwash and soap, one towel each, plenty of toilet rolls - was very clean. As well as the bed, we had a bedside table, a lamp, an alarm clock (old style), a small table, a flatscreen TV on the wall, one chair, and free wifi. Our room was on the ground floor. Our room was clean and had all the basics. Our only gripe is that the double bed was very narrow - too narrow for comfort and a good night's sleep. Only having one pillow each didn't help sleep arrive, either. In the basement is a kitchen where you can make hot drinks or eat breakfast cereals, bananas or swiss rolls (complimentary, do your own washing up) or cook and eat your own food. All this is free; you are charged \u00a33 if you cook their eggs etc. The hotel has no parking, but there is free parking in the streets very nearby after 5.30 pm until about 8.00 am. It is also free at weekends. We stayed at a weekend so this was fine for us, but other times it's residents only, so I don't know where you'd put a car during weekdays.
