Key worked - but lock didn't- maintenance was prompt and fixed the lock asap. Stiff robe and comfortable slippers. Had a couple beverages in the Fox Bistro- I am relieved to know this will be upgraded in the near future. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Had to get used to airplanes flying over the hotel - VERY close to the airport- but going for only one night, we opted for convenience. Planes stopped by 11pm and slept great. Water pressure in shower was awesome. Drank the large bottled water in the room, and noticed the card behind it stating we would be charged $3.50 if consumed... geesshh... had I noticed that I would have got a smaller, colder water from the vending machiene- so don't drink the water in the room if you don't want to be overcharged!!

Otherwise, this hotel claims, \"you won't pay.\" surprisingly, this slogan is at reception, in elevator and in the room. So, let's see how they deliver. In fact, the location is good. There are a few restaurants there. Room is large and comfortable. Bed is soft. It looked all good until the last morning when we faced real challenges. We had stayed in the hotel for two days. I would say hardware of the hotel is better than software. Except a tall lady at the reception and the lady in the breakfast, smile is absorlutely scarce resourse. I even wonder why? Situation got worse finally. On March 17, we would fly to Costa Rica for vacation. My wife got up at 4am to prepare. She wanted to curl her hair with an appliance from China. Unfortunately, the volt converter does not fit socket. So, I called reception. They did get something. Just it is same as mine. I went to lobby and asked for a extension cord, hoping to plug in. However, they got one that is exactly same. What is the point? It is just useless. I ran back and forth for four times(they never sent anything to my room), just to find out disappointment. To make it Worse, the guy at reception had no emotion at all. He never greeted when he called. He didn't have any smile, at all. The worst thing is I finally found out he is a manager(looks like south asian in light suits)! I told I am not satisfied at all. He kept saying, i understand what you say, but this is all I have. Fine, you dont have to help your guests. You don't even know what your guest, or more precisely, your trouble maker(as you are so unhappy), needs. To include, this hotel can't make guests 100%satisfied at all. How could it if staff has a stony face? And never have courtercy? Please! You over promised, and under delivered!

The problem arose after I crossed the street to check in at the Radisson - only to be told my 'third party booking' was made for the following night (funny...considering I said 'today'). The lady was absolutely powerless to help me, explaining that my hotel was paid in full and she wouldn't be able to honour the preferred rate. I explained that it was never my intent to book through a third party and that the rate was of no consequence. She encouraged me to call them back to make the change. 20 more minutes of phone time later, Expedia assured me it was fixed (had to get the 'supervisor's approval to honour the same rate - at this point it was about the principal of the matter - ugh). Returned to the desk...only to be told they couldn't yet see it on their systems. Asked if I could give them a credit card to check in while they awaited the 'paperwork' from Expedia (they have no ability to contact them ...despite their observation that 'people book through third parties inadvertently 'often'). By now I'm losing it and I risk being late for my corporate function. Finally Karen came to my rescue. She magically was able to take my credit card to allow me to check in - and just asked that I pop by later to ensure the room was charged appropriately. She upgraded me for my trouble. Room was beautiful, spacious, and very conveniently located to the Congress Centre (walking distance), Tim Horton's for my morning coffee - and gas station for my rental car. Overall it worked out.

Great value for money.\u201d", "Author": "Montrealeronthemove", "ReviewID": "UR32063380", "Content": "We stayed at the Radisson Suites Airport for 2 nights at the beginning of June 2009. We had an excellent stay. The hotel is a good distance from downtown and could be a real plus depending on the reason (and place) you need it for. The hotel is just off exit 354 of Hwy 401. You don't have to look for it: it's right there! The outside look is ordinary. The spacious suite-style rooms though are outstanding(see photos). We arrived a bit before 3pm and the attendant checked us in immediately. The staff is professional, helpful and really nice. We were assigned room 1015. I had read reviews about the noise of the airplanes if you were on a higher floor. Well... we were there on Friday which is probably the busiest day (flights in and out) and we could hardly hear the planes. When they land, some fly just over the hotel, you hear a light rumble for about a second or two. Everything stopped around 10pm! The next day, we were back in the afternoon for a while and hardly heard any. For those not used to Radisson, their sleep-number beds are great. There is a TV in the bedroom area as well as in the living room. The air-conditionning can be a bit noisy. At this hotel there is a charge for parking. At the time we travelled it was $11.99 per day, with in and out privileges. The only problem we had was the that, even if we registered our car with the reception of the hotel, the next morning we saw the attendant ticketing our car, taking pictures of the car etc. I proceeded immediately to the reception and gave them the ticket. The reception attendant told me to leave it with him, that it would be setlled. I think that they should have a pass system with stamped date to put in the windshield of your car instead of that registering system. It would avoid aggravation with wanna-be policemen who only want to show their power as security agents. Apart from this, I could only find good to say. The concierge in service in the evening was really nice and helpful about directions and restaurants. Whenever we needed something we got it either right away or brought to the room very shortly after. Everyone there gave excellent service. Sharing the parking lot of the hotel there is a Tim Horton's(actually 2 of them), Swiss Chalet and another restaurant (which I don't remember the name), plus the hotel's on-site restaurant (Fox Bistro (?)). I had read reviews saying that restaurants were far and that a good breakfast was hard to get in the area... well, we found full breakfast places within walking distance. For golfers there is a golf not far at James Gardens. The Toronto Conference Center is the neighbour of the Hotel. Talking about value, Radisson have a \"Free Friday\" promotion at this location, which means that if you stay either a Thursday and Friday or Friday and Saturday, you get the Friday free. All together for two nights and parking it cost 159.00$ CAD. I am sure that the pictures will tell it all about the room. The only thing I forgot to take a photo of, is the sink area. There is also a litlle fridge and coffee maker which is just behind the desk. We will definitely stay there again. The room, the staff we had during our stay, made it worthwhile to go again.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Bay, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAirport Stopover - Very nice and clean place\u201d", "Author": "dssdt1", "ReviewID": "UR26418128", "Content": "Spent 1 night at this hotel the night before we flew out to the DR.

What made the stay a little more challenging was that my daughter became ill during the night and I needed to get the bed linens changed. A call to the front desk quickly revealed that the fellow who had checked me in was about the only staff member in what is a fairly large hotel. To top it off he was almost brand new and told me that before he could give me a linen change he would need to speak to his manager who I think was safely at home. Anyway, to his credit the manager did call me and linens did arrive (although not quite the right ones). When I suggested to the staffer that he might want to remove the soiled and smelly linens (now in a plastic bag and placed there by me) out of the hallway he said that he would need to talk to his manager again.

If you want the newspaper, it's $0.75 CAD per day unless you decline it at check in. These fees really did not bother me much because they cost much more at a hotel in downtown. We booked the room on Hotwire for $50 per night. After taxes, it was a little over $60 which was quite good. The only negative thing I have to comment about is that my credit card was charged again when I have already paid for the room through Hotwire. This was promptly resolved by making a phone call but this shouldn't have happend in the first place.
