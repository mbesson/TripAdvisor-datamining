{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Decent budget priced hotel As expected our room was quite small. The sheets and towels were clean. Along with our robes, they were replaced daily with fresh ones. They carpet was rather dirty and our view was of a building 6 feet away. But we were there primarily to sightsee and marvel at the world's largest Megacity.The Front desk staff's English, depending on the time of day, was very poor. For the most part, they weren't as courteous as most Japanese we'd encountered. The hotel is situated near public transportation, a McDonald's, a 24 hour pizza parlour, a German restaurant(?!?!), a grocery store and the TBS building (Tokyo Broadcasting System). Essentially smack dab in the middle of the city.Breakfast was complimentary but I would suggest to westerners, order the Japanese breakfast and not the English one. The Japanese breakfast not only tastes better but is also nutritionally superior. The only extreme joy of staying here was the vending machine outside of our room. It dispensed different varieties of soft drinks, iced coffee and beer!!! All and all I would say, stay here only if you need a place to crash, want privacy and you don't want to sleep in a capsule hotel.", "Date": "Nov 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR522165681", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Interociter"}, {"Content": "Good Location, standard room       Akasaka, Marroad Inn from the outside", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR548483414", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RenRabbit"}, {"Content": "Good for the money Our room:- was very small. The bed was right against the wall on one side so I had to climb over my boyfriend to get to the loo in the night! The bathroom was tony - the taps for the sink in the bathroom swivelled round to become the taps for the bath! I thought it was quite cute though...- had no view whatsoever. There was one small window and it looked onto the back of a building. We asked if we could be moved but were told all the double rooms were the same so we stayed where we were.- it didn't bother us too much, but there wasn't any SKY TV, just Japanese channels so not great if you want to keep up with what's happening elsewhere in the world.- didn't have anyhere to hang clothes. No wardrobe or clothes rail.- was clean (although the carpet was long overdue to be replaced!) but very basic. The staff were very friendly but did not speak a word of English.We ate in the hotel restaurant one morning - it wasn't that great or interesting but it was okay.The hotel is very near the tube station and is quite central in Tokyo, so is well located.Overall, I think it's good for the money.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR162630087", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Dwynwen"}, {"Content": "marroad inn akassaka tokyo we found the staff very freindly apart from the fact they could speak no english. the rooms were a little small but tidy and clean the restaurant was very good .the hotel is situated in a good area for nightlife and restaurants overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again", "Date": "Feb 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR467098340", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "paulburns"}, {"Content": "Good hotel, Great Price This hotel was great to stay at for one of the best prices vs location I could find. Located in Akasaka only minutes away from the US Embassy, Subway station, and many small eateries.We opted to have breakfast every morning included the price. The American style breakfast was pretty good and we had a differant fruit juice every day. It became something to look forward to..lol. The only unusual thing is they serve a salad with dressing on the side with the breakfast..lol. (something lost in translation) Walk to subway is a nice 5 minute walk. Also a 7-11 near by that offers drinks and magazines. Across the street is a place the serves Beef bowls. If you are on a budget, make this your main staple. Its cheap and filling. There is also a yakatori house and a small store to pick up nic naks like medication. If you are American the little guy working it will explain that you need to take like 4-5 pills at a time..lol. Anyway the Hotel is great an I reccomend it to anyone staying in Japan on a budget. In fact I am going this weekend.

I assumed this meant that I could have either at the same price which is normally the case. The only other option was single or triple rooms.We were quite taken back at the steadfast insistence of the clerks at the hotel that the additional amount must be paid. They would NOT call wired-destinations for clarification. In fact, they would not even provide me with a receipt for the hotel stay upon my departure -- this after some insistence on my part. They did admit that I already paid a price to Wired-Destinations considerably higher than they normally charge, but would nonetheless provide a twin room.NEVER AGAIN", "Date": "Dec 26, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR586361199", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "FlyerCanada"}, {"Content": "Good Budget accommodation in Tokyo My wife and I stayed at MarRoad Inn hotel in Akasaka just a week back (september 2005) and the price for a double room was less than A$150 (i.e. just above US$100) (off - season). We stayed only 3 days and it was very convenient because it was less than 5mins walk from Akasaka Station. We were not interested in hotel facilities as such because we llooked for a hotel where we come to sleep only. The hotel was quiet and generally spacious from Japanese standards and we had nothing to complain about. Of course we cannot comment on the food etc as we ate from outside. There are quite a few small restaurants and snack bars around the Station and for budget travellers it was good. There was also a 24hr internet cafe (Hotel gave directions to Gera Gera) 5mins walk from the station which charged less than 400yen per person for an hour. From Akasaka Station to Shibuya or Shinjuku or Roppongi on the subway is very quick (only 3 - 4 stations) but you have to change the subway line midway which is no hazzle.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR860966125", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lamak"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d581941-r22268331-Hotel_Marroad_Inn_Akasaka-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "581941", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
