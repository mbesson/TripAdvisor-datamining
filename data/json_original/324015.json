I think the most outstanding part of the experience was the incredibly helpful and service oriented staff. I have stayed at top hotels and they were more courteous and better than any of them.

After staying at the Niksoma a couple of times we decided to try somewhere different, not to mention cheaper!After reading the great reviews on the GGBR we booked 10 nights at the hotel.We were pleasantly surprised at how good the hotel was for such a little price.We had room 14 which is on the ground floor - hopefully you don't get this room as it was right near the stairs and the spa girls all sit there and talk, so if you want a sleep in it's not the room for you. We also had a huge problem with mosquitos - my boyfriend ended up with so many bites on his legs that turned into welts - it was awful. We asked to move rooms which they did with no worries. We then moved to room 32 and had no more mosquito problems. The only noise problems was the construction happening over the road at the old Balihai. But that can't be helped by GGBR.Henry was our favourite waiter - nothing was too much trouble for him and a geniunely nice guy!The spa treatments are fantastic and very reasonably priced. I would recommend the facial!The rooms are HUGE and very comfortable. The only thing was the beds were hard, but that's our opinion and you may find them comfortable!The pool is so refreshing - it is just the right temperature! It is very clean and we loved it. As the hotel is only small there is no problem in fighting to get a lounge chair!!!The jacuzzi was so warm - it was great - like getting in a big bath!The hotel is a bit far out from Kuta, which is a shame, but taxis are in abundance and cheap so it's really no problem!All in all, really happy with the hotel and we would stay there again.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR949046658", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "WannabebackinBali"}, {"Content": "Good location for Kuta and the Airport Booked this hotel with Agoda. Finding the hotel was a little problematic at first, as there are 2 Green Garden hotels both in Tuban. This hotel is down the street from Kartika Plaza on your way to the airport, and a right turn towards the beach. The hotel is in 2 blocks, the first block contains the reception on the first floor along with the bar/restaurant and above that is the spa. The second block is about 3 stories and contains about 14 rooms (4 on each floor and 2 on the ground floor). Between these 2 blocks is a large swimming pool with sunbeds. Check in went smoothly, and the room on the first floor of the other block was very large albeit a little dated, with a big fridge, large double bed, chez lounge, big bathroom with a large corner bath and shower attachment. In the wardrobe was a safety deposit box. Two small complimentary bottles of water were left in the fridge daily. The balcony had a nice view of the pool and the spa/reception building. Pool towels had to be collected from reception and signed out/in. The spa was very nice, treatments were quite expensive compared to the massage shops on the street outside. The hotel was located in a quiet part of Tuban, surrounded by a few other hotels, and a little row of shops. There are a couple of very cheap laundry shops nearby. It took about 15 mins to walk to Discovery Mall in Kuta, either up the beach or the main road. If you gave the hotel reception 24 hours notice of departure, you get a free transfer to the airport which is literally 5 mins away. In summary, a good quiet location not far from the centre of Kuta, and a good jumping off point for leaving Bali at the airport.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR236098784", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Happynoodleboy_uk"}, {"Content": "Nice and cosy but a little over-rated My husband and I just came back from a 4-night stay at the Green Garden Beach Resort and Spa. The landscaping is lovely with lots of greenery. The pool looks very inviting but unfortunately we didn't have a chance to take a dip as we were out every day. We were given a room on the 2nd floor. It is large with a good size bathroom. The king-sized bed (2 singles put together) is comfortable, better than some of the 5-star hotels I've stayed in which tend to be softer on one side. There's cable TV which made my husband really happy as he could catch his favourite soccer matches. There's a good size fridge with daily supply of 2 bottles of mineral water. The air-conditioning is well maintained. There\u9225\u6a9a also a safe in the room. An adaptor is provided. However, the room we stayed in was a little tired with a number of mosquitoes flying around. There is a large tub in the bathroom. You'd have to sit and shower as the shower head is mounted very low. When you turn on the tap, there's a slight smell of sewage that comes out from the sink.We had massages every night. Therapist Ayu and Yuni are very skilled. The massages are reasonably priced. The massage huts are lovely except that the piped-in music is a little loud and the lights cannot be dimmed. One night we had to go to another spa place called Balisari just down the road as the spa at Green Garden closes at 9pm. It was horrendous. The exterior looks lovely but the rooms are basic. I believe the therapists who massaged us were trainees as they didn't really know what they were doing.The restaurant at the hotel serves really good grilled seafood which comes with a gorgeous dip - Balinese chilli with shallots. We actually had them for 3 nights! The mango juice is to die for! You can go for the satays too which are quite nice. Don't bother with the onion rings or roast beef. The staff were warm and friendly, especially waiters Agus, Awan and Henry. Nothing was too much trouble for them.On the whole, we had a nice stay at the hotel but I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b go as far as saying that it\u9225\u6a9a a fabulous 3-star hotel. Not sure if it's because my expectations were too high after reading all the fantastic reviews that i find it a little disappointing when they didn't quite much up. I prefer the location of Febris and Green Garden hotel as they are not in overcrowded Kuta but not as out of the way as Green Garden Beach Resort and Spa. A word of advice: Check your bill carefully before settling it as there was an entry for a beef burger which we didn't have. I'm sure they didn't slip that in but someone could have signed it to your room accidentally. What We Did in Bali: We went sightseeing the first day. We booked a MPV (6-seater) which came with a driver and a personal tour guide for 10 hours and it came up to only US$40! The tour guide, Lagros (not sure if it's spelt correctly), speaks good English and is very knowledgeable. He has a good sense of humour too. He gladly doubled up as our photographer so it was perfect! If you're interested in engaging him, you can ring him at +628123993994.We went white water rafting the 2nd day. Paid US$27 each with transfers and lunch. Agung river, though scenic, is a little sedate so if you prefer more excitement, raft at Telaga Waja.On the 3rd day, we went for a reef cruise (plus 1 dive) with Bali Hai. US$110 for experienced diver and US$125 for those who are not certified. The water temperature was 21 degree Celsius but it felt much colder than that so we were freezing. There's so much to do in Bali. Wish we had a longer stay!

It was also great to see that the resort is run in an environmentally aware way with power saving bulbs, solar power etc. So basically I cannot fault our experience.

My girlfriend and I spent 5 nights here in November and highly recommend this hotel. Though we were a bit skeptical given the price, we quickly realised we had found an undervalued gem and a great deal for what the hotel had to offer.The complex itself is quaint with only 15 guest rooms, a large lagoon style pool, an excellent restaurant, and a great spa. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.We had an exceptional room on the 5th floor with a nice balcony overlooking the pool and an ocean view. Walking into the room brought huge smiles to both of our faces, as it was considerably nicer than what we were expecting. The room had marble floors door to door, even a marble toilet and a large marble bath tub. The large window between the bathroom and the bedroom was also a nice touch, though equipped with curtains to preserve modesty when desired. Other extras included satellite TV, safe, refrigerator, etc. We concluded that the only reason this was not a 4 star room/hotel was due to the lack of complimentary toiletries.The hotel's spa advertised itself as Probably the Best Spa in Bali - it is probably pretty close given the value. A 1-2 hour massage goes for around $10-15; a three hour package around $25. Hotel guests get a good discount on spa treatments and you can probably find a free massage with the room if you shop around on Bali/Asia specific travel sites.Unlike many other hotels, the restaurant prices were competitive with non-hotel establishments. The rooms come standard with a pretty good breakfast. We ate lunch and dinner here several times given the convenience (room service no extra charge). There a couple of nice restaurants on the beach nearby within a couple of minutes walk.Location wise, the Green Garden Resort is in Tuban Beach - 10 minute walk to Kuta along the beach. While the hotel is not adjacent to the beach (another reason it is 3 star and not 4), it is right across the street. This is a great base to surf the reef off Tuban, although Tuban is not the prettiest beach in Bali - lots of stray dogs and hawkers ( 'You want sarong' )roaming around.All in all, you are going to get a 4 star hotel for about $45 a night. We left the Green Garden to stay at the 5 star Meridien Nirwana in Tannah Lot (also highly recommended) and nearly went back to the Green Garden after a problem with our room - the Meridien sorted it out, but we would not have been disappointed had we left.", "Date": "Jan 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR227346252", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "DrOxford"}, {"Content": "Forgotten We stayed at the Green Garden form June 9-13 2005. We upgraded to a Kids suite as we had two children with us. The room was extremely pleasant, however the shower caused the whole bathroom to semiflood and made it quite slippery. The problem we had whilst transferring hotels is that they had offered us free transport. Upon arriving at the hotel the driver took our luggage out and as he departed we realised that our backpack was still in the back of his car (Loaded with digital camera, about 200 AUD and other belongings) We tried to flag him down but he did not respond and so we ran after him and when we finally got to the hotel he told us oh I havent seen your bag. When we asked to speak with the manager they asked us who we were and basically could not remember us staying at the hotel. Mind you when we aere there they knew which room we were in and were talking to us by name and room number.Another incident which alarmed us was that upon returning from shopping on the second day they were showing a couple through our room. We actually spoke to a couple who were staying there and they said that they had actually watched the driver (employed by the Green Garden to offer transport to guests) that they had watched this man walk along the ground floor and look into all of the hotel rooms along the pool area.Although this hotel was great in cost and seemed friendly at first, be VERY CAREFUL when looking out for valuables and for the extra $10 per night you could be saving more in the cost of your valuables!!!!", "Date": "Jun 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR117892725", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kazdot1975"}, {"Content": "Charmant h\u4e48tel   showReview(22701445, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR713497800", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "lekid"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562690-d324015-r23023462-Green_Garden_Beach_Resort_and_Spa-Tuban_Bali.html", "HotelID": "324015", "Price": "$75"}}
