It is so conveniently located right off Union Square, Fabulous choice of restaurants all within walking distance and an array of shops too. We had a military rate of $149 per night which is the members' rate, parking is a very short walk away and is $27 per day if you stay in the hotel. You can take your car in and out for no extra charge. Breakfast is included in the cost as is the 4-6pm happy hour which makes this a very good deal! Both are served on the 12th floor which has stunning views over the city. The staff are very helpful and friendly. We had a king room which was very spacious with a huge closet which had a full sized fridge and coffee making facilities. The bathroom is on the small side but perfectly adequate and spotlessly clean. The style of the hotel is older but that is part of its charm. There is a lovely library with a fire to relax by.

The Club has a discount for garaged parking just up the street with in/out privileges.

The breakfast and \"happy hour\" are a plus, and one of the reasons we return, but they could use a little fine tuning. The breakfast wait staff were all friendly and efficient. I don't understand why they only have the toasters out on the weekends. And new toasters would not be a budget buster, it takes several minutes for a slice of toast to even get partially done. The evening cocktail hour was a mixed bag. The view is spectacular from the 12th floor, so why they don't turn down the lights, put a few candles on the tables and let people relax and enjoy it is beyond me.

By showing my husband's military ID when we checked in, our rate was reduced from $199 per night to $80 per night. What a great value! This price included our room which was adequately sized (by downtown San Francisco standards) and a buffet breakfast each morning on the 12th floor with a great view of downtown SF. For $27 a night, we parked our car in a garage which was about 50 yards up the street. Again, this was a great value, as most hotels in the surrounding area charged upwards of $50 per night to park a car. Our room included bathrobes, two double beds, an alarm clock, a coffee maker, a small fridge, and a hairdryer in the bathroom. The room did not have a DVD player and the pay-per-view movies were incredibly expensive, which was sort of a bummer for my sons. Also, our window looked directly out to a brick wall of the hotel next door. Some of the interior of the hotel was a little dated, and the nightly happy hour was always too crowded for us to attend. At $80 a night, I can't really call any of these things \"complaints\" because it's easy to overlook minor issues when you're getting such a deal. Had we paid the full rate, I would have wanted a nicer view and expected some nicer finishes here and there in our room and the common areas of the hotel. The only major reservation I have about recommending this hotel to people is that it wasn't the most comfortable place to stay with small children. My kids are pretty well behaved, and we travel with them a lot, but I still found myself \"shushing\" them and telling them to be quiet, sit up straight; etc. The hotel is frequented largely by retired military, and there weren't a whole lot of families there. This made the atmosphere feel a little stuffy. As a matter of fact, one morning, the breakfast buffet was especially crowded, and after we finished eating and got back on the elevator, one lady in the elevator remarked to another that the buffet was too crowded because \"there were a lot of families in the hotel right now\". I kept my mouth shut, but I actually thought it was the older folks up there drinking their coffees and reading newspapers that slowed things down. If you've ever eaten at a restaurant with small kids, you know that families usually eat and leave, and don't dawdle at the table. Plus, there were really only 3 or 4 small families of 4 in the dining room (including ours) during the time that we were there for breakfast. Her comment let me know that even a small amount of smaller sized families was an anomaly for the MMC hotel. Bearing that in mind, we will definitely go back to MMC again. The location was so great (we walked to Union Square to go ice skating) that you end up not spending a lot of time in the hotel, so even though it wasn't the most kid-friendly hotel, we still enjoyed our stay and will be back.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat military benefit!\u201d", "Author": "debedmtzIllinois", "ReviewID": "UR122241184", "Content": "Great hotel in the heart of San Francisco.

Unsure of what to expect with \"The Marine Club\" - we were a little hesitant about staying here. I'm happy to report, we were pleasantly surprised! Perfectly situated in San Francisco's busy tourist area of Union Square, this hotel was only a short walk (downhill!) to many tourist attractions: shopping, cable cars and more important, the public transport systems (BART and MUNI) at Powell St. There was a fun bar (The White Horse) two doors down, a liquor store right next door and a Walgreens, a short walk away; all necessities when booking a hotel in my opinion. The boutique hotel has a small lobby, but is quite large once inside. The hotel is a memorial to past Marine service and a service to current Marines; so the hotel is a Marine museum and we saw many Marines (past and present) on the premises. Our standard room was small; but very clean with all the standard hotel amenities. Our friends were staying in the Deluxe rooms and Suites; which were both VERY spacious; so if being able to spread out is important to you; I would opt for a Deluxe room. The (Bridal) Suite was enormous with a full sized living room, separate bedroom and separate bath area/toilette area. Definitely worth it for a special occasion. Included in our standard room rate, we received complimentary full buffet breakfast and \"happy hour\" cocktails. Both were fabulous. The breakfast buffet was traditional breakfast buffet with eggs, sausages, French toast etc. with all kinds of breads, pastries and fruit, coffee tea and juice. The happy hour from 4-6 included complimentary beer, wine and cocktails and was such a generous amenity. Worth the price of the room, right there! As the hotel is geared at the service community; as expected, there are many older couples and families staying here; so don't expect partying in the halls (or if it was going on, we didn't see it/hear it). My friend also hosted her wedding here; and I can say that the cocktail area and dining room were spacious and very classically beautiful. The service we experienced at the front desk, dining\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms and event staff were absolutely lovely. However, because this is a boutique hotel; expect to call for reservations (and make note of your own confirmation numbers; no email confirmation here); and expect the front desk to get a little busy, we called several times to no answer; but the staff themselves are absolutely fabulous.

Even tho it is technically not right on Union Square, it is a very short walk to the square and shopping. It is in a good neighborhood with convenient restaurants nearby (diners, Starbucks, etc.).

There is a hotel in the same block that had a cheaper base rate, but their parking for one night is $59. If you have an oversized vehicle such as a truck or large SUV, you pay more. So, the Marines Memorial has a deal with a self-park garage on the same block for $25 for 24 hours. This hotel has a wonderful breakfast buffet, which is included in the room rate. There was a big selection of fruit, bagels, breads, french toast, potatoes, oatmeal, cereals, and much more. The only selection that I didn't care for too much was the scrambled eggs. But, the rest was excellent. Coffee was provided in a carafe which was left on the table and the wait staff refilled the orange juice numerous times. They were very attentive. There was a happy hour between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. and it was complimentary. The bar area was small, but we were allowed to use the tables in the restaurant area and enjoy the view from the top floor. Our bedroom was small at the very end of the hall near the service area and ice maker and I thought we were doomed to a very noisy night ( it was one queen bed). But, it was very quiet.

There were nice soaps and the tub/show was nice and lots of hot water. The bed was a bit hard for my liking but that is subjective. All-in-all a very nice stay.

There are some things to mention though.... our room had a big crack in the basin and a big stain on the carpet, it was getting a bit worn and the bedding was pretty ordinary compared to other comparable hotels we have stayed in this trip. It was also stuffy as there is no extraction system but this goes with older hotel buildings.

So all in all just a one night stay but would love to be here for a week to explore San Francisco. There are no negatives for this review here are all the positives: - Location: in the heart of downtown San Francisco located within walking distance to all the sights downtown. -Free complimentary internet/ free gym pass at the attached gym with lap pool. Complimentary happy hour with free drinks and breakfast ( which we did not get to try). -Business center. -Comfortable rooms with flat screen TV/ refrigerator/comfortable bed/ nice bathroom with great water pressure. -11th floor has a historic library with array of different military books and newspapers. We will be back! Can recommend this place enough. Tip on eatiing We had Sushi at the Sanraku restaurant just up the street on Summit from the hotel. Great Sushi and service!

I can't say enough about the location. As far as the hotel goes, it is a GREAT deal if you are a member. If you are not a member than the price is still not bad. The rooms are basic, but comfortable. The beds and bedding above average. The bathrooms are small, but the closets are very big, walk in closets with a mini fridge and coffee maker. Everything is very practical-military. There is even a clothse line in the shower. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. The best part about the hotel is the top floor restaurant and bar. Great views of the city. The breakfast, included, is good. In the evening there is a happy hour, also included. If we weren't up to hanging out for happy hour we would grab some beers and put them in our mini fridge for later. If possible stay on a higher floor, because you are in the middle of the city, so there is street noise. I just brought earplugs and had no problems. Even if you are not a member, you can really save $$ by staying at this hotel with all the extras included. Remember this is not a fancy place, but very comfortable and convienent.", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Hotel in San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "1lacrosse", "ReviewID": "UR17415299", "Content": "I am proud to be a member of the Marine's Memorial Club, and always stay at this hotel when in San Francisco.

I stayed one night in February in a king room on a corner of the 9th floor. The view was lovely. The decor is light and pleasing, simple but pretty. The room was impeccably clean and had all of the amenities \u00e2\u20ac\u201d shampoo etc. right in dispensers on the shower wall, 2 free 1/2 liter bottles of water, bathrobes, iron and ironing board, safe, etc. etc. My favorite thing about staying there, though, was how quiet the room was. This is worth its weight in gold in a downtown hotel. I think they must have new beds, too; my bed was very comfortable and I slept much better than I usually do away from home. This place is an amazing value for club members and non-members alike. The building is gorgeous, with amazing period ornamentation and painted ceilings in the public areas (lobby, etc.). The location a block from Union Square can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. Parking is right up the street; you get a voucher that lets you take your car out and in again if you want. There are lots of Union Square hotels, but because this is part of a private club, when you walk through the doors, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re greeted like an old friend and you get the feeling the staff would do anything to make your stay memorable. What a difference that makes when any overnight stay in the City is a splurge, as it is for me. We unfortunately arrived after the hosted happy hour (included with the overnight stay) was over, but had a great meal in the steakhouse on the top floor. The breakfast buffet (also included) has EVERYTHING (eggs, bacon, potatoes, oatmeal, pancakes, cereal, yogurt, fruit, etc. etc.) and serves up a terrific view in the bargain. Good thing I got a workout in before tucking into that meal. A pass for Club One, downstairs, is also included. This is more than a hotel.
