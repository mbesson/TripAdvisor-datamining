We thoroughly recommend it. Firstly, the location of the hotel is very good. We prefer to walk and used no public transport except a taxi to and from the airport. It took approximately 40 minutes from the hotel to the Vatican, 30 minutes to the Colosseum, 6 minutes to the Spanish Steps, 12 minutes to the Trevi Fountain. Obviously being winter the temperatures were suitable for brisk walking and we would probably have been a bit slower in high summer. The hotel itself is charming; think 5 star service rather than slick and high-tech. It's very comfortable, very smart and very well maintained. The staff were all so nice.The staff at breakfast were the best of all. They were efficient and noticed when you needed something almost instantly. Nothing was too much trouble. They were very, very good at their jobs. The food was also, of course, of the first order; an international style selection of everything you can imagine for breakfast. Our room was clean and comfortable. The decor was in good order. Our room was a standard double and perfectly large enough. The bed linen was changed daily. Everything in the room worked. There was a room safe, as you'd expect. The hair dryer was attached to the bathroom wall which I do not like at all because I have long hair and have an uncomfortable time drying it. There was no kettle/ tea tray, again as usual. Would I stay here again? Yes, without hesitation. Room tip: I would ask for a room away from the Via Veneto, which had far more traffic on it than I had expected. Light sleepers might be disturbed by the road noise. Taxi tip: the journey to Rome from the airport is set at 40 Euro by the Rome council. We confirmed this with the driver as we got into the taxi at the airport and had no problem upon arrival at the hotel. When it came to leave the hotel telephoned a taxi for us, we did not double check the fair and we soon noticed the driver had put his meter on instead. As we were on the way home we could nbot be bothered to argue, but paid the 75 Euros instead. We could have avoided this by talking to the driver before getting into the car.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cHave everything i appreciate\u201d", "Author": "Hilde J", "ReviewID": "UR124736236", "Content": "Breakfast was exellent, especially cappucino, juice, fresh fruit and croissant Staff very friendly and helpful In the bar Simone served us delicious fresh snack with our drinks Rooms comfortable and very estetic Some noise from carbage/ trash outside our room at the pavenebt at night and early morning", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "martin1England", "ReviewID": "UR124538704", "Content": "Stayed for two nights.

Even very famous hotels with high reputation can turn out to be quite dated and not up to international standards. Not the Majestic. This was a real positive surprise and it is a real great hotel. Both in terms of building/rooms/design and service. The moment we arrived we felt great, very welcome and highly comfortable. ** overall ambience ** The hotel is more than 100 years old and seemed to be recently renovated. It keeps the 'old time' atmosphere but with modern touches. There are nice salons on the first floor which are perfect for a pre-dinner drink. ** Service ** The service quality was exceptionally high and the staff seemed to enjoy working there. In particular the staff at reception, the doormen and at breakfast provided exceptional service quality. Always in a relaxed way with a good sense of humor. ** Room ** We stayed in Junior Suite which was very nice and we had a lot of space. Essentially it was a proper sized room with a very small \"extra room\" with provided space for a round table and some chairs. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was nice and large, however no separate shower stall and no separate toilette. The room was facing Via Veneto. While at some times there is quite a lot of traffic on Via Veneto we did not have any noise issue. ** Restaurant ** Breakfast is served at the restaurant in the first floor which is a fantastic designed dining room. In summer there is also a terrace overlooking Via Veneto. Unfortunately we were not able to eat there in the evening as the Filippo La Mantia Restaurant was closed for Christmas holidays. ** Location ** The hotel is located on Via Veneto close to Piazza Barberini. It is about a 10 to 15 minutes walk to the shopping areas around Piazza Spagna. Other main sights like the Forum Romanum or Piazza Navona are in (long) walking distance. *** Reasons to stay at this hotel *** - classic hotel, newly renovated - high service quality - welcoming and cosy atmosphere but still a hotel of proper size - nice rooms (at least the better room category) - in general good value for money *** Why you might want to consider alternative hotels *** - while the location is good, you might prefer a hotel with a view, or closer to certain locations We will definitely stay there again when we go next time to Rome.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cmajestic was great hotel\u201d", "Author": "nazly b", "ReviewID": "UR122429128", "Content": "Front dest, concierge were so helpful and polite. room were small but very clean. we got room with break fast included, and it was awesome. the high light of my day, was so delicious. so close to spanish step and fountain travi, just few min walk.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "NYInternational", "ReviewID": "UR122117930", "Content": "We just returned from a week at the Hotel Majestic in Rome.

When I arrived the staff at the front desk greeted me like I was a favorite relative who rarely comes to visit. Everyone I spoke with, from doormen to porters to waiters to telephone operators could not have been any nicer, with one small exception (more on that later).The hotel is beautifully architected and enjoys one of the prime locations for sightseeing in Rome. I walked easily to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Parthenon, and the Coliseum/Roman Forum. Only the Vatican was a bit too far for me, although someone with younger and more energetic legs could manage it. In any case, St Peter's is a10E cab ride away. The room had lovely amenities such as wooden shutters on the large windows to keep out the street noise, marble in the bath, his and her dressers in the large closet (it was the first time in years that a hotel provided enough hangers to accommodate my travel wardrobe), huge thick curtains, and beautiful (silk?) rug. The air conditioning worked just fine in my room, though it was not overly hot outside in May. I have only 3 minor complaints, all technical in nature.The clock on the nightstand is plugged into an outlet that only works when the room light is on, so it is pretty useless. Alternatively, there is a clock in the TV, as i was informed when I called to complain about the clock, but the display is dimmed whenever the TV is off, so again, there is no way to easily see the time if one wakes up in the middle of the night, as I sometimes do. My second issue is that although the hotel provides wireless internet access for free (another bonus!), they do this by running about 8 different networks and encouraging guests to roam around until they find a working one. Depending on the location of your room and time of day, some work better than others. I was never able to get a connection with less than 5 tries, more often it was closer to 10, and the same one never worked twice in a row. I never failed to get a connection eventually though. Finally, the computers they have in the business center are a bit antiquated. I merely needed to print out a file that I had brought with me on a USB flash drive. One of the two computer had no USB slots, and the other had a slot but did not recognize my drive when I plugged it in. The front desk graciously called a technician to help me, and he arrived quickly, but spoke no English (I speak no Italian). As it was 9:30 or so in the evening, perhaps he is not the primary person to cover computer issues, and I got the impression that he was anxious to be done with me and my problem. We gave up without getting the printout, and I solved it myself later in a different way. I think things might have gone better if we had had a translator, so I will not judge too harshly based on that one incident. The daily breakfast buffet is quite nice, and restaurant is decent for dinner, but the menu is not as exceptional as everything else about the hotel. Overall I really enjoyed my stay here, and loot forward to returning soon. I recommend it particularly for those interested in a very safe, very convenient location, with a staff that goes out of their way to ensure foreigners enjoy their visits to Rome.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lebanon,CT", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in Rome, Italy!\u201d", "Author": "CtUSAMom", "ReviewID": "UR102022884", "Content": "We were on a tour of Italy and arrived at The Hotel Majestic Roma.

This is certainly a historic hotel and I'm sure a very long time ago during the Belle Epoque era it was the place to be at Rome and the epitome of style and luxury. Now things are a bit different. The hotel tries to retain the Art Nouveau feeling especially in the mirrored small lobby next to the reception area with beautiful emerald green sofas and armchairs and some of the wooden antiques and porcelain vases are truly magnificent and may be regarded as museum quality pieces. The only one elevator is tiny and ancient but blends harmonically with the whole place. The communal reception areas on the first floor are wonderful with beautiful chandelliers, rich fabrics and an atmosphere of a bygone era. It's a pity that they are not located on the ground floor and serving as the main lobby of the hotel. My room was a single, which in other words means tiny, with no views at all except for a stone and brick wall. Nevertheless it was comfortable and tastefully decorated with dark blue and yellow striped drapes, a queen bed with quality linen and a nice clean carpet. The bathroom was white marble (Carrara?) with a big tub and quite spacious compared to the rest of the room. It's a shame that the toiletries provided were very basic and cheap quality. In addition, the flush of the toilet kept running all night long making a very disturbing noise. I imagine that there are much more beautiful rooms at the Majestic but this is clearly a case where you get exactly what you pay for. This is hotel past its prime but still stylish and maybe elegant. I noticed that the guests were mainly old, whispering to each other with a formal attitude which makes the place an absolutely no-no for young couples or even families. The staff at the reception and the bar were professional and moderately polite. There was a general sense of discomfort when circulating within the premises, feeling a bit stiff and formal all the times while thinking that Rome is generally a fun city and the people are mostly carefree and open hearted. I think the hotel obviously tries to keep the usual tourists away and this may be an advantage since you cannot help but notice awful touristy types at other five-star establishments like the Excelsior, also on the same street. In conclusion, I strongly believe that this is a matter of taste. If you like the austere atmosphere and a small taste of early 20th century history this is your place. If you plan to exlore Rome backpacking in shorts, vests and inappropriate jeans start looking elsewhere otherwise you'll be very disappointed and probably dismissed.

Interior of the hotel was very 19th Century (in a good way). Service was very efficient although the restaurant staff could do with smiling a bit!

From arranging for our airport pick-up that made arriving from an overnight flight effortless to taking care of every detail exceptionally well, we couldn't have been more impressed. The rooms were very clean, cool and very quiet. The breakfast buffet that was included with our room was great. Whether we were starting early with a tour of the Vatican Museum (highly recommended) or sleeping late, the breakfast on the terrace was a great way to begin the day. All the hotel staff (front desk, restaurant, consierge and doormen) were very fluent in English which made our stay that much easier. We also found the consierge very helpful. Not only did they know our names after the first introduction, they remembered what they had recommended and were very attentive and interested that things had gone well. The restaurants and tours that the hotel arranged were all high quality and it was obvious the tours and restaurants interacted alot with the hotel as we received outstanding service. I was certainly left with the impression that if things hadn't gone well, there was going to be a follow-up by the hotel. There are lots of restaurants, cafes and bars a close walking distance from the hotel and most major attractions are a short walk and so location was ideal. There was lots to do if you wanted but the hotel is small enough that it is quiet and relaxing when that is what you want as well.

The entire room was a blinding white, except for the blood red curtains. They kept out the light really well in the mornings though. The room was a decent size and we were greeted with a plate of fresh fruit, which was quite welcome. There was a lovely breakfast on the patio included in our reservation.

For example there was no cooling (even April can be warm and stuffy) in the room and when the engineer came up to the room he told us in broken English -- air conditioner not working... Only later were we informed by reception that in Italy by law (apparently) no hotels can have airconditioning until May 15th -- very odd indeed, but who knows, it could be true!

A car arrived which meant we had to split and take a cab as well. However the hotel did apologise profusely and these things do happen.. We are a family of 4 and were pleased to get 2 rooms which genuinely interconnected with one door to the corridor and then a small entrance hall leading into the 2 rooms. Decor was slightly odd, sort of modern look but not stark. Our room had a small Juliet balcony overlooking a cafe below ie no view to speak of. We were on first floor and there is traffic noise. A higher floor would be desirable. Breakfast is served at a very attractive roof terrace and the continental breakfast which was included was very decent (pastries, good capuccino etc). Concierge was very user friendly and gave 2 good restaurant recommendations.

Great service, although the main waiter was sometimes moody. Great coffee and very extensive buffet including eggs and bacon. Our stay included one meal at their signature restaurant.

We chose the Majestic hotel due to it's location (towards the top of the city, but not too far to walk to local attractions, restaurants and nightlife), because of the rave reviews I'd read on sites similar to this one and plus their website looked pretty fabulous. Our room was lovely, perfect for just the two of us! Every day, afternoon and evening, the hotel staff made sure our room was kept clean and tidy with fresh towels and when we arrived back from an evening/night out we would find our bed turned down for the night - it's the little touches that make it so special!! Breakfast . . . we only had continental, and if I'm honest I was slightly dissapointed with the limited selection (probably also because I had to walk past the eggs and sausages to get to the food we were allowed!), but I refused to pay the difefrence in cost for the full breakfast - but anyway, the city has so many fabulous restaurants and cafes for lunch and dinner, it didn't make sense to fill up on breakfast. The bar is lovely, but doesn't get busy enough to give it some atmosphere, but nevertheless we enjoyed a G&T before heading out for the evening and were well looked after by the bar staff. Roma as a city is amazing, and I definitely recommend anyone to take a holiday there. I ate some of my favourite meals there - especially at the Hotel Eden - a taste sensation!!! Oh my, still makes me smile thinking about it almost a year on! New Years Eve itself, we watched the fireworks by the Spanish Steps - entertaining, although slightly precarious when locals set off their own fireworks!

I love the Via Veneto for its cafes and ambiance. I will consider another hotel when I visit Rome again. The first room they gave us was nice and quiet. Good size. Bathroom needed a bit of work. When we returned from dinner the A/C was out. It was hot. They sent a man to work on it. He vacumed out the filter and left saying there was nothing he could do. It seemed they had had this problem before. We were ready for bed. So, they moved us to a much larger room after we repacked all of our things. The next room was a stinky smoking room. Everything reaked of smoke, the sheets, towels, everything. Nothing seemed fresh. We had to make do because they had no other rooms and it was late. I slept with a robe over my head and still woke up smelling smoke. I wondered if the room was used as a smoking break room! So, the next morning we talked to them. They said for us to pack our bags, have them ready, and they would move us to our third room. Now, that shouldn't be a problem, but this was our 5th hotel in three weeks. We were tired of all the packing and unpacking. So, when we returned we had another room. Nice actually but next to the service elevator and on the street. It was noisy, very noisy. Hard to take a nap in the afternoon. They tried. They were very nice about our complaints and tried to accomodate. We were being reasonable in our requests for a good, cool, quiet room. One of the problems is that they need to renovate. It is an old hotel and has charm. It's has problems like the shower had only very hot water, no cool. It would run from hot to very hot in intervals.The bathroom was old and faucets rusty. As far as service goes, housekeeping rarely got to our room to clean it before 2:00 or 2:30. We would be returning from a busy morning in Rome and come back to an unmade bed. The bar is nice but a bit stuffy. They did have a nice business center we could use but at times the computers were down. The breakfast was very average. We used a huge amount of Amex points on this hotel and it was truly a disappointment. They were good about making reservations and suggestions but failed to tell us that one of the lunch spots where we had reservations did not allow dress shorts. We walked all the way to Piazza Popolo for lunch to find we couldn't eat there. They made the reservation knowing what we were wearing and were on our way out.

I'm not sure what staff that the previous reviewer encountered but I found all staff here to be efficient and friendly, in particular the senior person on the desk who was very friendly, always had a smile and always willing to help with any problems we had. On the first night myself and some colleagues arrived in late (too late to use the restaurant) but the staff at the bar were all too happy to provide bar food even though they had officially closed the kitchen. The room was superb - very clean (spotless to be precise), spacious with an excellent bathroom. I cannot comment on the restaurant food as we did not dine at the main restaurant, although the food provided for lunch was above the usual standard of corporate catering. The hotel is not first class for facilities and does not have a pool (which is a shame), but overall has a feeling of class about it. The conference rooms are a little threadbare but it sort of adds to the hotel's charm. I would say that it does trade off of it's past of having many famous guests (the hotel bar is scattered with notes from celebs saying how much they enjoyed their stay...). I also can't understand how the previous reviewer can say that it is effectively in the middle of nowhere - sure it isn't right next to the coloseum, but it's only a 5-10 minute walk from most attractions including the shopping areas. Plus taxi's aren't that expensive in Rome (about the only thing that isn't though!). For me walking around Rome is not a chore - it's a beautiful city; I guess it depends on whether you are lazy or not... The only grumble I really have is that the breakfast was way below par. I would not have paid for breakfast had I been paying for the hotel myself.

The location is certainly central to all the usual attractions though in a classier area on the Via Veneto. The hotel itself is very unique and European elegant. In the US, this would be considered a boutique hotel. If you check the hotel's website you will find the rates very expensive, though I found a much more reasonable rate on Expedia. I was assigned a single room on the second floor. The room was by far the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in, even compared to New York City. The view was of an alley and stone wall, though it was a particularly elegant stone wall. Day two of my stay I got a call from the reception desk saying I was being assigned a new room due to some mechanical problem in my current room. This situation was well handled by the hotel staff and I ended up in a much larger room with a better view, so no complaints here. The rooms are very elegant and spotless, with fifteen foot ceilings and crown moldings. Beds are comfortable with high quality linens. There is a mini-bar, but the prices as expected were very high, particularly with adjustment for the Euro. I tried room service one night. Service was quick and polished but the 43 Euro mixed grill was not worth the high price. Bathrooms are mostly marble, but beware the showers which are located in large high bathtubs with strangely rounded bottoms. I nearly slipped and fell several times. The public areas of the hotel are also interesting and unique. The narrow hallways are done in a high gloss white paint and lined with black and white photographs neatly displayed according to the year they were taken. Interesting, but kind of strange for a hotel corridor. The staff were very efficient and attentive, if not somewhat stuffy. Overall, I would recommend this property if you can get a good price on the room, though you will probably end up with one of the smallest rooms available.

We must have looked pathetically downtrodden because we were offered a room to rest in for a few hours until our own room was ready. I could have kissed them! We were led to a very nice room and immediately sunk into a lovely white bed with a fluffy duvet and linen sheets and promptly fell asleep.

The hotel offers these nice little touches that make you feel like you are staying somewhere special. For instance, there is turn down service everynight and the hotel provides a small card with a handwritten summary of the weather forecast for the next day. Via Veneto is a lovely, quiet, tree-lined street, peppered with five-star hotels which have now surpassed the gently fading Majectic. Although it was a little far removed from most of the things you'd want to see (i.e. Vatican City, Colloseum, Piazza Navona) the location does feel like an oasis from a city that can sometimes be a little overwhelming. The subway stop is a few steps away however, and can get you easily, for the cost of 1 euro to most locations, provided that you a prepared to walk a little further. Staff was friendly and courteous to a fault. The bed was a little firm but the linen sheets and comfortable duvet more than made up for it. Our bathroom was quite large, and covered in marble from wall to wall. The shower was excellent. Don't bother with the breakfast at the hotel; there are numerous bars and pizzerias that offer breakfast just outside the door for much less money.

On the way to the hotel from the airport our driver informed us that The Majestic was one of the best hotels in Rome which gave us a reassuring feeling. On arrival the front of house is understated but quite nice and we were welcomed by staff with perfect english who were very pleasant. We were shown to our room (210) on the second floor which is where our disappointment started. The room was small, stuffy and very, very tired. It was nothing like the photo's we had seen on a variety of sites and did not match the decriptions from others on this site. Having seen quotes of full refurbishment with contemporary or art deco styling, we saw none of it really. The styling is a bit odd in the rooms I thought, I have an elderley Aunt who has similar in her conservatory, and I dont find that particularly relaxing either. I went down to the reception and asked very politely for a change of room, it was here that I had my first meeting with a concierge (receptionist was busy)who is best described as 'probably unhappy with his role in life'. I have a feeling he might be the one referred to by a previous reviewer who didnt enjoy his company much either. After he had rolled his eyes and looked down his nose at me for a bit I moved back to the receptionist who was now free. He was very helpful and offered me two other rooms to look at on the fourth floor at the rear of the hotel. The first room was no better than 210 so we moved to 424 which was much larger and in slightly better order, although there were still a few bits that were broken, missing or wonky. I returned to the reception and agreed to take 424 for the duration of our stay. He was very pleased and agreed to only charge me an extra 100 Euros per night for the privelege. After some light negotiation we agreed 50 Euros per night. The beds - I can confirm as with other reviewers that the beds are indeed quite hard and a bit dippy in the middle. The hotel has only one lift which is centrally located just off the lobby area. It is one of those older style ones with the open shaft which is nice to look at but quite noisy, especially at night if your room is next to the shaft, as we were. There are two options for dining in the hotel, there is a restaurant on the second floor which looked nice enough but we didnt try it. (Tie required for gents). On the ground floor is a brasserie / piano bar which was empty on the night we ate there. Service was excellent but again it did not make up for the food which was average. Personally, if I go to a restaurant and can cook better food at home without much fuss then they need to try harder (and I can assure you I am not a great cook). The brasserie has lots and lots of signed photos by the rich and famous who have stayed at the hotel and make for interesting viewing. Sadly, I think those days are gone along with the stars who probably now stay at the Hotel De Russie. Whilst we are on the subject of food - the all day breakfast can be served in your room or in the restaurant. Either way the cost is 45 EUROS per person....!!! Turn right out of the hotel instead and go to the cafe just after the book shop. They do great toasties and for 2 they only charge 4 Euros The best thing about this hotel, and in my view the only real redeeming feature, is the staff. They were polite, courteus, helpful and efficient throughout our stay. Even the concierge I mentioned earlier warmed a bit, well a little bit. Big thumbs up for Claudo in reception who was very friendly and helpful. In summary, this is a nice enough hotel so long as you know what you are getting. What you do not get is 5 star as listed. At best this is a low end 4 star for comfort and style. It is too expensive for the quality offered and I think rides too much on the fact that it is listed with 'The Leading Hotels of the World' Group. Having stayed at others also listed with the group, it is our opinion that The Majestic is certainly not worthy of this accolade.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cMajestic is majestic!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4113494", "Content": "Absolutely great.

If you can stomach its high price tag, the Majestic is convienently located in a safe and highly touristy area. The location offers easy access to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and a Metro (subway) Stop. The rooms are a good size by European standards but by no means huge. Bathrooms are well stocked with complimentary toiletries and equiped with bath/shower, toilet and bidet. The bed is rather firm and you will either be fine with it or hate it, I did not have a problem with it. The in-room minibar prices are rediculous, as in most hotels. Overall the rooms are nicely appointed. The top-notch service is what makes the Majestic really shine. I flew in during the early afternoon and arrived at the hotel before check-in time. I knew my room would not be ready, but had bags I needed to drop off. Not only did the staff attend to my bags, but they went out of their way to apologize for not having the room prepared (early), sending a complimentary fruit basket up to my room when I did check-in (about an hour of sightseeing later). The concierge was very helpful throughout my stay, providing sightseeing and dinner ideas and booking me a luxury car and driver for a day, posting a letter to the states, and generally answering all my questions about the city. All the while being very friendly and without a hint of the \"holier than thou\" attitude which is sometimes found. Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Majestic and would love to return.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "winchester, hampshire, england", "Title": "\u201cAll a 5 star hotel should be\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3421364", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights over the weekend the new pope was enthroned.

When the Vatican announced that the Pope's funeral would take place on our first full day in Rome we were rather concerned about service at the hotel and how we would manage to see Rome during this period! Everything, however, was just fine, the hotel rooms had all the facilities a 5 star hotel should have, the staff were helpful and friendly and although Rome was busy we managed to see the sights and even got into the Vatican the day after the funeral. Our package did not include breakfast which was a shame, as the hotel charges quite a lot for this, and so we had a breakfast at a cafe just down the road. Also the hotel, like many European ones, do not provide tea/coffee making facilities in your room so it's wise to take a travel kettle! We would definitely recommend this hotel to people looking for a good room, comfortable beds (maybe we like hard mattresses!) and in a very convenient position for sightseeing. It's within walking distance of the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain and many other things. The Metro is minutes away and buses, including the 110 open bus tour, pass the hotel.", "Date": "April 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, UK", "Title": "\u201cAmazing place\u201d", "Author": "wuthering", "ReviewID": "UR3315409", "Content": "The Majestic deserves its 5* rating!

The beds were comfortable and seemed to be just like the beds in other 4 or 5 star European Hotels visited on this trip. The hotel is within walking distance of many attractions, restaurants and best of all- it is one half block from the Metro (Red Line)! The Metro is great for getting around- it is easy and once you get the hang of it, you'll appreciate the short walk to and from the hotel. We changed hotels during our stay due to the hotel being sold out for a part of our stay. We changed to the Mariott Roma ( a few blocks away) and immediately appreciated the personal touches of the Majestic staff. We decided to visit Pompeii and the staff of the hotel walked us to a travel agent about 3/4 block away to book train tickets. Talk about service.
