The high-rise center is less than 1km away.Everything in the hotel expect the breakfast room is quite old and not in perfect condition. The double room we stayed in was not very big. I'd recommend this hotel even it's condition is not the best and the railway station area is not the best area.There's free Internet PC in the hotel.The breakfast is very good.Price and quality ratio is very good.", "Date": "Aug 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR913544031", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Mynksteri"}, {"Content": "Very pleasant hotel We stayed at the Carlton for four nights in Feb 2007. We were quite pleased with the hotel. Smallish rooms (not a problem). Very clean and tidy. Very friendly English speaking staff at the front desk. Comfortable bed, good bathroom, good water pressure and lots of hot water. Wireless internet. Adequate breakfast provided. Fridge in room (no tea or coffee making in rooms). All in all good value and convenient location just across road from railway station. Close to Frankfurt red-light district, but not at all a problem. Would thoroughly recommend hotel to friends.", "Date": "Feb 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR187415409", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "johnrod"}, {"Content": "Very good value I stayed at the Carlton for two nights in early December, 2006. The price was excellent for a room in downtown Frankfurt, very convenient to the train station and not far from the downtown shopping district. The room was small, but more than adequate for my needs as a single traveler. It had a mini-fridge, which was nice, and there was a grocery store just across the street where I bought food and drinks. This is a busy section of town, so there was some street noise, but I think one would experience that in any hotel in this district. The hotel provides wireless service, which didn't seem to be working during my stay, or maybe it was just my computer. I was able to steal a signal from the hotel next door, so I never complained. They have an excellent continental breakfast included in the price (pastries, cereal, fresh fruit and vegetables, yoghurt, cold cuts, the usual German breakfast fare). The dining room was clean and the staff were very attentive to keeping the food fresh and available. The staff at the front desk were extremely polite and friendly, always greeting me with a smile and courteous small talk-- the young woman working the day shift was particularly pleasant and helpful. I booked the room through an online travel agency for 40 Euro per night, which I thought was an excellent price for this location and level of service. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR333100150", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vonschwind"}, {"Content": "Not bad, fair location Although this hotel is ideally located to the train station, it is too close to the undesirable section of town, ie. sex shops, etc. Some walking distance to touristy sites, mainly in financial distract.
