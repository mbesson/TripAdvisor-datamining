It's a prime location in the heart of midtown, and next to a subway station, for an extremely modest price. Although definitely not fancy, this basic facility provides a fully furnished one bedroom apartment with a sofabed in the living room for barely over $100 per night. It's certainly modest, but very clean and safe. My last stay with them, the sofabed was not really usable, because of a terrible mattress, but they apologized,offering a foam mattress pad and explaining that the sofas were already scheduled for replacement. If you are looking for a Hyatt, forget it, but if you want simple, clean, roomy accommodations at a bargain price, this is it. I have stayed with them multiple times and have never been disappointed. Note that my \"sleep quality rating\" was based on the double bed, not the sleeper sofa, which would have been a '1'. Also, the bed was perfectly comfortable, but I reserve '5' for the 4 or 5 star hotels with luxury pillows & mattresses.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milano, Italy", "Title": "\u201cFilthy room, inept Manager (Carlos).

The man downstairs sent us a hosekeeper who said she wasn't working there and she just dropped off three towels (which we soon found out were dirty,too), telling us that we had to make our own beds. A friend of us living in NYC called the property Management in NYC at 212-6168497, and after being disconnected while speaking with Dan, he spoke with Carlos, who put him on hold for over ten minutes. He called back and spoke with Scott, who said Carlos wasn't availabe; however, Scott assured that the room would be made right away. We left and when we came back at 11:30pm, the room was still filthy and unmade. We were offered to take a cab (at our exepense) and go to another apartment on 73rd Street, which we declined, because it was late, we were exhasuted and we feared that that place might be just as dirty. This morning our friend Marco called Carlos, who said he was still investigating this matter (he shouldn't apply for a job at the local Police station, I would say). I asked him what investigation he had been making and he told me that he wanted to speak with the people at the Times Square \"Palace\" (no name was ever more fitting). When Marco let him know that we were leaving in a few minutes, and that we expected a full refund, he said he would call back in a few minutes, which he didnt. Marco persisted and called back, only to hear Carlos say the \"investigation\" had produced the following result: the housekeeper said that she has cleaned the room and therefore there was no refund. Since no one had bothered to come and check the condition of the room when we complained, we feel we were treated as liars not worthy of any help and we strongly believe that a lazy and incompetent man like Carlos should not be working in the hotel business.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201c73rd st apartments, great price great location\u201d", "Author": "neashley", "ReviewID": "UR95587972", "Content": "My 12 year old daughter and I stayed at the Woogo Ap's on 73rd st rm 1408.

I recommend Beacon Wine and Spirits for a great selection of wine. They are across from Fairway Markets. It was a close walk to Central Park 10-15 min maybe? Also you can grab a hot dog at the famous Gray's Papaya across the street. The only thing I would say I didn't like is we went in March and it was freezing and they kept the apartment too warm.

There was less of an aroma in the bathroom, but it had a pipe running through that made it terribly hot. On our second morning the toilet overflowed and the shower broke, it took forever to get sorted, i had to physically go downstairs to get somebody to come and sort the flood out. The receptionist had turned his nose up at my request but luckily a manager of some sort was passing through and over heard and ordered immediate action much to my delight.

My family and I (me, hubby, then 3yr old son, and my 63/65 yr old parents) stayed at Woogo apt on W53/8th Ave over Xmas n New Year 2006. We had a 2 bed apt which was EXACTLY like the pics on the website. I booked it almost 12 months in advance and all they took from me was $100 deposit. The balance was paid on arrival - after I checked the apt. Woogo was recommended to me by a friend of my brother , who had stayed at the Lincoln Centre apts and thought highly of them. It was clean, tidy, with a stocked fridge, tinned food on the counter top (all in date) and great views over the Hudson. We arrived 3 hours late, after 10pm and I was panicking abit, but no fear. The manager had left our details at the front desk and our key was awaiting us. Yes, the office on floor 14 was like a bombsite, but staff were reasonably helpful. They arranged our transfer back to the airport. And we could leave our luggage in the office (along with many, many others!) on our last day. Having stayed in New York hotels on several occasions, I would recommend the Woogo apt to families who want space - if you've ever been cooped up in a hotel room with a hyper toddler you'll know what I'm talking about!! we had ample space and the living room was great for my son to play in (just move the glass table out of the way) and equally great for grandparents to relax in while babysitting without having to be in the same room as child. TV, phone and all equipment worked. We have just returned from yet another trip to NY and this time stayed in Novotel (as apt being converted and my first choice Belvedere not available - great hotel, stayed there 3 times) and we all agreed that apt living was infinitely better than a hotel room. I do believe these apts are no longer in use unfortunately, being converted into condos. At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. If you want luxury then pay the prices.

After waiting the 21 days and seeing no refund, I wrote them and said that if i didn't see the refund immediately, I would be calling my credit card and putting a fraud alert on the charge and have the charge revoked. I did get the $1900 refunded almost right away, but have yet to see the $500. i think it is a scam that they charge you that much just to make the reservation; they then keep it for a while so they can probably collect the interest off of it.", "Date": "April 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cBeware...Uge Scam..Worst Experience of My Life\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4956394", "Content": "WHAT A HORROR story. we checked in for a weeks stay 2/5/06, around 10 pm of the night we checked in a notice was slid under the door that woogo had surrendered all 110 rooms that they had in the Herald Towers. The notice was stamped by a notary, and said that if we continued to occupy the room after 5pm on 2/6/06 that we would be trespassing. As soon as the Woogo office opened in the morning I went down there...along with About 100 other people, and was told that it was a scam, not to worry. When we returned to the room around 4 pm the manager of the Herald Towers took us into his office, and explained that Woogo had indeed surrendered the rooms, as they were subletting for periods of less than 30 days, and that violated the agreement that they had w/ The Herald Towers. I again contacted the Woogo office, and Travel Now who I had booked through. Oscar, the Woogo rep came up to our room, told us not to leave it was a \"scam\", and that he Would be back in about 10 minutes. In the mean time a representative of the Herald Towers arrived at our room with a New York City police officer who escorted us out of the building. The gentleman did give us a $20 bill for a cab. My god...my co worker and I felt like a cheap prostitute!!!!. Woogo is a HUGE sacm....we paid for a weeks reservation, and were literally thrown out on the street in New York, as were at least the occupants of the other 109 rooms.

We stayed one week in February 2006. Having made my way to the 14th Floor of this apartment block to the WooGo office (office=untidy apartment rooms) I was given the keys to a 7th Floor apartment. On walking in our faces dropped. It lacked any sort of wow factor. But the place grew on us and we were very comfortable there. It was a spacious two bed apartment with a living room with a sofa bed. Four of us stayed there and it never felt crowded. Plenty of cupboard space. The bathroom felt old (the building is old come to think of it). It looked old and tired but perfectly adequate. No more than that though. The kitchenette was ok for making cuos of tea or coffee or for getting a drink from the fridge. In New York you will not want to be cooking for yourself so the kitchen was not needed but if it was then...no. The apartment was heated. Too well heated. I never thought I would use air-con to cool a room in Winter (the windows are sealed and don't open). We felt safe there. The doors had double locks. There was a concierge at ground floor. The place is very conveniently situated on the corner of 53rd and 8th Avenue. It is less than 5 minutes walk to Broadway and about another 5 minutes to Times Square. The people who work for WooGo are friendly and accommodating. If I have a criticism they promise more than they can deliver. Could they get me a taxi to the airport. No. But there are plenty passing by outside anyway.

No couch. Our room was basically clean, although it had construction \"residue\" along edges and corners and a very strong amonia cleaner smell that never went away. 2 burner stove top, no pots or pans (just potholders!). Fridge under burners where the door kept swinging open due to the slant in the floor. Small table, but useless as it held the microwave. DIshes were not microwave safe (lots of sparks). Coffee pot - no filters. Small night stand which held the TV. No where to put ANYTHING except the floor. No heat control, room was HOT so we slept with the window (no screen) open. Sheets were clean but so thin you could see the uncovered mattress. Mattress too small for the frame. I called ahead to let them know we would be later (12pm) but it took us 45 minutes to find someone to give us keys. All the doors were locked and no one was around. We stood outside knocking...not much fun. I never did find the exercise room. There is no lobby. For the money (we paid less than 100 a night) I don't think you can do better-we at least had a private bathroom. You just can't expect it to be anything like the pictures or what is advertised. Don't plan to lounge around in your \"apartment\" because we had to sit on the bed and step over all our stuff to get to the door. It was very small. Area is safe, location great, and our neighbor was nice. We are pretty good at rolling with the punches and just laughed and had a good time anyway. I can see though how it would be easy to have a really bad experiance so we will not stay there again. I have a problem with any company that mis-represents itself on such a large scale. They would do better to simply be honest. I have included pictures taken from every angle around the room.
