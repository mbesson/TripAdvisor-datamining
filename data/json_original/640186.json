We were very impressed. It didn't have a lot of extras, but the room and the rest of the hotel was immaculate. The free breakfast was not very good--there were four or five set menu items you could order, one western, the rest Chinese. It was inexpensive and definitely worth it if you are willing to stay a little out of the way.", "Date": "Feb 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR610004011", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Tianjin"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d640186-r7379510-Holiday_Inn_Express_Shangdi-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "640186", "Price": "$66"}}
