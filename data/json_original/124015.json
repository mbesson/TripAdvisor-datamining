SLEEP IN YOUR CAR.\u201d", "Author": "JBDC40", "ReviewID": "UR71199104", "Content": "This is the most horrible dump of a hotel I've ever had the displeasure of staying in. The general appearance of the entrance way and parking lot makes the property appear to be a remnant of a burned-out urban strip b/c the lot is sort of empty and torn up with weeds growing through the asphalt of part of it. The lobby was deceptively well-appointed. The check-in process took over 50 minutes when there were 3 people in front of me checking in, one of which was making incredibly intricate arrangements to rent multiple rooms for 2 weeks, while paying for some of the rooms for just 2 nights, others for just one, with more payment to follow. Another guest came to the desk and complained twice that his key was mis-programmed and he couldn't get into his room. This guy was very vocal and complained loudly that the hotel needed to get maintenance on-sight to fix the key programming machine and was convincing the people in line in front of me that their keys weren't going to work. The one woman working at the desk was trying to keep her cool but there was NO ONE helping her. She called the manager twice and told him she needed help and she needed someone from maintenance. The manager never showed up but after about 15 minutes some guy who evidently was from maintenance showed up although he did not look like an official maintenance person at all. When I finally got to the front of the line I asked for a first floor, Non-Smoking room b/c I had lots of luggage to bring into the room but none were available. I was assigned to a second floor room to which I went, and luckily the key worked but the room REEKED of smoke AND the toilet wouldn't flush. I went back to the front desk and asked for another room, but those same 2 people who had taken so much time to rent all those rooms for two weeks while I was in line previously WERE BACK and taking another 15 minutes to partially pay for some of the rooms for portions of the 2 weeks. While I waited in line, the woman who had been in front of me initially waiting to check-in came back to request another room too because there were \"bugs in the bathroom\" of her room. During this return for another room poor Allison was at the front desk STILL and STILL had no help. So when I finally got to the front of the line I told her about the problems with the first room and she assigned me to another, which now magically was on the 1st floor where there were no such rooms available only 20 minutes previously. I went to the newly assigned room, where the toilet flushed, but although there was a non-smoking icon on the door this room also STANK to high-heaven! I had been driving for 7 hours and was exhausted so I unloaded the car figuring that all the rooms must be just as terrible. I then went immediately to CVS for air freshener and neutralizer to make it tolerable. One of the wall lights didn't work; the floor lamp behind the chair was bent and stood at an angle almost propped up by the upholstered chair; the curtains and sheers were stained and torn and not hung regularly on the rod; there was a huge brown smear of something on the wall above the mirror and below some nasty stained ceiling tiles; the wall-mounted iron/ironing board holder was halfway hanging off the wall with one of the screws not present; the ironing board cover was stained; the bathroom had dead bugs on the floor behind the door and tons of cigarette burns on the edge of the tub; there was no drain stopper and looking into the drain I could see hair and string hanging on the cross bars inside the drain; there was only one washcloth; the lightbulb hardware under the shade of one of the bedside lamps was bent so badly that the bulb was touching the shade creating a fire hazard; and the carpet was totally sticky. And that was just the room! The grounds and general appearance of the larger property were equally as abysmal. The entry parking lot was very sketchy, as I mentioned, and the parking lot around back and on the sides of the building was in poor condition; there were cigarette butts all over the parking lot; there were two porch chairs in a parking space in the back as if some people were living there; there was litter everywhere; the laundry room was dark and in disarray, including one washer/dryer that was totally disassembled and askew from the wall; the carpeting in the foyer area outside the laundry room was torn up; the grass in the courtyard around the pool was un-mowed and full of weeds and cigarette butts; the concrete walkways were old and cracked and in one section it looked as if some kind of excavation was taking place with a big pile of concrete pieces piled up; and there was a wooden desk sitting out in the middle of the courtyard in the weeds. There was also a very old, faded piece of kids playground equipment out there but I wouldn't have let any child of mine climb on it. I don't know how this place could be redeemed without a TOTAL makeover. This Ramada was a remarkable dump except for the lobby. And I have pictures if you'd care to see them. I would never stay in this place again. It was so filthy that my travel companion and I were scared to even try out the pool or the restaurant. It was THAT dirty. And instead of parking near my room I parked my car directly under a streetlight in the empty front parking lot which was visible from a major road. I was surprised no one tried to break into it.

The coaches found this hotel and didn't think it was too bad and they offered us a deal. It was, in fact, not a deal at all. Check in took a good 30 minutes. After a softball game us 10 girls wanted to relax. When we got in our rooms we were grossed out. We decided to go to the pool. Once again grossed out. We needed some towels, none to be found by the pool. The phone by the pool worked, suprisingly, and we called for towels only to be told that we had to come get them. When we asked for 10 towels, the 16 year old girl said shed try to find that many. Back in our rooms no one would sit on the floor, it looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks. Showering scared me. As one girl said she felt like she was in the movie Psycho. The tub was dirty and there was a hole in the ceiling. That night a couple girls and I didn't sleep under the blankets. We didn't even look under there. Then at about 4 in the morning my roommates and I woke hearing someone walking past our room back and forth for about an hour. I also should mention that people live there and stink up the buliding with their smoke. Probably why someone was up at 4 am, most likely high. We woke up and went downstairs for breakfast to find a few hard donuts,orange juice ,and coffee that had been there since we got there. Then we all got together and decided that we want to change hotels. We had planned on staying there 4 nights and only stayed one. We changed to the Super 8 down the street. We payed more, but the move was well worth it. We only used 5 rooms and later were charged for 7. We called to handle this and never recieved a call back. 3 star hotel??? I think not.

There is an outdoor pool which was old and dirty. A indoor pool that was small and a little cleaner but overall dangerously outdated. The jacuzzi isn't very warm, but it was clean. Sauna? Never could find it. The finess room was closed down. The \"game room\" has 3 arcade games. Now to the actual room.....the carpet is dirty and worn. stained is putting it mildly. The tub was full of mildew. The shower curtain was too. The Tv remote didn't work. The blanket on the bed had cigarette burns all over it.....which we stripped from the bed. I can say the sheets were clean. I actually bought lysol to spray the room. I would have NEVER stayed in this room if every other hotel in Indy wasn't already booked due to the Nascar race. I could go on and on complaining, but trust me this is no 3 star hotel. It is a run down glorified drug dealing motel. It appears that there are regulars that live at the grand view.

I called the next day, got a desk clerk and asked to speek to Anna. The first clerk gave me the time to call Ann for the next day. In which I did. No Anna. I began to question the second clerk about my pillow. She informed me that house keeping had the pillow, down to the description of the pillow. This peocedure resulted in NO responce from Anna. Now I e-mailed to the motel telling them the story not once but twice. As of this date NO responce. Now my wife and myself are planning a four day trip to Indianapolis IN in May of next year.

I will start with the most recent. I attended this hotel July 18-20. Complaints first: I was able to receive early check-in. Upon entering my room, I noticed a damp musky order. I borrowed some air freshener from housekeeping. The last time I stayed at this hotel, I travel with a group (10/02) and we had the same problem with some of the rooms. The thermostat was not working. They figured that no one would use it in the summer, but it was so cold in the room, due to the fan being on full blast prior to our arrival, we wanted it to warm up fast. Two years earlier, I remembered that my friend had been in this room, 209 I believe and the heat did not work then. The room was old, stains on ceiling, spots on walls, and we had only one set of towels to use. I called front desk and they told me to call housekeeping. I left my request on voice mail and the towels were never received. I ended up doing like the previous poster and getting towels from the front desk. The buffett that was available was not good. Save some money and go across the street to Dennys or Bob Evans. On the previous occasion we encountered a rude waitress, thank God she seemed to be gone. We requested a do not disturb sign and placed it on the door. When we left the hotel, we still had it on. Housekeeping entered our room, and lo and behold brought the missing towels a whole 24hrs later. The outdoor, indoor, and jacuzzi pools were very nice. We heard the front desk deny early check in because they were fully booked and needed to clean rooms-not true, and housekeeping really didn't do a great job of cleaning the ones that they supposedly had cleaned. Since I am not high maitenence, I will stay at this hotel again, but mainly for two reasons the price and the shuttle drivers. The shuttle drivers are so friendlt they make you want to come back again. The fact that this hotel has shuttle service is a great assett. They will take you anywhere for free, and offer to pick you up. We arrived by Greyhound in Indianapolis and they even picked us up then. Much cheaper than a cab and less annoying then \"Event\" downtown traffic. The pool table, club, and pools are a great asset as well.
