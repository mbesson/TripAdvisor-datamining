The room was average, nothing special about it. Old TV and furnishings could use updating. Overall great location downtown for what we needed the room for. We were on the 10th floor and could hear the one of the air vents squeaking on top of the building all day and night. The tub could have been cleaner as there were several black hairs found attached to the plug in the drain. We were initially worried about bed bugs in the area - but we did a check before moving into the room and didn't find any or any evidence. Overall this location was good, and quality of the room was okay for the price paid. Not the best room for the price I have ever stayed in though...

The beds were really comfortable and whenever we asked for extra supplies of coffee, creamer etc; we were readily supplied with however much we wanted. The breakfast admittedly was basic but at least we were not charged extra for it. The hotel is well-situated for the tube station on Yonge/Bloor.

Staff were mostly friendly, although one or two were less than friendly. On arrival, we had a reservation issue whereby they could not find us in the system even with a confirmation sheet in hand. We were there on business and were to stay almost a week, and it took them several days to get it straightened out with the proper rate....the rate had apparently changed, and they did not want to honor the rate as noted on our confirmation. Additionally, until they straightened it out, they put us on a day-to-day basis, which meant our computerized room key kept expiring at the proposed check-out time and we had to stand in line to get it re-programmed. Lines were often long, even with only one or two guests waiting as there was usually only one desk clerk on duty....there appeared to be numerous \"situations\" that often required lengthy dealings. One last comment, there was complimentary coffee available in the lobby area; however, other than early morning, it always seemed to be empty. On two occasions when I asked if it was going to be refilled, I was told that it would be \"shortly,\" or \"when we get a chance.\" After waiting 15 minutes, I gave up on one occasion and came back an hour later....still was not done. On the second occasion, the clerk seemed to speak with a bit of an attitude, so I didn't bother to wait. Three of the clerks I spoke with said they had just started, and were there less than two weeks, and did not know how to answer certain questions, or how to deal with some situations.

I have read all the good and bad reviews before arrival so I was not expecting much, but since I was only going to be here for two nights and the price is cheap, I'll live with it. The bad. Much like some of the negatibve reviews indicated, this hotel is cheap in almost every single way - from the condition of the room, floor, decor to facilities, you name it. They call this a 3-star hotel but it certainly feels more like a 2-star or perhaps even 1.5 star by some people's standard. The only \"polished\" area is the hotel lobby so it is easy to get a false impression. I was put on the 10th floor where the hallway looked old, dark and somewhat filthy so I was a bit concerned about the room. However, I was not as displeased as I thought I would be when I walked into the guestroom - the room actually is quite spacious and the beds are clean. Yes it is an older room with absolutely no frill and the bathroom is cramped, but for 95 CAD a night with free internet during the high season, this room is acceptable. I guess you get what you pay for after all. Now the good. Just to be fair, this hotel is in a fantastic location, only 1.5 block away from the Bloor/Yonge subway station, less than one block from Church/Wellesley Village and about 100 feet from Yonge St. Tons of shops and eateries around the area - everything is just winthin easy walking distance. The Toronto subway system is very simple to figure out and runs along Yonge St. Hence any hotel locates on or right off Yonge St. is a big plus. BTW, if you drive into town, use the parking garage across the street which will I believe will cost you less than the hotel parking. I agree with many people this hotel is definitely not the most ideal. But if you are looking for a hotel in a fantastic location with a bargain price and basically just a clean comfortable room/bed to sleep in, this is really not a terrible choice as some people suggested here.

The rooms are not \"newly renovated.\" The surprise on the faces of the clerks when I asked for a different room to meet this bill was palpable. They thought I had the wrong website and hotel. Yes, there were a few updates. The bathroom was relatively new as well as the wallpaper. The beds were fabulous. No one would describe the \"room\" as \"newly renovated.\" Nor is it well-maintained. A light fixture was broken in the room and a electrical socket literally hanging out of the wall, mold was in the bathtub, the floor was badly warped in spots, the door had to be shoved to close, and the air conditioner literally fell to pieces when I made an adjustment to the vent (which gave me a good laugh). Yes, the bathrooms are miniscule but we knew that ahead of time. As to location, it is a mixed bag. The immediate area is very seedy, with a lot of strip joints. True, it is not the fault of the hotel, but don't look straight ahead when you walk out of the front door or you will see one strip joint across the street. On the other hand, around the corner was the theatre with the Sound of Music. And it IS only a few blocks from Yorkville and the Royal Ontario Museum. It is not \"close by\" many of the other locations mentioned on the website, unless you want to walk a long, long way (we exhausted our teens the first day when we tried), or take the subway (WHICH SAVED US BECAUSE THEY ARE WONDERFUL & FIXED LOW PRICED FOR FAMILIES ON WEEKENDS!) or a taxi. Don't expect any benefit from any promotion with a \"free breakfast.\" It was literally dark water coffee and old toast in the Japanese Restaurant that is part of the hotel. The staff of the restaurant was sullen. It was almost insulting. I would never eat dinner in this restaurant based on the \"breakfast\" experience. The front desk staff, if they could be deemed \"concierge,\" had virtually no knowledge of how to get anywhere in Toronto or of the tourist spots, though they were very polite and tried to be helpful. However, the hotel discount tickets for ROM and other spots were wonderful. We had a excellent package to see the Dead Sea Scrolls. If you check in early enough to get one of the few coveted parking spots with in and out privileges, it is very convenient. Be careful for the bottom of your car over that bump!

The location was great, only 1 block form Yonge & Bloor. We were glad for that because it was very cold so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to walk far. I was a little nervous about this place based on previous reviews but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a cheap room in a good location and go in with low expectations it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not bad at all. We tried to reserve parking when we booked but they said it is first come-first served because the lot is small. They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kidding! Getting in and out with a mini van was an adventure. The parking cost was $19 but they let us leave the car there from 9pm until 6pm the next day. The parking system is weird: you have to check in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nowhere to legally park or stop while you do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then drive to the parking entrance and use the phone on the wall to call the front desk to let you in. The garage is tiny, probably fits about 20 cars. There is a large public garage across the street too if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no room left. The main lobby is nice, looks like it has been renovated. Service at the front desk was very good. The clerk gave my colleague and me rooms on the 7th floor. When I checked into mine it was overly warm and smelled a little musty. I turned off the heat as best I could and opened the window even though it was minus16c outside. I left it open all night and was still a little warm. There are 2 small beds with older linens, a tv on a stand, dresser, table, 2 chairs. The room was pretty big but the bathroom was absurdly tiny. The tub was barely a tub at all. For one person it was enough room. It was relatively clean but this is an older hotel and not exactly fancy. Anyone looking for more than the basic amenities should go elsewhere. My colleague didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have as much luck with her room. It was about 30 degrees C in there and reeked of cigarette smoke even though this was a non-smoking floor. Due to the temperature and the smell it was disgusting and uninhabitable. She went down to the lobby and the clerk switched her to the 8th floor to a less stinky room and she was satisfied with that. The elevator is very old and lurch-y but works. There is a sushi/teppanyaki restaurant in the hotel that advertised breakfast. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother. There are hundreds of restaurants nearby where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be better off. There is a continental breakfast buffet for $6.95 or a bunch of odd menu choices for table service (Huge \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast but no a la carte eggs). For some reason the server added a $1.00 service charge to each bill. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask about it but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave a tip either. The ambiance was unexpectedly nice and it might be ok for lunch or dinner but breakfast was not their strength. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a tight budget. It was only $79 for the night and the location is really excellent, but you get what you pay for.

We have stayed there two previous times before with no problems, however this hotel chain has definitely gone downhill over the years. When we walked into our guest room after checking in, we were stuck to the floor ... literally. There were sticky spots all thru out. Not only was the carpet sticky, the bathroom did not pass for clean either. However, it was a busy weekend for this hotel as it was Pride Weekend in Toronto, so my Girlfriend and myself put towels on the carpet so we didn't get stuck, and cleaned the bathrooms ourselves. Wasn't too big of a deal, however definitely not what you would expect when walking into a hotel room. However, this isn't the main complaint that we have regarding this hotel. Our problems arose from the lack of customer service that this hotel showed when Customer service should have been the priority. On our second day there, we happened to get stuck in the elevator between the lobby and first floor. Altogether, we had 9 people in the elevator, capacity on license was 12. None of us blame the hotel for the elevator breaking, however the actions taken by the staff from the time the alarm button was pushed to the time of our checkout the following day are their own faults. First and foremost, we had to press and hold the alarm button for minutes before finally the front desk manager came to see what was going on. He then went back to his desk to call Maintenance, which we were advised would be approx. a 40minute wait. Others that came into the hotel went to the front desk and advised them that with 9 people stuck in an elevator on a day where temperature was in the 30's was unacceptable... that he needed to call Emergency services... This was then done by front desk. During this time, the people in the elevator were resourceful enough to find a lever that opened the bottom door up so that we at least had air. The manager was DEFINITELY neglect in not pointing this out to us. He should have been aware of all procedures that should be followed in an emergency situation. We had to pass our room key thru the bottom crack to people down below who then walked up the four flights to our room for water for us, as again...it was very hot and there was NINE people in there. After they returned with drinks for us, the manager then came to the elevator with FOUR bottles of water. Hmmm, Four bottles, for nine people... LOL You gotta be kidding me! We waited for the fire department, who showed up about 30 minutes into this. They finally got the door above us opened so that we could crawl up and out. However, we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the hotel to FIND a ladder... Once we were out, 7 of us went to our room in the hotel. The manager did not even once contact our room to make sure everyone was o.k. Definitely Not customer service. On day of checkout, the same manager was working front desk. As we approached, he asked us how our stay was!!!!!! ( Didn't even recognize us...) When advised that we were stuck in his elevator the day prior, he asked us \"Which time?\" Again, failing to show any customer service on his part. He told me what my bill was, and was advised by us that that was not acceptable. We were not going to pay full price, not after the lack of concern shown by the hotel. We were guests, we paid for a service, and definitely did not receive it. He argued with us that he wasn't able to do anything, I advised him that something would need to be done. After arguing back and forth, he finally said he would give us 50% off .. I said, 50% off both nites, meaning one nite would be free, he said \"No, only off Saturday nite.\" He then advised me that there were 12 people in the elevator and that's why it got stuck. We let him know that we had been in the elevator long enuff to count the people numerous times, and there were 9 of us. Although, even if there had been 12, the license on the elevator itself stated capacity was TWELVE!!!!! Therefore, even if he was correct, we should have still been fine. (Day of check out tho, there were signs posted at elevator saying only 6 at a time... handwritten.) We ended up leaving as we didn't appreciate being told we were liars...as well as we didn't appreciate his lack of respect for us, his paying guests. The day after we got home, we then sent off a lengthy email to the hotel as well as to the Comfort Hotels main website letting them know of our experience. After waiting three days, we still had heard nothing. We then forwarded the same email to not only the original recipients, but to also three other email addresses found off other websites for the Comfort Hotel Chains. We then received a response telling us that the email was being directed to the proper department and that we would be hearing something shortly from them. Which, we did. We received an email asking for mailing address and phone numbers. We responded with the information that was requested and heard nothing again from them. We then forwarded all the emails back, advised them that the Comfort definitely is not Customer Service oriented hotel, and asked when something else would be heard. We then received another email stating that it was back in the hands of the hotel where we stayed and that we should expect to receive something in the mail. We were elated when 3 days later we did receive a letter informing us that they were going to rebate us the additional money that we had paid for the Saturday nite. Giving us one nite free after all this hassle. This was just a form letter, and now... over a week later, and a voicemail and another email sent still nothing has been heard. Very poor customer service. Please be forewarned, and stay elsewhere! The Comfort Hotel would possibly learn from the dictionary definition of GUEST... \u00e2\u20ac\u201cnoun 1. a person who spends some time at another person's home in some social activity, as a visit, dinner, or party. 2. a person who receives the hospitality of a club, a city, or the like. 3. a person who patronizes a hotel, restaurant, etc., for the lodging, food, or entertainment it provides.

Definitely not worth paying to stay.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara Falls, NY", "Title": "\u201cToronto Favorite\u201d", "Author": "yqq990", "ReviewID": "UR14353602", "Content": "Stayed here twice in the last six months.

There are lots of coffee places in the area that we tried for breakfast - we didn't choose to go to the restraunt downstairs from the hotel but ventured out instead. Restraunts along Yonge as well - easy to walk to. I'll add this is a gay friendly area too. While there are adult bookstores in the area, and a nude dancing parlor across the street (not a brothel as someone mentioned, and its set back quite a ways so its not in your face) we felt quite safe in the area. There is nearby shopping and a walk thru the park is lovely. Excellent location. You'll find indoor basement parking - it was $19 a night for us, but just be aware there are only 20 spaces. Bring your smallest car too - its a little tight. I did notice a big public garage across the street and I suspect (but do check) if they fill you can park there as well. Beds are very comfortable.

He shouted out from the other side of the door that he wanted to 'take our beds away'???! We just said that we were in the bed and wanted it to stay in the room and he went away. I checked with the reception to see if this guy was for real and they confirmed that they were replacing beds on our floor and apologised for trying to remove ours with us still in it (as well as the rudeness of the bed snatcher). Location wise this hotel is fantastic. You are right opposite the tube (give or take the car park which you have to walk through for a few seconds). The area seemed very safe - we returned back pretty late nearly every night and all was well. We were able to walk up to the Eden Centre (big shopping centre) in about 20-25 mins which was fine with us. My overall comment would be that this is a great hotel in a central location; it's cheap, spacious and clean. It isn't overly pretty but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just planning to sleep there then....!", "Date": "September 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MISSISSAUGA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3782420", "Content": "I recently stayed at Comfort hotel downtown with my girlfriend and her parents.

Next to the toilet was what looked like years of dirty and scum. I don't even want to know what was all over the shower curtain! No soap was avaible in the shower, I ran out of toilet paper and had to call the front desk for a replacement! Let's just say I will never ever stay at this hotel again.

We stayed in a 5th floor room with 2 double beds for $99 Canadian. On arrival we were given a smoking room despite having reserved nonsmoking. The clerk sincerely apologized, but they had no nonsmoking rooms available. To compensate us for that, he gave us the rollaway bed we needed for free. The room didn't actually stink of smoke, so we kept it despite being offered a new room for the second night. The room was basic but clean. The bathroom was quite tiny with no counter space (just a small shelf on the wall). There was a coffee pot in the room which was fine, but to my dismay on morning #2 the maid didn't replace the coffee! We also had some trouble getting enough towels, but again the staff was polite and (sort of) accomodating - I finally got the towels by walking down to the housekeeping office. The hotel isn't in the greatest neighborhood if you have kids. The strip club advertising Miss Nude Greece across the street, as well as the condom shop around the corner, took some explaining.
