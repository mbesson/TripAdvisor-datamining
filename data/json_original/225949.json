The hotel is a motel-style accomodation near Kahului Airport, Maui Seaport (stop of cruise ships) and near some shopping malls of Kahului.

Unless you have got a room to the garden/pool side it's a bit noisy during the night, since there is a highway nearby. The mentioned pool is nothing fancy but sufficient to cool down for some minutes. There is also a sandy beach in front of the hotel, but the view on the commericial harbour doesn't allow too much of holiday feeling. The ladies at the reception were very friendly and helpful. Our hotel room (Deluxe) was real big with two King-size beds, plenty of space arround and a standard bathroom. We had booked overnighht including breakfast. Unfortunately they don't offer a buffet style breakfast but some set courses, which do not always meet everybodys taste.

I was looking for a place near the airport for our last night on the islands. First appearance upon entering the parking lot was \"I hope the inside looks better than the outside.\" I had booked through a travel website and the package I selected was described as \"Standard 2 Doubles Garden View Including Breakfast...Free Breakfast valued at $25 for two... Free Wi-Fi.\" We arrived at about 2pm and the desk attendance said we could not check into the room until 3pm. We left to get lunch and came about 2:45pm. Many people were waiting at the front desk for them to be assigned a room. I tried to access the free internet and asked the front desk for the code. The internet page stated that free access to the internet is in the lobby by the front desk - only. If you want to access the wifi in your room or other area of the property it required you to pay $8.95 per day. EACH time I logged off or stepped out of the free wifi area, I had to go back to the front desk, ask for another code and enter it. The room... we were assigned our room and told it was in building 3. Building 1 and 2 (both two floors each) are on both sides of the outdoor pool. Building 3, which has 3 floors, looks like it may have been a different hotel at one time. Upon entering the room, it appeared to look fine. The room space itself was large. The beds had the used-a-lot appeareance, flat not round topped. It was nothing fancy, but it was clean. The room had a large window so I went over to look out. Our \"Garden View\" room had a view of the roofs of buildings 1 & 2, power lines, the west Maui mountains in the distrance; look to the right and see the water in the bay. If I put my head to the glass and looked straight down, I could see the grass between buildings 2 & 3, but I would not consider this a garden view by any means. Property pros: fairly inexpensive for Maui, but I think still overpriced for the age of the buildings and what you get. The pool was clean and grounds around the pool is maintained and nice. The building does have a narrow beach by the bay. There is a restaurant onsite, another one block to the east, and there is a nice Italian restaurant across the street. Close to the airport, a Whole Foods grocery store, a gas station and the cruise port. Not far from Queens mall. Coin operated self laundry facilities on the property. Property cons: The pool closed at 6pm!!! Not really a garden view. Free internet only in lobby or pay other areas. Long pass code required to enter each time. Staff that smiled but not necessarily friendly. Use of public computer in the lobby - need to hand over your drivers license at the front desk for use of the keyboard for the computer.

Sometimes it's to get away from the crowd, sometimes because you want something romantic, sometimes you want to save money and sometimes you want a convenient area.

It's not luxurious 2. it's dated 3. it feels unremarkable, you may notice in the halls a dingy lit area, maybe the smell of smoke 4. the room we were in is not going to win any awards for views as ours had a look out to the parking lot. 5. if you have a lot of bags, you better have strong arms for the long distance you may have to haul although the elevator works in helping you get there. 6. The fridge in the room is tiny. 7. The bathroom works but it's not beautiful. 8. The beds were ok, but you'll hear a fair amount of traffic. 9. the lobby is active with people trying to get on the internet. 10. The pool is available but I saw no one swimming there. 11. There is a view of the north shore and it's not bad. You'll see people of all ages coming here to stay or to eat at the Coconut Room, which is average. And ..... if you read the other reviews provided you'll find there are truisms all around. Everyone's point of view here is on target. So why stay here when there are certainly other places that are far way better? Well.... 1. It's close to the airport. 2. It's cheap 3. It's family run. Which is great when you consider much of the Maui economy is run by chains which are not local at all. So the money stays in Maui. 4. A lot of people stay here, some for extended periods. They must like it for a reason and they're nice people. 5. The service is truthful, which means it's good for what it is. A value oriented place to stay. You will notice on Maui that staying in Kahului is as romantic as an industrial byway with a strip of highway full of car dealerships, fast food restaurants etc. Yet.... You can always get in the car and picnic on a coastal area. Hana Highway is nearby. You'll be near all the conveniences of life like shopping centers and fast food. If you're a student on a budget or a retired couple watching your pennies, you've come to a place which can help you out. If you are looking for the ideal escape or the lap of luxury, spend a lot more money somewhere else. So.....know why you're staying here (for us, we had an early morning flight) and if you care about certain things and don't care about other things, this may be the right place for you.

The Coconut Grill on site is a good meal option and provides breakfast in the room rate if you opt for that. There is upscale Italian across the road and Burger King close by. The hotel is family run and the staff were friendly and organized. The room was clean and there were US sockets for charging in a strip next to a desk. The bed was comfortable. Internet access is available in the lobby on 2 large Imacs. There is a pool and there is access through a gate for walks near the seaside but there is no real beach here. The hotel was 100% booked full in January. The rooms are large but very BASIC with overhead fan, in wall air conditioner, flat screen TV and average sized bathroom with modular shower over bath. I could not log into Skywave internet ($8.95 per day) in the room, others has no problem. Parking was $5 extra per day. Overall the hotel is like a Days Inn that is perhaps 1980s vintage and in need of redevelopment but seems to be well run. My room cost $US112 per night, which raises questions about value but the Market rules! This place will be too basic for some people but is well situated for business, eating and airport.

It is a decent value for Maui . The rooms are nothing to write home about, but they are ok for a short stay. The main drawback to the hotel is that you will want to get out into other more scenic areas of Maui, or to the regular beachside hotels, rather than to stay here for more than a night, in most cases. However, I am sure people do stay longer here, and the pool is very nice, the view across the harbor is good, and you are not far at all from the other side of the harbor (driving though, not walking unless you like a longer walk) where people surf on boogie boards a lot. The restaurant Cocoanut Grill is a decent place for a breakfast and the wait staff was nice. In fact, the service was fine at this hotel. The people were nice. The decor in the rooms isn't that attracitve but it is clean and serviceable. If you walk across the street at the light right outside the hotel and about a block up that cross street, there is a small older mall on the left, and it has a great indoors farmers market. I think the market is almost every day of the week (Maybe not Sunday, and I don't think a lot of vendors are there on Saturdays). I'd recommend it as a place to get some food (avocado, banana, etc- there are also cooked meals available there and other baked items) to take for the rest of your trip, esp when you are starting out, as Maui restaurant costs are high and besides, you will want to sample the produce. Of course fruit and vegetable stands are all over the place in Maui, but this farmers market is the real thing and gives you a chance to select from a wider variety of food than any roadside stand. Taking an avocado for lunch with some fruit is a great healthy substitute for buying restaurant food. For some reason the hotel staff didn't recommend this market when I asked about where to buy bottled water, but there is water and soda for sale at the market as well.

I was given a second-floor room and since the door lock appeared to be quite sturdy I felt reasonably safe. The room was clean and bug-free and while the amenities were not luxurious there was shampoo, soap, conditioner, sewing kit and shower cap, plus a hairdryer. There were people camping in the vacant lot next to the hotel, but they quieted down by about 10 PM so they weren't a problem. The hotel seemed to be full of people on their first or last day of vacation and a large group of young surfers. There was a little bit of noise earlier in the evening but things quieted down by 10PM. The hotel posts rules about quiet hours, and apparently enforces them. I got a good rate through Hotwire ($75). They charge an extra $5 for parking, which annoyed me to no end. I would rather pay $5 more for the night than be nickel-dimed. Also, they don't have an airport shuttle so if you don't have a rental car, expect to pay another $15 for a cab. Rental cars are so cheap on Maui you might as well just get one at the airport and save the cab fare. Also, they charge for internet access. I didn't test it because I have my phone and that was enough to do the small amount of internet surfing I needed to do. I would not stay here for an entire vacation as it's not a very relaxing or beautiful place to hang out, but for a pit stop on the way in or out of Maui it gets the job done.

In our efforts to find affordable quality lodging in Maui, we considered many choices, including several B&B's , and this hotel. But we happened to end up in it due to the Hotwire's Hotdeal: they offered us a extremely attractive price for a hotel in a determined area, around 25-30% cheaper than the cheapest hotel in the island, but without revealing the name of the hotel, just how many starts and some of the service it includes, and an immediate payment is required, and no cancellations accepted. Only after you buy, then they tell you what hotel you paid for. We took the risk and we certainly were not disappointed. Even though the lady that received us at the front desk clearly was in training in her first days of work, backup girls came to help and we were delighted. There was no problem. We were surprised to learn that the rate includes full service breakfast in the restaurant next door, the Coconut Grill. The only downside is they charge $5 parking a day. It's good because they have security agent all night long checking and going around the cars. They offer free parking but across the busy street from the hotel, and no security watch. We just agreed in paying for their parking The grounds were very green and clean, very nicely maintained. Our room, maybe because of the Hotwire deal, was not in the best location: the window was looking directly to the building entrance ramp, and it was a little bit tucked in the ground, but neither of those facts affected our stay. The window was normal size and fully above the ground. What I probably liked the most, is that the room was HUGE, probably the biggest hotel room I've been in. inside the room is also when you notice the hotel is very old, but at the same time, after 3 nights, you notice how much effort and dedication the owners/manager had put in keeping it in extremely good shape. Our room had an area of irregular floor, near the window, but the carpet was pristine on top of it and it didn't affect our comfort either. If you want a microwave, as stated in the hotel webpage, has to arrange it BEFORE your arrival, as well as a hair dryer, you need to ask for it in the front desk. We didn't have the microwave in our room when we arrived, but I called front desk and after less than 10 mins was brought and connected in our room. The hotel is barely 3 or 4 miles from the airport, that is less than 10 mins, and close to all of Kahului, restaurants, convenience stores. Is also an excellent central point in the island to beaches, Haleakala and he Hana road.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cThis was a great location for exploring all that central Maui has to offer!\u201d", "Author": "lasvegasview", "ReviewID": "UR74125698", "Content": "My husband and I stayed several nights at this hotel in July.

The pool overlooked the ocean and the lobby offered a room with comfy chairs overlooking the pool and ocean. The hotel was a little dated, but I really enjoy the retro feel. My impression was that the hotel had a lot of history and character. The rooms were quite and the beds were super-comfortable. We could see canoe races outside our building, which were exciting to witness when we left the hotel in the morning. The hotel does not offer a fitness center, but the track at the nearby college was open for anyone wanting to run a few laps.

We dined at The Ale House twice, which had good food and drinks at a good value.

The beach is actually part of Kahului harbor, so don't expect crashing surf, white sands and a glamorous view, if you want that, book in the resort areas. The water looked clean and there were somepeople swimming, though for what it is, the pool is probably a better option.

The only place that it had been vulnerable was at the hotel. I called the front desk and they said they would check the premises, but after only a minute she came back to the line to say no one turned it in. I asked if she would check the parking lot and she said she had. I hastily returned to the hotel from the airport and talked to staff and security and no one claimed to have seen the bag. I asked if they would talk to the day shift employees and call me with their findings. I left my phone #. I flew out that evening and didn't hear another word. I called later the next day and was told by the front desk, no one had turned in any luggage. I asked her and the manager and their canned response was \"no one turned anything in\". I am concerned by the lack of concern or interest in trying to assist. In fact, one of the front desk attendants seemed to be totally uninterested. The motel has a security guard on site that was within sight of our car, but I don't think that there was any attention paid to what may have been going on inside or outside of my car. I take full responsibility for putting my bag at risk, but I was very dissatisfied with the effort and concern for their guest and the stolen property.

The following day, we returned to our room (at 9:00 pm) after a day outing only to find dozens of TERMITES and COCKROACHES all over our room. When we called the front desk, we were informed that they would give us another room. Fine. This next room was in the same condition, if not worse. My boyfriend literally filmed a roach climbing on our bed for 10 minutes while we were waiting for the staff to do SOMETHING. We were shown two more rooms, only to be met with the same conditions, as well as tons of HAIR UNDER THE BEDSPREAD AND SHEETS! All of this we meticulously videotaped as we couldn't believe what was happening! I asked to speak to a manager but was rudely informed by the two women at the front desk that they make the decisions when the manager is away, and that it is too late to call the manager. At this point, the two women at the front desk stated that they would not show us any other rooms because we are \"looking to find something\"- when we were merely lifting the sheets on the besd to check for more insects and hair! This went on for hours until I decided to call the local police, who informed us that it wasn't there concern. After speaking to the police, it was around midnight and my boyfriend and I were asking to be shown ONE clean room in which we could spend the night in until we could check out the following morning. It was obviously the middle of the night and the hotel is in a seedy area of town so we did not love the idea of leaving and having to find something at that hour. Additionally, we prepaid our entire 9 day stay and were concerned we would not be refunded. The two front desk women ignored us, made unbelievably rude and sarcastic comments, and finally checked us out and had security take out our luggage out of our room WITHOUT OUR CONSENT. Again, we videtoaped this entire incident. We wanted nothing more than a clean room to stay in until morning so we could check out and were met with nothing but hostility and rudeness- not even one apology for the state of the rooms, nothing of the sort. One of the women at the front desk called the police to have us removed from the premises, and this was done for no reason at all as we did not do anything except ask for a clean room. We videotaped our entire exchange with the staff, as their behavior was absolutely unbelievable (even when they knew they were being videotaped!!!!)! At around 1:00 am we were thrown out of the hotel and forced to find another room in a city we were not familiar with and at the height of the tourist season. Upon returning home, I received a letter of apology from the owner stating that insects are normal in a tropical climate (however, he conveniently did not mention the globs of hair under the sheets -which have NOTHING to do with the climate, nor did he mention the rude and unhelpful staff)- I'm sorry but it is NOT OK for a hotel to have termites and cockroaches in the rooms, no matter what the climate. And it is not OK for hotel staff to mock you and complain that you are being crazy for checking under the sheets on your bed! We have stayed in Hawaii twice previously and never had this problem with insects. Also, the hotel we checked in afterwards did not have any such insect problems. Stay far far away!

If you are really looking to be by the beach Seaside is probably not the hotel you want to rent. There are shops and malls around this hotel but nothing more to see. I am not sure if you could go for a nice walk there at night. If you want to get out at night, take a walk, buy gifts then go to Lahaina. We ate at Kimo's restaurant.

The suite had a sitting room with a few chairs,a sofa, a tv and a wonderful view of the bay. The bedroom was very big and so was the restroom. Our room was very neat and clean. The grounds of the hotel were immaculate and the view to the bay was really beautiful. We had a wonderful time and had not one problem. The clerks at the front dest were very helpful with suggestions on where to visit and eat and calling the taxi for us. All in all, it was very pleasant and we will be going back next year.

The continental breakfast included fruit, assorted muffins, hard boiled eggs, toast, etc. and was sufficient to keep us going for most of the day. Anyone who has been to Maui knows that dining out can be expensive, so this breakfast represented a significant savings and provided the energy to keep us going until we dined out in the evening. We used the Maui Seaside for our base for our travel excursions as everything could be reached easily from it since Maui isn't that big. Money saved on a room to sleep is money that can be spent on experiences outside of a hotel. We talked with an individual who was a guest at the hotel as a result of a business activity.

I don't know if it is but... I just returned home to Oahu and I think I got what I expected there. I do wish that they had supplied at least small bottles of shampoo and lotion though. Also, the parking is free but limited. If you are returning to your room at night you may not find a parking spot. I also wish the parking stalls were wider. Most times I had to have my companion get out of the car before I could park. I got to stay in the poolside rooms and I liked it. As long as you don't expect too much you will be pleased with the hotel because the staff is very friendly and the location is near the airport. If you are staying on maui, you should not be spending much time in your room anyway! There is so much to see and do! For the price I paid, you could get a better room in Waikiki but for Maui, where everything costs a bit more, it was fine.", "Date": "January 18, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Maui Seaside Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60631-d225949-Reviews-Maui_Seaside_Hotel-Kahului_Maui_Hawaii.html", "Price": "$107 - $130*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">100 West Kaahumanu Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kahului</span>, Maui, <span property=\"v:region\">HI</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">96732</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "225949", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e8/3b/64/maui-seaside-hotel.jpg"}}
