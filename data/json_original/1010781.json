I won't list them all but everything is close, the only time we needed to catch a bus was to get to the Vatican City and the Vatican Museum. The room is very clean, bathroom could have been a littel bigger however it is very clean too, very well looked after by the owner who is extremely friendly. We were in Rome from 23 till 26 August (quite hot) but we were in heaven when we were inside as the room was airconditioned. Breakfast was excellent too. Can't recommend highly enough. A real value for money!", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg, Russia", "Title": "\u201cStay away!!\u201d", "Author": "taiagirl", "ReviewID": "UR118032361", "Content": "The rooms resemble a 3rd world country hospital, everything is white, there's no decor whatsoever and the lighting is next to absent. The place is seriously baaaad. There is no place to put things in or on, toiletries consist of a small soap bar and lemon wet wipes (?!?). Breakfast is just a joke... The couch in the breakfast room is draped with a white bed sheet... Chairs are formerly white, but just filthy yellowish and stained now. The noise from the mobile a/c unit and the outside is unbearable. We didn't sleep the first night and had to sacrifice air the second as we were exhausted and needed sleep at any cost. Two nights cost us \u20ac240, which is outrageous for the quality, even for Rome. Credit card payment only thru Paypal, which equals problems for visitors from certain countries. On the bright side, the owners really try hard, and are helpful and friendly, but they should really consider some serious changes to their rooms. But unless that happens, stay elsewhere.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cPerfect if you are young and active and in Rome for a few days\u201d", "Author": "Expert_adviser", "ReviewID": "UR117278304", "Content": "I booked last minute through an online site and snapped up a room at a good rate. My objective was simple. See as much as Rome as I can in 3 days (2 nights). Marta, who runs the B&B was very professional, warm and welcoming. Her high standard of service is the reason why I have rated this 4/5 and not 3/5 (which it otherwise would have been). Marta gave me a map and quickly showed me the lay of the land. She accommodated an early check-in and a late check-out when I left. I spent most of my time waking the streets of Rome and visiting the important places and only came back to the B&B when I wanted to sleep. If you want a hotel to be able to lounge around in, this is not it (and quite frankly, for a comparable price, I can't imagine you will find anything). The good stuff: The rooms are clean. I had my own bathroom with clean towels, new soaps and shampoo. The room had air-con (which was essential on a 40 degree Rome day!). The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean. The bad stuff: The air-con was loud. Thankfully I had ear-plugs and so I blocked it out. Plus, I was exhausted from touring so I slept through it. Could be a problem if you are a light sleeper. The lighting in the room was insufficient. There was one small globe which barely lit the room enough to see your things (the bathroom light assisted). If you are old, or unfit, you might want to think about staying somewhere closer to the action (by that, I mean somewhere near the Pantheon or Palazzo Navona). If you are active and fit and enjoy walking, this is a great position. All of Rome's attractions are within walking distance. Say, a 20-25 minute brisk walk will get you to most places in Central Rome. I had a great time and a great trip and I recommend this place for the reasons above.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Hill, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNot quite\u201d", "Author": "RLW_13", "ReviewID": "UR114814492", "Content": "Nice private bath, comfortable beds, freedom of easy access to Rome sites but this B&B just wasn't quite all we had hoped for.
