Away from the tourist traps we discovered the Paris that the locals know and love.

If you are an experienced traveler you know very well that Paris is a rather difficult place where you find a relatively affordable hotel that offers a certain level of comfort. Joyce has been highly satisfactory on every count (I have slept in too many bad hotels in Paris!). Facilities at Joyce are spotless and you get them all at once in Paris solely in much more expensive hotels. The staff is super friendly. When I checked in it was late at night. Generally in Paris you would be received by an aloof and disinterested attendant who would have checked you as fast as he could in order to get back to his TV room. At Joyce I was received by Samuel who was at Midnight as sparkling as only an attendant at the concierge of George V at 10H00 in the morning could be! He helped me in every way he could. Another day somebody else, as friendly and efficient,was so kind to print my flight boarding card. And he did it so fast! Almost too fast for myself! Furthermore I was very surprised that the cleaning ladies were also very friendly and collaborative (and we all know how hard they can turn into hell your staying in a hotel if they are not!). The breakfast has been excellent, in every detail. For instance: the orange juice is freshly squeezed and not the horrid industrial one. Jam was not served in little awful plastic packages (like it happens also in even more expensive hotels than this!) but in lovely jars and of superb choice (Bonne Maman!). The bed is sublime, with great linens and pillows. The TV screen is big and spotless, with so many channels available and all shown at highest picture quality. Bathroom is excellent, and again full of thoughtful details. How often we experience in hotels that: 1) there are not enough hooks or racks for the towels 2) not enough surfaces for little bags and our own stuff 3) the shower tap is either too complicated or the tap is too low or the curtain sticks on your skin or whatever 4) the detergents and shampoos are bad and never enough. At the Joyce it is not like that, it looks as if somebody has been thinking thoroughly about all the things to avoid when conceiving an ideal bathroom! The internet connection is free and really accessible. Many hotels promise free internet connection and then it is either too slow, or you got to call for assistance and so on. At Joyce it works straight away. The wardrobe spaces are generously thought as well as the safe which can contain a lap top. I mean I could go on and on with examples. I was totally enthusiastic to find such a satisfactory hotel and I wish I could talk to the person who conceived the hotel. He clearly understood that being generous to the clients and coaching the staff in a way that they really and profoundly understand what real service is , is simply better for everyone.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki, Greece", "Title": "\u201cClean, friendly, perfect mattress\u201d", "Author": "Mcisgr", "ReviewID": "UR121670088", "Content": "We stayed at Monterosa only a few weeks after the opening (Jan 2010) and we book our room with special discount.

Service: Excellent - from the concierge / front desk to the wait staff, all were impeccably polite, cheerful and helpful when we were asking for directions to get to the Versailles, subway stations, booking a airport shuttle bus for us etc. Room: We already knew that Paris hotels were small, so we weren't taken aback. In fact, the room size we felt, while it could not be described as large, was definitely decent. The bathroom with shower was ok too. We had one big luggage between the two of us, that fit into a corner so it was just fine. After all, who spends much time in the hotel room in Paris? The bed however, was smaller than a queen, we found it a bit of a squeeze but still manageable. Now, the elevator however, has got to be the smallest elevator we've ever seen in our lives. It's a horizontal rectangular lift, which could fit four slim people without luggage. The stairs were small and spiral - so suggest that you don't haul your luggage up unless it's small, light or can be carried on your shoulders. Decor: The room and hotel is really lovely - nicely designed and quite artistic too. Perks: Free breakfast (mostly cold stuff like cereals, ham, cheese, breads, yoghurt, fruit - but good enough and definitely filling even for a guy) and free wi-fi. Every day after 2pm, there was an open bar where you could sit and help yourself to drinks (soft drinks, fruit juices, water) and some finger food (cherry tomatoes, crackers, chocolate biscuits). Good enough if you want to have a brief respite from the Parisian heat. Location: Walking distance to two subway stations - Pigalle and St Georges. Further away are the stations near the Galleries LaFayette, we could also walk to the Gare St Lazare, which is a train station where you can take a 25-min train to Versailles. From the Gare du Nord, where we arrived in Paris, it was tough taking the train to the hotel as it involved changing trains and going up and down staircases (poor hubby had to lug the luggage) - so maybe invest in a taxi if necessary. It is also walking distance to the Moulin Rouge. There are a couple of small mini-marts around the area to buy bottled water etc - there are also some eateries around the area, though we enjoyed the La Fayette Gourmet which we walked to.

When I emailed the hotel to cancel they stated that I would have to make a new reservation, and the rate was going to be higher. I did not understand this as I was keeping 3 of the days as per the reservation. They would not honor their rate, so I went to their sister hotel Palm Opera which did honor the discount rate! You can read my review on that hotel, but I am writing this review to say that there was no reason that they should not have honored our reservation. We already had the dates, but needed to cancel 2 days because of flight changes. We already had a reservation with this hotel!

The Joyce delivers where it counts: spotlessly clean, excellent mattress and linens, very quiet room (at least where we were), and ample hot water. Our rate included free wifi (in room as well the lobby) and breakfast. The Hotel's many virtues, not least of which its friendly, welcoming staff, offset almost completely the few areas in which one is reminded that it is, after all, a budget choice. Among those are towels, which while of good quality are small, and the breakfast, which comes close to underwhelming (when it's not just being odd - I don't really fancy a cold rice salad at 8:00 in the morning, but perhaps there are those who do...). If the Hotel were to upgrade its croissants and perhaps offer some less sandpaper-like coffee cake, it would be a vast improvement and would better match the excellent coffee and lovely setting. We enjoyed the hotel's little quirks - the infintesimal elevator, the design quirks (the tiny LED lights in the lobby floor work; the white china antlers sprouting seagrass, possibly less so), and the general air of friendliness that prevails. Even more, we appreciated the very caring attitude and support of the desk staff when one of us fell ill on a weekend evening and needed help in getting to the only late-night dental emergency room in Paris. The neighborhood is central enough to be an easy walk to the opera, department stores, and amusingly dodgy Pigalle/Place Clichy district, with longer walks to Montmartre and down to the Louvre quite possible. It's quiet in the evenings, but we still found several nice places open as late as midnight - and the quiet makes for excellent sleep.

We speak only the basics of the French language, and the never had an issue communicating with any hotel staff, as they spoke English. They allowed us to check in very early after an exhausting overnight flight, and they answered questions and made dinner reservations for us. Very pleasant and made our stay very comfortable. The hotel itself is new, and it feels new (vs. a janky renovation.) It is beautiful and light and clean. The design is so thoughtful. It is small and easy. There is no restaurant or bar, but the breakfast area is so bright and nice. The free breakfast (if you can get it) is a GREAT deal - baguette and croissants, fruit, meat and cheese, dry cereal, coffee and juice. The rooms are not too small - plenty of room for us and our gear. Really great beds, clean spacious bathrooms, and again, plenty of light. We loved that we could have a window open all day/night to get fresh air. Our room overlooked the courtyard and had a decent view, being on the 4th floor. Free wifi was a nice bonus. Nice TVs and iPod docking station/speakers, also bonuses. The neighborhood was perfect for us. The hotel is on a very quiet street, but is within 10 minutes (on foot) of Montmartre - lots of bars and restaurants, plenty to see and do. The hotel is 2 blocks from a metro station, also. I would love to stay here again, should we return to Paris, and would very much recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates a unique and beautiful building, well designed rooms, quiet, kind staff, all of these things.

The hotel is in a great location and is very clean and compact, the bathrooms are nice and its very clean for paris standards, its not cheap but I think relatively reasonable for what you get in comparision to other hotels. The breakfast is good and the staff are really really good, again especially for Paris when you can get some real arseholes. We stayed in a ground floor room the first night and it was noisy as hell, the room was good but the reception is the other side of the wall and the toilet for the lobby is right next to the bedroom door so if your a light sleeper avoid at all costs, the second night we moved to the top floor which was quite a small room but very quiet.
