I was part of the first 75 people to line up by 430pm on a September 2011 day and got a voucher for a FREE hotel stay! We wanted to go with Waldorf Astoria but it is far away from Downtown Chicago, so we opted for the CONRAD. I've never stayed in a fancy hotel such as this so, our expectations were really high. Before we booked anything, we've been communicating weeks before with management via e-mail. We made sure our vouchers would be honored and that we can upgrade and pay the difference. When we checked in at 6am (we flew red eye), we were just hoping to leave our luggage in the hotel and be given our promised upgrade to an executive suite. This is when we encountered a bit of difficulty with Ron at the front desk. There were 2 men at the check-in counter. The first man said that the upgrade would be honored. Then, Ron stepped in and said that it is NOT available given the type of payment we had and that because it is a busy weekend (we were there over President's Day Weekend), the room is (suddenly?) not available. We reminded him of the e-mail exchange with another manager and he said that he'd have to speak with them since maybe that person was misinformed. We then handed over our vouchers and he starts asking why our names aren't on the vouchers. This is when I started getting internally angry since he was making it very difficult for us despite the previous communications with management. We had to remind him of how promo works and that Hilton gave out these vouchers randomly. I started taking down notes such as what his name was and all the things he was saying. I think this is when Ron realized that he needs to fix things quickly because you do NOT want a BAD review or upset guests. With that said -- Ron made it up to my friends and I BIG TIME. As he should because, we have evidence of e-mail exchages and Twitter re-tweets to score this voucher. As such, we were treated like Royalty eventually. The first night was a Standard Room with 2 beds and a free of chage roll away bed. We were given tons of pillows and 5 free drink tickets which cost around $15 each. The next day, we were finally upgraded to an executive suite like we've been promised for free. The suite had a queen size bed and a bath tub. Both rooms had great views of the other buildings. I love that you can order endless bottled water and can request a Keurig coffee maker. The location was perfect -- within walking distance of the major sites. We didn't even get to ride the Metro since cabs were fairly reasonable when we split it amongst us. All in all, I would recommend this hotel despite the hassle at the beginning. I would however suggest that management be more accurate with giving out information so as not to upset guests. Thanks for everything, Conrad Hotel!!

With 5 large pillows, cloud top mattress, and down comforter, I was in heaven. The robes and slippers were also a very nice touch. The bathroom is very large with huge soaking tub and walk in shower. The person who turned down our room shaped a towel in the shape of a heart on our bed and placed several valentine chocolates around it...how many hotels do that. The technology in the room was amazing...large flat screen TV, Boze sound system and I-Pod player. The concierge has extremely helpful and personable and gave us some great suggestions.

When I got to the check in desk I told them that I just wanted to drop off my bags because of the posted check in time.

The rooms have a large bathroom with a soaking tube (great to use after the workout room to soothe the sore muscles and sore knees after working out), glass enclosed shower, and separate room for the toilet. The only down side was the office building basically right outside my windows but not that big of a deal just close the drapes. Its really nice that the hotel is attached to the The Shops At Northbridge because there are about six restaurants in the mall so if you don't want to go out you can take the elevator down and get a bite to eat in the mall. Also there are other restaurants very close outside the hotel, very convenient. Try the italian restaurant that is basically right out the door of the hotel. You will get to use that fridge in the room because they serve huge portions. One other downside is the price of a drink in the hotel bar. It was ten dollars for a rum and coke.Pretty steep in my opinion. The other great thing is the gift shop stays open until 11:00 pm great for those late evening munchies.

In comparison to most other 5 star hotels in Chicago, this is one of the best properties for the money, which is why I booked here. The location is good, especially in winter months. It is located right across from a mall, so you can enjoy nearby shopping and dining. From the time I stepped out of the cab, I was greeted by a friendly and professional doorman, leading me to the elevator for the reception area. The reception area is neat and informal. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the opulent, grand experience like most 5 star places, but it is simple, efficient, and worked well. I would say the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is modest and uneventful. Although nice, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find much of a WOW factor here. (Until you see their breakfast prices\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I will get to that.) My check in went smoothly, and I informed the hotel that I had 2 separate reservations that needed to be merged together. I informed them I would be staying 2 nights, not one. The friendly check in reception gentleman told me that this would be no problem, and the following day, to just come down to reception to have my keys recoded so that they would still work. No problem. I made my way up to the rooms where on my way, I found the elevator areas adorned with beautiful potted orchids; the look was very beautiful and elegant. Once inside my room, I noticed 2 things. (1) The bathrooms are really beautiful, big, and full of amenities. They are marble, gorgeous and complete with matching bathrobes. (2) The TV is huge. The not so great thing was that my view was directly into an office building. I literally could see what they were eating for lunch, etc, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just barely visible. It was like I was in there with them. No bother. I drew my blinds and moved on. (When you check in, ask for a view of NOT into an office building.) A small perk of this hotel is that they do a complimentary tea service each morning until 10 AM, which we used and enjoyed. At night, they put out hot coco and marshmellows for guests, which is cute and a nice touch. We did like that. What sort of struck me as funny at this hotel is that they pride themselves on having a pillow menu, where I think you can pick between 4 different kinds of pillows delivered free to your room, plus others at an additional cost. The irony in this is after waking up, I had concluded that the Conrad pillows were the least comfortable I had ever experienced in a hotel. Funny. (Maybe I should have ordered up a special pillow?) Downside to the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that the once stocked mini bars are all empty now. The only use for them now is to put your leftovers in. Me? I like to be able to grab a snack or a drink from the mini bar. I found it strange that this was a 5 star hotel with a little, pathetic, empty fridge. Despite this, however, all in all, the room is quite suitable, I think most people wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much an issue. Here is where you may take issue with this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6breakfast prices. Wow. For a complete breakfast in the dining room ,it is $24-$32, depending on which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast meal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you get. It is very pricy on this, (but delicious and well prepared / served.) However, as good as it was, it just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153$60 for breakfast for 2\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd good. My opinion is, there are nearby places that you can find that are a nice walk for $28 for 2. We asked the front desk for a recommendation and he said that Yolk was good. (Most Nordstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a caf\u00c3\u00a9, and had I thought of it, you probably could have gotten something awesome and cheap there, inside, right across the street from the Conrad.) All and all, I simply found the breakfast menu to be a turn off all together. Breakfast at the Park Hyatt, arguably a nicer and more upscale hotel, is less at $16 for room service complete breakfast, just for perspective. My opinion is that the Conrad should consider their cost of stay vs their cost of breakfast and maybe consider reducing. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where my stay got kind of annoying. The housekeeping belted on the door at 8 AM on a Friday morning. A little early, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you think? We told them to come back later, and we got out of bed and hung the DND sign on the door. Fine. Jet lagged and needing a nap, we retired back to the bed, only for the bellman to WALK IN to our room at 2 PM WITH THE DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door. Have you ever even heard of such a thing? We yelled out, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are staying another day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the bed and he left. We drifted back to sleep when\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6RING RING. Are you kidding me? We are being woken up again. It is the front desk, now calling to apologize for the bellman walking in. They caught the error in the computer now, where the hotel room bookings had not been merged like I had asked them to at check in. Now, I am really pissed. It was just all the getting woken up. The only point of booking the room was to have a luxurious sleep after a 16 hour nonstop flight. This rather ruined it. I wished this hotel could have been a little more organized and perhaps have housekeeping come by at 10 AM instead of 8 AM on the dot. Just too early for folks that are here to relax and unwind. I would describe this hotel as quiet, tranquil, spacious, unfussy, unpretentious, classic, non-trendy, simple, elegant, and calm. It really just depends on what you are looking for. This property competes in price point with the Sofitel and overall, I would stay at the Sofitel over this hotel for the money. This is a decent property, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blow me away. I would describe it as luxury on a budget.

I had previously never been to Chicago, and since anniversaries only come once per year, I decided that we could splurge a little bit and stay at a high-end hotel. After doing some research online, I chose the Conrad, and I have not questioned my decision since. The hotel itself has a great location near the magnificent mile and is within walking distance of many of Chicago's best restaurants and stores. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly bellman who offered to take our bags and directed us to the check-in desk. The check-in staff was very friendly and helpful, and greeted us by name throughout the duration of our stay. Common courtesies such as the personal greeting can really go a long way in making one feel comfortable and I felt that it was a very nice touch. As it was our anniversary, I spent a few extra dollars to purchase the Allure package which came with a free room upgrade, champagne toast upon arrival, and a complimentary breakfast-in-bed. The room itself was incredible. It had a large flat screen TV, an ergonomic chair, a large desk with a nice, leather desk chair, and quite possibly the most comfortable king-size bed that I have ever slept on. The bathroom was also very luxurious, containing his and hers sinks, deep soaking tub, unattached shower, and a separate room in which the toilet was located. Among the bathroom amenities were 2 bathrobes, cotton swabs, floss picks, mouthwash, face and body lotion, shampoo, and conditioner. As I mentioned before, we were to receive a champagne toast upon arrival as part of a package that I had purchased. My initial thought was that two filled champagne flutes would be waiting for us in the room, so it was a pleasant surprise when we discovered an entire bottle of champagne resting in the ice bucket. I am no champagne connoisseur, but I can confidently say that it was not your average $10 drug store variety. After taking down the bottle, we left to go experience the town. Although we did not try it, I have heard that the restaurant inside the hotel is very good, offering dinner options in the $30-50 range from what I saw. There was also a rooftop bar that was very highly recommended, but since it was late October, drinking outside wasn't really in the cards. In the morning, we were greeted with a breakfast for two in bed by a member of the hotel staff. The eggs and potatoes were excellently prepared, and the coffee and juice were also of very high quality. Overall, this was one of the best hotel stays that I have ever experienced. I usually like to include some cons in my reviews, but there really weren't any. If i had to name one, I would point to the $45 per night parking expense, but that is pretty standard anywhere in a big city so it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding\u201d", "Author": "mattcoats", "ReviewID": "UR121146090", "Content": "As usual the Conrad represents the best in quality and service.

We got a decent price on the room (I can't recall exactly what it was, but I thought it was around US$225 per night). I picked the Conrad over some of the other nearby hotels because they had free wi-fi. It still surprises me how the lower end hotel chains can offer free wi-fi, but the higher end ones will still charge exhorbitant prices. Well, refreshingly, the Conrad is not one of those. I loved the rooftop patio - we had a nightcap there on a warm July evening and took in the view of being surrounded by Chicago skyscapers.

Large room, large bathroom (with a separate room for the toilet), executive shower, massive flat screen TV, comfy bed and pillows. Large closet with lots of hangers (real hangers, not the ones with flat tops that prevent theft, that slip into a bracket locked on the rod). The room also had a great sound system (Bose) that included a huge sub-woofer on the floor. This system could either be used to play CD or connect and iPod or as surround sound for the TV. I've never stayed in a room with a system like this. We could have happily spent our entire time in the room it was so comfy and quiet. The 5th floor also has the hotel lobby and the bars and restaurants for the hotel, so we could not have been more conveniently located. While we were there there was free cider in the afternoons outside the restaurant and free coffee in the morning (no in-room coffee machine that I could see). The 5th floor also contains an elevator for the adjoining mall, with 4 floors of shopping and access to the Magnificent Mile - Very convenient! This place also had the highest end laundry bags I've ever encountered in a hotel. Usually they are plastic with a rope string at the top. This place had paper shopping bags for your laundry - high end indeed. We'll stay here the next time we are in Chicago!", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location & Service\u201d", "Author": "DDatYVR", "ReviewID": "UR119735766", "Content": "Stayed at the Conrad Chicago for four nights in a King room. Check-in was efficient with Amelia. It's amazing that she remembered my name and greeted me every night when I walked by. Housekeeping was very efficient and observant - I drink a lot of water, and in one night, they caught on and provided me with extra bottles of complimentary bottled water. I'm hesitant to recommend the Concierge as she was unable to provide good restaurant suggestions and seemed to just read off the descriptions from a restaurant reservations website. I ended up researching and making reservations myself. The doormen were generally unhelpful as most times, I ended up getting my own luggage and packages out of the car and opening the hotel doors myself. They seemed more engaged chatting with each other. The room was very clean and comes with complimentary wireless internet access. Slippers were provided along with two complimentary bottles of water. Unfortunately, my room faced a high-rise office building; the offices were about 10 feet away, so we could watch each other. This was very uncomfortable as I prefer natural light and like to keep my curtains open. I tried to switch rooms, but the hotel was sold out. The marble bathroom was spacious with separate tub and shower. The Acca Kappa bath products were a nice touch. I took a shower at 7:00 a.m. and that must be prime time for showers, as water pressure suffered greatly and the temperature was only warm. Hotel location was excellent, as it's connected to The Shops at North Bridge (Nordstrom is an elevator ride away). The hotel ground floor lobby is off Rush Street, though you can cut through to Michigan Ave. by exiting through the mall. All the major stores are nearby and the hotel is well-positioned so you're within 10 minutes walking distance from the Art Institute to the south, and Water Tower Place to the north. There are many nice restaurants nearby - i.e. Volare, The Purple Pig - and others such as Spiaggia are within walking distance. I was able to obtain a corporate group rate, so didn't mind the hiccups with the Conrad Chicago. However, if I were to pay full price at over $400 a night, I will likely look elsewhere. Overall, quite a nice stay; the great service I received from certain members compensated for the other shortfalls.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington dc", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Surprise in Windy City\u201d", "Author": "wiscomilker", "ReviewID": "UR119722575", "Content": "Popped in for weekend get-away.

The Hilton honors breakfast in the restaurant was delicious and included with our voucher. I also ordered room service very early on the morning of the marathon. It arrived late and was missing part of the order. It would be nice if the restaurant could open early on marathon morning to accommodate the many runners who were staying there that weekend. I recommend a 5:00 am opening. Due to the unseasonably warm weather, the outside terrace was open. We enjoyed drinks and lunch outside and it was fabulous....so glad they opened it up to guests that late in the season.

The road goes undergrade in these areas and it is not inviting. We avoided it by going 1/2 a block north or south to Grand or Hubbard before going east or west for any of our walks. Great proximity to wonderful restaurants, walking, and shopping. Combined with the cleanliness and superior customer service we received, we will definitely look to stay here again in the future.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rexford, New York", "Title": "\u201cTerrific hotel in a very convenient location.\u201d", "Author": "spetron", "ReviewID": "UR118880330", "Content": "The Conrad is in a great spot, a quick walk to shopping, restaurants, the river and much more.

Chose the Conrad for its location at the south end of \"Miracle Mile\" and near the Chicago River. Hotel is connected to a small upscale mall with its main entrance on Rush St and an additional entrance through the mall onto Michigan Ave. Lobby is located on the floor 5 accessed via an elevator from street level. Don't know what all the fuss is about with some reviewers - extra three minutes to get into the lobby of the hotel - not a major inconvience. In fact it offered a sense of greater security coming in off the street. There was never more than a 2 minute wait to get to the front desk - often service was available immediately. Outdoor and indoor restaurant located on this level as well. Only ate at the hotel for breakfast at the interior/indoor location - so I can only comment on this area. At all 5 breakfasts, food was fresh and promptly prepared. The non-ala carte waitered breakfast menu included eggs any style, toast with jams/butter, sausage, selection of cereals, fruit, OJ, coffee and a selection of teas. I had insisted on a number of items 3 weeks prior to arriving at the hotel when making my reservation - quiet area of the hotel limiting noise from external and internal sources; having the use of a mini fridge and a coffee maker during our stay. All were waiting for us upon our arrival on the 16th floor. As the hotel is only 17 floors, the street noise is not entirely eliminated - you'd probably have to at least be double the height- but the location of our room away from internal noise sources and not facing Michigan Ave was most likely the best the hotel could offer. Room had one king bed - pillows a little soft for our liking - otherwise fine. Quiet A/C. Well appointed with flat screen TV, sound system, ipod charger/radio, reading pot lights, seperate toilet room, shower and bath, makeup magnifying mirror. During our six days, we were offered or asked no less than a dozen times, if we needed anything or how our stay was going. It was always unsolicited and offered by the front desk, the concierge, the maintenance staff or the restaurant staff. It added to the enjoyment of the vacation knowing that the hotel was genuinely concerned about our well-being. Only downside, no pool. Although I was aware of this when booking, that combined with a spa, would have put the hotel teetering on a five-star rating. We did utilize the pool once at the Homewood Suites, a block away, but it wasn't worth the effort.

The bathroom had separate shower and bathtub which I truly appreciate, and the toilet was in a separate room within the bathroom, something my wife truly appreciates. Toothbrush, toothpaste, combs and mouthwash were provided, a rarity in the age of cost-cutting. Something which I think is lacking from a hotel such as the Conrad is the in-room coffee maker. Instead, the hotel has replaced it with a limited self-service table of coffee, tea, water and newspapers, located just outside the restaurant in the lobby.

My husband is a Diamond Hilton member, and staying at a Hilton property is a high priority when I choose a hotel property. The Conrad appeared to meet all my requirements prior to staying there, such as location, breakfast, work out facitilty, and parking. We parked directly across the street which saved a money. I fell in love with the location of the Conrad being on North Michigan, mere steps away from Nordstrom, plus other shopping retailers. We had a incredible amount of resturants to choose from for dinner. Upon check-in we were upgraded into a Junior Suite with a view. The living room was large including a dining room table. The bathroom was unbelievable. I think my daughter took three baths in two days. The hotel will bring up special oils and salts to make your bath more relaxing. There is a menu of services provided for taking a bath. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was inviting. The best part of bed time was being able to order a special pillow that would allow your night's sleep to be the comfortable as possible. My daughter ordered the body pillow and still would like one to this day. We did not bring our dogs to the Conrad; we loved the fact the Conrad allows dogs. The Conrad makes your dog's stay at the Conrad as memorable as his or her owners. Offering services such as dog walking, dog day care, dog beds, dog \"special\" food, dog spa. Since we ate a late lunch we opted for room service later in the evening. It took about 45 minutes, which I thought was slow. We were not hungry and time was not an issue. The cruisine looked as if a pastry chef had made it and sent it right up to our room. It was expensive, but I was excepting a high tab. For one coffee, one hot tea, and two cheesecakes the tab was $87.00. I didn't mind the expensive room service bill since I was able to look out and see excitment of the city, the beauty of Lake Michigan and grandure of Navy Pier. We wanted to enjoy the luxury of our suite, the view, the relaxing baths, and a perfect night sleep with our \"special\" pillows. It was like we had a vacation within our vacation at the Conrad. I would strongly encourage if staying in the city over the week end or a period of time to spend the extra money and upgrade into a suite. I stayed at the Hilton on South Michigan and would choose the Conrad not for the locations, but the amenties, and the staff. The only down side, which happens at every hotel you stay at downtown if it be in Chicago or New York is the noise of the city. I have found no matter the price of a room, it is unavoidable that one will hear the noise from the city below. The Conrad exceeded my expectation from the staff treating us like royalty, to the extra touches of the pillows to the best location on Michigan Avenue.

We made reservations through the hotels website and chose the option for an upgrade ($10/night) to a room with a balcony. The check-in process went smoothy and efficiently and we were given a room on the 16th floor with a huge balcony that was shared with the suite next door. The views of Michigan Ave were awesome!! We could even see the lake from two angles. The room was large and very clean, the bed and bedding very comfortable and luxurious. Location was perfect. The entire Conrad staff was very friendly and accomodating and helpful with every detail...from the doormen to the front desk to the housekeepers. The only minor issue involved parking. We chose to self-park ($40/night) directly across the street in Nordstroms ramp. When we went to retrieve the car we were charged an extra $31 because the 24 hour period had expired since we originally parked. The hotel staff promptly credited our account for this. Just keep this in mind when parking...it is based on 24 hour time periods. I would highly recommend the Conrad for an excellent stay in Chicago! P.S.

The Conrad is a nice hotel and moderately priced for the area, but beware of package deals from Hilton. Let me start out by saying, overall we enjoyed our stay at the Conrad. Our room was very clean, the beds were appointed nicely and we had a nice large flat screen TV in our room. The hotel is in a very good location. Close and within walking distance to many attractions, but far enough away from everything that it is quiet and peaceful at night. We only had two main issues with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6one moderate and one major issue. Moderate first, the air conditioning. Although, the air conditioner was on 65, our room was warm. After calling the front desk, a maintenance technician came to our room. He informed us that the hotel had installed energy efficient motion sensors in each room. The sensor recognizes when someone has entered the room. When this occurs the air conditioner then comes on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6great for saving the hotel money\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6bad if you are out all day and enter into a room that takes forever to cool down.

When we booked the Conrad through Hilton, we bought their package that included parking. The representative over the phone told us that the parking would include onsite self-parking. Sadly this was not the case. Although the hotel does have self-parking which is attached to the hotel and shared with Nordstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, we were made to park two and a half blocks from the hotel. Upon check in we were told that the parking package was for a parking garage off-site. WHAT! Needless to say, this morning when we went to get the car at 5am it was extremely scary. Please be forewarned, if you are driving, do not get this package. Not to mention, the parking that is attached to the hotel, was only a couple dollars more than the package. Other than the aforementioned, the hotel was nice AND if you stay over on a Sunday night, I highly recommend eating at the hotel restaurant located on the roof top.

It was a corner suite with a large terrace overlooking the mag mile and John Hancock on one side and the tribune building on the other. The room itself was very spacious with a living area and a separate large bed/en suite. Both rooms equipped with 42 inch tvs. Everything was finished to a very high standard. Anytime we needed help with anything the concierge was more than helpful. We went to see a NFL game and our tickets were arranged for us.

The rooms and nice and clean and the staff are friendly but the key card issue and how long it was allowed to go on for before someone thought to really look into, it is enough for me to think twice about recommending it to anyone else. the location is great but it isn't the only hotel in the area either. if you do stay here i hope they have the key card issues fixed so that you don't miss out on chicago as i did. i'm giving them and average because if it wasn't for the issues with the keycards it would actually be a higher rating. oh and the fact that i am on the 5th floor and can hear every bit of traffic noise.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSmall Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Trve", "ReviewID": "UR116539526", "Content": "Convenient location downtown with excellent staff.

We were just an elevator ride to great shopping and the stores on Michigan Ave. We could walk to many attractions, great restaurants and would pick this as the perfect spot. Rooms were quite nice. I wouldn't say they were huge or extremely fancy but they were clean, had a nice tv, robes, comfy bed, pillows, water bottle on the nightstand... Hotel staff were very helpful, nice and very efficient throughout our stay. My only negatives would be that it doesn't have a lot of \"wow\" in the lobby and the price of parking. It's very basic and when you enter from Rush Street, you basically come into a small room with an elevator. You need to go to the fifth floor to check in We didn't need a fancy lobby but I just expected it too be a little nicer.

When you walk out the exit on the Michigan Avenue side (through the mall) one has access to the CTA buses that take you a few minutes south to the Water Tower Place, the Rush Street Area, the Gold Coast ( $$$$ ) residences, and all the shops in-between. Want to \"head\" north on Michigan Avenue to the river cruises, Wrigley Building, Symphony Hall, Art Institute, Archtecture walking tours, Museum Campus with the Field Museum, Planaterium, Acquarium, Soldier Field, Buddy Guys Club, Millenium Park, etc., then buses to these attractions are within a 1 (one) minute walk from the hotel. Get a $25 CTA pass for a week with the hotel as your base. More importantly, the hotel is SPOTLESS. It's really, really clean. No dustballs in corners, no stain-streaked glasses; no grubby garbage cans; nothing is overlooked. The room service meals (grouper/crab and everything else ) were cooked to perfection. In fact, the front desk actually called to insure that the room service meal was delivered on time, which it was!! I don't believe I have ever had that happen before. Now, here is the most amazing thing about our 5 night stay: my wife and I returned after a 4 hour walking food tasting tour and a 2 hour walk of the city on our own. In responding to a query from the front desk about \" how was your day,\" my wife mentioned that her legs were causing her some discomfort/pain. Within two minutes of arriving in our room the front desk called and advised that they were sending from their pillow menu a special full body pillow to help my wife feel better. Within minutes the pillow arrived and, not only was the pillow delivered, but also a small bottle from the hotel containing a concentrated liquid for my wife to use in the bath ( I don't remember exactly what it was), as well as a bottle of organic tea was delivered. But that's not all: about 15 minutes later the sweetest lady from housekeeping ( I believe her name was Sheila ) knocked at the door and brought my wife a jar of epson salt; she mentioned that when the staff was unable to locate the epson salt in the hotel, another staff member ( Prisca, I believe was her name ) actually went to a drug store and bought the epson salt for my wife!!! That's right. Amazing. I tried my hardest to give Sheila a gratuity for her and Prisca and she refused it, telling us that we were \"Hilton guests\" and a gratuity would not be accepted. I believe that the young man who was responsible for the pillow and tea was Randy from the front desk. Also, a young lady, Jill Natale, went out of her way to assist my wife and I in so many areas where tourists such as us have many, many questions and seek assistance. I can understand why this hotel at the time of writing this review is ranked #3 for hotels in Chicago. I would be amazed if the service at any other hotel could match that which involved my wife. It is obvious that the management at this property knows what they are doing!! A big thanks. I would have written this immediately upon our return but I had misplaced the names of the above people who were so gracious to us.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cElegant, quiet, excellent service (but skip the breakfast package)\u201d", "Author": "dlmr1", "ReviewID": "UR115338028", "Content": "We stayed for a couples getaway for two nights.

The price online ranges between 180-300 and in my opinion it's a steal. The service is amazing, staff friendly and the front desk is honestly the best. I got a small room upgrade to a better view which really made a difference, the rooms are modern and very clean. Internet is FREE. No extra service charges that everyone hates. Housekeeping is on the ball and beds, towels and rooms are kept up and you get free bottled water daily in your room. One strange fact is that the lobby is on the 5th floor which is somewhat inconvenient but not the biggest deal. We really enjoyed Chicago but on the last day I didnt feel too hot and decided to take the last flight the day we left. When I called the front desk about a late check-out, they were awesome and let me check out very late for only $78 and even offered me a comp gatorade to make me feel better.

And everything looked brand new. Not a sign of age. I'm lacking in any interior design sense, but I would like to say that good taste is in evidence without interruption from the lobby to the room. Great location in Chicago between Michigan and Rush. Hotel bar was perfect for a nightcap. Luis was terrific as our waiter each night.

When we dropped off our luggage, we were told we were upgraded to a executive suite. When we checked in later in the day, we were checked into a handicap accesable room which had a bedroom and an attached sitting room with a fold out couch which is not what we wanted. We called down but were told the hotel was full and we couldn't be moved. Later we discovered the phone didn't work next to the bed and to make a call, we had to go into the bathroom and that phone kept falling off the wall. The TV remote worked when it wanted to and a movie we rented had the sound so messed up it was like watching an overdubbed karate film from the 70's. Bose system and all. Then the chain came off the toilet plunger as we were departing to dinner the second night at a very bad time. Had to take the back of the toilet off and stick my entire arm in the toilet basin to get it to flush. I was not happy. Room service was VERY expensive after all the fees were added and drinks at the bar were nearly $15.00 each after a reasonable tip. $30.00 is simply too high for a scotch and a magarita unless you are in St. Lucia looking at the Pitons and not a kid screaming in a stroller getting his diaper changed in the bar. And the hotel has no pool and it was perfect swimming weather. There are just better options for the same money and far better options for a bit more jack.

First, the location cannot be beat - central to North Michigan Avenue and walking distance from much of the nicer things in Chicago. The only downside to this is that I do recall hearing some traffic noise on at least one past visit (i.e., sirens traveling down Michigan Avenue), but this is not significant enough to disturb most sleep. The hotel was formerly a Le Meridien, which means that it was built for luxury, and in fact the Conrad Chicago management has continued and kept up the property to very high standards. The amenities in the rooms are top-notch (Bose sound systems, high-quality bedding, etc., etc.). The rooms feel both elegant and comfortable. They are kept spotless by the housekeeping staff. The service within the hotel is exceptional. From the front desk staff, to room service staff, to waiters in the restaurants.

Valet parking $51/night, self-parking $38/night. I choose valet upon arrival since not that much more than self and services provided in case I needed in/out privileges just dial 0+3 digit ticket number for car waiting, but never did as either walked or used CTA trains. I also opted for estandby upgrade for deluxe suite and immediately told not available, but will give you both points and breakfast vouchers when you normally have to choose one for stay. Clerk asked if any guests and I had 2 for 2 separate nights so breakfast vouchers provided complementary for them as well. I also provided their names for key access and breakfast but never necessary as used my 2 keys and my last name for breakfast. The room I selected from echeckin #1107 was provided upon arrival, but room didn't have living room area I needed for my stay and thought from pictures would include and no clear view of Michigan avenue with buildings in the way. I called asking if upgrade available. I got called back quickly with junior suite #957 corner room normally $75 a night upgrade, but complimentary to me as Diamond member. Bell hop brought new keys to exchange quickly. This was what I needed with open living area and more roomy bed&desk area. I had a yoga instructor booked to come to my room so I knew we needed space for the intense workout and this room was ideal for such. Junior suite had window near desk and triple window over couch for direct view of street. 2 thermostats, one for bedroom area with air coming down on head of bed which I love to sleep to snuggled in pillows and covers and the other for living area. Large flat screen TV with Bose sound and iHome radio/Ipod player on nightstand. Like 7 HBO channels and large cable selection. Bose system provided radio and CD selection as well as TV. Really impressed with quietness of room at night but some noise during day as storage room across since end of hall, uber comfy bed and pillows and plenty of hot, soft water in shower and quickly on tap including sink. I do wish both shower and bathtub could have been both larger for accommodating two, but single filed just fine. More for man in shower and woman in tub than for both for either. Outstanding full American breakfast and buffet breakfast fully covered by vouchers. Outstanding selections available on menus. Expected so brought with me but couldn't use HDMI connection to TV in room 957 (upgrade) but noticed available on TV in original checkin room 1107. Friday morning, my friend from Indiana left room for breakfast and we returned with room cleaned and I left my MacBook Pro and IPad 2 out on desk and all there but cables put nicely out of the way. I like to tip $20 per night for maid service for upscale hotels, $10 otherwise. The only thing I struggled with during my stay was receiving wifi login instructions after I was in the room (had to request) and this access expired during my stay so had to request another set of login credentials on Sat. Also, oddly, first access allowed all 3: Apple Mac pro, IPad 2 and IPhone to use global services wifi and my first guest's iPod Thu night, but second access with phone call of credentials only allowed one connection so I chose IPad. Outstanding genuinely friendly and very professional upscale hospitality from all personnel I encountered from valet service and concierge at entrance, especially upon checkin and upgrade request quickly met, bell staff, maid staff and especially also restaurant staff. I received this response on the wifi/HDMI issue I replied to general manager's email for my stay prior to this review and he replied quickly with the following which makes sense for what I encountered. I said sorry, but I am a geek. \"Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your comments. I can say I am a geek as it pertains to our in room technology and I want to improve it yesterday. That said we have started upgrading the TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to handle apple and HDMI inputs. As well we are upping our bandwidth to 100mb soon and that should help high speed.

The room and maid service was always very prompt and efficient. The negatives were that the street noise was a bit loud with lots of sirens but I use earplugs so it wasn't a huge problem. Also, we had a one bedroom corner suite which was lovely but the furnishings in the living area were a bit average (not worn - just a bit boring and bland). However, the suite was huge, very clean and had a large dining table where we enjoyed in room breakfast dining (which was included in our room price). Overall we thought the price for the room, especially when you factored in the free breakfasts, was excellent value given the amount of space we had. Another minor issue was that the window sills in our suite were quite high which detracted from the view. Finally, the hotel entrance is on a different level than the lobby. There was another entrance from Michigan Avenue through the adjacent mall but both entrances required two separate elevators (located a short distance from each other) to reach your room. Not a big deal but a bit of a nuisance when you were tired and just wanted to hurry back to your room to relax after a busy day of sight seeing.

You can book through the automobile club online or through the Conrad Hotel Chicago site directly. Conrad has room upgrades that you can watch and be put on a list to get, if you prefer.

It's clear the hotels don't realize it, but giving Priceline customers less consideration and treatment than a regular rack rate customer would receive is only telling me that I should not (and I won't ) stay at a Conrad again when I am booking a hotel direct.

That bathroom had tons of counterspace - which is imperative for makeup and hair care products. Now on to the negative side of my stay. At check out I had over $40 in mini-bar charges. I never even placed my hand on the handle of the mini-bar. At checkout I had this removed, but it was only removed from my invoice.

The Conrad also offers lots of little extras - at no charge - that you usually either don't get or have to pay for at nice hotels. The rooms have Bose surround sound, great flat panel TVs, separate shower and tub (and the tub is a GREAT, deep soaking tub), free wireless internet, in-room electronic safe, and they even offer a Pillow Menu, with complimentary aromatherapy pillow options. The beds have lots of pillows, but I will say one of the only down sides is that it's not the most comfortable bed I've slept on - still very nice, just a little too firm for my personal liking. For Gold/Diamond members who have the breakfast option, their breakfast is great - it's not a buffet, but rather you order from MANY options (like the things you would see on a buffet) and it's cooked to order and presented very nicely. I'm not a coffee drinker - but for those who are, make sure you either ask for a coffee pot at check in or you can come and have complimentary coffee and tea in their bar/lobby area in the mornings. The staff are all wonderful - very friendly at check in and GREAT bell service... always greeting us with a smile and very willing to help with whatever we might need (boxes, luggage, getting a cab, etc.).

When we went to pack up on Sunday Morning, the bag with shoes and laptop was found to be missing...so after thoroughly checking every inch of both rooms, we reported the missing items and black bag to the front desk personal and they pleasanty said an investigation would take place...we were very appreciative and left to tour the SHed Aquarium...upon returning to the Hotel for a late check out I went back to the rooms to check one more time for the bag with no luck.....Unfortuntely we left the hotel with no laptop or bag with shoes but the Hotel front desk assured us that a investigation would be completed.... After returning to our home, my wife waited until Tuesday, and after no response from the Conrad Chicago, called to inquire about the investigation for the lost black bag with shoes and a laptop...Intitally the staff she spoke with were unaware of any such investigation, not giving up and getting increasingly frustrated my wife eventually was put on the line with the Hotel GM who repeatedly talked over her and essentially called her a liar by stating that there was no evidence that a black bag with shoes and a laptop was brought into or checked in to our room, AND HE THEN HUNG UP ON HER......UNBELIEVABLE !! At this point I became involved and wrote numerous emails to Conrad Staff who eventually FINALLY said they would complete a thorough investigation.....a few days later, \"INCREDIBLY\" after interviewing staff members and searching the Hotel, it was indicated to us that black bag with shoes (BUT NO LAPTOP) had been found under one of the beds in one of our rooms, and it was returned to us promptly...COME ON CONRAD -WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO KID HERE, it is OBVIOUS and does not take a genious to see the FACTS do not lie - there is some type of cover up going on by Hotel staff including the Hotel GM for a laptop that was stolen from us in our room at the Conrad.... ALMOST 3 MONTHS later we have yet to be compensated a single dime for theft of a $1800 Laptop computer that meant even more to our daughter as it had all of her school projects in progress on it ....and we spent over $2,000 at the Hotel for our 2 day stay....REAL NICE CUSTOMER TREATMENT...if you want that I suggest TRUMP Chicago up the street, my wife and I stayed there last month and had a truely 5 star experience!! I have resisted sharing my experience here as I typically like to take the high road and expected that a Hotel such as the Conrad would make this bad experience right promptly ....BUT THEY HAVE NOT, IN FACT THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO DRAG THIS SITUATION ON TERRIBLY, NOT TAKE ANY ACCOUNTABILTY OR ACCEPTANCE OF BLAME FOR OUR LOSS, AND MOST INFURIATING, they have INSULTED MY WIFE AND I ALONG THE WAY....", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elgin, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLove the Conrad!\u201d", "Author": "mhsun", "ReviewID": "UR93967056", "Content": "Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, best location in the city and got it at a great rate.

The suite was truly lovely, living room, bedroom, large bathroom and fabulous views from the huge terrace overlooking Michigan Ave....I didn't even notice the cold December weather. I thought it was a really nice touch having complimentary hot chocolate in the lobby. It really added to the ambiance, holiday spirit. Definitely made it more festive. And it gave us a chance to meet and mingle a bit with some of the other hotel guests. Well, I enjoyed it and far more than I would have ever thought. As a Hilton Gold VIP, I received breakfast coupons. They have a HHonors breakfast on the menu. You can choose anything from a list - coffee, juice, toast, oatmeal, yogurt, fresh fruit (my ideal breakfast), plus - eggs, potatoes, pastries, cold cereal. For me, the breakfast was perfect. The location is excellent! Located at the Shops at North Bridge, which for a shopper like me, came in handy for a last minute Christmas gift. Didn't even have to put my coat on when I made a dash for Nordstrom. I really like that the Conrad Chicago uses Acca Kappa bath products. I love the White Moss scent. And as a female, I appreciate better quality bath products. With that said, I think this hotel is also a good fit for Bvlgari and L'Occitane bath products too. It would be really great if part of the amenities was a small loofah or a mesh sponge to use with the shower gel. The one thing missing for me, as I forgot to pack one.

Housekeeping did a great job and we tipped $20.00 per day and it paid off with all the extra bottles of water left in our room each day and mints on our pillows and 2 coupons for a free large pizza and a local pizza pub, which was great. The room was ok, but i think it needs work. It just needs some good art work and the wood work in our room needed touch up. I'am not a hotel snob by any means. The bath/soak tub was great. If you request a bath butler it will cost $83.00 for him to prepare a bath for you with oils and salts. My wife passed on the due to the cost. You would think they would get much more business if they lowered the cost a bit. We had 5 drinks in the hotel lounge at a cost of $122.00. Lets just say we only did this once and found a great little pub close buy with way cheaper drinks. The room service prices were crazy. $23.00 for shrimp cocktail plus 18% tip and $5.00 service charge. We never ordered room service at these prices. Because of the high prices we ate elsewhere every night. Like i said it is a great location, but there are alos several other great hotels in the same area.

This year I've tended to rotate around between the Trump, the Conrad and the new Hotel Palomar, based on price and availability.

I still like the hotel very much--beds are comfy, decor is nice. It's a very comfortable place to stay. A few observations: Early-month trip: When I checked in, they had a spread of fruit and water in the room with a card with someone else's name on it. Obviously, not my room. But, they let me stay and keep the stuff, which was nice. Ended up having to work late hours in the room and had occasion to order room service. Really excellent food. Even the fries were good in a unique way. Room service guy was great, very conscientious, though it took way too long. With those TVs, though, they need to update to HD. Put on a movie to keep me up while working and the no HD option really reduced the benefit of the $15 movie. Also, when I called about the fact that the lamps in the room would just randomly turn off, the response wasn't helpful. I called twice over my 3-day trip. Never was fixed. On the plus side, the front desk was able to extend my stay at the same rate when I had to stay another day, so that was nice. Late-month overnight: On the late month stay, I discovered that if you don't pay for a room, that have the tiniest room ever just waiting for you. Definitely too small by Chicago standards. Not even room in the bathroom for a separate shower stall. Kind of bummed by the fact that on a weekend when the hotel obviously wasn't full that I couldn't get even a normal room for the zillion points they charged.

Sadly, my expectations were not met. Upon arrival, we were given a hotel with a window that was impossible to shut properly. Ok, change of room. The room was nice enough, but only because we gotten a high floor room faced away from the Mich. Avenue. Some rooms are really close to the terrace restaurant /bar- those should probably be avoided at all costs. The concierge service was almost non-excisting. When we asked if they could book a food tour for us, the man at the concierge desk advised us to do it ourself online. Okay, why didnt I think of that in the first place? The fitness room was very Hampton Inn-style. No water bottles or cold towels, and the room was very hot and humid (where was the air con?). No permanent staff supervising the room. To our surprise, there were no turn down service. When I asked about this, I was told that this had to be ordered spesifically. However, the breakfast was truly amazing. I have never tasted a better omelet with potatoes. Loved that they had a HHonors breakfast menu option, never seen that before. The room itself was great too. Huge, with a lovely bathroom. No bathtub, though. Some channels on the TV were missing/not working, like Fox. When I asked about this, they could not give me an answer on why. Told me that they would send a technican - but I guess they forgot, All in all a good stay, but not a great one. I actually found Conrad Indianpolis a little bit better. The location is hard to beat, but then again there are a lot of nice hotels in the area. I got a great rate, and therefore choose to give this hotel a 4 star rating.

Appreciated the separate door to the water closet.

The FITNESS CENTER was above average. If memory serves, there were 3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 3 stationary bikes, a few weight machines, and a full set of dumbells. I visited the FC at 8:30 a.m. on a Saturday and the only wait was for an elliptical. The complimentary aromatherapy pillows are a nice touch, and the eucalyptus offering helped with the travel-induced congestion. Also appreciated by both my teenager and me was the COMPLIMENTARY WIRELESS, to which we connected effortlessly. The hotel was at full capacity, but we did not have long waits for elevators as i have had at other area hotels. We did not try the restaurant or room $ervice. Had this been an adult-trip, the terrace looked like a perfect spot for a post-shopping cocktail.

The next day, after going out for lunch and then a ballgame, we returned in the evening to find two HUGE spiders on our ceiling. Called down to the front desk to see if they had any other rooms available. The receptionist stated they were completely booked for the night but offered to place us in their 'last sell' room. As we had no other option and did not want to stay in our original room, we took this new room, #536. The room itself was fine... handicap accessible, which made the shower and bathroom wide and open. However, the bedroom directly faced the Terrace Bar, which was in operation from 11:30am-midnight. Closing the curtains relieved the problem of the patrons being able to see inside the room, but it didn't alleviate the noise coming from the bar's music system. The next day, we were moved to a 3rd room, #936. This was slightly larger than the 1st two rooms and we had no issues with this one. Would have been great if we had this room for our entire stay. Staying in 3 different rooms during our 3-night stay was not the ideal way to celebrate an anniversary trip. I will commend the Conrad's staff for being as helpful and accomodating as possible. As we were using points, they stated they could not refund any portion of them. But they did offer a complimentary lunch in the Restaurant, which was quite good.

The major problem is much like the Phoenician in Scottsdale -- just like the Phoenciain has all of those horrible rooms in their \"basement\" area on the first floor where on the back side of the hallway, the rooms are dark because they are partially underground -- in the same manner, the Conrad has a number of rooms that are located by their roof-top bar. I stayed my first night in one -- Room 536 -- that was located literally right beside the bar. I could sit at the desk and the bar patrons were within 6 feet of me - just on the other side of the glass. Thank goodness the curtains were not lie the curtains in those Days Inn / Motel Six motels where the outside hallways are right next to the front window. But roof-top bars have become popular in Chicago and the Conrad needs this apparently. But if you have one of these rooms, your nights will be short. so unless you can live on 4-5 hours of sleep, try another hotel -- or ensure that the Conrad will guarantee you a room away from the bar. Bell service is fair, registration is on 5th floor, property is very clean, restaurant is good at least for breakfast and lunch (did not try for dinner).", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but staff needs to receive some training\u201d", "Author": "ryanberry2", "ReviewID": "UR81834992", "Content": "Let me first say that this hotel came recommended to me by the Trump Hotel when I was unwilling to pay $550 per night for one of their rooms. The Conrad is a good hotel and it is located in a great location if you're interested in shopping or sight-seeing downtown. Most of the staff was very helpful and consiterate however the stay was not without its complications which will keep me from staying there in the future. At $1,195 for three nights (by the time you pay taxes) you certainly want it right and they did not make it \"right\". The first issue was that after unpacking three suit cases I started to notice a faint but unpleasant smell. It took me a while to locate the issue but I eventually found a large plate of rotten strawberries encased in mold that had been overlooked by staff for sometime. I don't think it was housekeeping's fault as I found them in the food cabinet that was I was told his monitored by someone else but it was nasty and it hadn't been there for just a few days. They offered to move my room but we had just unpacked and after a very long trip I just decided to stay in the room as I was not looking to spend another hour packing, moving and unpacking. Later we tried to book a boat tour and a restaurant reservation through the \"concierge\" who was just the front desk guy sitting in as the concierge. He said that he could make those reservations and that they do that all of the time for guests. He told me that he would leave a note in my room related to the time of my dinner reservation the following night. We left for the day and came back at night to find there was no note, there was no voicemail and there was no reservation. I had to go to the front desk where they told me that seating was not available and that they were \"sorry\". Well, that's great but it sure would have been nice to know that I needed to make a reservation somewhere else rather than having to seak out the \"no\" answer after I had tipped the guy 5 bucks to make a phone call. I then asked them if they could suggest any other restaurants for the following evening but they said they were booked up. So I decided to call one of the restaurants myself and found that they had plenty of seating and to \"pick whatever time I wanted\" after 7pm. So, moral of the story...don't expect them to help you book anything and if you do, check behind them and don't bother tipping because it makes no difference. This is not what you expect from a $350 per night hotel! Oh, did I mention that I paid for the \"Bed and Breakfast\" package which they failed to recognize at check in and then I had to remind them of the package and go collect my \"breakfast vouchers\" which ended up not even covering my full breakfast.! Each day I spent about $15 bucks on breakfast for me and my wife even though Breakfast was suppose to be included. Little things like coffee for one person is $6 bucks! Again, I understand this kind of thing normally but when you're told that \"Breakfast is included in the Bed and Breakfast package\" then you shouldn't have to spend an extra $45 dollars over three days to get breakfast! So, is it a good hotel in terms of location and comfort, yes it is. Is it worth $300+ per night, no it's not. Does the staff need some serious training and maybe a visit to the Ritz or the Trump....definitely! Oh, and don't spend the extra money on the Romance package that comes with strawberries because you will likely have left over strawberries in your room when you get there....Have fun finding them!", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pinckney, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWent the extra miles\u201d", "Author": "seamus62", "ReviewID": "UR81763385", "Content": "We had a recent trip to Chicago for a special celebration.

The Conrad absolutely made our stay phenomenal with great attentiveness and luxury! The level of service that we received was entirely unexpected in this economy, and it was such a pleasure. I was concerned about security, driving into downtown Chicago and parking by myself with my son, but it was perfectly fine. We utilized the hotel parking garage (Northbridge?) and although pricy ($38 per day, with in-and-out priveledges), it was very safe, clean, and convenient. It was a great first impression. When we checked in we were greeted by wonderful staff who 'oohed and aahed' over my son and his birthday trip, and even gave him a cute little stuffed cow. He thought that was great! Our room was SO very nice - from the HUGE tv with a larger than normal channel selection (my son's favorite) to the extreme cleanliness. It truly could not have been more comfortable. It was also obvious that it had been freshly painted, and the furnishings and decor seemed brand new. The beds were very luxurious, and the bathroom absolutely beautiful. I did miss an in-room coffee maker, but the quality of the complimentary coffee service in the bar was worth getting dressed and going downstairs every morning. On my son's birthday night we got back to the room and had a surprise amenity waiting for us - birthday milk and cookies! That was such a wonderful, personal, attention to detail that continues to be one of our favorite memories from the weekend. Check out and getting out of the parking garage went very smoothly, although we were sad to go. It was about an hour south of Chicago that I realized a big problem - I had left a number of credit cards and my checkbook in the room safe! I tried not to panic, and immediately called the hotel. I was forwarded to the Security office and the officer handled the situation with sensitivity and finesse. I am very grateful for his empathy and problem solving, and he was able to retrieve my items and recommended shipping them to me. He facilitated this process smoothly, with multiple phone calls back to me, and took steps to assure me as to the items' security. Again, I am bowled over by the level of service and luxury at the Conrad and I cannot wait to come back again!

Due to my job (as well as my wife and my love for travel) I have had the opportunity to stay at some of the nicest hotels around the world. I also spend about 150 nights a year at hilton owned properties and think that the service I received this past Saturday at the Conrad was above and beyond everything else I have received - ever. The staffs willingness to meet my requests (a room upgrade upgrade, a late night candlelit dessert on the terrace) and the desire to make my stay a truly special night for my wife was above and beyond my expectations.

I was a little concerned about the room quality since most hotels don't favor 3rd party bookings. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the Chicago trip was a last minute decision. We drove into town and utilized the self-park garage located across the street from the Rush Street entrance. The Chicago Conrad is located above the Nordstrom shopping center. When entering from Rush Street you take a elevator up to the lobby which is located on the 5th floor. The Terrace Restaurant is located right off the lobby on the 5th floor. I was under the impression it was a roof-top area which it is but it's above the sky-bridge building above Rush Street not the actual hotel roof-top. Check-in was quick and efficient. The young lady at the front desk was helpful answering questions and provided us a shopping map with restaurant locations. She also validated our parking which is $38 daily for self-park with in and out privileges. Valet is available at a different rate. We were assigned to a room on the 12th floor which turned out to be a handicap accessible room. There is no soaking tub in the bathroom or a separate room for the toilet. The shower is extra large with a unsightly shower curtain. This is what I was afraid of using airline miles to book the room (hotel staff was aware we are HH Members) My husband called the front desk and requested a room with a soaking tub. The hotel was able to accommodate our request. A bellman quickly appeared with a set of keycards to our new room located on the 8th floor. Overall the room was nice but nothing WOW. The service was good but nothing extraordinary (no one acknowledged our anniversary). I wasn't disappointed but wasn't impressed at the same time. The best thing about this hotel is the location. Great shopping, great city, great restaurants all within a few steps. We have stayed at the Conrad Indianapolis a number of times and the Chicago Conrad just can't compare to the luxurious rooms, amenities, and service they offer.

Two things to mention that were not good and kept me from giving a perfect score: the rooms don't have a coffee maker for coffee or tea service. I suppose they want you to order the way over-priced coffee or tea from room service. They do have coffee / tea available in the lobby in the morning, but if you like to have a cup while you are getting ready in the morning you are outta luck. One morning they had run out of black tea (they only had decaf and green teas) and I asked the hostess to restock some black tea. She seemed really put out that I had asked for this. They just need to put an ample supply out there and have some easily available to restock it. Another morning the hot water had cooled to just a bit over luke warm. Of course all of this would be for not if they just did what every other hotel in America does and put a coffee maker in the room. The second problem was brought up by other reviews: some of the staff (not all, by any stretch, but some) are pretty snooty and you almost feel like they are looking down their nose at you.

I'd have previously good experiences at the Conrad, and the hotel did not disappoint on this trip. The hotel was excellent in all respects, and it remains a hotel I look forward to staying in. On the first stay, I was initially assigned to a room that wasn't to my liking (a bit close to the elevators and without a view); when I asked if another room was available, the front desk staff member graciously assigned me to a room with a much better view, far from the elevators. Even though I would have understood if a better room wasn't available, I appreciated this highly responsive service. On the second stay, I was upgraded (thanks to my Hilton HHonors status) to a huge suite with an amazing balcony overlooking Michigan Ave. Wow! The room quality at the Conrad is very high -- enormous bathrooms with a shower and deep-soaking tub. Awesome robes. Slippers! Comfortable, adjustable desk chair. Nice working area. Flexible lighting. Ample plugs. Large closets. Amazingly comfortable beds -- the sort that make it very, very difficult to get out of, no matter how important the meeting! The window coverings also have a luxurious feel, and they block the light. There are lots of other thoughtful touches, from the map of running routes from the hotel to the complimentary shoe shines. My dining experiences were acceptable. I had breakfast at the restaurant. Service was very nice, although a little on the slow side. Coffee was delicious. My fruit plate was tasty. Room service was prompt, which I appreciated; food quality was OK (I've had equally good room service at far less expensive hotels with much, much cheaper room service). I do hope the Conrad keeps up with facility needs. While there was nothing beat up enough to be disgusting, there's some \"rough around the edges\" elements that need to be taken care of -- baseboards and door frames that are chipped, a couple of wood surfaces on the furniture in the room that are starting to peel, etc. Nothing anything big in the scheme of things (as, overall, the hotel has an elegant, classic design), but if the Conrad wants to live-up to its 5-star billing in every respect, it should watch these things -- those are details that other 5-star properties (Ritz, etc.) don't wait until the next major renovation to fix. None affected the quality of my stay, however -- and most people probably wouldn't notice them (I tend to be a bit of an eagle-eye for that stuff thanks to the amount of time I spent in hotels). Overall, this is a great hotel. It's on the smaller side (for Chicago), and it's typically very quiet and elegant feeling. These are great touches considering its location -- it is surrounded by some HUGE hotels with very noisy, active lobby spaces. I think it's a gem in Chicago -- it rarely is hugely more expensive than surrounding hotels and offers a service and room experience that is vastly superior to its competition in the area.

We found several great restaurants nearby (Rosebud's Steakhouse and Benny's Chop House were absolutely our favorites!), it was an easy walk to the Theater District and just a bit further to Millenium Park and the Bean. We would recommend the easy- to-navigate train system or the always available taxi cabs for a visit to the Sears (oops!), Willis Tower. We also walked to Navy Pier and the Chicago River Boat Tour. The hotel staff was very accomodating. They were able to provide recommendation for dinner that met our needs, although we used TripAdvisor for the final decisions. We were asked prior to our arrival of any special requests we would like in the room, including fluffy down pillows at no extra charge. The free, in room wi-fi was a treat as was the flat screen plasma with a Bose surround sound system. The bathroom was stocked with quality toiletries, a magnifying mirror, a huge tub with seperate shower (didn't care for the clear glass doors), and a seperate toilet area. I loved the drawers in the bathroom that allowed us to put our toiletries out of sight and not all over the counter.

My arrival night was Super Bowl Sunday and I arrivied just in time for the game after a 3 hour delay at the airport. The staff was great as usual, especially the front door staff who were great all week. And it was a joy to watch the game on the 42\" TV with Bose surround sound. As a Diamond member, I was upgraded to a corner executive room with a wall of windows on both exterior walls, one facing Michigan Avenue. Even with all of these windows, the room was pretty quiet with little street noise. I sleep better at the Conrad then at any other hotel I have ever stayed at due to the very comfortable bed and pillows. Several nights I had to work and the desk was roomy. The desk chair was not the most comfortable for long periods but worked fine. I also had to remove the desk lamp shade for the best light, but no big deal. A couple small things I loved about the room and something any decent hotel should have (but not all do) is a safe large enough for a laptop computer and power outlets near the bed to charge the cell phone. I could go on and on about the overall experience but I think the best compliment to the hotel is the fact that I traveled with a co-worker this trip. She had never stayed at the Conrad.

The only drawback at all was that the beds had pillowtop mattresses that tended to dip down on the edge so that you had to try to sleep more towards the middle or it felt like you were rolling off the ede of the bed. If both people were rather large, it could be a little uncomfortable. The pillows were comfortable and they give you a lot of them. The TV was just great - a flat screen that was at least 42\" or maybe more, and the BOSE sound system was awesome. The bathroom was spacious with separate spaces for the toilet and sink areas. The location of this hotel can't be beat. It's right in the heart of everything and was very convenient for shopping, sightseeing and restaurants.

My mom being in a wheelchair, required my search for a hotel to be very thorough and a bit demanding. We wanted GREAT location, 5 star category, and spacious wheelchair accesible rooms with a Walk-In shower. I was suprised to find out that one should NOT asume that a 5 star hotel will have these types of rooms. Some just don't (Westin). We got a great deal ($220-$240 a night). Eventhough the rate didn't include any meals at all, we all agreed that it was worth every penny. The service was wonderful, beginning with Bell Boys, then Front Desk, Then restaurant Staff (great food by the way), the housekeeping staff...just about anyone I can remember was courteus, very considerate with my mom ( and us) The concierge gave is good tips on where to Dine (for all budgets) and the best recomendation was the Architectural River Tour (Chicago Line). We saw other companies offered it, which mostly departed from Navy Pier, but this one has it's harbor on a separate location. The boats were better, the guide was awesome, and the price included Starbucks coffee, muffins and cookies. Make sure to take a cap or hat and sunblock, since the 90 min tour is on a completely uncovered deck, so you can appreciate the buildings. The rooms were much larger than your average double room. Eventhough I was hoping for 2 queen beds, we got 2 full size beds. The bathroom was extremely acomodating, we were able to actually \"wheel\" my mom into the shower...which had a fold-in bench for her to sit on, hooked to the wall (VERY convenient). We had room service twice, when my sister could not get her body moving without her coffee. The actually send you the french press and press it right there, so the coffee is as fresh as can be. They have a very lively bar by the main lobby, which is mostly populated by business collegues (this is not your typical family friendly hotel). On the same floor , a beautiful Terrace overlooking downtown Chicago (Main Lobby is on the 5th floor) with a limited but very creative menu offering a variety of \"tapa-like\" appetizers that range from asian cuisine to eclectic dishes that were nothing but exquisite. We tried The Terrace once too, and we left very satisfied both with the amount of food and the quality/taste. Considering it is a 5 star hotel, the prices on the menus (Main Restaurant inside, Terrace and the Bar) are considerably high. You can have a delicious breakfast consisting of eggs / omelette , toast, juice & coffee which will be in the neighborhood of the 25 - 30 dlls. The PLUS of this hotel is, ...if you don't want to spend all of your per diem on meals, COSI is right across the street where they have 2 or 3 VERY decent choices for breakfats, Quiche, Croissants and excellent coffee. We also discovered (halfway through our stay!) that there is a passage that connects the hotel directly to a mall, where NORDSTROMS is, and in it, the Nordstroms Cafe, which will serve you a very good breakfast (simple fruit or bagel or as complex as a delicious Veggie Omelette) for aprox. $10.00 So...you have all the choices right there. The location is another plus. It is within walking distance of the best Malls, Miracle Mile, Navy Pier (which I do not recommend unless you like shopping for \"I Love Chicago\" T-Shirts and Key Rings), a dozen or more of the best restaurants in downtown Chicago, and many more attractions. A cab ride to the financial district or the Theatre Disctrict is no longer than 10 minutes, and will cost you around $5 - $7 dlls at the most. I am an extremely light sleeper and I can asure anyone that the rooms are soundproof and they start on the 5th floor, so all the rooms are quite far from the street noises. The only one thing we complained about was the extremely cold temperature they keep the lobby and hallways at (around 55 - 60 F) and the bath towels (to thin and rough). I will be writing a separate review for the points of interest, with comments on Wheelchair accesibility, surrounding neighborhoods , dining and museums. We would definatelly go back to this hotel.

Check-in was quick and very pleasant.My room was on the 6th floor,cityview. Both of our rooms were identical. The entryway to the room was spacious. The room had a large (50\"?)flatscreen TV, desk with comfortable leather chair, easy chair with ottoman and a dresser with 3 drawers for storage. For the life of me, I cannot understand why this hotel does not have wifi, just old fashioned wire hookup.There was a good sized closet equipped with a large Conrad shopping bag to carry home your souvenirs. The closet was also eqipped with slippers, cloth laundry bags and an umbrella for use during inclement weather. Because of the hotels proximity to a firehouse, the area can be loud at times I never did hear anything from other rooms or hallways the 2 nights I stayed and there was a convention in town, so I was quite impressed with the quietness. The bathroom was \"Kohler\" branded with luxurious marble countertops and floors, a tub, and glass enclosed shower. Toiletries were Italian, but also included Q-tips, flossing sticks, mouthwash and a toothbrush with a very small tube of Colgate toothpaste included. The toilet was seperated by a door from the bathroom. The towels were very thin and worn as mentioned by others. The hotel had a bar with around 12 barstools and tables and easy chairs to accomodate another 28-30 patrons. There were more tables and easy chairs in the area surrounding the lounge entrance. The bartender and his assistant were very good at their jobs and pleasant to boot. I only used the restaurant for breakfast. I was given vouchers for a free Continental breakfast. The vouchers were worth $14.00 and could be used as credit for any item on the menu. I opted for the American breakfast which consisted of eggs, potatoes, a meat item, toast, juice and coffee or tea. The price was $19.00. The portions were on the small side and I would have definitely opted for another restaurant if I didn't have the vouchers. Onlike some other comments about the staff, I was very happy with the service I received from my waiter and waitress. The hotel itself is in a great area for shopping, and a 20 minute walk to the waterfront. It is also a 5 minute walk to the C.T.A. Redline, which is great for traveling to the friendly confines of Wrigley Field or connecting to other train lines. My ride coming into the city from ORD on Friday evening was about a 35 minute ride and $45.00 +tip. On Sunday morning, the ride took about 25 minutes and cost me $36.00 + tip. Having Diamond status in the Hilton Honors program, the only thing I was slightly disappointed about was the lack of an executive lounge. But I knew this going in. Overall, the hotel was everything I expected. Because of the lack of an executive lounge, I will probably try the Drake Hotel the next time I am in Chicago.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cVery solid experience\u201d", "Author": "brmusicman", "ReviewID": "UR30254277", "Content": "I have stayed at the Conrad Hotel a few times, for both business and leisure. This trip, in May, 2009, was for leisure (a long weekend in Chicago). Given that I keep returning, I obviously like the hotel. The rooms are well-appointed, the decor is on the luxe end without being ostentatious, the fitness center is awesome, and the location -- right on Michigan Avenue, with the car entrance on Rush -- cannot be beat for easy access to downtown Chicago and beyond (the subway is only a block away). This latest stay offered another solid experience. The hotel does position itself as a high-end property, and it mostly fits the bill. The concierge service is always excellent, and there are several thoughtful amenities [slippers, plush robes, fantastic AV in the room (including DVD & CD player at no additional charge), huge bathrooms, luxe bathroom products, umbrella, complimentary shoe shine, fabric laundry bags, etc.]. The bell service is always very nice. The property seems to cater to an older, but not ancient, crowd, so it does feel like a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave., and because the hotel is smaller than most of the properties on Michigan, the lobby lacks some of the craziness of the big hotels. I think the only areas where the hotel misses the mark a bit are in some of the detail work other luxe properties (like Ritz and Four Seasons, which the hotel positions itself as competing against) get 100% correct. For instance, the ATM in the lobby wasn't reading cards, but the staff didn't know it; turndown service was forgotten in our room one night; the hotel's newsletter in our room, detailing movies shown on its terrace during the summer and fall, was very old and featuered the 2008, rather than 2009, schedule. Also, I attempted to order a simple room service breakfast one morning (some pastries and coffee), and I was told that the wait would be one hour because the kitchen was overwhelmed (I appreciated the honesty, but an hour for coffee and a croissant?). Most of my stays have been with a pretty great rate, so I haven't minded these small things, but if I was paying the rack rate for the hotel I'd been more sensitive to some of these things.

It's a good quality hotel, with service to match - the staff are well-trained and friendly, and generally efficient. The check-in was helpful, the housekeeping and concierge staff dealt with some of my dumb questions with tact, and the bellboys did a good job with good grace. The room was large and well decorated. There was a huge TV with DVD player (and a good range of free-to-loan DVDs at the concierge desk), played through a small Bose sound system with CD capability. There was also an ipod player, which made my teenage daughter very happy. The beds were large and comfortable (maybe slightly soft, but for some that might be a plus), and the window opened (a little) so you can sleep in fresh air. The bathroom was large and well-lit. The internet worked well, on both LAN (hooray!) and wireless, and was free, which is increasingly and annoyingly rare in good hotels. So expectations were high! The negatives? No bathtub. I like to soak and read a book before I go to bed, especially on a leisure trip. Humph. No tea/coffee in the room - I like to be able to make tea when I travel, and carry my own supplies of my favourites... they went unused on this trip. And you have to take two elevators to get to street level as the lobby's on level 5, so \"just popping out\" for something is a more major exercise. Parking is in the public garage opposite, and even with a hotel discount it's expensive. But there were all, I guess, part of the hotel's service proposition, and it was, overall, a good one. I had two complaints that could have been better handled. First, on one of the days, housekeeping forgot to make up the room, and we had to remind them as we went out for dinner in the evening. Secondly, and more seriously, I need to keep hard copy of final bills for my tax records, and, for the first time EVER (I spend over 100 nights a year in hotels, and have done for years)... let me repeat, for the first time EVER - the front desk couldn't issue me a final bill - they asked my to call some 1800 number to get a copy sent! That didn't make it a bad stay, but it did make it an administratively inconvenient one. But generally, assuming you can get a good rate (we paid about US$250 for a twin-bed room), it is a good value, high quality hotel.

For someone that is Hilton Gold or Diamond, this property definately does NOT worth the extra cost to stay, as you will get very basic treatment compare to Conrad Hong Kong. No exec. lounge is the first down side, plus you will only get a continental breakfest coupon. I know for a fact that even if Conrad Hong Kong has no exec. floor rooms available for upgrade, you will still get a buffet breakfest at the restaurant, but this does not apply to Conrad Chicago. I did however still manage an \"upgrade\" to a city view room. City View room is not much of a city view, basically it is the view looking north on rush street, most of the view is blocked by the next door Marriott, as it is much taller than Conrad, you only get some view on the left side for some residential and commercial buildings, no landmarks like Sears Tower or Water Tower. I would strongly suggest for those not to pay extra $40 for the city view room, not worth it at all. I found that my room is not that much different than a nicer Hilton, with the exception of large flat screen HDTV, comes with Bose surround sound. Bathroom is like other conrads, with separate tub and shower, plus another door to a separate toilet. I found that it is very odd for the deep tub, but very narrow, it would be a problem for a slightly bigger person to take a bath. Bath towels are really thin. Also there is no TV to watch while you are taking a bath like Conrad Hong Kong. Turn down service is available but missing all the little touches, no slippers put next to the bed, no chocolates, no fold out one corner of the comforter to invite you to bed. However, an extra two bottles of water were put on the night stand. The most important thing, missing the signature conrad toy ! I went downstairs and ask the front desk, it is a cow for Conrad Chicago, but it is only available on request, also no plastic duck next to the bath tub like in Conrad Hong Kong. Basically the only upside for this Conrad is even you are at the cheapest room, you will still get the upscale ACCA KAPPA bath amenities instead of in Conrad Hong Kong, unless you stay in exec.floor rooms, you will only get some unknown conrad brand bath products.

We arrived a little early and were concerned that a room may not be available for us at that time but our request for a king room was met with no problems. The man at reception was very pleasant, and helpful. He asked us if it was our first time visiting Chicago and we told him it was, despite having passed through O'Hare Airport endless times! He seemed very keen to help us in any way and gave us maps and directions to anywhere we wanted to go, and any advice that we needed. Our room was lovely. It was spacious, modern and very clean. The plasma tv was fabulous and the bed was very comfortable. We didn't have a view to speak of but that didn't bother us, as we hadn't booked a particular view anyway. The bathroom was great with a seperate shower which we're a fan of. We like hotels that are modern, and have clean lines and unfussy decor so the Conrad was just to our taste. The turndown service was very nice, with the obligatory chocolates! A huge draw for this hotel is its location- right on Michigan Avenue, attached to The Shops at North Bridge mall which was very handy. It was about a 10 minute walk to John Hancock Building, 20 minutes to Sears Tower, 15 minutes to Grant Park (at a leisurely pace) and less than 5 minutes away from many of the boat tours that go along the river and Lake Michigan, along with Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower. It was absolutely perfect. We even found when we took the free trolley back from Navy Pier, that it stops almost exactly at the front of the hotel! We didn't eat in the hotel at all because there was so much choice in terms of cafes and restaurants right on the doorstep. The room service menu did look a little pricey but I would say no more than other hotels in the same rating. When the hotel really came into its own for us was on the day we were due to check out. We were up early as we were due to fly to Houston that morning and we found an envelope pushed under our door. Our travel agent had faxed the hotel to tell them that American Airlines had changed our flight to one about 8 hours later and to let us know immediately. Not only did they do that, but they extended our check out time for a few hours to make up for the inconvenience. We thought it was very good of the hotel to do that, especially as the inconvenience was nothing to do with them. We made sure we told them at check out how grateful we were and they gave us the impression that nothing was too much trouble for them. We absolutely loved Chicago (it ranks right up there as one of our favourite places) and we're sure that our perfect stay in Conrad Chicago, was a big contributing factor to that.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at a great Chicago hotel\u201d", "Author": "IntegrityTravel", "ReviewID": "UR22332136", "Content": "AC POWER Suite, had power at the desk, and some at the night stands, but still found myself running an extension cord to get the laptop to the bed.

Housekeeping came to room about 15 minutes later and made the pull out and left 1 bottle of water, that was the extent of turn down.

The food was average. Again that night, no turn down service, called the desk and they sent someone up, she came with a scoop of ice and 2 bottles of water this time.

I picked this hotel based on the many other positive TripAdvisor reviews. In terms of location, the Conrad has a lot going for it: it's located near the southern end of the Magnificent Mile, two blocks from the Grand (Red line) station. This makes it a short walk from many of Chicago's attractions such as Navy Pier, Millennium Park, the Art Institute, and the John Hancock Tower. Wrigley Field is a short train ride away. In the immediate area surrounding the hotel there are a large number of restaurants, both formal and casual, as well as numerous places to grab a cup of coffee. While not as chic as a W, the rooms were smartly decorated and in nice condition. The Conrad definitely says \"business first.\" The bed was not as overly plush as a Heavenly Bed, but still quite comfortable. As you might expect, hotel offers nightly turn-down service. The staff--front desk, concierge, housekeeping, bell desk--were extremely friendly and helpful. I shared an elevator ride with a man who I believed to be the manager and even though I was in full tourist dress mode (t-shirt & shorts) he never gave me \"the look.\" After all, I'm paying the same rate a businessperson pays! My only complaint has to do with hotel access. The hotel's entrance is on actually on Rush St. with the lobby on the 5th floor. If your room is above the 8th floor, you must take a second elevator to get to your floor. While it's possible to enter the hotel from Michigan Ave. you must walk through the mall (The Shops at North Bridge) and take an elevator up to the 5th floor. This made it a bit awkward, especially when the mall elevator was out of service.

For the price we paid, we really enjoyed the hotel. But if I had to ever pay full price (about $300 a night), I would stay elsewhere. About a week before we arrived, I called the hotel to request a King room since the room we were given by Hotwire was a Double. We were told that they could not even put the request in and that it could only be made when we arrived at check in. Never had a hotel say that they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even put in the request. At check-in, I requested a King room.

We were put in a room on the 8th floor. I think it was either room 826 or 829. Well the room was decent but the view was HORRIBLE. Our view consisted of the rooftop of the smaller building next door littered with trash and beer bottles and the taller office building next to that. We could literally see into the conference rooms and the cubes and the employees on their headsets. The room was very spacious. Beds were nice and comfy. Bose system and the plasma/LCD TV was nice. However, the remote to the Bose system didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. This controlled all the sound/volume for the music and the TV. I left a note with housekeep the next day wrapped around the remote. They took the remote to get it fixed. But they never brought it back for the remainder of our stay. Kind of annoying when you have to keep getting up to change the volume when watching TV or listening to music. Turndown service was nice. They leave bottles of water, filled the ice bucket and turn on the jazz music. But be careful with the water bottles. The first night we came back after dinner, I almost took a sip out of one of the bottles only to see that it had already been open (the seal ring thing was broken). I put it level on the table next to the other bottle of water and sure enough, it looks like someone had already taken a sip or two out of it. Housekeeping was really good. Always there early during the day to clean the room. We ate dinner one night at the terrace. The food and drinks were okay but the prices were outrageous. In the end, for the price that we paid, it was a good hotel. But for people who are paying full price, customer service, rooms and attention to detail need to be a lot better than what we received.

Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. There is a contemporary boutique feel to the decor throughout and the rooms are spacious enough and have fantastic 42\" flat screen TV's There are nice little touches like the nightly turndown service and there is a roof top bar that really is a plus point in the summer and a superb fitness centre. However, there are too many little annoyances that make this only a good rather than the great hotel it could and should be. Firstly: - This is a pet friendly hotel and as someone who is not a dog lover, sharing an elevator ride with two dogs each the size of a Hummer was not a pleasant experience!. Secondly: - Apparently, the Hilton group have only recently acquired this property and it seems as though they are still ironing out the kinks. The staff don't appear to be all on the same page They are typical of my experience with the Hilton group - friendly, hard working and eager to please, but at the rooftop bar for example, I was charged three different prices by three different people for the same drinks, on the same night!. Thirdly; - There is some blatant price gouging here - particularly the business centre (minimum charge $17!) and breakfast (the bed & breakfast rate only gives you money towards the full cost of breakfast!) They even begrudge you a free cup of coffee after 8am - you have to request a coffeemaker in your room - I did, twice by e-mail and suprise, suprise no coffeemaker when I got there!. I seriously think they must have made a deal with the owner of the coffeeshop across the road as there were long lines of Conrad guests every morning that I was there!. All in all this is not a particularly tourist or business friendly hotel and I don't know who exactly they are aiming at for their Clientele.

We were in Chicago for a short vacation, and wanted to ensure that our accomodations would be top notch and were willing to pay for that. The hotel location is very good, but so is the Marriot next door, Hyatt down the street, and Intercontinental across the street. However, on arrival the entire lobby / street entrance was undergoing construction, and you have to walk through a less than appealing maze to get to the actual reception, of course there was no mention of this prior to arrival. A very bright note of the stay was the concierge service throughout. Nothing less than excellent. The room itself was unfinished, with receptacle wall plates missing where contractors must have assumed that the curtain was going to hide them. The rooms have large Flat Screen TVs and Bose sound systems as advertised, but to go to all of the trouble, to put the flat screen, etc., in the room, then leave all of the cables, plug in, wires for same in plain view, makes appearance cheap and look \"thrown together.\" Housekeeping could use improvements - the bathroom was not vacuumed or swept during stay, when the bed is turned down perhaps there is a better place for the bedspread and pillow besides next to the bed on the floor. Maybe closet shelf? No fresh soap in the bathroom - used same small little bar throughout, and bare essentials - shampoo, conditioner, nothing more - definitely not indicative of a high end hotel chain. At night there was one bottle of water placed by the bed when two of us were staying there - cheap? Check out - receptionist was alone, with a long line up and wait, I asked him if he was understaffed due to the length of wait and check out line up, and no apology, just a flippant response that no he was not understaffed, one person was showing someone a room, and someone was at lunch. I would think staff lunches would be scheduled a little later than noon considering that is checkout time.

Stay was May 9-10, 2008. Hotel was booked through Priceline with a winning bid of $119, with taxes/fees = $145.21. Rated 4 star hotel. Very Nice hotel. Located near beginning of Magnificent mile/Michigan Ave. Just a couple minutes from the river. The entrance on Rush street is the main entrance. There is also an entrance off Michigan Avenue but it is shared with North Bridge Mall. The elevator to the hotel is to the left of Nordstrom on the main level off the Michigan Ave entrance. The hotel is on the 5th floor of this building along with the main lobby. Levels 1-4 are for shopping. Checkin was uneventful with our priceline reservation. I was asked if we wanted to upgrade our room. I declined \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more on this later. Standard room with king size bed was clean, everything was in good repair, nice paintings/framed photos, neutral painted walls, no worn furniture, bed was comfortable, clean sheets, quiet at night. Tub and shower worked well. Nothing to complain about. Awesome large-screen tv on the wall. There are 2 remotes for the tv \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one to turn it on and the other to turn on the Bose surround sound system to hear it. Refridgerator has refreshements/snacks for sale. Really no room for anything you want to put in there. Warning label states if you remove anything you will be instantly charged. The room has wine glasses, which was a nice surprise, since I brought a bottle of wine with me, and I used the corkscrew in the room to open the bottle. Hotel has a nice looking bar and attached restaurant both of which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use. Besides, there are many great places to eat nearby which would be cheaper than the hotel. Nice separate seating area next to the bar with a piano. We took a taxi to Geha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caf\u00c3\u00a9 for dinner which is a fondue restaurant. For Saturday morning, I walked to Tempo Caf\u00c3\u00a9 ( 6 East Chestnut / Corner of Chestnut and State street ) which was about a 10-15 min walk. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice place for breakfast. Ordered takeout to bring back to hotel - spent $26 for waffles/strawberries; 3 eggs which came with hashbrowns, bacon and toast; 2 freshly squeezed orange juices. The hotel restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast menu is outrageously expensive. We shopped for about 1.5 hours Saturday morning on Michigan Ave. before we checked out at 11:30am. I should have asked about the upgrade at checkin since it was for our anniversary but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and this troubled me. So I asked about it at checkout. The receptionist told me they do upgrade your room if you want but you have to pay for the difference in price. However, if it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they might upgrade for a special occasion or if you want to try a different category of room for free \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their discretion. Live and learn. The hotel did seem a little slow.? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll definitely ask next time. Great hotel. Great location. No complaints. I would stay here again but only if we won it through priceline for a weekend getaway for us parents married with children. Use the difference in money for shopping and eating/drinking. As for parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we drove in from the suburbs. I parked at the Millenium park garages, specifically the East Monroe Garage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for $20 per 24 hours. Park near the Randolf street exits. I only noticed escalators going up. I had to take the stairs going down. I did not see and any down escalators. Walk to the hotel from here is about 15-20 mins in decent weather with light luggage which we did with 1 roll-along. I would say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 1 mile walk.

On this trip to Chicago, I had the pleasure to be on vacation for a change and took my other half with me for a week to the Conrad to celebrate St. Patrick's Day (and 6 other days around it!). Before arrival, I spent a good amount of time reading reviews on TripAdvisor from others who have stayed at the Conrad to try and make sure this was the best place to spend my valuable points. Yes, I used my points, I paid for 6 nights at the Conrad using no money whatsoever. I am a Diamond member with Hilton Honors, and I try to stay exclusively within that family of brands. So I was a bit concerned because I didn't know if I would be treated as well as the average \"cash\" customer, let alone if I would receive the usual upgrades and benefits (i.e. Breakfast vouchers) that I receive when I travel on business. However, I was told by my travel agent that it'd be a good idea for me to call the hotel ahead of time and make it known that I wanted an upgrade, that it was for a vacation, that I'm a Diamond member, yadda yadda. I called one week ahead of time and got the name of the desk agent I spoke to, and he said he would note in the account that I called and would put me down for an upgrade. I also called 3 days ahead, did the same thing, and again the night before (when they pull room assignments). So let's get to what happened at check in... We arrived at the hotel after a long and unenjoyable train ride from O'Hare (that's an entirely different story), and at the moment we walked up to the entrance on the street level we were greeted promptly by a doorman who took all of our bags, without even asking, and directed us to the 5th floor where the lobby was located. At the front desk, we were again treated wonderfully, and I was immediately informed I'd been upgraded to a Jr. Suite. Now, in terms of upgrades, that's multiple room classes. A Jr. Suite has a separate living and bedroom, each with their own 42\" plasma television. Upon getting my room keys and portfolio handed to me, I asked if it contained my breakfast coupons, and, much to my surprise, I was told \"they will be delivered by hand to your room this evening.\" It should be noted at this point that even for a paying customer with Diamond or other status at Hilton, the standard is for *either* a room upgrade *or* breakfast coupons. I found this to be a great surprise. We arrived at our room on the 15th floor to find a beautiful, clean suite, with living room and bedroom. The living room portion had a plasma television and a small sitting area with a couch and table and couple of chairs. The room also had a window looking out to Michigan Avenue. There was also a small bar alcove with a mini-bar fridge in it as well as an electronic user-configurable safe. The bedroom area had another plasma television, and was a very large open space with a king sized bed and tons of windows which practically wrapped halfway around the room. There was a Bose stereo system under the television which had great sound and was used as the sound source for watching TV as well as getting radio stations. There was also a desk with internet connection. Wireless internet was free, although we did not use it. The bathroom was very large as well. There was a large shower and separate deep soaking tub. Amenities were great, including two robes, plenty of large towels, Molton Brown shampoos/soaps/etc, and even an umbrella in the closet. (I'll get to the umbrella's significance later). Each evening when we returned from being out and about, we found the bed to be made up, turned down, and the stereo was turned on and playing smooth Jazz music. This was a great touch. Turndown service also provided us with bottles of water by the bed each night. On the first night we arrived, we noticed that there was no refrigerator or microwave which we could use for leftovers (so many amazing restaurants!). We called the front desk, requested these two items, and by the time we returned from dinner, they were both installed in the room. On the subject of services to our room, I have to say that room service worked almost like ninjas - each night we went to sleep, we never put the \"do not disturb up\" yet never experienced the dreaded early morning wake up call in person of someone opening the door and yelling \"room service.\" No one ever even knocked on the door. Yet whether we left the room at 8am or at 5pm for a while, the room was always made up when we would return. Let's get to the meals situation. Clearly we wanted to make use of the breakfast coupons we received. Their breakfast vouchers are for a Continental Breakfast, including taxes, not including gratuity naturally. Their value is $14.00. Yes, that's the price of the Continental Breakfast that includes a couple small pastries and some juice and coffee. Now, you can upgrade your breakfast to an American Breakfast for another $5.00, or to a Chicago Breakfast (comes with pancakes and a NY Strip steak) for another $12.00. Clearly one can see why having the extra $14.00 makes breakfast not quite so rediculously priced. Were it not for the coupons, I highly doubt we would have been eating at the lobby restaurant. But as for food quality, it was great. The kitchen was good at making certain items in certain ways to our liking, the coffee was very good, and juice was fresh. Portion sizes on the meals were good. Service on the other hand, as other reviewers have indicated, left something to be desired at times. Out of the week we were there and the handful of times we ate breakfast there, sometimes the service was very good and other times not so much. In short, unless you are either able to fully expense your breakfast or have a breakfast coupon, there are much more affordable options located right there at the mall in the food court or at any number of nearby places to eat. We'd like to make special mention about the bartender at the lobby bar, he was exceptional. The day we checked in, we were so happy to have finally arrived that we threw care to the wind knowing how expensive the drinks would be and ordered a few from the lobby bar. We did not return to the lobby bar again until the last night, 5 nights later, and the bartender remembered both of our drinks to the letter. Something else I really appreciated in the Conrad was their Concierge service. At check-in, we asked him to give us all the information we needed on where to go and what to see for the St. Patrick's Day festivities. He was very helpful, printed out maps and even lists of bars and restaurants. On the last night we were there, I had wanted to do something special for my girlfriend and I called the Concierge while I was out and about and told him that I wanted him to take the bottle of champagne I'd purchased and stashed in a cabinet and have it put in a bucket of ice and have two glasses ready for me by a certain time when we would be arriving back to the room that night. Just as requested, this was done, no charge, no hassle. He also coordinated a surprise carriage ride around town (Noble Horse Carriage Co). I guess it's relevant to state the down-sides of the hotel. Sure, the Conrad is not perfect. Here is the list of problems we saw. 1) They are (as others have stated) stingy with giving out more shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soap etc. during your stay. It isn't replaced everyday as I would have liked to see. However, it was never empty either, or I would imagine it would have been replaced, and I am 100% sure that had I at any point called the front desk to ask for more of anything they would have delivered it instantly. 2) Breakfast prices are too high, and the level of service for breakfast is inconsistent. 3) The price of drinks in the lobby bar is also too high (+/- $15 each), but I can admit the service was very good. There are lots more I could say about the Conrad but this review is already too long I'm sure. I'll end it by saying why the umbrella was significant and how it sealed the deal for me knowing it was truly a great hotel. During our stay, the weather changed from 50 degrees and sunny to 30 while raining and snowing. On the last day, we ventured out and decided to take with us the hotel-supplied Conrad branded umbrella. From my experience, anything hotel-supplied that isn't shampoo is usually going to end up on your bill later unless you leave it in the room. We went out for dinner and walked around for a bit, and somehow between the two of us, we misplaced the umbrella somewhere. Unable to find it, I immediately panicked thinking that I was going to surely end up being charged an unreasonable fee for this stupid umbrella a couple of weeks after check-out. I called the front desk from my cell phone and I said that I was the guest staying in suite 1519 and that I wasn't sure how I did it, but I'd managed to lose the umbrella that we'd taken out of the room. The response from the desk clerk was \"it's raining outside, if you tell me where you are, I can have another brought to you.\" I about fell out of my chair laughing. I explained that I'd lost it, didn't need another one, and she said she would note the account not to charge me for the umbrella. I just checked my card online and the charges I put on my card were just run through today - without the umbrella. The Conrad did an amazing job of giving us a wonderful week away from home in a fabulous city. There is no better location in my book, we were right at Michigan Avenue and just a few blocks north of the River. Any minor issues were far outweighed by the overall experience and service that we received. And for anyone who is debating between the Conrad and the Drake, do what we did - stay at the Conrad and visit the Drake for a meal and/or drinks to get the nostalgia for a couple hours without having to stay in an ancient tiny room. I almost feel like we cheated somehow considering that our airfare was all free (miles) and we only had a $170 bill for meals and drinks charged to the room over a week. There is no doubt in our minds that we would return to this hotel again.

The room itself was comfortable and not overly large but for two people ( I was in town on business and brought my sister to shop) was great. Know this though-if you want the tub and seperate shower(which was really nice to have to warm your bones) you have to book a King bed not two doubles. I had no view but I could care less as when I wasn't on business I was shopping. I'm sure a room with a view would have made it all the better but then again same if it was July- February is very cold but comprable to Toronto so who cares. What else... the fact it is attached to Nordstroms and the Mall was excellent. You could walk to the Water Tower Place and all the great shopping on the Mag Mile. The shopping was amazing!! Hotel staff were very friendly and helpfull. Loved the slippers to take home and the Motlen Brown products and they had no problem bringing up extras. I agree with other travellers that the Room service is really expensive. Breakfast 'American' 2 eggs bacon toast and coffee and a fruit smoothee( amazing for breakfast) with tip and hotel charges $49.00- this is for one person!! I feel bad expensing to my company. Tip-if you are travelling and paying for yourself Mary's Cafe is good food Eggs Pancakes and Coffee under 10.00. or the Nordstrom Cafe is really lovely and they are very attentive free coffee refills.

I chose the Conrad because (1) the brand has such a good reputation and I've been impressed with their Miami location; and (2) the stellar reviews on this website. Let me start by sharing the good. The lobby is beautifully appointed with fresh flowers, a dramatic bar area, a stunning front desk, and attractive furniture. The location is outstanding. You are close to the subway, theaters, restaurants, attractions, spas, etc. The rooms have great linens, a pillow menu which is fun to try, a large flat screen tv, nice sound system, and a large bathroom. The fitness center on the 11th floor is well equipped for cardio or strength training. All this sounds good, right?...why would I be disappointed? you may ask. Well, first off, do not expect them to accommodate your requests for room type. Usually when I stay at Hilton's I get upgraded because I am a diamond preferred member of Hilton...not this time. They did not upgrade my room or even honor my request for a high floored room. In fact, the lady gave me a room in the section of the hotel that had not been updated, it was small, and had a view of a building in front of me. It was on the second floor of the building. I did get a breakfast coupon but beware that does not give you a free breakfast but a $14 credit which barely gets you coffee and orange juice at their prices. A modest breakfast for two was $48.00!!! I could have gotten the same or better from a breakfast joint in the mall below for 1/4 that price. The food was good but not great. I was shocked when the bill arrived. The service was poor...they were understaffed and did not regularly attend to customers for refills or clearing plates. My floor was not looking good. The carpeting was worn out, stained badly in one location, and the room was showing its age. While this would be acceptable in a Hampton or Double tree, for the prices you pay at the Conrad, it really is unacceptable. I blame the management here. The Conrad Miami does have its act together--Chicago could learn a lesson or two.

At a regular Hilton, the tolietries are replaced everyday, used or not. The Terrace Bar was great the first night. We loved the view of all the skyscrapers nearby. On our last night, we received awful service. We were ignored for 20 minutes after my husband finished his drink. We finally got fed up and told the hostess our room number and left. Again, just unacceptable given the \"atmosphere\" of the hotel. I ran into another problem at the business center while I was trying to print up tickets for a show. The mouse on the computer didn't work, rendering the computer useless. We called for help, but no one came since the business center is farmed out to another company. No one at the front desk seemed to care that we might have missed our show. Luckily, a manager let us use her computer to print the tickets, but we still have to resovle the issue of getting the initial $16 internet charge refunded. What a pain! I would not stay here again the next time I come to Chicago. I would rather be at the regular Hilton on the executive floor where we can get complimentary breakfast and turndown service that actually includes chocolate- what a concept!", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat, Clean, Comfortable Room\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoDon30", "ReviewID": "UR8682864", "Content": "I travel often for business and stay at 4-5 star hotels as well as the usual Marriott Courtyard or Hilton Hotels.

I almost never dine at the restaurants in a hotel at which I am staying. (usually too many great other options in a city) We had a case of the munchies upon checking in so we ordered appetizers via room service. Service was quick, sharp, and the food was very good. The next day, we had lunch at the 5th floor rooftop garden restaurant (outdoors) which has a fabulous view and again, was amazingly quiet given the location of this hotel. The food was FANTASTIC. We only ordered Maine lobster roll sandwiches so we were't expecting an amazing culinary experience....SURPRISE! The presentation was lovely and the lobster roll came on a platter with several \"samplers\"--- soup, cabbage slaw, homemade chips, and a sinful chocolate mouse cake. I've had lobster rolls in dozens of places up and down the eastern seaboard and I'll tell you that this was the best, most flavorful, and freshest I've had. The whole dining experience greatly exceeded my expectations. I would say that this hotel is a gem in the city and recommend it without reservation of any kind.

Here is my review. This is a luxury hotel, and they treat guests like they are staying at a luxury hotel. Let me start by describing the room, it had a large plasma television with a Bose surround-sound home theater system, an iHome iPod-capable clock radio, a large glass shower stall, and a large tub with whirlpool jets. Other amenities included a bathroom scale, high-end soaps/shampoos, and complementary Internet and bottled water. Turn-down service is provided at night, when I got back to my room each evening i was greeted by soft music on the Bose system, slippers, and they even put the shower mat out for the next morning (or nighttime shower). Rooms have wired and wireless Internet, comfy chairs, super plush beds with down comforters and pillow top mattresses, and super plush towels and bathroom rugs. Wake-up calls are taken and made by real human beings. Even the housekeeping staff refers to you by name. The location is also fantastic, it is connected to a shopping mall featuring a Nordstroms. The heart of Chicago's entertainment/dining district is a short walk, including the Navy Pier which is about 10 minutes away by foot. There is a restaurant in the hotel which we didn't visit, as well as outdoor and indoor bars, both of which featured a nice selection of drinks, but very slow service. But this hotel wasn't perfect. The Internet service was troublesome, twice I called the front desk, each time they transfered my call to GuestTek which provides the hotel's Internet service. Each time it took 10-15 minutes with a tech support person to get the service enabled. Apparently it wouldn't recognize the room that I was in. When I checked out I noticed that the hotel had charged me $20 for these calls, which they promptly removed from my bill. Others in our group had the same issues. I also had a problem with my room key, it usually took 5-10 tries before it worked. I tried a new room key but had the same result. The front desk personnel told me they'd have maintenance look at the lock, but I had the same trouble throughout my stay. The cold-water in the bathroom ran at a quarter of the volume of the hot, so if you weren't careful you could easily burn yourself (something I learned the hard way the first night).

This is a very nice property, quietly tucked off Michigan Avenue. Pros: It was nice to escape from the chaos of the city to a very calm, relaxing place. I liked that the Conrad didn't seem like a gigantic conference hotel like some of its neighbors with conventioneers all over. Not much of a scene like the Peninsula, but the bar area was busy enough. The room: nice, though if you looked closely you could see a few shortcuts taken in putting it together. The tub was super and the water pressure amazing. A deep soaking tub that actually filled rapidly! Good Molton Brown toiletries. But the best was the staff. Everyone was super professional, extra friendly and went out of their way to help. Cons: As I said there were a few shortcuts in the room (no convenient outlets to the bed; when you soaked in the tub you looked at the raw underside of the sink area, etc. No view, but that wasn't so important.

Flew in to ORD around Noon, got to hotel at 12:50, checked in early no problem. Friendly front desk lady lend my buddy a cell phone charger as he forgot it back home. Request high floor, assigned room was on 11th Floor (mid floor as hotel is level 5-17 in the building.) next to the elevator, I was dreading for a bit but noise from hallway was non-existent. Huge and spotless double-double room has plasma TV and Bose 3-2-1 system. Resolution sucked on the TV though as it's just a regular SD feed, no HD. Slippers are my favorite amenity in a hotel room when travelling, I have a morbid fear of walking around barefeet no matter how clean a room is. Asian hotels always have them no matter how cheap, same cannot be said about North America even with the upscale ones. Robes are of course pretty standard in a Conrad. Bathroom has no tub, which suits us just fine. Giant tiled standing shower and granite vanity with seperate lavatory. Pretty standard Conrad. Showerhead could use more pressure in rain mode. Had to have it on massage mode to get any pressure. Molton Brown amenities are nice. Towels felt thin & cheap though there were plenty of them. In-room safe is quite small but fit my 12\" laptop fine, the built-in outlet for charging is also very handy. The safe however isn't bolted down though and is just connected by the power cord to the minibar cabinet. And the hotel doesn't have card key security in the elevators so it posed a minor concern for me to leave valuables in the safe. Evening turndown service offered complementary mini-Evian waters, nice touch. Linens & Beds are excellent and we slept in every night as it was so comfy. our room overlooked the back of another building and noise from the NMA was non-existent. Our friends over at the Westin however had a suite with a glorious view of NMA and heard sirens blaring by every night. Sucks to be them. HVAC is perfect. Hotel rooms always tend to be too cold/too hot. Not at the Conrad. It was perfectly comfortable with the dial at 70F Housekeeping was topnotch. We're slobs when on the road for hockey road trips and the room is always spotless when we come back. No one ever disturbed us when we had the DND sign on the door 'til we woke up and left at noon everyday, yet the room's always ready when we come back around 5 for a shower before dinner after some shopping and sightseeing. Had a bottle of VOSS water from the room, nothing special, but the bottle was cool looking. Wireless AND Wired High speed internet is free, but both are painfully slow even with good signal on the wireless. But it got my work done. Don't try to download anything major though or you'll be sitting there for an hour. Did not eat at the hotel nor ordered room service. Went downstairs to level 4 (the mall's food court, must take hotel elevator to level 5 the lobby first then transfer into the mall elevator) and ate at Tuscany, the Italian fast food place that served restaurant style pasta in a fast food setting with fast food prices. Quite decent and the price is very agreeable. Only pet peeve is the 3 elevator system to navigate if you're unfamiliar with it, I was fine but our friends from the Westin got lost when they came to visit. Requested late checkout and was given 2PM without a fuss on Monday as I had a 6PM flight out of O'Hare. Excellent front desk girl did it with a smile. Fitness centre was 5 steps from our room next to the elevator, very convenient and huge. Complementary green apples and all the hand towels you can use are a nice touch. LOCATION. This cannot be stressed enough. Smack in the middle of the Mag Mile (NMA), right across from the Intercontinental if you enter through the Nordstrom mall. Walking distance to anywhere. We walked to the Water Tower, Hancock Building, Navy Pier, the Loop, ESPN Zone, Hard Rock Hotel, The Trump Tower under construction, Walgreen's at the Realtor Building, and the Macy's next to the Westin where our friends are staying. The only time we took a cab was to & from ORD and the Shedd Aquarium/Field Museum and the United Center for the game. Weather & Others: It was raining on the Friday, bloody cold on the Saturday and absolutely gorgeous on Sunday and Monday. Had a great time all weekend though even with the bad weather to start. Wished we could've stayed longer. Everyone we met were very friendly, which is more than I could say for LA, there's just something about the midwest that feels so much like home. The streets are surprisingly clean in a city of almost 3 million.

The lobby was not huge, however it was cozy. The terrace looks like it would be a great place to sit and have a drink in the spring and summer. There is a gift shop in the lobby, however I'm sure prices are high. There is a Walgreens not to far from the hotel. As a HHonors Diamond member, I was upgraded to a king suite overlooking Michigan Ave. What a wonderful room! Everything was very clean and in good working order. Appreciated the large-screen plasma tvs and Bose Surround Sound System. I really appeciated how thick the walls were in this hotel .. I could not hear anyone from the rooms next to mine. The bathroom was also very nice and incredibly clean. Deep soaking tub was very nice and just what I needed after a day on the town. The bathroom was stocked with great amenities! Room service was fast and efficient and the food was very tasty. Internet service was reliable (both wired and wireless are free). Fitness center looked very nice, however I did not get a chance to use it. It was nice being able to walk next door to the shopping complex (restaurants are located on the top level). Stopped at the concierege desk to ask for tickets to a show in town, however he was busy with another couple. One of the front desk staff immediately came over and asked if I needed assistance. The location is nice .. just a quick walk to the Magnificient Mile, Water Tower Place/John Hancock Buidling, Macy's, etc. The Chicago Marriott Magnificent Mile Hotel and Intercontinental Chicago are across the street. I would definately stay at this hotel again, in fact I plan to make it my prefered hotel when in town. HHonors members have good chances of getting upgrades, especially on the weekends. The only downfall to this hotel (just like other 4-5 star hotels in the area) is the price often exceeds my budget. Tip: Check the Chicago Conrad hotel website and click on \"specials\" on the bar at the top of the page.

They also provide L'Occitane lotion in the rooms. The Location is great and the price is good. I paid $230 a night. Anyway the biggest complaint for me is the customer service. Most of the staff don't know much about Chicago and good luck getting the concierge service. It appeared like the Hotel was understaffed. I never see anyone eat at the hotel restaurant. The gym is nice for a hotel.

Anyway...the Conrad did not dissappoint. My girlfriend and I were traveling to Chicago for a girls weekend away over the Labor Day weekend. The point of the trip was to relax in affordable luxury and to enjoy some good old fashioned shopping. We were pleased to be greeted by Stephanie with warm smiles even after 11pm on a busy Friday nite. After reading several reviews about the property on TA and noting that folks had a tough time locating the entrance we decided to catch a cab from the metro (totaling about 4.50) and the cab took us right to the Rush street lobby door. I do however get the confusion on the entrance to hotel since the main lobby is really on the 5th floor if you enter from the mall side off Michigan and on the 1st floor if you enter from Rush Street. There was not a wait at check-in and we walked right up to the desk. Stephanie checked us in and though we asked about the view she told us it was limited but that the room had been renovated. She was right...the room had all of the luxury of a 4 Seasons or even a couple of Ritz properties as far as I am concerned. The beds were turned down with soft music playing, a hand written welcome note next to Christofle silver neatly placed next to a generous bowl of fresh fruit, two bottles of cool VOSS water , a full ice bucket and even two small bottles of evian on either side of nite stand with the beds turned down waiting for our arrival. I was floored! There were two large fluffy terry robes with matching slippers and hi-thread count sheets, about 4-5 fluffy pillows, and the lightest but quite comfy euro style duvet ever! The bathroom had no tub( so not as relaxing as it could have been) but had a separate water closet(toilet area) and all marble and granite everything. Molton Brown bath products and beautiful crystal glasses, bath tumblers and soap dishes. There was a very large flat screen TV (about 42\") with a Bose home theatre setup that was phenomenal for listening to relaxing music as well as watching a late nite movie. We could not hear any outside noises from the ground...though we were on the 16th floor, we also couldnt hear any voices from the hall or anywhere else either. Stephanie was right about the view, but I think I only looked out of the window twice to check on the weather in the morning so the view did not matter at all. The bathroom light blew out and the sink had a slow drain but after a call to report this, both issues were resolved on our return to the room in the evening. There was an honor bar, but we did not need to use it since there was plenty of welcome fruit for noshing. We did use the room service for late nite sandwiches ( Classic Club and an Angus Burger ) Both sandwiches delicious and served hot and beautifully but with only one flaw. I requested Blue Cheese and Bacon and both had be be brought separately later as they were not placed on the burger. Once all ingredients got together though there were fabulous. Room service charges not bad at 35.00 for everything including two soft drinks. We had vouchers for complimentary Continental breakfast or you could use it to subtract 12.00 from your meal...the omelet, thick toast, and home fries were cooked to order and delicous and cost 14.00 so this was a reasonable upgrade for 2.00! My girlfriend and I were greeted by name by the hotel staff during our entire stay and I just dont know how they do that, but we felt welcome and appreciated for staying in their hotel...that is quite rare these days! Checkout went very smoothly and Stephanie was on again to make sure we knew where and how to leave our luggage for pick up later as we were not leaving Chicago to late in the evening and had much more shopping to do. This was a wonderful weekend and my stay at the Conrad just made it better. For maximum comfort I would make sure I was in a renovated room. I would definetly stay at the Conrad again! Very, very nice! ps. After arriving home I realized I had left a CD in the theatre system. I called back to inquire if it had been turned it. The person who answered the phone took my name and home phone number and called me back in less than 15 minutes saying that she had indeed located it would send it to me via FEDEX in 2-3 days on them!

The bed was very comfortable, and the pillows fresh. The room was very quiet, meaning you did not hear any other guests, or plumbing noises from other bathrooms. The bathroom is really great. The deep soaking tub is large enough for two, as is the separate shower with a double headed shower fixture, and a ton of pressure for both the tub and the shower. There is a separate toilet room within the bathroom. Room service was nice, with an afternoon snack taking about 35 minutes to be delivered. At night, the champagne popped unexpectedly when I removed the safety retainer from the above the cork, causing the bottle to tip, knocking over a water glass, which shattered on the rug. A call to the Guest Services for a vacuum, along with a request for additional washclothes forgotten during the turn-down service, got a nice young man up with a vacuum in 4 minutes to vacuum up the glass. He even remembered the washclothes. Very impressive, quick service.

When the cab dropped us off we could not figure out the lobby. There was no one at the Rush street entrance desk and the bellman did not inform us that the lobby is on the 5th floor. Weird. I wish I could remember the guy's name who checked us in because he was super. Friendly and attentive. We overheard the man checking in ahead of us being told his room was not ready and he would have to wait, so we were expecting the same. The desk guy told us not only could we go right up to our room, we were getting one of the newly renovated ones. Sweet. Very nice, new modern decor. Every detail was perfectly taken care of, from the wood encased ice bucket to the fancy wastebaskets. No view. Had to keep the drapes closed or the people in the offices across the street could look in. I looked around for the room directory, the book that tells where the gym is, the restaurants, bar hours etc. and found none. (asked about it later and were told there wasn't one yet due to the changeover.) Mini bar was computerized so we could not put our cold drinks in it or our dinner leftovers later. No coffee maker. When we left for dinner we asked if we could have the minibar fridge emptied. The response was no, because we would be charged for every item! We could have had an empty fridge brought up for $20. We didn't. The ice machine on our floor had an out of order sign for the 4 days we were there so we went to other floors to get ice. What we really liked about the Conrad were its excellent location, walking distance to great restaurants, the river and only 2 blocks from the red line subway station. There is an outdoor lounge on the fifth floor that is phenomenal. The city views and lovely sunset cocktails were to die for. One night they even showed a film. There are many chairs and tables in addition to the bar as well as canopy \"beds\". Just dreamy. The staff was so great. On the day we left we needed a late checkout and it was no problem. This time a young woman helped me. I had forgotten to print out my Southwest boarding passes the day before and asked where there was a business center where I could and the lady at the desk did if for me! The last, weirdest thing was again, the lack of coffee maker. The Conrad guide to their properties stated that all Conrads feature in room coffee makers and the checkout survey asked if we had used the coffee maker. On other floors I saw coffee packets on the maid's carts. When we passed through the lobby to depart we asked the staff if there were not supposed to be coffee makers. One gal appeared about to say yes, but the guy who checked us in gave her a look and said no. I suspect that as they remodel they are removing the coffee makers. Odd.

A big part of a perfect hotel stay is the attentiveness of the staff, and here the Conrad delivered in spades. Even the bell hops were able to provide solid advice on restaurants, shops and other opportunities available in the neighborhood. The conceirge was able to manage all things with a single phone call -- including handing me tickets to the King Tut exhibit that allowed me to jump the line and walk right in. Superb. In terms of location, the Conrad is exceptional. One entrance opens on Rush Street where taxis can be had easily. The other opens into the Westfield NorthBridge mall and then out onto Michigan Avenue and the Mag Mile. Literally, the showiest and best that Chicago has to offer is right outside the door. Perhaps my only criticism is one that is true of all high end hotels: everything is just breathtakingly expensive. Two glasses of wine plus tip easily topped out at twenty-five dollars. Wine plus a very nice dessert of fresh berries out on their stunning terrace (try to snag a couch or one of the beds if you can) pushed forty dollars. I understand that this is how hotels manage to make their bottom line, but it often feels mercenary to me to soak the guests so relentlessly. Finally, a tip to all those who would stay at this amazing hotel: call their reservations line personally. Do not rely on their website or one of the discounters for the best possible rate. By calling seven days before my arrival, I was able to secure a rate of $180 per night (that's less than half the going rate, and only marginally more than some three star properties in the area are charging). When in Chicago, for me, the Conrad is the only place to stay.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Snohomish, Washington", "Title": "\u201cHad a wonderfull time!

It seems that the Conrad has inherited a hotel property that just doesn't work. The entrance is very difficult to find. There are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby. As a result, there was often a line waiting for them. The same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area. If you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay, you will find the poor elevator layout annoying. The King room is what I would consider small compared to other Chicago hotels. Although I like modern design, the room was quite stark and cold. It was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear. The bathroom was the best part. Has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk? It was the most uncomfortable set-up I've experienced. The views are non-existent for most of the rooms. In a city with amazing vistas, this was disappointing. I saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them. Room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay. Excellent food and high quality presentation.
