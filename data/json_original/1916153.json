To get there from the Fiumico airport... If under 65, buy your Roma Pass at the airport Tourist office, otherwise buy metro/bus tickets at the tobacconist opposite the office- We bought a three day and a one day pass there. a) get a taxi to the hotel, good value if there's 4 of you. or b) get the bus shuttle for 4 to Termini or c ) get the non stop train to Termini, pricey, then metro see below or c) get the slow train to Ostiense station, 8 Euro, walk to Pyramids metro (not far) metro( Line B) to Termini At Termini switch to line A, towards Anagnina, get off at Subaugusta Outside the station , get the 558 bus just past the corner restaurant towards Torre Maura, 10 minute ride. Get off at Romanista Giaquinto ( 2 stops past a petrol station on the right, before a petrol station on the left, 100 metres further on, turn right, hotel 100 metres on the left.

That's where the good stuff ends. Supposedly 4 stars, the hotel is situated way out of the city centre in a residential suburb of Rome, and miles from the airport. Whilst our room was clean and comfortable, we were amazed to find no tea/coffee making facilities in the room (a must as far as I'm concerned and surely a standard feature these days?). There were just 4 coat hangers between two of us, no drawer space, no extractor fan in the internal bathroom, no shower gel and they were mean with the toilet rolls! The \"fridg-o-box\" drinks cabinet, which housed only soft drinks and water, was not chilled which we found rather pointless. There is no kitchen as such, so no facility for lunch or dinner, and being situated in a residential area there are very few restaurants nearby, although there is a supermarket right next door. Breakfast was just continental with the only hot food available being scrambled egg with pieces of bacon mixed in, or frankfurters which, as a vegetarian, I couldn't eat. After three days eating the same breakfast I never want to see a cheese roll again as long as I live! The \"dining room\" itself was large, cold, impersonal and utilitarian and felt more like a canteen than a restaurant. Being subterranean there was no natural light and it lacked warmth and atmosphere. We had no hot water for 2 of our 3 days and to top it all, when we checked out we were informed that we had to pay \"city taxes\" - 3 euros per person per night! A 4 star hotel? No way. I wouldn't stay there again and certainly would not recommend it.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cInconvenient & soulless\u201d", "Author": "ManchesterMary01", "ReviewID": "UR120963965", "Content": "Inconvenient location for a city break, the back of beyond.

Rooms are spotless, beds, thin mattress but comfortable, my bathroom looked like it had been built in one of those 60 minute make-over shows- fittings not secure, not aligned, but again spotlessly clean..

On arrival at Termini station, we found that people just did not know where the hotel was. We were told conflicting advice by two tourist information boards and bus drivers. As advised we took the number 5 tram, which we were told would take us 800 meters from the hotel. When we got off the tram we found we were hopelessly lost, nobody had heard off the hotel let alone the road. One kind Italian man walked around with us for over an hour asking people directions on our behalf. In the end a stall holder called a taxi for us. 4 exhausting hours later after landing we arrived at the hotel. The next day we took a taxi to the centre and found that we had the same problem returning back to the hotel in the afternoon. Many taxi drivers either didn\u2019t know where the hotel was or didn\u2019t want to travel the long distance to the hotel and it was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The hotel itself was okay, but because we booked through a tour operator paid more than the prices on the hotel website. Breakfast was okay if you like continental breakfasts, but the room was clean with daily housekeeping. Rooms are not sound proof. The reception staff were not very friendly and did not seem concerned with practicalities of having to travel on public transport. Evening meals are non-existent and there is no -where to have a proper meal. Hotel should be 3 stars not 4.

However, it is a VERY long way out of the centre of Rome and a bit of a nightmare to be honest. To go into the city in the morning we would walk 5mins to the bus stop, get the 558 bus from Rottastini (I think it was called) to the Sub Augusta Metro station, which took around 10minutes - so long as the bus arrived quickly - at times we waited 20mins in the heat for a bus to come. Then down to the metro and a case of waiting around 10-15 stops on metro which can take around 30-40minutes. In early september when we went it is very hot walking around and we wanted to freshen up for evening meal/opera etc. This meant we had to allow 2hours to get back to hotel. Then shower/change and allow 2hours to get back in to city for dinner (absolute nightmare and big time waste). this also caused problems for our evenings in rome because on friday night metro closes at 9pm and there are only night buses - we waited so long for bus that eventually we gave in and paid 30euros for taxi home.

Plenty of parking, a pleasant room, with all the necessary facilities, and still new enough to be smart. Absolutely no complaints about the accommodation - it was good. Breakfast wasn't much to write home about, especially over the Easter weekend when there seemed to be no supply of fresh bread or fruit, but it was plentiful and provided enough to fuel us till lunchtime. Some members of staff were very helpful - the barman and Magdalena at reception in particular. Others appeared to speak little English, and a couple of others didn't seem to want to help. But on the whole, there were no problems, and no-one was rude or went out of their way to be unhelpful. The hotel doesn't serve anything except breakfast, and there are very few local eating places within walking distance. Those we found only accepted cash. The main issue we had was getting in and out of the city centre. The hotel doesn't provide any information in the room, and although there are public transport links, they aren't easy to find out about. Despite being assured by those in the know that it wasn't possible to miss the bus/tram stop, we, and many others, did. Getting back out of the city proved difficult, primarily because no-one had heard of the hotel and we weren't sure exactly where it was! Taxi drivers reverted to phoning the hotel reception for directions or denying that it existed; the tourist information office gave us wrong tram line numbers; even local bars didn't know about it! It all proved quite an adventure, and an expensive one at that. But those of our group who did work the public transport system out found it easy and cheap to use. So to summarise, it's a good place to base yourself if you just want a comfortable modern room and an acceptable breakfast at a reasonable price (\u20ac99 room and breakfast per night at Easter weekend 2011). But prepare yourself with plenty of information about where and how to get buses and trams, or if you're taking a taxi, make sure you have the hotel's address and phone number to show th driver!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hull", "Title": "\u201cIt was ok\u201d", "Author": "FiddlegirlHull", "ReviewID": "UR105187932", "Content": "Fine but far out.
