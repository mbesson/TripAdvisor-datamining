The parking lot was very tiny and tucked away around the corner so that was my first worry. The lobby was clean and bright and the young man that assisted us was very friendly and willing to accommodate when we asked for a smoking room (ok I know! ) After a ride in a tiny elevator we found , our room was at the end of the hall, right next to a fire escape door that was propped open.This building is very old and I think was a studio apartment house in it's younger days. Building materials were propped against the walls in the hallway and it smelled musty and slightly of curry. In our room large cracks adorned the walls, paint was peeling from the door frames,there was no phone, the heater was right against one of the beds, slats broken and didn't work on the heat setting. The carpet was old and dirty. The bathroom was ancient, cracked tiles and the toilet was up on a raised platform. There was a little kitchenette but the light didn't work. It didn't seem too clean, but there was a working fridge and two microwaves. I went to the lobby to ask for an ashtray and was told that you couldn't smoke in the building because it would smell up the hallways,but out on the fire escape, which is why I guess that door was propped open. This led me to feel unsafe as anyone could come up the fire escape stairs and into the building virtually unseen. I worried about bed bugs, the mattress were very hard and the pillows flat.I took pictures on my cell phone but need to get a cord to download them to my computer.

Instead of stopping along the way, we decided to drive all the way down last minute. After being in the car for 10 hours with two young children we found out that our original hotel the Hyatt Regency Mission Bay was completely booked that night. I tried calling all the other hotels in the area but they were all completely booked for the night also. So, I decided to call hotels.com and ask for some help in searching for a hotel for my family just for one night before we check into the Hyatt the next day. The lady on the phone told us that she found a \"great hotel\" for us in downtown San Diego with a view of the harbor and it's luckily the same cost as the Hyatt. It sounded good on the phone and I put my trust in her to help my family out because we were all exhausted from the road trip. After I got off the phone with her I checked the hotel on trip adviser and found out it was not a good fit for our family. I called hotels.com back and they would not allow us to change hotels. We had no other choice but to go to the hotel and check in. The front desk lady looked at me crazy when I asked for a room with a king instead of one queen. She said, \"WE HAVE NO KINGS HERE!\", like it was a stupid question. My family of 4 piled into this \"suite\" with one queen and a smelly old sofa bed and I wanted to cry. It had a nasty dingy smell and the carpet was wet in the living area of the room. It was really gross and I couldn't wait to leave the next day. I was told by hotels.com that it had a view of the harbor and we only had a view of the parking lot. In fact, I don't think any of the rooms had a view at all. We heard cars honking and airplanes flying over us all night. My two little girls had a really hard time sleeping. I can't believe hotels.com took advantage of us like that. I'll never use them again. This room was the same price as the Hyatt?

There are only two positive things about the hotel. One is the location, couldn't complain about that other than the street was very noisy and the planes fly directly overhead (and I mean to the point where you feel they are going to land on your room) until well after midnight. Other than that, it is close to excellent places to eat, transportation, freeway and the harbour. The other was aside from the up charging that the hotel staff does, they were very accommodating and friendly and as helpful as they were able to be. The hotel smelled and was old and uncared for. The room was disgusting. I asked for a non smoking and got one that had been covered up with highly allergenic air freshner. There was mould in the fridge, old food in the drawers, cracked walls, cracked casing that had come off and was just banged into place again. The kitchenette had a sink and fridge, no cutlery or dishes and the sink was completely corroded. The windows didn't close properly, likely original ones. The bathroom was old, fixtures were chipped, towels frayed, no kleenex, the cheapest soap I have ever seen. Beds were ok, no bed bugs or cockroaches but when I stripped off the sheets to check the mattresses, there were old blood stains on the mattress cover. Breakfast was a joke, coffee with creamer, toast, frozen waffles. Might as well lower the rate and not have breakfast. Everything was an up charge, with a \"resort\" fee (of course there was no resort) and extra for another bed. When my friends and family called the staff was indifferent and never offered to take a message. There was no voicemail so that wasn't an option either. All in all a dismal experience for what Hotwire rates as a 2 star hotel. I would maybe give them a 1 star for location. Sad because the hotel has tons of potential with some of the original finishes and could be a gem in a fantastic location. The grande dame has let herself go!! I would not recommend this hotel to any but the most indifferent or adventurous people who don't care where they lay their head down to sleep!

We soon learned that there was no functioning elevator during \"construction\" and were forced to carry our luggage up the three flights of stairs to our room. The door would not open easily and had to be rammed with a shoulder to create a very narrow opening. This was due to the door being stopped by one of the two queen sized beds which was too close to the door. The room appeared clean and did not smell as I have read in other reviews. The bathroom door would not close and there were holes in the both the door and above the shower. We did not have a coffeemaker in our room as has been stated on many websites for this hotel.
