The complex on entering the grounds looks lovely with neat little gardens, an outdoor restaurant overlooking a nice little pool. But the rooms are another story altogether. The standard rooms are like little prison cells with stark white walls and th bathrooms with a hand held shower that sprays directly onto the floor. There are also problems with spotlights from the pool and pathways shining directly into the one small but barely curtained window.The deluxe bungalows are not a lot better. They are bigger with a couple of pieces of furniture but with no reading light, and no comfort of any type. The indoor/outdoor bathrooms are a huge improvement on the standard but even this small attempt at charm was diluted by the brown funghi whcih the walls wore and which looked remarkably similiar to smeared human faeces.The airconditiong was poor in both rooms, the mosquitos huge and the televisions poorly tuned to only Indonesian speaking channels despite cards left in the rooms to announce the english speaking channels.The breakfast was atrocious with eggs (any style) accompanied by cold pre-cooked bacon and tomato. And fruit that had to be secured before 8.00am or there was none left.This hotel promises much but the state of the rooms and the apathy of the many staff soon bring you down to earth.Safety wise, there are issues with both the laneway leading to the hotel and also the numbers of seemingly neither guests nor staff who hang around the grounds of the hotel.I would not stay here again and would definitely not reccomend it to anyone.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR576761160", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Willow_cricketer"}, {"Content": "Ida Hotel Bali, brilliant little place Stayed in bungalow 404, deluxe for two weeks beginning 13th May 2008. It was absolutely beautiful. The room was large, the beds huge and soft mattress' and the outdoor bathroom was fantastic. You sort of felt a little naughty in the bathroom first off, but got used to there being no roof and knowing no one could see you.The gardens are lovely and peaceful, I could have sat on my balcony for hours. The staff are very friendly and the location is brilliant. A short 5 min walk to kuta square or to jalan Pantai Kuta. 24 hr security guards which was good for people like me travelling alone. The lane looks scary but it really isn't knowing you have the guards there.All in all, definately recommend this to anyone, budget travellers or not.cheersLisa", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR204216312", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Madnesss"}, {"Content": "The lovely Ida This beautiful oasis nestled in the absolute centre of Kuta, Bali. On the night that we arrived we were a little bit taken aback by the long, dark, narrow driveway. But fellow travellers do not fear! As we pulled up to the front gates we were met by thier 24 hour security guard which made us feel quite a bit safer. As we cruise up to reception they have our keys and room ready and they lug our suitcases for us. We arrive as our little home for the next two weeks. The doors to the bungalow are ornately carved the balcony has two comfortable chairs and a small table that is quiet and private with frangapani trees planted in front. As we walk into the room the gorgeous four poster bed greets us with a firm matress and crisp white sheets. The room is not huge but there is more then enough room for the two of us, a wardrobe in which to hang our hangables and two bed sides with drawers in which to put our other odds and ends. The bathroom was a refreshing surprise! While it had four walls and all the essential amenities it has an open roof and a garden it did take a while for us to get used to going al fresco, the garden in the bathroom is a nice touch. I have nothing but the best things to say about the hotel and all the staff, they could not have been more helpful and kind to us. If you are reading this hello to Jero, and Sumi, hope you enjoyed dinner. And a special hello to the boys behind the bar who supplied mewith endless Ida specials. The Ida made us feel so at home the only time I was homesick was when I arrived in Australia.

A great hotel if your travelling on a budget. The rooms were basic but clean and the hotel staff very friendly. The hotel is located just behind Kuta square and is a short walk to bars, restaurants and shops. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to any one who is looking for a cheaper holiday.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR239369430", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "wardMelbourne"}, {"Content": "bublicit\u951f\u7d5c mensongere, attrapent touristes   showReview(17098224, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR643009629", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "GLOBWOMEN"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d629605-r18964545-Ida_Hotel-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "629605", "Price": "$38"}}
