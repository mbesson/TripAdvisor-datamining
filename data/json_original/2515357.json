Depending on what you need to do/see this hotel will probably suit you well. I primarily stay in IHG properties due to the Priority Club program and that was my main reason for staying here. Having said that it is close to the Space Needle, shops, restaurants and I-5 interchanges. The front desk staff was quite friendly and they upgraded us to a suite on the west side of the hotel. Try to get this side as it will give you a great view of the needle especially in the evening. The bathroom was revently upgraded with a large jacuzzi tub and new tiling. The rrom also offered a fridge and microwave. Parking was pretty full while we there but we found a spot and for $10 it's a good deal. Breakfast was typical HIE fare. Aside from the bathroom the room seemed a bit tired. The furnishings and decor are older. I'm not sure if it was just our room but the layout was not to my liking either. The bed is too close to the wall, the vanity is in the main sleeping area and there was no desk, just a round table. As we were there for a short pleasure stay it wasn't a big deal but it would not be great for business. One other minor irritant is the internet access. We could connect just fine but every time out iPads pwered down we would lose the connection and have to re-enter the password. Despite all of this we will probably stay here again on our next rip.

Location is OK at best, though really depends on why you're in Seattle and what you want to do. It is located on a rather busy and grimy street but if that's not an issue, Seattle City Center is just a block away and Belltown/Downtown is a 10-15 walk or shorter bus ride in. If you have a car and need to get around, driving to I-5 or other major arteries seems easy. The room was clean, as were the rest of the premises. \"Fitness room\" really just consists of five outdated cardio machines and a treadmill, and the pool is really only usable if no more than 3 people are in it (or say, 4-6 little kids which, on this trip, were the primary users). Great for 1-2 night business travel, or perhaps a short vacation for young families traveling on a tight budget.

We told the clerk for 1 night only and she repeated \"just 1 night\". When we got a checkout statement we were charged parking for 2 nights. We got 1 night parking off after we complained but that shouldn't have happened. If we weren't careful, we would have overlooked and got charged. Should have paid cash! Found out that it's a little closer to walk to catch the streetcar/trolley (than the monorail) to downtown and don't have to deal with stairs. ($2.50 but it's unlimited ride for 2 hours so you can ride back with the same ticket within 2 hrs) Also, Metro Light Rail takes you to SEATAC from downtown for $2.75 if you don't want to take a taxi and pay $60+", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nanoose Bay, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in comfort\u201d", "Author": "FrankT55", "ReviewID": "UR118623527", "Content": "This was an unexpected find in Seattle.

The location was also convenient. However, a few employees of the Holiday Inn Express front desk staff /\u201dmanagers\u201d were extremely misleading when I questioned them about transportation options to return to the Seattle Airport for our return flight home. My partner and I rode the public transit Link Light rail when we arrived in Seattle to get to our hotel at the HI Express Seattle Center for $5.00 total (40 min. ride) and easily took a free 5 minute bus ride from the train station to the hotel. Therefore, we wanted to do the same exact thing upon our return to the airport to fly back home since it was straightforward and very economical. Why waste money taking a shuttle or taxi for $35-40 each way? On Saturday 9/11/10 night I asked the front desk what bus my partner and I needed to take to get to the Link Light Rail station in Westlake Center that goes to the airport and that our flight left at 10:15AM. The front desk \u201cinformed\u201d me that the Link Rail train did not start running until 9AM and we would have to take the Town Car service for $35 to get to the airport. The employee then stated HI Express has a relationship with the Town Car/Shuttle company and would book the ride for us for $35. I grudgingly agreed since they emphatically advised me that I had no other lower cost options to get to the airport in time. Since the Link Rail Train didn\u2019t begin until 9AM on Sundays. I informed my partner about what the front desk told me and we both concluded it was nonsensical for a public transport train to start that late (9AM) since numerous travelers and Seattle residents need to take the train early. I checked the Link Rail website on my on at discovered the train begins at 6:20AM on Sundays! I also called the 24 hour transportation hotline and they confirmed the train begins running at 6:20AM and they also gave me directions to the 2 minute walk behind the hotel where we could catch the bus that would easily take us directly to the train station. I truly believe the hotel makes money off booking Town Car/Shuttle services to the airport and purposefully deceives tourists into paying the $35 each way instead of advising cost effective and easy ways to get to the airport. My partner and I were extremely upset and wanted to voice our complaint to the hotel manager. I called twice from the room to try to speak to a manager and was put on hold for extended periods and had to hang up both times in order to have enough time to begin our transit back to the airport. On the 3rd call from our room I was told a manager would call back quickly, we waited an hour an never heard back. There was also no manager present at the front desk. I also called the HI Express when I returned home and was put on hold again and unable to speak to a manager.

Apparently space is at a premium here and the garage is underneath the hotel down a somewhat difficult to navigate ramp.

We had booked using Priority Points and were very lucky to get a parking space at the front of the building. We were given a room on the top floor (621) which had two large double beds which were good for us all, a flat screened television, and breakfast is included. We also accessed the internet using the wireless capability and it was a little slow at times but otherwise was fine for general work. The complementary newspaper was useful to get up to speed on what was happening in the city and around. The breakfast area was indeed very full and we were a little lucky to get a table on both mornings that we were there. However, the breakfast time availability was extended time and it did get quieter a little later. Cereals, fruit, toast, muffins as well as eggs etc were available and milk was available in cartons which you took to your table. A variety of fruit juices and coffee was also available. There was a large sofa with a large screened television also in this room to keep the children occupied when they did not want to sit at the table. Another plus with this hotel was the swimming pool itself which was great for the children. The only real downside was a lack of changing facilities and there only being one shower (all this is shared with the fitness room next door) so there was a wait and a quick change before heading back to the room. The room we were in was not on the Space needle side of the hotel and even on the top floor the noise of the bins being cleared was evident during the early morning. Also this floor is higher than the HI next door so you do get a good view towards the east side of the city and I5. The location is extremely good for a relatively short walk to the Needle and it was not bad for a walk into the basic shopping centre of the city itself. This was evident with our two young children and we actually used the reasonably priced monorail back to the Needle to come back. The general area around the hotel is a little run down but it is clear that it is being improved with new apartments and leisure spaces including restaurants between the hotel and the Needle. In conclusion this is a good value oriented hotel for visiting the Needle and the city centre. As we were tourists using our car to get to places was not really required, we used a \"tour\" to do this (if you want a little fun and have kids check out the Ducks).

We enjoyed the typical HI express amenities which include triple-sheeted beds, comfortable linens/towels, and free breakfast. One of our rooms was a \"mini suite\" which had one queen bed, a sofa with pull-out, coffee table, computer desk, microwave, and mini-fridge. It had a nice view of the space needle from the window (see photo). The other room was just a regular room with 2 Qs. Both rooms got good free in-room wifi which is always a plus when you are sightseeing. The location was excellent, just a few blocks walk to the \"Seattle city center\" area which has the space needle, pacific science center, emp/sci fi museum, and many restaurants. There is a monorail there that you can take to get within walking distance of the pike market, so overall you are pretty nicely situated to walk or use public transportation to numerous sights and restaurants. This HI Express backs up to a \"regular\" Holiday Inn and they share the same parking garage which was a bit tight to get into and around with our rental minivan, but we managed. The parking has a fee of $10 a day, but I don't think the hotel actually charged our account for that. The rooms at this hotel, like the parking, are tight. We had 2 younger children with us in the mini-suite and had requested a rollaway bed which was promptly provided. However, there was absolutely nowhere to put it in this small room! So we ended up putting one child on the unextended sofa, putting the coffee table on end in the closet area, and then opening the rollaway in the coffee table's normal space. We could barely get by without tripping over the rollaway bed, but I guess it is a small price to pay for not listening to kids kick each other during the night. We were not charged for the rollaway either. The breakfast was typical HI Express - there was 1 hot option each morning, scrambled eggs and bacon, or eggs with biscuits and gravy. There was a nice assortment of muffins (the chocolate-chocolate-chip scored well with my crowd) and cinnamon rolls. Also, cereal, yogurt, milk, juice, coffee, and apples or bananas. The hotel does have an on-site restaurant, which as priority club members we were given a 10% off coupon for, but we did not go since its reviews were nothing special. The people at the front desk were friendly and efficient. Although the rooms (and the parking) were tight, they met our needs and were clean and comfortable. There is a small indoor pool.

There is a Monorail by the Space Needle that for $4 takes you Downtown in about 3 minutes. That is a fun experience, but not worth taking everyday, as it takes about 10 minutes to walk Downtown.

It's about 15-20 minute walk down to Pike Place Market, the real highlight of this city. Your best bet is to go down Battery to 1st Avenue. You will avoid most of the numerous homeless people that plague downtown Seattle. The room was very clean, breakfast was great, though very crowded. We only parked a car for 1 night, and after getting stuck at the end of the parking lot, we got a spot that fit our sedan rental. Parking is tight, but the price is not bad. I did a lot of research before going on this trip - months of research. I encourage anyone who enjoys walking to stay at this hotel and save some cash. I didn't find the monorail to be helpful in getting down to Pikes Place Market, it is better for the shopping district only. SafeCo Field was about 2 miles from the hotel and we walked to two games while we were there, not bad at all, as long as you take the right route.

Being a Priority Club member, I was even greeted with cookies! I splurged for a King suite with jacuzzi tub - it was great to have the extra space - basically a standard bedroom that had a sofabed, with a smaller bedroom connected with a door. We did look out the back at the adjacent Holiday Inn, but the extra space made up for the lack of a view. The oversized jacuzzi tub was great - like having our own hot tub! Internet worked well, but does require an ethernet cable. I have just started carrying one with me all the time. There is also a small business center in the lobby with two computers and printers - great for printing boarding passes. The kids (and I) enjoyed the indoor pool that was actually heated. True, it's not huge, but it is ample. Hey, it's the only decent hotel in the downtown area that has a pool. You can walk to the Space Needle and adjacent museums and amusement park in 5 minutes. It's an easy walk with signals to cross streets. You can also walk to a bus stop in the downtown free bus ride zone in about 5-10 minutes. The free ride zone covers a large area. You really don't need a car here. We worked our way down to the waterfront one evening and had a great meal at Fishermans. We took a cab back and it was only $10, including a $2 tip. I parked a rental car here the first night - yes, its tight parking, but not nearly as bad as I expected from the previous reviews. I returned the car on the first Monday (original plan - we had it for a week touring around the state - see other reviews for Sheraton Airport Portland, OR; Quality Inn Ocean Shores, WA; Quality Inn Port Angeles, WA; Qualtiy Inn Downtown Victoria, BC) so didn't have to park the remaining nights. We ate a dinner at the adjacent Holiday Inn - fairly plain food, but kids eat free - nice budget break during a two-week trip! I used the washer/dryer facilities one night - the detergent machine took my money - the front desk staff gladly gave me a box without question. Hint - if you have to have a rental car while in Seattle, reserve it from the downtown location - you can save ~$90 in taxes on a week's rental. It pays for the cab ride to the rental location and the town car ride from the HIExpress back to the airport and more. The hotel will arrange a town car to take you to the airport for a $30 flat rate - less than a metered cab fare.

As I looked closer I noticed the person had a camera and could see the red light blinking occationaly indicating he was in fact taking pictures, I can only assume at the windows in the Holiday Inn Express. Concerned I called the front desk immediately and informed the front desk clerk. To my astonishment, my concerns were all but disregarded as he informed me they were quite busy and he would call the other hotel when he had a moment. Appalled I asked for the number to call myself and did just that to inform the Quality Inn someone was on their roof, apparently taking pictures of the guests at the HIE. When I checked out, I once again explained the situation and my disbelief in the quality of response. This person was much more appologetic and responsive and did give me a follow-up call after I checked out saying they were checking into it with the other hotel.

I don't imagine the guy was taking pictures of someone like myself...but to imagine someone taking pictures of my wife, daughter or mother is very upsetting. To not do anything about it-is infuriating!

There are no proper curtains! The windows are dressed with a sheer curtain and curtain panels on either side, the panels don't move, so if you'd like an afternoon nap, or a long lie-in it's going to be difficult as you can't block out the light.

We just enjoyed the first stay so much more. We did not even get breakfast during the 4/7 stay because we checked out so early the next morning.

A phone call to our credit card company proved that the room had been charged. They would not help us or even get their manager.

The room I had was small and faced Aurora, a very busy and loud street. The Space Needle hovered outside my window about 2 blocks away. Between the rain and the fan on the heater it drowned out most of the noise. Even though small the room was clean and comfortable, refigerator, coffee pot were in good shape. The attached restaurant, the Emerald Club was good for a sandwich and a beer. To me this was a typical Holiday Inn - almost like a McDonalds hamburger, about the same no matter where you are...
