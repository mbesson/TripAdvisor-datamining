I got stoled in my own Room, the cleaning lady took my mom's swetter and the charger from my cell phone that it as in one of my suitcases that it was inside of the closet, when I called the manager there was no manager in charge, I have to wait for more than an hour for him to show up and at the end I was the liar according to him, he told my mom that how she dare to blaim the cleaning lady if she had losted her swetter and that maybe I left my charger somewhere else. He asked to check my suitcases and the ones for my mom and he refused to take responsability, he calls us thiefs and a pair of gold diggers. After that he refused to do something about and for other comments we heard that this is not something new. I would never ever in my life had an experience like this.

We were taken to one rooms, but then after we paid for 5 nights, we were given a completely different room that smelled moldy and was very noisy. The bed was also super uncomfortable and hard! It was impossible to sleep there - it was horrible. We decided we wanted to check out right away and move to a new hotel. When we tried to check out and move to a new hotel, the manager became irate and told us \"too bad\" since we had paid ahead. He yelled at us and was really rude and defensive - we got scared. We tried to compromise with him and even pay for 1 night plus a 20% fee if he would only refund us the other 4 nights. He signed an agreement that he would pay us back, but we had to come back another day since there was \"no money to put back in out account\". Every time we returned, he was \"not around\", according to other employees. There was no refund policy posted, nor is there a refund policy on their website. We are now in a credit card dispute with this hotel and we are still in the process of recovering our money. What a nightmare.

We could only stay here for one night even though we had reservations for 3 nights. It was the loudest hotel we've every stayed in. The only reason we stayed one night was because we were exhausted from traveling. Although we barely slept because of the rudeness of the other guests who were literally screaming, dropping beer bottles or splashing wildly in the pool all night long. These were not college kids either, they were Mexican families on vacation. The management did nothing to ask them to quiet down as far as I know and they were very rude to us the next morning when we told them we were leaving. Do not stay here!

The first two nights we didn't have A/C but with the help of the ceiling fans and the fact that we weren't in the room during the day we managed to get by until they fixed it. After that, the A/C worked great. Our junior suite was on the ground floor and had an elevated walkway above the pool about a regular sidewalk width wide. No room to sit right outside our room in chairs and no private terrace. But we adapted and would mainly sit around the very nice pool area after returning from the beach around 4 pm and have a happy hour with other guests who were staying at the hotel. You could bring your own beverage or buy beer for 15 pesos each at the restaurant where they served you the included breakfast that came with the room. The front room in our junior suite measured about 13' X 20'. It had a sofa, big counter with a stainless steel sink, a couple bar stools, and a bigger mini fridge which could be set very cold. The bedroom with the king bed measured about 13 feet square and had a 19 inch color TV mounted on the wall on which you could get a large number of channels. Probably about 10 English speaking ones included. Bathroom with shower was decent sized and we had a closet, dresser, and an in room safe. We have been to Mexico about 15 times. Three times to Playa. And you always get some kind of culture shock when you first check in. In almost all cases, and this includes 5 star all inclusives, we have found little things that should be touched up and repaired or repainted. The Vista Caribe was no different. But the tile floors and the entire room were cleaned pretty well and we settled in and had a very enjoyable stay. The King Bed is very firm. But we slept very well and had no back problems. We had no problems with noise in our room. Beach towels were available at the front desk. And since the Vista Caribe did not have beach chairs on the beach, we would walk a short distance and get beach chairs at one of the nearby beach clubs. Our favorite was probably Yan and Tens. Beach lounger with thick padded mat and umbrella was 50 pesos. But the beer price of 35 pesos for 2 cervezas was cheap (that is less than $1.75 per bottle). Regular chairs and a table set up on the beach with umbrella were available at no charge. A couple great restaurants to try are La Pesca (great Imperial Shrimp stuffed with cheese and wrapped with bacon for 130 pesos) on 30th Avenue across from Mega. El Fogon is a great choice for authentic Mexican. We split one huge order of Chicken Fajitas which included baked potato, some guacomole, frijolles (a delicious bean soup) and tortillas which only cost 70 pesos. Our entire bill for the meal and a beer each was around $10 USD. We had some great Italian at Rolandi's. Meals were around $10 to $12 USD. But the bottle of Evian water that my wife got cost 39 pesos. My bottle of beer was 28 pesos. All in all, we had a very comfortable enjoyable stay at this very clean hotel. We paid a pretty reasonable price for what we got. I would stay there again. But it would be nice to be at a hotel directly on the beach.", "Date": "March 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cLocation & room config, but nothing else...\u201d", "Author": "MoretaCalgary", "ReviewID": "UR13684043", "Content": "Our trip was from February 1 to February 17, 2008. We stayed at (and wrote reviews for) the following hotels (if you are interested in the others): Hotel Vista Caribe, Playa del Carmen, Mexico Doubletree Cariari by Hilton, San Jose, Costa Rica Cabinas Espadilla, Manuel Anotonio, Costa Rica Garden Court Hotel, San Jose, Costa Rica Days Hotel - Greenspoint, Houston, TX, USA My husband, 9 year old son, brother and parents stayed at the Vista Caribe from February 1 to February 8, 2008. This was our first trip to Playa del Carmen, but we\u2019ve been to other Mexican destinations. This is a small hotel with a very convenient location. It is a half block walk to the beach and a half block the other way to 5th Avenue. The court yard and the swimming pool are well kept, although quite small and right next to rooms. There is really no where to sit that you aren\u2019t right in front of someone else\u2019s door. The \u201cswim-up bar\u201d is physically there, but not in use, although guests can take their own drinks out to the area and sit under the bar roof which is basically just used as a patio now. The rooms are in serious need of TLC. There were broken tiles in every room; most of the furniture had seen better days and the fridges looked pretty old (although they worked). AC was sketchy as there are only 3 condensers for the whole hotel (my bro is an electrician and was looking at this stuff) so some days it worked pretty well, others not so much. A few gallons of CLR would work wonders to unclog and clean lime encrusted showers & sinks. Our shower had mould starting on the ceiling and we could see where it had been painted over (instead of cleaned first) in other showers. However, the beds were clean and comfortable and they did come in and clean up the rooms each day. The redeeming feature was the room configuration. We had a quad room which was two levels, a queen bed and bathroom on each level \u2013 nice if you\u2019ve got kid(s), a triple room with a main queen bed and a second double bed with a partial wall in between for a bit of privacy and a double room which was a standard hotel room with one queen bed. The hotel does not have its own restaurant which was a problem during the election as we weren\u2019t allowed to buy alcohol for the day before or day of the election unless it was within your hotel (we were unaware of the election and no one filled us in when we arrived or we\u2019d have been prepared!) The breakfast offered by the restaurant next door as part of the hotel\u2019s charge was OK for a day or two, but limited in terms of selection. We found a place a block to the south on 5th Avenue that offered a breakfast buffet where we started going later in the week. There are lots of other restaurants around though, so finding food isn\u2019t a real problem. We loved Casa Agua, Madre Tierra and Playasia. Not so fond of Big Lobster or El Rancho right next to the hotel. Later at night, Bourbon Street was good for US music and the 2 for 1 place half a block south on the west side of the street was good for live Mexican music and drinks (my memory is fading). One challenge of not being right on the beach is lack of chairs/shade when you visit the beach. If you are beach front, your hotel will have those, if not, you can\u2019t use them and there is no public area where chairs/umbrellas are offered for rent that we could find. While the sand is soft and comfy, bringing your own umbrella would be handy. The location is about four blocks north of the bus terminal so if you catch a bus from the Cancun airport to Playa, you could easily walk to the hotel. It is also about six or seven blocks north of the ferry to Cozumel which was handy for day trips. Since we\u2019ve been to Mexico before, we did not arrange any tours through either the hotel or through one of the tour vendors. We took the ferry to Cozumel one day and rented scooters to explore the island. There will be lots of people offering scooters and other stuff when you get off the ferry. However, if you go for a walk first and then go looking for those guys when there is no ferry, they can be hard to find. Scooter/car rental places are about two or three blocks east from the ferry exit and then north if you need to find them on your own. We also went snorkelling in Cozumel and went with one of the companies who actually had a guy on the ferry advertising. All the \u201cglass bottom boats\u201d which seem to be the common fare are fairly similar, so if you want something bigger/different, you\u2019d probably have to check with a tour operator. We rented a car one day and went south along the highway to Xel-Ha. It was a nice place, but not cheap and snorkelling wasn\u2019t anywhere as clear as out in the open ocean. Arrive early so you get your money\u2019s worth as they close at 5:00 p.m. I believe entrance was $80/pp and didn\u2019t include the submarine, underwater walk, dolphin stuff or basically all the really \u201ccool\u201d stuff they advertise. It did include all food and drink, so again \u2013 arrive early so you can take advantage of the big buffets and free drinks (the wide open Corona tap was a favourite!) We rented a car another day as well and visited Tulum to the south. We enjoyed this visit to the area better than a previous one on a guided tour as we weren\u2019t herded around like sheep and forced to visit gift shops. Having a guide book about the ruins would be helpful. Remember to bring your bathing suit so you can enjoy the beach at the bottom of the cliffs. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d return to this hotel unless its gets a good cleaning and a few repairs. However, for the price and the room configuration, it worked well for the type of group we had.

Our suite included a kitchenette with microwave and minifridge, a dining room table, living room area and two bedrooms. More than enough room to spread out.
