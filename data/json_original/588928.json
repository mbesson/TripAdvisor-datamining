{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very Ordinary Walked in off the street to book this hotel after finding the Bali Garden Beach Resort (2 doors down) was fully booked. Pool looked nice and the bar pool seemed to be manned, however didn't see anyone swimming. Pool closes at 10pm.Location was fantastic, just across the road from Waterbom Park and very close to many shops and restaurants/pubs. Complimentary breakfast and arrival drink, however after staying a night, we decided not to eat or drink there. We showered with a cockroach and couldn't get the hot water to work. We were in room 111 on the bottom level where the bathroom wasn't too bad I guess (I'm not too fussy) but the bathroom in 316 was tiny! You could sit on the toilet at wash your feet in the hand basin at the same time. The beds were huge singles and very comfortable. Rooms were very cool when we arrived, but the AC must have been turned off at some point through the afternoon while we were out. Self controlled AC in each room.Indonesian TV channels only. paid about $50US which I felt quite expensive for what we got and compared to other nicer hotels nearby.", "Date": "Dec 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR487287966", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "chicknlips"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d588928-r22795638-Hotel_Karthi-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "588928", "Price": "$41"}}
