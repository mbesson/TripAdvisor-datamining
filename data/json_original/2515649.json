They have waffles, cereal, hard boiled eggs, fruit and various drinks but no place to sit down in the lobby. However, it is no problem to take breakfast back to your room or eat at one of the tables by the pool. It is very convenient to most every place in San Diego. It is also easy to get on I-8 east or west. The motel, although right off the freeway, is quiet and in a beautiful spot, sort of an oasis compared to all of the other motels that are 90% parking lot.

The property was fantastic. It was very well maintained by both repair and cleanliness. The King room were very nice with expected amenities. Breakfast was basic but fine for me who was on the go early am. The front desk service was personable and helpful. The maids refreshed the rooms each day to perfection. The free amenities I enjoyed was the breakfast, in-room safe, and above average toiletries. The room was good size, good furnishings, and perfectly sanitized. I was very satisfied with the money I spent at the hotel. I would not mind returning back to this hotel on my return visit.

First night, single bed room location horrid - highly frequented soda machine just outside door; Interstate noise continuous - added up to unrestful night.

The alternative was to be moved to a different room. Made all the difference. Two bed room location was at back of site away from machines & Interstate plus much larger and had HDTV. First night room had an old, fuzzy TV. My advice if you choose this hotel with its ridiculous \"can't change your mind\" check out policy, book a two bed room because the price difference is worth the amenities including a table and chairs for eating. That's important because there is no central dining area; it's eat in your room. Breakfast is sparse compared to similar priced accommodations. Food choice is pretty much waffles or a piece of fruit. Hotel Row is home to all brands of hotels and a great location because it is the Interstate service road essentially; is located just across from a major shopping center with movie theater, restaurants (Cheesecake Factory is a stand out), etc; easy access to Interstate facilities getting to Things To Do.

We did experience a friendly staff. They were very attentive to our request. The room was clean, but not a comfortable layout. The TV is on the side of the beds sitting on top of a dresser. The TV had not been changed out to a flat screen model. Still an old, heavy tube model and not even on a swivel to make it easy to turn toward the bed. The room walls were bare of any pictures-not even some cheap ones. The AC was loud. It competed with the TV sound. The ironing board would not stay up, but housekeeping brought us a new one. The shower hot water wasn't consistent and the water pressure was low. The tub was dirty-brown stained bottom. The biggie: The hole in the bath towel. When you are getting out of the shower it is too late to call housekeeping for a new towel. Plus there were black spots on the towel like someone had put polish on their shoes with the towel. I was going to complain upon checking out, but the one and only employee behind the desk had more customers standing behind me. (Upon checking in there was only one employee on duty at the desk with a lobby full of people waiting to check in. The housekeeping supervisor came in to help-bless her heart. She was the best part about the stay) The outside walkways in front of the rooms and the stairs were dirty. They needed a good steam cleaning. The ice machine at the pool was dirty. Trash needed to be emptied. It stunk. We continually had to pass a trash container at the top of the stairs to get to our room. The breakfast area is next to the front desk. So if you check out during the breakfast rush hour, be prepared to jog around those standing around waiting for their waffle to cook. And you have to take your meal back to your room. There is no place to sit now and eat. I'd think the hotel would have at least dedicate a room for this activity.

Suggestions for front-desk employees: gently remind upstairs occupants that the floors are thin and to be considerate of downstairs neighbors.

I felt the room was clean and the maid service did a good job. They do seem to be reluctant to give extra towels for some reason though. The one thing that was kind of bothersome were the knats that were in the room when we checked in. I think the maids leave the doors open while cleaning and they enter then with all the trees surrounding the facility. This could easily be fixed with better awareness. Also, the in-room safe did not work. Make sure you get the $2 per day charge removed from your bill if it does not work. It was laready included on my bill and would not have been removed if I had not said anything. Leo, in the office was very helpful and pleasant during our breakfast visits. And the breakfast itself was what I have come to expect.....your basic waffles, cereal, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, muffins (weekends only), milk, juice, coffee.....more than adequate. Be aware that parking is VERY limited. If you return late on a weekend night when the hotel is at capacity, you will not find a place to park. This happend to me, and after going into the front office to ask for help I was told to park in the \"overflow\" lot out back (which looked like a homeless camp), or pay $17 to park next door at the Marriott. I chose to park at the hotel on the end of an aisle that was technically not a parking stall, but did the job and was out of the way. In the morning I saw that others who returned even later than I did had the same problems and some even parked in the landscaped areas. They really need to address the parking problem.

However, as far as I am concerned, it is as good as or better than the fancy motels. It is a beautiful little motel (one can park at the door) in a lovely setting. Every one from the desk to the cleaning staff were great and very helpful. The room was very clean and stayed that way. The wireless internet service, although listed as not secure, is excellent and worked every time. There were no surprises at check out-I was charged exactly what I was quoted per night plus taxes-no hidden fees. The room has a microwave, fridge, ironing board, coffee maker (for-for me, tea) and a safe. I believe there may be a fee if one uses the safe but I did not use it so I can't say. In my opinion the location is great. It is easy on and off of I-8 going east and west. But, then I can get around Hotel Circle and San Diego with no problem. I had no problem getting to Cabrillo National Monument, Mission Bay, Old Town Birch Aquarium, the USS Midway, or Harbor Drive. It isn't that hard but for some one not used to the city it might take some practice but once you know where you are going (and San Diego is not hard to get around in) it is easy from this motel. There are some restaurants in motels near here but I did not try them. That would be the only draw back -lack of near by places to eat. They do have a nice breakfast in the lobby with Belgium Waffles, hard boiled eggs, fruit, cereal, tea, coffee, juice, etc., BUT one needs to bring the tray from the room that the coffee maker is on and take breakfast back to the room. My room was ground floor near the stairs and by the coke and snack machines and it was not noisy. There are two pools, one heated.

Try finding a cheaper, cleaner alternative in the San Diego area than The Vagabond. It's not going to be an easy task. 4 nights' stay, taxes INCLUDED, came to around $270 ($67.50/night). For this we got: -a decent-sized CLEAN room (unlike the hotel down the street where we previously stayed. -free parking (UNlike a unnamed hotel nearby that charges $16/day to park). -free wireless internet that works well. -a safe in-room -in-room microwave -in-room refrigerator -iron/ironing board; they'll lend you a hair dryer -a very nice comfortable king-size bed. the pillows were nice, too. -a free continental breakfast every morning (fresh fruit, coffee, milk, cereal, wafflemakers) -TV and desk area in-room During our most recent trip, my wife and I stayed in 3 different hotels in Las Vegas and San Diego. The Vagabond had the most comfortable bed. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I slept like a baby, and I am a pretty light sleeper. The location is within walking distance to other hotels in the circle (restaurants), there is a convenience store next door, and you can walk to Fashion Valley Mall in about 10 minutes. I should mention that we had a vehicle at our disposal (my son lent us his truck). The hotels on Hotel Circle are right next to the freeway (I-8). If you are not going to have a vehicle you should probably stay downtown. Other than that, The Vagabond is great. Regretfully, we may never stay at The Vagabond again.

The AAA price of 59 dollars a night was fantastic, and the help was very friendly and pleasant, but there were some issues I had. First off, the water heater is extremely finicky and often spurts out cold water without warning for a minute or two before returning to it's previous state. On top of this the rooms are fairly small, and not at all what I expected from viewing their images on this website and others. Our room was also extremely noisy as traffic can be heard quite clearly from the room. If I had to describe the level of sound I would say it was almost like the window was open, but I have checked and double checked everything only to find that the gaps in the door are to blame (to which we can do nothing about.) It is easily heard over the television. After finding these issues to be too unpleasant for the price and the vacation I had in mind, I asked if I could either upgrade or cancel my second nights stay, and they informed me that they had no better rooms available, and then denied me the chance to cancel the next day due to their 24 hour cancellation policy. This gesture should speak for the hotel more than I can - they denied me sleep and hot water but they still expect to be paid for the next nights stay. So if you merely need a place to stay the night (not a vacation,) and you have no trouble falling asleep, then look no further - the staff is quite friendly and there is a refrigerator AND microwave in the room... but if you are looking for a vacation, or are a light sleeper, I advise you stay away.

Wifi is free and parking is free. (Town and Country charges $8 a day for parking!) The front desk staff is also very nice and helpful. However, their clientele is what bothered me. On Friday night we were in a room near the pool but we had just arrived, so we had jet lag and wanted to sleep. The kids running in and out of their rooms and slamming the doors was a problem. So was the highway noise. Then we moved into a room farther back in the complex. That solved the highway noise. But on Sat. night a big brother was wrestling his little brother and slamming him into the walls, doors, and railing all the way down the hallway. Finally on Sun night at 4:30 in the morning behind my head board there was a domestic dispute going on with a man yelling, \"I'm going to kill you, you f***ing b**ch.\" Then Mon-Thurs. was just fine and then on Friday evening the pimp mobiles started showing up in the parking lot again. I just can't recommend this hotel and it's sad because there's nothing wrong with the hotel or any of their services or any of the staff.

Even the hot tub was super clean which is different from most public hot tubs I have seen. The 'make-your-own' waffle breakfast was a very welcome change from the bland continental breakfast served by so many less welcoming hotels.
