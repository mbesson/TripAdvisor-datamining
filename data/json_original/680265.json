When we arrived at the hotel I didn't even want to get out of the car. My husband went in and said the lobby wasn't bad. One look at the room and I knew that I did NOT want to spend the night there. I told the desk clerk this and she said that if we left then we would still have to pay 80% of the total price of our two nights. I immediately called my booking company (which I will never use again) and complained to them. They said that they couldn't do anything. No way was I giving this hellhole money for nothing so I sent my husband across the street to get some beer. If I was going to have to stay there then I needed to get a little drunk. While he was gone I went through the room and bedding searching for bugs. I didn't find any, thank goodness. I can't believe that they basically made us stay, knowing how miserable we were and how much we hated their hotel. FYI - Finding out that the Holiday Inn Express was 5 euro less per night was painful. The whole room smelled. The walls were dirty, the exhaust fan in the bathroom had black stuff coming out of it. The toilet was disgusting, the windows were so dirty you could barely see out of them. The carpeting was stained. The curtains didn't cover the entire window so we were up at the crack of dawn. We were given one traditional key for the room. The key had to be used to lock the door. While I was sleeping my husband wanted to go downstairs to use the computer so he had to either wake me up to lock the door behind him or lock me in the room. Speaking of computers....they say their wifi is 5 euro per day....it's 1 euro per hour and it's only available in the lobby. They also said that there was parking available on site for 5 euro a day. The parking was on the street and it was metered. There is a disco right next door and it was very noisy. Then, once the disco closed we were woken up by a street fight and the police trying to break it up. The neighborhood looked sketchy so we asked the owner of the shop across the street if it was a safe neighborhood. He told us \"Don't look anyone in the eye and you *should* be okay\". Wonderful! There is no phone in the room and the tv is maybe a 20\". The remote control for the tv held together by duct tape. I literally could go on forever about how much I hate this hotel. Run far away and as fast as you can!!!", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "RJCW1", "ReviewID": "UR117653090", "Content": "On the upside, the staff were very nice, friendly and efficient. Breakfast was good. However, overall the hotel is very disappointing, overpriced and does not reflect its (excellent) website. There were few facilities in the room - no kettle, no cup. Television, but only with a few German-language channels, which is no good for foreign guests. The rooms at the front of the hotel are very noisy as traffic drives past at speed all night and the windows are not sound-proofed. The room was also too hot.
