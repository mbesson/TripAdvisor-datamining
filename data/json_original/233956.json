I have previously stayed at a NH hotel in Madrid, which was exceptional, and thus had high expectations of the NH Mitte. Though the receptionist on check-in was a little abrupt, I was upgraded to a room on the 7th floor as there were no more standard rooms left, and moreover my request for a quiet room was kindly honoured: I was given a room facing into the inner courtyard, which while there was no view, had essentially no traffic noise. With a closed window, the room was completely quiet, and I had a wonderful night's sleep. There is a complimentary gym on the 8th (top) floor (though did not use it): it has a couple of trendmills, dumbbells up to 20kg and an 'adjustable height' cable crossover machine. So not too impressive, but then again German hotels in general don't seem to have cottoned on to the idea that their clients may want to stay in shape while on travel. Check out was also a little slow: there was a long line of people waiting to check in and out and not enough desk clerks. It would be nicer if one could prepay on arrival, to save time on exit, but then the NH wants the opportunity to sell you all the extras during your stay i.e. minibar, Internet (free in the lobby but not in the rooms), and breakfast (21 euros (there are plenty of cafes outside)). The NH merits the 5 stars nonetheless because of the excellent night's sleep, and at the end of the day, this is most fundamental when on business travel.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheltenham", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "Keri M", "ReviewID": "UR126103312", "Content": "I've stayed in a NH hotel previously which is the main reason why I booked this hotel in Berlin.

We booked the hotel via Hotwire where it as listed as 4 1/2 star. That is not correct. The hotel lists itself as a four star hotel. On the surface it does look like a four star hotel. The lobby is nice and spacious and it seems clean. The garage under the hotel is nice. There are however a number of cons... At first we were given a room on the second floor. Entering the room was not a pleasant experience. The room was old, dark and dirty. The furniture was old and should have been changed years ago. They were all in dark colours and combined with a window that did not give much light to the room it was very dark and boring. The cleaning of the room was not good either. It was cleaned on the most obvious places but if you looked in the corners or beside the TV it was obvious it was amateurish. There were even flies laying by the window. It was awful and as my wife put it \"we have stayed in IBIS-hotels that were a lot nicer\" We went down to to the reception to complain. After som persuading they \"upgraded\" us to a \"deluxe\" room on the firth floor. The only difference between that room and the \"standard\" we were originally given was that this room had been renovovated not too long ago. It was the same size and the bath room looked exactly the same. Cleaing was still not good. This room I would say was good enough for a three star hotel. The \"standard\" room at best for a two star hotel. Anyway - having already paid the room for four night there was not much to do than to accept the room. The hotel is is i a great location and since we did not spend much time in the hotel anyway the state of the room did not matter that much. The hotel offered free wifi- in the lobby. However - I have not experience anything that slow since the 1990s... The check out was another nightmare. Having booked through Hotwire the room was obviously pre-paid. However the reception had no idea about this and wanted us to pay for the room there as well. About four people were involved from the hotel's side before they could finally admit they were wrong. So amateurish... I do no get angry easily but this time I got really upset because their lack of knowledge and unfriendly manner. Finally - when my wife brought up the subject of the cleaning when asked about if we liked our stay - the hotel staff said they were sorry but that it was not their own staff. I can't believe they blamed their poor cleaning on somebody they had hired to do this.

This hotel managed dark okay, but it's noisy because of street traffic (so leaving windows open isn't an option if you prefer quiet,) and also noisy because you can hear other guests through the walls. As for cool -- forget it. The room was absolutely miserable! There is no air conditioning, but a fan -- however, the fan turns itself off after about 10 minutes. No matter what I did, the fan turned off and I woke up stifled & sweaty. (Remember that this is Europe, so there is no top sheet, just a heavy duvet.) I'd get up, turn on the fan, go to sleep, wake up sweaty an hour later, the air in the room stifling and heavy. Horrible! On top of that, the hotel was just cheap -- not in the sense of inexpensive, but in the sense of petty. Chocolates on the pillows on the first night, but never again in a week-long stay. There is no lotion or conditioner. They provided only one bottle of shampoo, one of shower gel, and one bar of soap and never replaced them, even when I ran out on day 3.

We made our booking directly through the hotel & got a great promotional rate including buffet breakfast. Check-in was a breeze, the room was ready upon checkin when we arrived a little early. The room itself was small & the view was looking in on other rooms on a central cavity in the building but despite it being an older building the rooms had been recently renovated so it was pleasant. The Bed configuration was two singles pushed together with separate duvets & square pillows in the European style. TV was a small flat screen attached to the wall. The room had internet which you had to pay for which we only used briefly when trying to figure out where some restaurants were, the speed of the Internet seemed fine. Minibar was stocked with the usual but was packed so could not fit any extra goodies in (Like a schwartzbier or two). The room was very quiet despite being on a small central corridor. The bathroom was small with Shower over Bath & like most hotel bathrooms I have stayed in the bathroom floor inevitably floods but everything worked & the towels were replenished as required whilst the ones we hung up were left to re-use as is the 'eco-friendly' request. Breakfast buffet was packed each day & the wait staff seemed to be working feverishly to turn over the tables & provide pots of coffee & tea to the new restaurant inhabitants. They did well whilst constantly replenishing the buffet which saw vultures circling whenever there was an empty plate. The Food was a full continental spread with the usual hot options of a big tub of scrambled eggs etc. There was a also a chep making fresh waffles. Overall the breaskfast was good although a little manic at times. We had Room Service one night & to be honest not impressed. There are a lot of dining options around & some even better ones a short Bahn away so its our own fault for being too tired after a day of walking around Prenzlauer berg. There is plenty within a short walking distance, just around the corner is 'Kaiser's' Supermarket or snacks & Schartzbier. There is a small bakery right around ther corner as well on the way to the metro station so you can grab a quick pretzel en-route. Pharmacy is literally next door just in case & the galleries lafayette is just up the street.

The hotel is in a very new building and the rooms are in brand new/perfect condition. The location is sensational, in the very best part of Berlin for sightseeing, you are within 15 minutes walk of the Brandenburg Tor, Hitler's Bunker, Potsdammer Platz and its wonderful leisure facilities (Imax, English language multiplex, Sony Centre etc), also Checkpoint Charlie and the old location of the Berlin Wall. The nearest U-bahn (subway) stop is Mitte and is about a minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and the superior room (costing 69 euro for each night - a steal!) even had a microwave oven and sink, the soundproofing from the windows was truly amazing - I think they must be quadruple glazed, not a sound from the busy road outside. The aircon also worked a treat. The staff on reception were very friendly, smiling and helpful, like most Berliners. The hotel is almost opposite the Berlin Telecommunications Museum which has had a multi million pound refit and is a wonderful (& fun) way to spend two or three hours, the three robots whizing around the visitors in the main hall are a hoot. The museum was also very quiet, no crowds! Despite wondering what I was going to do in Berlin I fell in love with the city, it is cheap compared to other Western cities, it is great fun and very down to earth & there are LOADS of things to do. Nowhere in Europe has been affected by history as much as Berlin and there are ghosts everywhere, and because of this history and the massive and almost complete regeneration I found it a very exciting place to be in and completely unpretentious and friendly. I was so pleased with this hotel and Berlin that I will visit again next year, this time for a week, which is certainly something I won't be doing with Paris which I visited last week - what a pretentious, expensive & boring mausoleum! By the way, don't bother staying in the Zoo/K-Dam area in the western part of Berlin, it is no longer the heart of the city and well past its prime, a little seedy. It was probably the place to be 30 years ago but the heart of the city has shifted a mile east since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Mitte area is now the place to be! Also, Berlin doesn't have the hordes of London or Paris, which can become overwhelmingly stifling wihin hours of arrival, being able to wander around peaceful streets was a liberation!", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNice and modern hotel\u201d", "Author": "Gremio", "ReviewID": "UR8096223", "Content": "This hotel is located in a very nice area of Berlin.

The Hotel is very central, close to the old Checkpoint Charlie and very close to the central shopping avenue, Friedrichsstrasse. The lobby is loud in a strange way, so I had problems understanding what I was asked at the desk. The room was not too loud, considering that it was with the window next to the busy Leipziger Strasse. It is a new business-persons hotel with (I assume) all facilities that one can ask for. And the price as well. At more than 150\u20ac pr. night, one does not expect to be charged 6\u20ac for a bottle of water and 17\u20ac pr. day wifi. The brochures claimed that internet was free on cable, but not ethernet outlet was present in the room, then offering only a very uncomfortable high-priced, but well-working Wifi (I guess at about 2 Mbit.) The limit of 400 MB downloads pr. day may or may not be reasonable considering the price. I had dinner at the hotel one night and it was nice, although the vintages on the wine list didn't match what was served and the waitress, who was nice by all other standards, did not know much about the content of the wines. They ought to have in-house tastings to become better at that. The wine list was primarily Spanish and German and seemed both fair and varied. The room was clean and kept very tidy during my stay and even reasonable sized with a good number of facilities, although I missed a trousers press (which would be fair for this kind of hotel). There was a Playstation 2 in the room or something similar, but each game was 5\u20ac or more, so I was glad I brought my Mac (which contrary to popular belief has a few games onboard ;-)) I could be coming back for: - the room itself. - the Wifi (if it was free). - the general service level. - the okay hotel restaurant. I will probably skip it because of: - The super-expensive WIFI. - The super-expensive console game - The super-expensive bottle of water, that made me avoid even looking at the minibar.
