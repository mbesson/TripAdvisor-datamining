The first night, I was in room 303. The bathroom sink had no plub, the towels were so threadbare that you could almost see through them, the shampoo containers had broken seals and were half full. The windows were filthy, there was sand on the floor, and the room smelled musty despite the window air conditioner. The final night, I was in room 102. No phone. When blowing the thick dust off of the clock/radio, I sneezed. No phone. The room is located right next to a common area where a party was going on until late at night. Since you can hear through the walls...enough said. To print out my boarding pass, I had to give all of my information to the desk clerk. A new printer had been installed, and the clerk didn't know how to use it at first. I left to have dinner, and when returning, the desk clerk said that he needed my information again. I did get the pass.

My Aunt booked the hotel through their website less than 2 hours before I arrived at the hotel. When she reserved it, it seemed as if she paid for it when in actuality she only reserved the room. Once I arrived the clerk said they needed to see my Aunts credit card, I explained to her she was not with me and had already paid for the room. That's when it was explained to me it was not paid for but reserved, and if the credit card is not present I could not check in. In order to take the credit card, my aunt would need to send in a fax with a copy of the front and back of her credit card as well as her driver\u2019s license saying she authorized the payment. I explained she was not near a fax and is there any other way to pay for the room without having to do that maybe book through Travelocity. She said I could. I told them to cancel the current reservation so it could be re-booked through Travelocity. The clerk then explained because I\u2019m rebooking without more than a 24 hours notice they would have to charge me a $79 cancelation fee. I explained to her I just made the original reservation online less than two hours ago, I\u2019m standing right in front of you and I\u2019m rebooking the same room why would you charge me $79. At this point I called my Aunt and passed the phone to the clerk so my Aunt could reason with her. In the end she said she would talk to the manager to see if he would waive the fee. Once that was partially settled, I was booked given and key and went to my room The Room: Once I entered the room I noticed a smell, but I couldn\u2019t tell where it originated from. I thought maybe the humidity was causing a closed in smell. Once I pulled the sheets back I noticed they looked stained. I pulled the top sheet back and a section was covered in urine, the smell was horrible. It penetrated down to the mattress cover but not the mattress. I don\u2019t see how the maid could have missed the smell or that spot when making up the bed. I called the front desk and asked for new sheets, they immediately brought them up and apologized profusely. The Restroom: The restroom is very small; the tile could use a good cleaning with bleach to remove dark stains. I also saw what looked like two small baby cockroaches on the toilet. Cleanliness: The maids did not actually clean the room, I marked my sheets to see if my sheets were changed, they were not. They did not clean the restroom, they only made the bed and replaced the towels. Strangely when I arrived I had only three large bath towels, no wash clothes and when they replaced the towels they only gave me three large bath towels. Luckily I had my own face towel, but I thought it was strange I was not provided one or at least a hand towel. Wi-Fi: I was told I would have Wi-Fi in my room, it is available, but it did not reach to the second floor. I had to go down to an area directly adjacent to the front desk to surf the net. I also tried getting a signal in the courtyard but I was unable to. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, the stained sheets alone would deter me from ever going back or telling anyone to visit.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSandy Beach -- very good choice\u201d", "Author": "ChrisBidnith", "ReviewID": "UR118539397", "Content": "I spent my 1st 2 nights in PR at the Sandy Beach Hotel.

The room had dried blood stains on the floor, the shower had hair and other debris in it, towels were dirty and smelly , the mirrors and wall were dirty and the quilt on the bed had a big hole in it. We had to clean our own room in order to feel comfortable in it. The next day we were then given the room we originally requested however, there were no towels. When we complained to the hotel manager she told us she was only the secretary, apparently she was too embrassed or ashamed to admit that she was the manager, and said \"these things happen and an early reservation does not guarantee a specific room \" eventhough the it says in the computer \" do not move guests from this room\" .. Our reservation was made with the niece of the owner who was the one who noted that we were not to be moved from our requested room.

The one maid they had came in when she felt like it or not at all, one day she showed up at 5 PM to start cleaning and only stayed for half an hour. There was garbage left in the halls, the ice machine was broken and kept beeping all night which kept you up along with the noisy air conditoners.

We knew that a head of time. The taxi stand is right outside the hotel. Right up the street at the next parallel intersection is the GreenHouse Cafe and the Latin Star. Great little places for dinner. Starbucks is also a block away. The hotel is a corner walk to the beach. All beaches in Puerto Rico are public and free. Its the same beach as the Marriot for 1/3rd the price. You cant see the beach from your room because the Hotel's neighbor is a condo complex but that doesnt matter. The room and hotel was very clean. The staff was very friendly. The room we had was about the size of a cruise ship cabin, so for one night it didn't matter. The A/C worked well and there were no insects. The elevator is an old style Otis with just enough room for two and your luggage. It's just a little tight.

Old San Juan is really close, either a $.75 bus ride or a $12 cab ride. Old San Juan is nice, lively on the weekend, especialy on Sundays. I stayed in the Sheraton in Old San Juan after the cruise ( I wrote a review there as well). If you are staying for a night or two, I think it is worth the money. And if you just plan to use your room as somewhere to sleep then it is not that bad. If you like the luxury of the a nice room as part of your vacation, then I would not recommend it. The worst part of this whole El Canario Inn/Sea stay was that I orginally reserved my room at the \"Inn\" and when I called to confrim my resevation two days before my arrival, I was told that my resevation was moved to the \"sea.\" The \"Inn\" was closed for vacation. And no one contacted me about the move. I am glad I called. AND when I wanted to cancel my reservation at the \"Inn\" for after my cruise, I wasn't able to do it at the \"Sea\" I had to wait and do it myself when they opened.", "Date": "October 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston MA", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced\u201d", "Author": "Stevemac113", "ReviewID": "UR5612141", "Content": "I guess the big selling point of El Canario is that it's a stones throw from the beach.

The main thing to keep in mind is that El Canario hotels are NOT resort hotels. If you are looking to spend lots of money to lay by a pool all day, this is not the hotel for you. If you are on a budget and looking for a clean, comfortable room right on the beach that offers free breakfast (the pastries were AWESOME!) and a friendly and helpful staff, El Canario is a great choice. The best way to summarize our experience is that I felt like I was a guest in someone's house instead of a nameless guest in a chain hotel. The building is an older building that has been tastefully decorated in tropical decor. The rooms are simple and comfortable. The courtyard where they serve breakfast is really beautiful, so be sure to check it out. And best of all, you are about 10 steps from Conado Beach. And although the hotel's site says they do not have ocean view rooms, the rooms on the front of the building all DO have views of the ocean. The staff, especially Karlos, was wonderful! We had so many questions about tours, restaurants, and just getting around. Karlos helped us so much in ensuring we knew where to go. Thanks Karlos! I have never experienced such personal service and attention from a chain hotel, and good service makes a world of difference! The only real issues we experienced were a drippy faucet in our shower and a broken window latch (issues you'll face in older buildings) and some noise on the weekend nights. The hotel is located on a public access road to the beach so you get some street noise on Friday and Saturday nights (especially if you are one of the front rooms), but this was not an issue the weekday nights. Unfortunately, that's a catch of being so close to a beautiful beach. Bottom line, I'd definitely stay there again! Like I said, if you are looking to lounge at a hotel, not a good choice. If you are looking to get out and see Puerto Rico (and I STRONGLY recommend getting out of San Juan and exploring the island), this is a great place to stay, and it is convenient to restaurants, a convenient, and a bus stop. By the way, if you are looking for good Puerto Rican food, try Cafe de Angel which is about two blocks from the hotel. It's fabulous! Ajili-Mojili (about 4 blocks away) is a little more expensive, but also wonderful.

We are a very easy crowd to please- and just go with the flow- but to be on vacation to celebrate my 40th and feel like we entered a stressful situation was not a good thing. Before considering your stay - please take note-- communication between staff and clientel was lacking and innapproiate. When asking for more pillows - we were told no- when asking for a blanket- beware- none on the beds- just a top sheet - we were told no- some rooms had remotes- some didn't- some rooms had cups in bathroom to rinse mouth out after brushing-some didn't - at times room towels and washcloths were not available- when we wanted ice- we were yelled out for taking too much- when we took extra milk other than enough to fill bowl of cereal- we were chased down and treated like children- sometimes beach towels were not available- the elevator never worked properly- always ended up either below or above floor exit- very dangerous- when we advised the staff of this problem- they shrugged their shoulders and said- well if you get hurt and sue us- we will sue the elevator company- now is that way to resopond to hotel guests. Some rooms had clock radio's - some didin't .Stray cats surrounded the hotel- so the smell of cat urine was not pleasant- and if staying in room 308- be prepared to hear screaming cats in heat - jumping from roof to roof in the wee hours of the morning. If you are in room 206 - two single beds- expect to have your knees hitting your chin while on the tiolet- very very small bathroom. Room 206 had great water pressure- but 300-308-and 200 was a bit lacking with water pressure and hot water. Bottom line is any time we asked for something or were concerned with an issue- we were simply treated as if they didn't need the business. By day 2 - we went across the street to the Marriott- and booked 4 rooms for the rest of the stay. Before we left for vacation we did look at the Marriott property- but a steep price of $400 a night kept us away- when we checked the second time around when we were in town $200 a night was the price for a nights stay- only $75 more than El Canario and well worth the difference. So think hard- treat yourself to the comforts that you would want on vacation.
