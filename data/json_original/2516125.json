If you travel outside of rush hour, you'll be in central Los Angeles or West Hollywood in 20 minutes.It's a little bit off the beaten path, and in no way a \"hip\" area, and therein lies its character. Across the street there is a shopping plaza, and a large grocery store that caters mostly to Mexican folks. I went in there several times for various things (including some tasty bakery treats) and people there were friendly. There's a CVS pharmacy a couple blocks away, and the legendary In & Out Burger is represented about four blocks south. Across the street is a Burger King and a McDonald's is abut 2 blocks north. Now, I read a review here were someone wrote they ate at the McDonald's and scurried back. Ummm, ok....this is not the kind of McDonald's you might visit in Ames, Iowa or some suburb where everything is squeaky clean. The neighborhood is working class, a bit gritty, perhaps, but if some reviewers think of the area as \"ghetto\", as one person wrote, I would say, dear sir, you are quite paranoid. In the day, you see all kinds of people out. Single women at bus stops, moms with kids and strollers, etc. At night, you're not going to see so many people walking around, And because it's a major city, you obviously want to always be aware of your surroundings. One of the great things about L.A. is the food trucks. Every night, one parked at the shopping center across the street. My wife and two of our kids walked from the hotel to the truck a couple of times and came back with great tasting food that was cheap. I swear, I'd stay in this hotel again just to hit up that food truck every night. They had the best tacos I had in L.A. One night around 9 pm I had to walk to the CVS pharmacy a couple of blocks way. Would I want my wife to do that? No, of course not, but that's common sense. I walked it and didn't ever feel threatened. but I grew up in Chicago and I'm not going to think I'm in danger if I see a cigarette butt in the curb or see a homeless guy nodding off on a bus stop bench. Parking was never an issue. One reviewer wrote you had to leave your keys with the front desk or some kind of parking valet, but that wasn't my experience. I found the area quite interesting. it is not the glitzy L.A. of the Strip, or as cool as West Hollywood. Walking around the area in the morning, I found mostly small, modest homes of working class folks. There's no cool clubs or coffeeshops. In other words, the yuppies haven't got to it yet and it's authentic. The rooms were clean, spacious, a good spot to sleep for the night, or just put the TV on and zone out. No noise from the streets drifted in. Breakfast was a lot better than other similar hotels I have stayed in. Eggs, waffles, fruit, muffins, yogurt, juice, coffee... I'd suggest at night, go out to the pool area. Pull up a plastic chair, have a glass of wine and chill. Watch the neighborhood, the cars going by, the people coming away from the taco truck, the shoppers at Superior Grocers. This is a part of L.A. that most visitors don't see.

We needed to be in or near Burbank and we researched hotels thoroughly in and near the Burbank area. (It is also close to Studio City). This Trip Advisor site had many excellent reviews of this hotel with only one real negative sited in many of the reviews and that was the parking situation. Well the parking problem has been worked out. They have an efficient system worked out if there are many cars, and it works like a valet system. We had no problems at all. The room was great, although we had to look at about 3 rooms before we took the one we took, as the others either smelled of smoke or had no screen on the window. In the end the room we had was perfect, except for not having quite enough lighting (more lamps or more overhead lighting is needed and a night light is also needed). We just moved a lamp that was on the desk to another area and it worked for us. The room was spacious, the bed perfect , in terms of comfort and size, the TV was fine and the bathroom was super. The hotel and it's surroundings were quiet, so sleeping was fine. The breakfast was adequate, but being there for 2 weeks, it did become repetitive,howeve,the quantity of fresh fruit that was available all day every day was something we had never seen before. Also, there is a grocery store across the street and others not too far away so that you can buy additional breakfast food, or whatever, and put it in your room refrigerator. Every room comes with a refrigerator and microwave. The hotel is near the art district of NOHO and there are a lot of alternatives for eating in the area. One that we recommend highly for breakfast, if you want to leave and eat out is a little restaurant on Magnolia Street called EAT!!! For lunch try the Pit Fire restaurant right on Lankershim. The staff at the hotel was very polite and helpful and in particular, we were pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of the cleaning staff. The hotel is nicely located; very close to the Metro, if one wants to use it. It's also close to Universal, Warner Brothers, and the NBC studios.

For the price, the hotel should have had a microwave and/or refrigerator. Their pool (which we did not use) is located in an unusual place to say the least. Our window did not have a screen. We asked the clerk if it was safe to leave it open at night and he said he would not recommend it because *theoretically\"* someone could climb up or down to the overhang and well, you get the idea. Having said that, the hotel was great for the price--many places in LA worth more than this one are dumps, and almost all under $100 seem to be. The staff was very helpful (a couple were not all that helpful but tried to be), and the room was nice. Their free computer with internet access in the lobby area was a bonus (kind of slow, but how many motels even offer this service); I used it a few times for information. We had no parking issues as some have raised. Perhaps we were there at a slow week but there were plenty of spaces available. The neighborhood felt safe to us. I don't know how some posters here define safe, but there are far worse neighborhoods in Hollywood and I have stayed in much less safer-feeling areas before. I only saw one instance of what I assume was crime-related (one evening, a helicopter flying a few blocks from the hotel shining a spotlight on the ground) A great supermarket was conveniently located across the street which I went to every night for cooler ice. The best thing about the hotel was their continental breakfast. They had a lot of choices, of which I tried most in 4 mornings, and all the food was fresh and good. Loved the waffle-maker! Why can't more hotels/motels have breakfast that is more than a piece of fruit and plain toast.

And shortly after arriving, we quickly saw why. From the brand name, we had already been expecting 2-3 diamond standard service - which was fine with us. We weren't planning to spend a majority of our time at the resort. There are a couple things that should change though if they haven't already! Being that I work at a resort myself, I'm very careful to use my debit card to hold a reservation - I only did so after calling the property directly to confirm no deposit would be taken, which they confirmed. Upon arriving, I told the front desk agent I would like to use a different card than the one I used to hold the reservation with, which he said was fine. I signed the registration form with the new credit card information. Upon getting to my room, I called both my credit card used and debit card to check the balances on both - I had over $250 holding on both cards! I'm very aware that additional money is usually held for parking, resort fees, incidentals, etc - but I had specifically asked for my debit card not to be charged! I walked back to the front desk and asked for them to reverse the charge, which the agent said he had already done - and that it's up to the bank now to release it. Again, I work at a front desk myself - after asking him to please call the authorization center and to reverse the authorization using his merchant number, he said he couldn't do it and that only a manager could - and the next manager wouldn't be there until the day of my departure. This was a horrible start to 3 days, since the money in my checking was what I would be using for food, recreation etc. Had it been held only on the debit card, I would have used my credit card - but he was holding both! That's near $500 I couldn't use! I told him he should do his best to fix it himself or to call his manager, as I wouldn't be paying for his mistake. Shortly after we had settled in and unpacked everything, the fire alarm system went off. Assuming it could be serious, we picked up everything we could grab (after just unpacking it) and ran down the stairs. We were stuck outside of the hotel for roughly 45 minutes before it was clear to go back in. We went to the concert that evening, and came back to find there were no parking spaces available. This upset me because we're paying for daily parking, and either 1) there aren't enough spaces to accomodate all guests, or 2) someone is bringining additional cars, which hurts both the employees and the guests. There was a parking space blocked off with traffic cones, which I removed myself - I was not going to pay someone else for overnight parking when I was already paying that to the hotel! Beds were very comfortable - A/C was a bit loud. The next morning, took a shower - very refreshing, strong pressure - until the hot water went out! Day of departure - hotel included continental breakfast. The bagels and muffins were stale! We ended up going to Denny's before driving home. It's good that my boyfriend and I have humor, because most of these things were pretty funny in restrospect - but I left comments with the manager - so hopefully, your future stay there is more enjoyable!

I initially booked for one night only since I could not find enough reviews to feel confident about booking the additional nights for our Los Angeles stay. The hotel is a few miles past Universal Studios theme park on Lankershim Blvd. The Blvd goes from ritzy studios/office buildings to modern lofts and retail (Starbuck's, etc.) to low/middle class housing/shopping, where you will find the hotel situated. We felt pretty safe, and upon seeing the room, which was cleaner than what I expected, we spoke to the staff about availability for 2 add'l nights. To my dismay, the staff was rather non-chalant about checking availability, and I was told to just call the front desk the following morning. We got the additional nights, however, they did not offer us the AAA rate ($89) that we were offered at the initial booking. The bathroom was very clean, as was the room in general. I was not impressed by the bedding. The sheets had moderate soils that were not removed in the wash and I found hair in the bed. I generally travel with my own linen when travelling with my toddler, so we made the beds with our own linen, which the maid was kind enough to use when re-making the beds during our stay. Parking was somewhat of a problem. The hotel is newly renovated, and in an effort to have more parking in the one-level garage, there is double parking---one car behind another. Problem is, if the first car in does not pull forward, the next guest is out of luck! Every evening, we had to go in to the front desk to complain. Because they don't follow their own policy of having guests leave car keys at the front desk, we had to invent a space. We watched some non-handicapped guests parking in the handicap reserved spaces!! If you like to swim, don't bank on enjoying this hotel's pool--it's very small and situated, interestingly enough, in the parking deck!! There is a complimentary breakfast each morning; we did not partake, so I cannot comment on that.
