The hotel restaurant is excellent, as is the nearby Pagoroma. Also nearby is the not quite as good but more moderately priced Ambasciata d' Abruzzo. The buffet breakfast had almost anything you would want, from cereals and yogurt to eggs, cheeses, smoked salmon, fruit, breads and pastries. I cannot recommend this hotel too highly.

The service was superb, and the staff was attentive without being overbearing. The concierge in particular was very good and consistently made excellent restaurant recommendations. The location though isolated from central Rome, provided respite from the chaos.

Don't let the location deter you, though, as a cab stand is nearby and it is a short and reasonable trip to most common destinations. If you (like we) enjoy walking, it is a pleasant stroll down through the park to the Piazza del Popolo (one of Fellini's hang outs and home to two stunning Caravaggios at Santa Maria del Popolo), and we even walked back from the Vatican following an early morning tour. At less than thirty rooms, the service is very personalized and consistently courteous and friendly. Of particular note for us was barman and sommelier Nicola Grieco. This is a barman of the old school as in a Hemingway novel: impeccable service and presence, not familiar, but a delight to converse with should you choose to do so. Plus the barroom he runs is an art deco gem. We may return to Rome just to have another martini and bottle of wine with Mr. Grieco. We booked a junior suite and, although not large, it was very comfortable with a small balcony overlooking the park. The room was so quiet and dark that, somewhat jet lagged, we normally early risers inadvertently slept to 11:30 the first morning.

In selecting hotels, I settled on the Lord Byron based on my own research and the reviews to be found on-line. Let me add that we are both well-traveled and have experienced our share of hotel disappointments. In a sentence, the Lord Byron and its staff was a wonderful find! From the moment we arrived, the staff made sure our every comfort was met and this despite a minor check-in problem due to another departing guest. In fact, the most appealing aspect of this charming hotel is its wonderful staff- I have to singularly point out Marta, Gus, the other gentleman concierge/front desk (whose name I did not get- apologies) and of course, the incomparable Andrea Lacetera. An entire review could be written regarding the services and attention provided by Andrea and those who have written before me have echoed the accolades afforded this fine gentleman. Andrea assisted me in planning many aspects of my itinerary as there were certain special touches I desired in order to make the visit a memorable birthday for my wife. His every suggestion and attention to detail was impeccable. The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood on the north of the Borghese Park. The location makes for an exceedlingly quiet stay and a true oasis after a hectic and noisy day/evening in the crowds of Rome. We are accustomed to walking and frankly enjoyed our strolls through the park as we came and went. A taxi is but a 1 minute wait when needed. Marta is happy to map out the shortcuts through the park if walking is preferred. The interior is art-decco modern and a clear departure from chain hotels, as well as from the opulent over-upholstered interiors of other area hotels. The public areas are tastefully charming and our room, with a view and small balcony on the front, was exactly what we expected (and needed). The room was quite spacious and cooled/heated to our needs. Mini bar drinks (water, colas) are freely available and included in the room cost but my suggestion is to visit Gus in the downstairs bar for a quick chat and glass of wine. Except for breakfast, we did not dine in the hotel- and again thanks to Andrea- we were ushered to many of Rome's finer restaurants (and by all means take him up on his suggestions to eat in some of the nearby restaurants that are typically not visited by tourists). With only a small number of rooms (32?), guests have immediate access to hotel staff for questions, planning, etc. In addition, one rarely sees other guests (this despite being nearly full) and the entire feel is almost like staying in someone's villa. Already we are discussing a return visit and look forward to seeing our friends at the Lord Byron once again. This was the perfect hotel visit for us and we can't imagine staying anywhere else in this wonderful city.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel with the friendliest staff in Italy!!!!\u201d", "Author": "ShaunaG-77", "ReviewID": "UR106993694", "Content": "I cannot say enough nice things about this lovely hotel in Rome!

I travel a lot for work and leisure and I have never posted on Trip Advisor because our trips usually are great. However, I felt that it was necessary to post our experience at this hotel so that other families with young children are aware of it. After reading the great reviews of this 5 star, we were excited about the trip. When I booked the room in December, I communicated in writing that I would need 2 baby cribs. A week before our arrival, I wrote to the hotel to reconfirm and the resident manager told me that a crib or a rollaway would be an option for our older child. I explicitly told her that I wanted 2 cribs. She said fine. When we arrived, I was told that only one crib was available. I informed the front desk that this was not acceptable given my original communication and my correspondence with the manager last week. We went up to the suite and found that the hotel had already pulled out the couch and made it up as a bed. This irritated me even more. Forty-five minutes later, the front desk called me and said that they had another crib. When the crib arrived, I was not impressed. It looked like a small wooden crate with bars around it with a mattress as thick as a sponge. This is not 5 star service. To put things into perspective, the Four Seasons has beautiful brass cribs decorated with colorful buntings, beautiful bed linens, a stuffed animal and a welcome gift for children. Later at breakfast, we were told that there was only 1 high chair in the restaurant. I could not believe it. The poor other family with a young child had no high chair to use at all. Some of the other reviewers wrote about how it was lovely to walk through the park to get to the city sites. This is true if you don't have a stroller with 25 kilos of kids in them. The hotel is situated on top of a hill. To get to the sites, one must walk down a big hill, then walk up a big hill and then down again and then of course, up, down, up on the way back. It takes about 15-20 minutes to get to the closest site, about 1.5 hours to get to the Colosseum. We like to walk a lot but it is hard to avoid taking cab at all if you stay at this hotel. Again, if you don't have young children, that is fine. If you do and have to drive without car seats in a taxi, it's not exactly safe. My advice to the hotel is to invest in some basic baby equipment: comfortable cribs and more high chairs if you want to accommodate families with young children.

Andrea got us then a car from the boss of Hertz. took us an entire day to fix that! we had one excellent dinner at Mirabelle restaurant - Michelin star rated - with amazing view; well, in Rome that is pricey though; any dish is in the 50 euro area; so be prepared to spend well above 500 euro!

We looked at all the usual suspects but each time kept returning to the Lord Byron's website. We love small, unique and special hotels and this one fit the bill dead on! We arrived late in the evening but had no trouble settling in immediately. We had a suite on the top (6th) floor with a separate sitting room, bedroom and wonderful bathroom (Note: The elevator only goes to the 5th floor and a flight of steps is required to reach the top/6th floor). The Art Deco is really well done and fully integrated in every aspect of the hotel's design as well as its furnishings and decorations. Even though it was October, it was still pretty warm and we appreciated the AC units in the bedroom and sitting room. In the cool mornings we opened up the big windows to let in the cool air and take in the beautiful views from all sides. The bed was very comfortable, even for someone well over 6'. The bathroom was all white marble and we appreciated having 2 sinks, a separate bathtub (in the same room with the sinks) and shower (in a separate room with the toilet/bidet). The water pressure in the shower was a bit weak but the water was warm and the view from the shower over the rooftops outside made up for that! The public rooms/areas are all impecably kept and the staff is professional, courteous and helpful. The complementary breakfast was a welcome addition and, contrary to some of the reviews, we found it more than adquate to start the day! The neighborhood where the hotel is located is beautiful and being so near the beautiful Borgese gardens, made for some wonderful walks. If you're a dog lover, there's a dog park at the end of the gardens which was always great fun in the evenings. Logistically, as some of the reviews note, the hotel is a bit of a hike from the core tourist areas; however, in our view, that's a benefit since being able to retreat to the quiet, calm beauty of the hotel in the evenings was a welcome event. We walked a few times into the core area and enjoyed the scenery along the way; however, we also did end up using taxi's to take us to the core and back a few times as well. That said, the distance, by cab, is very short and the fare was never over 10 euros (usually less). Bottom line: If you want to be in the thick of things then you'll probably want to stay closer to the core. If you do, however, you'll miss this gem and the beauty that surrounds it. SPECIAL NOTICE goes to the incredible master barman in the hotel lounge! He really has style and makes the best negroni's I've ever had! We can't wait to return! P.S.

I am a member of the Leaders Club so hastily reserved Hotel Lord Byron. Looking at some of the other reviews I think that I shall deal with the location first. It certainly isn't right in the middle of the action, but then again it isn't that far out at all either. It is right by the Borghese park which has many touristic as well as naturalistic attractions of its own. The quickest way into the city isn't through the park but along one of the roads leading up to the hotel - it is an easy fifteen minute walk downhill to the Plaza Popolo (location of arguably Rome's best property, Hotel De Russie) and then another five - seven minutes to the Spanish Steps. Of course the walk uphill might take you longer, but if you are reasonable capable and not in any tearing hurry this should not present any obstacle in your staying here. If you really are unable to walk then a taxi to/from the Spanish Steps will only cost around 6-7EUR. A plus side of this location is being able to eat in restaurants local to the hotel which are not touristy (nor Michelin starred), being filled with largely local diners. I stayed in a junior suite (photographs of which have been posted by another reviewer) which had almost faultless decor. Lots of high gloss, high quality veneered furniture in an art deco style, red velvetty carpets, and a couple of paintings to tie in with the theme and add some fifties interest (i.e. to remove the 30s themepark feel and to make the whole scheme more eclectic). This was complemented by two terraces, one being rather large with a few pots containing mature orange trees; a most delightful place to relax in the evening. Bathroom was half timbered, think deck from a yacht and the remainder was finished in large marble tiles. If one wanted to be very picky, then the bathroom should've had twin vanities and perhaps a separate shower, which would've been possible had it been arranged in a completely different manner. The deco theme extended to the rest of the hotel, once again objects/paintings from a different era added to the eclectic feel. Overall the property almost gave the impression, particularly in the hallways with the large framed, lacquered veneered doors, of being on a yacht from the 30s. Unfortunately the restaurant, which seems to have a good reputation, was closed during my stay so I could only take breakfast at the property. The usual selection of four or so fruit juices; orange juice was not \"freshly squeezed\" despite the label aside the jug declaring that it was (this seems to have been the case at this time of year at all the other Italian hotels I stayed at on my trip - so is not a problem unique to this property). Some scrambled egg, bacon, cereals, fresh fruit, tinned fruit, pastries, cheeses, etc. The selection was by no means expansive, but I would describe it as adequate. Compared to another property on my trip (in Naples) the breakfast was vastly inferior. I would recommend that they provide far higher quality pastries instead of some warm croissants and danish pastries, try to use more local Italian cheeses instead of Dutch stuff, and provide a greater variety of fresh fruits. Service throughout my four night stay was excellent. Door and reception staff were extremely patient, professional and helpful. Every wish truly was their command. The maids serviced the rooms extremely well, even laying out and folding night clothes (which had been left on a chair) with the turndown service. Again I would agree with other reviewers that it is a shame that there is no relax/fitness centre - even a room with a few loungers, soft lights, scented candles, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room would be better than nothing. Obviously there are space constraints and it would doubtless mean losing a few bedrooms!

Taxis easy though and the hotel has an hourly (10am until 6pm) shuttle bus.", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pensacola, Florida", "Title": "\u201cService was the best attribute\u201d", "Author": "I10driver", "ReviewID": "UR7989917", "Content": "The service and staff were great.

I booked the whole trip myself by researching first at the library using Frommers ect. and then by going on tripadvisor to contact various hotels that looked like a good match. Our first stop was in Rome, and the Lord Byron was our first hotel. Everything about this hotel was fantastic. The service from the time I called from the states to the time we left on the train to Florence was excellent. They were so patient with me as I am quite picky!! Although it is a little off the beaten path of downtown Rome, this place is worth it. After a long day of site seeing and shopping it was such a pleasure to be back at this little gem of a hotel. On one night my husband and I went down to the bar in the hotel which is just the right size and a group of very attractive Roman women were assembled. One of the ladies got up and started what seemed like acting out a play to her friends. As my husband and I don't speak the language we were not able to understand, but you couldn't take your eyes off of her. It turns out she was quoting Donte to her friends! One of the ladies was the owners' wife, and she was so gracious to us. The rooms are gorgeous, the staff is helpful without being in your face, and the food was fantastic!! There is so much more I can write about this hotel, all of which would be positive!! We also stayed at the sister hotel the Regency in Forence consitant with the Lord Byron, it was also a gem.", "Date": "May 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey, USA", "Title": "\u201cSophisticated and relaxing\u201d", "Author": "BrianNicholas", "ReviewID": "UR6363887", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel back in October with a friend of mine for four evenings. It exceeded our expectations in many ways. The rooms were immaculately clean and well laid out. Upon arriving we were immediately greeted by name and told we would be upgraded to a Junior suite. This was a godsend seeing as how standard rooms in major cities can be on the smaller side. The room was large enough for two people, it had a balcony overlooking the front of the property and a large, marble tiled bathroom. The front desk staff and the concierge were all very helpful in pointing out local restaurants and sights to see. Since breakfast was included in our booking, we made an effort to get downstairs each morning. There were always fresh pastries, fruits, breads, etc. and the wait staff was professional and courteous. The only caveat I have for this hotel is the location. It is on the outskirts of the city center in a suburb near Villa Borghese. It was expensive to constantly take taxis to and from the major sights and the walk is brisk, no shorter than 30 minutes, uphill and we are active twenty-somethings. Also, be sure to leave in plenty of time at the taxi queue down the street when under a time constraint.

We were very happy with the look and feel of the hotel and the service was excellent. Our room was good sized and large by Rome standards with elegant decor, a big tub and big fluffy towels. Our beds were turned down every evening with complimentary slippers placed next to the bed. We both thought the hotel bar was very cool but we were slightly disappointed with the Sapori restaurant. The service was excellent, appetizers were great, the wine and deserts were to die for but both of our entrees were a big disappointment, especially considering the prices and glowing recommendations. One other small, nit-picky item: To add to the luxury feel of our weekend we paid extra to have a private sedan pick us up and drop us off at the train station (45 euros each way vs. 10 for a cab). We were picked up in a Mercedes sedan, which we loved, but our trip back was in a minivan (we were told there were no sedans available)--it would have been better to just get a cab. This wasn't really the fault of the hotel but the hotel called this company for us and it's a small thing to be aware of if you ask for this service. This hotel is off the beaten path and definitely not central to Rome, but since we had previously done a big sight-seeing trip this was perfect for us. The hotel is a short, easy walk to most of the museums in the Borghese gardens but not much else. It's not difficult to get into central Rome, however, with the hotel's complimentary shuttle (a 5-minute ride) which drops you off a block from Via Venetto and 3-4 blocks from the Spanish Steps. Be aware, the last shuttle bus to the hotel was at 6:15pm during our stay. Cabs into town are not that expensive though. We had dinner one night near the Piazza Navona and we paid 10 Euros each way (including tip) for a cab ride. All in all it was a lovely experience and I would stay here again for a relaxing, romantic getaway.", "Date": "August 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Co.

The complimentary shuttle bus was never mentioned or offered to us throughtout our stay and the 15 minute walk to the centre must be for persons of Olympic stature, not normal persons. You start on top of one hill, travel through two valley's and over two further hills, before descending into the north end of the city centre. Walking through the Villa Borghese grounds is NOT recommended from dusk onwards. One evening at dusk it took us 50 minutes to walk round the eastern perimter of the grounds to the Spanish Steps. The internet site claims that you MAY have a city view or Villa Borghese view. Looking south west, from the front door you view the sold wall of the Belgium Embassy. Looking south east you view an apartment block. Looking north east you view beautiful old very expensive houses and north west is another block of apartments. Minor but very important inaccuracies in the hotel literature that need correcting. The look and feel of the hotel is very good, but not excellent because of the little things mentioned above.
