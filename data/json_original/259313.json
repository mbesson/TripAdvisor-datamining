We got the train, late at night from the airport and came out at the wrong end on the station and admittedly we were a bit concerned as it looked a little rough-but if we had come out the main entrance and headed straight for the hotel-the area is absolutely fine. It's in walking distance of the Forum, Colloseum, all the major attractions. There's lot of great restaurants, cafe's nearby. The staff are friendly, the breakfast has enough of a range to keep you going for the day. If you're looking for luxury, this isn't that kind of hotel-but it's a good hotel, the rooms are good sizes with spotlessly clean facilities. We loved it. Rome is fantastic and just get some comfy shoes on and walk it-if you can. On foot, you can see just about everything but if not there's plenty of buses and the underground. We walked everywhere. I would highly recommend, Pallatine Hill, the Forum, Colloseum and see Circus Maximus-where everyone walks there dogs! Buy a ticket from the Forum-and get into the Collosseum and Pallatine Hill as well-much cheaper than paying seperately and also if the Collosseum is busy you get through the line quicker. My least favourite was the Vatican-I know its a hot spot but I found the place busy and would have rather spent the day elsewhere. Obviously if you are religious it's a must see. The Pantheon is so intersting as is the area around, filled with shops and busy cafe's. If you have time, catch the train down to modern Pompei town and visit the ancient city-a spectacular must see!

We spent 3 days in Rome, staying at the Hotel San Remo. I did read the reviews however i remained open minded as people do have differing expectations of 3* hotels. I am pleased I did! The hotel was in an absolutely fantastic location for sightseeing everything in Rome. We walked everywhere and unless you have an aversion to walking, everthing is within walking distance; no need for the bus or metro. We went with our 4 year old daughter and she had no probelms either. On entering the hotel we were greeted by friendly staff and were checked in quickly. A junior member of staff helped us take our luggage to our room using the lift. Our room was basic but on a par with the many 3 star hotels we have stayed in elsewhere in the world. It was large, had plenty of storage space and the beds were comfortable and clean. The room had individually controlled heating and a TV and fridge, which was handy. The bathroom was beautifully clean and well stocked with plenty of fresh towels. Yes the water pressure wasn't fantastic and a little luke-warm in the mornings but it was fine for washing my, rather long, hair! Breakfast was a feast of everything continental and the staff nothing but kind and helpful- they wanted you to have a good breakfast! The location was considerably quiet, for the world's noisiest city! This was a perfect short stay and I could not fault the staff, the room or the hospitaility we received in the hotel San Remo, it was fantastic!

Also the hotel \"lounge\" feels more like a hospital waiting room- you wont want to spend any time there. We went to the Great Western around the corner and used their sofas and bar!

Even tho all we wanted was a clean hotel to put our heads down there are a few things that would of made our stay more comfortable. Check in was quick and easy, we were on the 5th floor so took the 1 lift the hotel had, it was a small lift which didnt feel too safe and was veruy slow at times we thought it had stopped. From then on we tended to take the stairs. The rooms were basic but had all we needed for a city hotel. There was a TV which only one English station (who cares as you dont spend anytime in the room). There was a shower over the bath but the shower curtain went around in a circle so you had no space and the curtain stuck to you which was really annoying! The water was never hot just luke warm. The walls here very think and if someone went to the toilet or had a shower in the room next to yours then you could hear everything at one stage I thought they were going to come thru in our room!!! The beds are the worse I have ever slept in, there were so narrow and so hard let when the laid down the mattress didnt give at all!!! You needed a good nights sleep after walking around seeing the wonerful sights that Rome offers. There were towels in the room and the rooms were cleaned everyday. The hotel is in a good location, so close to the Termini (metro/train main station) and was not far from the colosseum. There is a restraurant on the street corner just a stones throw from the hotel which we eat in a few times, it was clean cheap and friendly. The staff at the hotel spoke ok English was sometimes hard to explain things but I think maybe they played on it at time speically when someone complained. The hotel offered breakfast which had a small selection of ceral, cake etc. The hotel did have a small bar but we never used that and didnt ever see anyone in it. I wouldnt stay here again.

Unless you want to shower in the early hours of the morning or mid afternoon you have no chance of a shower with warm water. When I raised this with the receptionist she actually laughed yes laughed & pointed to a sign that stated, they where having a problem with the boiler.

Indeed we never had warm water the whole time unless at six in the morning. Other problems where internet was not working, I could live with that, The bed was as hard as a park bench well almost, they seem not to have enough bed clothes as we ended up with no bed spread, lights that didn\u2019t work, lack of ice for our drinks etc etc. We where not looking for a fancy hotel & we have stayed in many three star hotels & all we required was a base.

People at the hotel were friendly, but the first day we got there we had hard time with hot water, and they did nothing to get this fixed for the whole week, so we had to take a cold shower pretty much every day, save one or two medium cold ones... Other then that, the hotel is nice, with statues and Roman stylish decoration all around. The room we got had a balcony (not all do) so we could look out and see Roman live going on. Speaking of which, it starts early in the morning. They pickup garbage every day and they do it twice a day, one of which is 4 am. There seem to be noise (people are loud) all over the night so if you go in the summer, opening a window might not be a good ide. I am not complaining about the noise myself, I loved it, seemed to me that Felini's Roma, had to be like this. I also liked the way the hotel was located. The hotel offers a buffet every morning but it's a light one, so don't expect a big american style breakfast. There was only one computer and no Internet in the room, so sending an email did not materialized for me, since there was allways someone at the computer.

AVOID!!!\u201d", "Author": "clkaylor", "ReviewID": "UR106654458", "Content": "After booking through \"The luxury Italian holiday specialists\" Citalia we had good expectations of this place. My advice, ignore the pictures of the lovely reception room and the three star rating. The place was an absolute hovel and the staff were disgraceful. An absolute rip off! Location: Hotel is in a central location near Termini station but a little hard to find as it's on a small side street. Reception: When we arrived, we couldn't find it so called to ask for directions. The man who answered wouldn't speak to my boyfriend, just said the street name and slammed the phone down. I called and he was really nice, clearly he is only interested in speaking to females! Upon arrival the lady on reception tried to keep our passports, very dodgy! We left them with her to photocopy them and went to get them back later that evening but we had a job getting her to part with them! When walking in and out of the hotel, reception staff do not even acknowlege you. The maids were more polite and seemed to be doing their best, it's not their fault the place is so disgusting! Room: We were given a key and pointed up the stairs. Got to the room to find the door was held on with duct tape, not a joke, literally, held on with duct tape! There was a big gap at the bottom and we couldn't lock so we had no privacy whatsoever. We overlooked this in the hope the inside would be nice, like in the photos... No chance! Skirting boards had come off and were left propped up against the wall, Wooden floor was bumpy where there must have previously been a flood in the bathroom, we were given single beds despite booking a double room, no proper duvets, just sheets and tatty old brown fleece blankets. Bathroom: The lock on the bathroom door had been removed and the hole where it once was had been filled with toilet roll. There was a shower but the attachment to hold it on the wall had been broken off making it impossible to wash your hair without help (thankfully I was with my partner) Grouting had turned brown, everything was old and a bit manky to be frank! How the staff dealt with the issues: We went to reception and asked for another room and were told no rooms were available. We asked for someone to fix what they could while we were out, we were told the caretaker had gone home for the day. We asked for the bed to be made up as a double and were told the maids had also left... I then asked for some sheets so i could change them myself and was told they didn't have access to the laundry!! The staff didn't seem to think all of this was an issue! We pointed out that we shouldn't even be in that room as we'd booked a double, to which a man replied \"Well normally Japanese couples request separate beds, even when they're on honeymoon!\" A totally random and irrelevant comment seeing as how neither me or my partner are Japanese! No apology was given, only after ALOT of arguing did they say they'd try and get us another room the next day. All in all we paid \u00a374 a night for this poor experience, our 4 nights there was a huge waste of money! The room we were eventually given was clean enough and at least wan't falling apart I suppose. It was on the top floor so I think one of their \"Superior\" rooms but still didn't warrant a 3 star rating. The lights in the head board flickered all night making it hard to sleep and the doors weren't at all sound proof. Rome itself is a nice place, but it seems to be common practise in restaurants to treat customers based on presumed wealth. Expect to be treated as a second class citizen if you are under the age of 25 and don't have children. As a young couple, we were pretty much ignored by waiters, at the restaurant on the corner opposite the Termini we waited an hour for two soups whereas older couples and families were served within minutes.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe San Remo-lovely\u201d", "Author": "Chrisrob903", "ReviewID": "UR103677772", "Content": "What a lovely stay we had for 5 days.

The area around the hotel was okay, some reviews say that people were worried at night but I have to say we did not get that feeling.

DO NOT go to the McDonalds, they are majorly overpriced, it worked out with exchange rate that you would end up paying \u00a38 for a big mac on its own.... we travelled on 13th - 17th march 2010, we were prepared for showers, but upon arrival we were met with nothing but sun and only needed light cardigans for the night as it did get chilly but nothing they could not handle. overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone onshort break to city, as its location is perfectly situated for sight seeing and also getting away from hussle and bussle of city life.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "suffolk uk", "Title": "\u201cBudget Hotel near station good base for sightseeing\u201d", "Author": "smartesthorse", "ReviewID": "UR67968421", "Content": "The hotel is within easy walking distance of the TERMINII station which is for trains and buses.

Jet2 fligh into T3 in rome and it is dead easy to get the Leonardo express train that runs every 1/2 hour to the main train station- Termini.

The breakfast was adequate and kept us gonig till tea time ( with the exception of an occassional ice cream or cake!). A good tip when eating out i to ask for the drinks price list, many places just show the food list, but charge a small fortune for drinks, some places charge 9.50 euro for a large beer!! We found a great little place called\" Nuova-Stella\" onVia Manin, 54-58, fresh home cooked meals for around 8euro per person, but more importantly, the house wine was 10 euro per bottle- that's cheap. Franko was the main guy- very friendly. The sites: well worth getting a guide for each area you go to, we had guides for the Colosseum, forum and Palatne Hill. the guides bring the Roman times back to life and are well worth the money- around 20 euro- seniors are free. The Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Trevi fountain and the Spanish Steps are all close together to walk between. Note that the Vaticanmuseums are closed on public and religious holidays- as we found out going on Palm Sunday!! Overall we had a great city break- oh, also, not many public toilets in Rome, go in your hotel and in the cafe's or resteraunts you visit!!

We got to many of the cities best site from here, and you can buy a train ticket for 1 euro, which last for 75 mins, and enable you to travel anywhere in Rome for that duration. It is also located about 10 mins walk away from the Colleseum, whci is spectactular, but not worth goin inside of it, just to observe from the outside. The nigth life is great in Rome, it is dotted full of uni bars, with very loud American students inhabiting them, which is always a source of entertainment! I especially recomend Scholars. the breakfast at the hotel is ok at best in all honesty, most days we dined round the corner for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rome is quite expensive for eating out, but its the best meal you would ever eat..i assure you!! The staff at the San remo are very helpful and speak very good Englidh and can help you with regards to tours etc. the maids always keep the rooms clean and tidy.

We were shown to our room, which turned out to be quite small and sparse, two single beds, a plastic chair, a flat screen tv which it was impossible to get a decent picture from any channel on. the bathroom had a toilet, sink, shower and a bidet, the walls above the shower had mould on them and the ceiling was flaking. The bathroom apart from that was clean, the was no evidence of cracked tiles as previously reported, the towels and flannels were clean and fresh, the toilet flush left something to be desired, and the taps were a bit old fashioned. Overall the room was clean, but very small, one thing we realised after the the first night the heating/air-con had a mind of its own, and we ended up throwing nearly all the covers off, this was remedied by the next night having the window wide open, in January!!!!. In the morning got up for breakfast, continental style again adequate but not cordon bleu, something which I will mention later the Italians cannot seem to make decent coffee, so we settled for the hot chocolate, incidentally all drinks came out of a machine, so work it out for yourselves. The bar was a bit of a shambles certainly not the place you would want to spend an evening, plus cokes at 4 Euros each seemed a bit pricey. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful and spoke good English. The hotel was very well situated to enable the tourist to take full advantage of sightseeing in Rome about 300 metres from the main railway terminal and virtually the same from the tour buses starting point. Rome itself has loads going for it we were only there for 3 days and one of those was taken up with a trip to Anzio to visit a relatives war grave, incidentely the cost by rail to travel to Anzio a one hour train journey was 3.20 Euros no this was not a mistake 3.20 per person each way, the trains were clean inside with plenty of seats double deckers, and always on time, the staff at the railway terminal very helpful and probably used to dealing with idiot tourists who not speak Italian, whilst on the subject of the railway they are the best way to get from the airport to the centre of Rome at 11 Euros per person, dont get bullied at the airport by shuttle bus drivers telling you they can do it cheaper and better, they cant! As mentioned earlier the best way to see the sites of Rome is by open top tourist bus, the one I recommend is \" Rome Cristinana\" at 16 euros for 24 hrs on/off also they have fold away roofs when it rains (which it did most of the we were there), you will also be assailed by brolly salesmen, who seem to be every third person you come across with prices ranging from 3 euros to 10 depending how hard it rains. Rome sites: do not miss St Peters Basillica, absolutely unbelieveable, we did not have time to queue to see the Cistine Chapel unfortunatley, we were a little dissapointed with the Colosseum, as we had previously see the one in Tunsia which is bigger and more complete, (where they filmed Gladiator) and it cost 12 Euros each to go around it, but all you can do walk around the walls on two levels. We also did the Trevi Fountains and Spanish Steps, mind you it is a bit off putting to see Roman Soldiers standing around using mobiles and smoking while in designer track suit bottoms. Take a walk down the Via Nationale towards the Colosseum and you will pass the forums very interesting. Beware of crossing roads a zebra crossing is not a safety zone once you are off the pavement you become a legitamate target , the Roman motorists treat tourists as big game, not funny. If you like coffee as I do you will disappointed in Rome apart from being expensive, the taste ranges from mud to bottled water. One place we ate at was the \"Hard Rock Cafe\" the food was good and resonable, and not too noisy, with good staff, we also did the usual Pasta and PIzza, nothing special but then perhaps we went to wrong places, we tried to choose the ones that had a lot people in them. Overall I enjoyed my short break in Rome, would I go back? I would not rush back and if I did I would research my hotels better and go in better weather, mind you saying that the queues would be longer for the attractions.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham", "Title": "\u201cTrouble!\u201d", "Author": "myviewonyou", "ReviewID": "UR52563396", "Content": "It looks like there are some complains involving money.

The hotel is basic but very clean, take into consideration how little time you do actually spend there! We used the hotel for sleeping at night and that was it. Location was excellent, literally a couple minutes walk from the main Termini station which the centre for all public transport in Rome. You can get a train from and to the airport costing 11 euros each way, you can also purchase travel tickets which are 1 euro for one trip or 4 euros for a whole day, this applies to the metro and buses which we thought was great value. That said, you can do most of Rome by foot, the hotel is within walking distance of all the main sites; we just used the metro towards the end of our trip when our feet were aching too much!! So back to the hotel.... We found the staff to be very courteous and friendly, particuarly the reception staff, who always looked up, smiled and said hello as we passed, and were always happy to answer any questions we had about the city or the hotel itself. Rooms were fine, cleaned everyday, our only complaint was the two twin beds pushed together to form a double, though you get this most places. When we arrived we discovered the fitting that fixed the shower head to the wall was broken, we mentioned this to the girl on reception when we were going out, and when we came back it had been fixed. We thought the breakfast was perfectly acceptable, just your standard continental breakfast with croissants, rolls, toast, biscuits, fruit, cereals, eggs, cold meats, cheese, coffee, tea and juices. I don't understand why so many people have complained about this?! There are plenty of restaurants and cafes surrounding the hotel, which offer lovely food at reasonable prices. You will pay more if you choose to eat near the sites as you pay for the view, therefore eat in some of the smaller restaurants off the beaten track- they're half the price!

Firstly we thought the hotel looked ok from the front and in the reception area, and the female receptionist that checked us in was friendly and helpfull. The lift was tiny for the size of the hotel and very slow, it was actually quicker for us to walk the 10 flights of stairs to our room ok the 5th floor. Our room was of a an average size and quite clean apart from the dodgy air conditioning unit above the door and the absolutely disgusting shower head. We would advise anybody that is thinking of stopping here not to leave any lose change in your room, as regardless of wether you want it or not the house keeping staff will take it. We had left money on the table for drinks we had taken from the mini bar, as a reminder for us to pay for them on check out which it stated on the price list, after a nice day out we returned to find the room had been cleaned but also that the money had been taken!! We checked with reception if housekeeping had handed the money in to cover the mini bar bill and they informed us they hadn't. Our biggest complaint however is the fact that we could of missed our flight home due to the incompetence and bare faced lies from a male member of reception staff. We experienced problems trying to reconfirm our airport transfer for our return flight, so we asked the man at reception if he could help us. He tried ringing the number while we were there but no one was answering so he told us to leave it with him and he would sort it out and confirm our transfer. After a lovely day sight seeing when given our room key we were handed our paper work and told that our pick up had been confirmed for the next day at 4pm. The following day 4pm came and went, no airport transfer turned up we had to phone the uk emergency number to see what was going on.

One to be avoided!\u201d", "Author": "bellissimomare", "ReviewID": "UR38475917", "Content": "Let's begin with the positives! Hotel San Remo is located around 400 meters from Termini Station, and is a 5 minute walk from Via Nazionale, the main thoroughfare when travelling on foot in the direction of the Vatican and other major attractions. The staff were mainly very pleasant and polite, especially one young lady on reception who took every chance she could to practice her English language skills on myself and my partner! The entrance lobby (inside) is very clean and quite elegant, and the breakfast served was adequate. Internet access is available free of charge upon request of a required token, and buys you around an hour of usage. Our room was on the 4th floor, and may as well have been on the roof for all the use it was. Initially very clean, our 4 days spent there were replete with reminders by ourselves to reception to ask housekeeping to actually come along and clean, something which just wasn't happening! On the 3rd time of asking, we just gave up and begun taking towels and soaps from the openly available/discarded housekeeping cart on our floor and tidied as we went along. Our room was also decorated with a toilet that can only be described as someone's science project, and which must have wakened the dead when flushed during the night. The sound resembled a freight train passing through, and was unmatched for volume except for a collection of garrulous bimbos whose constant nighttime chatter emanated from a nearby room. A 30 minute refill for the cistern heightened the experience and made sure we remained bright and alert during the night. Tastefully crumbling plasterwork and bonding around the shower, accentuated by a rusting shower-head and broken floor tiles completed the look of the room. The previous guest's body hair smeared along the shower tiling were an especially welcome and thoughtful addition. We also appeared to have been placed where there was a minimum of soundproofing available. Staying in room 409, we could actually enjoy the late night conversations of those airhead bimbos staying 3 rooms along. Constantly engaged in mindless babble about Yoorp (we took that to mean Europe), guys, moms, dads, and \"like our totally miserable allowance. I mean, duh!\"; and extolling the virtues of some \"condo in Malibu\", they must have been using their room hairdryer to stay warm at night, as it remained on so long. Either that, or it was Rapunzel and her North American airhead sisters staying in that room. Chapping their door drew silence, which was something the staff had stated they would do, and never ever did. My only wish was that Dr Lecter might be placed next door to them, and I wouldn't have had to silence them on each never-ending night of our hideous stay. Alarmingly, there was a real problem with homeless persons living rough in the vicinity of the hotel. I was really shocked to find 4 of them living in archways either immediately next to the hotel entrance doorway, or right across the street. These poor people had absolutely nothing of their own, and both myself and partner found ourselves switching immediately to our professional heads and either talking with them or taking one of them for some food. It was heartbreaking to behold and worrying that in a city of such profound wealth, there is such untold misery so commonplace. Where this relates to Hotel San Remo, is that the hotel appears to be used as a urinal by some of the homeless persons, and perhaps late night revellers we hadn't seen after dark; but nonetheless it is the responsibility of the staff to get out and clean their own doorstep. It absolutely stinks and was completely offensive. In fact, Rome was generally very badly smelly and it's a problem we discovered in Florence too. Urinating in public must have become something of a passtime for Romans and Florentines of late. To sum up, I'd choose this hotel if I truly had nowhere else to go. Appearing initially stylish, you'll quickly learn that despite the best efforts of the reception staff, this tatty hovel holds the appeal of a paper cut and the style of a bread van. It's the ultimate in sham chic. Mutton dressed as, well, mutton. Sleep there if you can bear the noise of the many idiots this place seems to attract, and get the heck out of there at first light and don't return until you're so exhausted you won't care if there's a herd of birthing camels in the next room.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "indiana", "Title": "\u201cLoved Rome .... and Hotel as well...\u201d", "Author": "amkrn67", "ReviewID": "UR38099741", "Content": "Very centrally located .

There is nice a granite staircase with Roman statues, plus a tiny elevator. The rooms are small as one expects in Europe, and have been recently renovated. The floors are wood grain (probably laminate) and the walls are neatly painted. The bathrooms are tiled on the walls and floor, with modern fixtures. The shower is tiny but useable with plenty of hot water. The single bed is comfortable and the linens crisp and clean. There is a small desk and chair, a place to open a suitcase, a closet, and a full wall mirror over the bed. The windows are new aluminum framed with double glass to isolate the noise, and could be fully opened to get some ventilation. There is an air conditioning unit in the ceiling, but as far as I could tell had not been turned on yet (April-May). I had a room that faced into the open central area, so there was absolutely no traffic noise. I could hear other people talking in their rooms through the open window, but it was extremely quiet. Wireless internet is 20 euros per day. Staff was very friendly. I received a friendly Buon Giorno from everyone, almost like on a cruise ship. The front desk helped me with opera tickets. On my last day after checkout, after the breakfast was closed, I asked if I could get a coffee. The desk clerk brought me into the breakfast room, and I was given a coffee and two croissants. The location is about 3 minutes from Stazione Termini, Rome\u2019s central train station, which is why I chose the hotel. This central location gets you easily to the parts of Rome that you want to see. There is a direct train from the airport and to other cities, and a metro station on lines A and B. The station has cafeterias, ATM\u2019s, and a number of stores. You are a few blocks from the opera house, and a few kilometres from central Rome. I used the hop-on/hop-off bus to get around for a few days, starting at Termini. The metro is easy to use, either 1 euro per trip or 4 euros per day. The area is in a state of change, with upscale hotels and restaurants, and a few slightly shady areas. There were a couple of street people opposite the hotel. During the day there are plenty of business people walking around, but at night one should be a bit careful. It is better to follow Via Cavour south for two blocks from Termini, then take Via Principe Amedeo one block west; the hotel will be around the corner on your left. At night, the plaza in front of Termini is full of young people, but I don\u2019t think they were interested in hassling tourists. The hotel offered the usual continental breakfast, with meats, cheese, yoghurt and breads. And a coffee maker that produced acceptable caffe latte. I liked the hotel so much that I stayed there on my return trip from Naples. My second room was very much like my first, and I had a great sleep. The only thing missing is a safe in the room; you could get a small locker in the luggage storage room, but I did not feel safe leaving my passport there. I paid CAD$146 per night (USD$124, 92 euros) prepaid on Expedia.ca. On my return, I paid 65 euros for one night, so I guess I overpaid on Expedia.

We arrived at the rail terminal and found it to be a 5 minute walk from there. The train service from the airport runs every 30 minutes and is 11 euros each week. One tip do not forget to validate your ticket in the yellow machines on the platform. Do this before you board the train as you are only allowed 90 minutes from validating the ticket to being timed out. It is within 30 minutes walk of the Forum, Colosseum, Trevi Fountain & Spanish Steps. We had a room on the 6th floor. The lift is very small and only allows 3 persons. Our room was spacious (room 611) and cleaned each day along with a change of towels. The only negative point was the 2 showers were very poor. They shower heads need a good clean. It took about 5 minutes to get the hot water through but once there it was ok. Breakfast choice was more than reasonable and plentiful. At times the breakfast area was over-subscribed and no-one was allowed to sit in the bar area. It would make sense for the hotel management to extend the breakfast area during busy periods. The staff were pleasant and helpful. There are city maps on the desk and other local information leaflets. Our friends did have to wait to have their hairdryer replaced.

The cereal was not good. The staff were very helpful and friendly, and when we asked for a room change they did offer one, but it would of had to of happened at around 11 am.

Well, what can we say? It was a superb holiday and the 'San Remo' definately enhanced our experience of 'Bella Roma'! Even though we arrived an hour early for check in (1 pm) we were able to sort out a safety deposit box and could leave our cases in a secure room so we could start enjoying Rome that little bit quicker! As we're sure you know from previous reviews, the hotel is in an excellent location ( 5 mins from Termini station, 15 mins from Colosseum). Yes, the hotel isn't in the 'nicest' area of Rome but as long as you have an ounce of common sense you'll be fine! Back to the hotel - On the ground floor is a plush reception area, bar, and breakfast room. The safety deposit boxes are also located on this floor. If you're anything like us you might find it a wee bit strange that it's not in your room. Don't worry, the room is opposite the reception desk and there is always a receptionist on. Contrary to some comments the lift was fine, it wasn't hanging on by a thread of cable or anything like that. And we were very glad of it as we were staying on the 3rd floor ( just think of the poor souls on the 6th!) Our room was warm, spacious and clean, what else do you want from a bedroom? The beds might be a little on the hard side but after a full day of sight seeing who cares? The fridge was a mini blessing and well stocked with drinks, though we bought our own from a gorgeus little shop 2 doors away from the hotel. There is a T.V. in the room but I don't think we even had time to switch it on once! The bathroom was another thing we were really not looking forward to, but it was lovely. The shower was hot and quite powerful, the hair dryer was adequate and the towels (we had to mention the towels) resembled cotton sheets but were surprisingly absorbant.

The normal room rate through Orbitz for mid-January (Jan. 8-13) for that room was $70.87. With the Orbitz deal, though, I got the 5 nights for a total out-of-pocket of $203.57, or just under $41 a night. It proved to be an EXCELLENT deal. The room was smallish and fit an odd corner space, with an anteroom (more like a hall) having the closet and desk and the private bathroom in a similar odd space. As had been reported, the shower stalls were quite small (maybe only a square yard), probably due to retrofitting. Even though it was my first trip to Italy, I've stayed in plenty of under-$50 budget places in the Benelux countries and as far afield as Hong Kong, and from that perspective this place was very clean, well kept up and relatively spacious. The view from my window wasn't much, but I think it's still quieter and better to face the back rather than the street. TV was small, but they did have the Italian broadcast channels, CNN International and a few satellite channels. Location was excellent, about 3 blocks from Termini station. It's easy to walk over to catch buses, the Metro or intercity trains. The 40 Express or 64 buses were readily available to get to the Vatican or many places intown, the 175 to the Trevi Fountain, or the Metro to Colosseo station for the Coliseum/Palatine Hill. Desk staff was very helpful. The breakfast room was big enough to not overflow to the TV lounge, but space may be a problem if the hotel is totally full and everyone wants to eat at once, rather than spread out across the 7-10 a.m. breakfast hours. The included buffet breakfast was pretty good, neither frugal nor extravagant. Croissants with ham, cheese and salami and washed down with yogurt and tea helped start the day right. I had read the reviews before going and must say I'd have to see the glass as more than half full. Would even recommend at the $70 rate without the (long expired) Orbitz special deal. Of course, it was low season, so if you go in summer I'm sure the rates all around will be quite a bit more, and I think that had to be a major factor in some of the bad reviews. I was also very pleased with Rome in January. It wasn't that cold and the main weather problem was rain about half the time. But the big crowds causing long waits that the guidebooks had warned about were pleasantly absent, which made going to the Coliseum, Sistine Chapel and any of the museums much more enjoyable.

To be honest, it doesn't really try to and that was just fine with me. Located a few minutes walk from the Termini station, the Hotel is far enough away to offer a quiet nights sleep and the road felt nice and safe. The Termini area itself is not really the best example of Rome, and the bus station is a bit of a dump (broken ticket machines, tramps etc). It\u2019s quite a walk to the main attractions of Rome but the buses are frequent and cheap although they get very crowded. There are some good restaurants around the hotel with much better prices than those near the main attractions. Our room was nice and clean and the bed was very comfy. We really only used it as a place to sleep so was not after any great luxury. There was a TV that had a Sky box so we could watch BBC World. Bathroom ok but a bit tatty but again I wasn't fussed. No fluffy towels etc and instead some weird thin things but they did the trick. The biggest problem with the Hotel is the lack of hot water. One morning nothing came out of the hot tap at all although I tried 1/2 hour later and it was fine. I'm not a person who gets annoyed by this sort of thing but if you are then be warned! Breakfast was ok but could have done without the many Germans reserving all the seats for their families that hadn't got out of their rooms yet. This is something you have to live with wherever you go! Hotel staff very nice (one guy hilarious!). The stairway etc could have done with a lick of paint but was still clean. Would I stay again?

We were in Room 210. After having a little trouble trying to open the door (you need to pull the door and turn the key anticlockwise.) we got in and the room was big. It had its own little room. So our friend slept in the mini room, and me and my other friend slept in the bigger bit. Had a tv, and a spacious fridge (minibar) which is useful for those of you who want water.

The beds were a little bit rigid but you honestly do not want really squidgy beds in such heat. The cleaners were amazing!

I would recommend that you collect a safety deposit key at this point...the safes are in the luggage room not in the bedrooms. We locked all our passports etc away, thank goodness, because later during our stay I had my purse taken in St. Peter's Basillica, of all places!!! Still, it didn't spoil our stay. Our room,on the top floor, was a large one with a double bed and a little side room with a single bed and a wardrobe. I had to ask the staff for extra hangers as there were only 4 in there originally and the extras arrived swiftly. The spotlessly clean bathroom was up a couple of steps so take care if you have to visit it in the middle of the night!! The towels were thin linen and I found they dried me perfectly, better than some fluffy towels. Our room faced out on to the back of the building, so there was no view, but we weren't in Rome to gaze out of the window. The mini bar was useful but we didn't buy anything from it, just used it to cool our own drinks. We didn't have any problems at all with the lift. Breakfasts in the hotel were a little basic but adequate. The dining room was fairly small but we always managed to find a table. Best part of the breakfast was the pot of fresfly brewed coffee, brought to you by the 2 waiters, if you could catch their eyes! Location of the hotel was excellent...not only close to the Termini station but also to the rather limited but cheap Metro system. To be honest, if you are fairly hale and hearty and don't mind walking, Rome is best seen on foot. You can take frequent stops to enjoy a cup of coffee, an ice cream or whatever takes your fancy. Just make sure you have a comfy pair of shoes...the pavements etc are very uneven. Some surfaces, of course, were from ancient times! Some other tips for Rome...? Patience is required. Long queues at the Vatican Museum and the Colosseum but worth the wait. Avoid the 'organised groups'...buy a good guide book. You need to like your fellow man! All major sights thronging with people..even in February. Friendly waiters in several restaurants close to the hotel...practise your Italian on them! Keep vigilant..there are pickpockets everywhere. Buy a good map...signposts are a rarity. Eat a delicious Tartufo ice cream in the Tre Scalini in the Piazza Novona. A pizza at lunchtime in any restaurant will set you up for the rest of the day. Use the loos when you stop at a bar or cafe...you won't find them anywhere else. Soak up the history of Ancient Rome in the Forum, Colosseum and the Pantheon. Truly spectacular monuments. Be amazed at the Sistine Chapel ceiling and be stunned into silence by the 'shhhshing' guards. Check in your guide book and try to visit some of the lesser known areas.

After reading so many reviews on this hotel i thought we should let you know a little more! We found San Remo on a great little site called Citalia-recommended by a friend - right from the start they were proffessional and helpful, very reasonably priced too! Our trip included transfers wich i would recommend as when we arrived at the Airport the disorderly lines to catch coaches/buses into the city was scarey , we were met by a very handsome devil who escorted us to our Mercedes - very stylish we felt like royalty. We later found out that Mercedes are widely used in Rome as Taxis anyway , but what a nice touch! We arrived a little early for check in and we did have to wait 1 hour before going to our room, this gave us a chance to go and explore a little and have a beer. One thing we did find over the 4 days stayed is that if you like a beer its very expensive, we paid 28 euros in one place for 4 beers! and thats their measure not ours- we found a very good Irish Bar that was fun as the Rugby was on and it was St Patrics day, so was full of friendly fans, you can find this if you turn left out of hotel - left again then right . San Remo is just around the corner from the Terminal wich is a little seedy and their are lots of umbarella sellers -great if its raining we did buy one at 5Euros and it broke the next day- ha ha - also many rough sleepers in this area. Ok -we thought after reading so many reviews that all the major sites would be miles away so before we left we had already decided to catch one of the many Tour Buses - DONT - everything was easier to get to than we first thought - Collesium im not joking we stumbled upon whilst looking for somewhere to eat, 15 mins walk away from hotel and breath taking!!! Trevi Fountain-Spanish Steps my favourite a little further away about 30 mins - but the walks around the city are just breath taking so dont miss anything by taking trains/subways - except for the Vatican, we took the number 64 bus wich cost 4 euros each it took about 25 mins and was worth it as if walking we would never have found it , you have to put your ticket into a very aggressive machine once on the bus - so watch your fingers, the Vatican was very striking i had to tell my other half to shut his gaping mouth several times but it is a remarkable place to see and it will take around 4-5 hours just to see some not all - to do this you would need a few days,its huge!- if you go by bus you will need to buy your tickets from the Terminal Stands - If your into visiting the Hard Rock Cafe - go for it - its in the Quirinalle District on the way to Trevi - what a cool place - there are also many plazzas and squares on the way to everywhere where you can take a break and sit on one of the many water fountains chill out out or eat in the many many resturants - we did not have one bad meal whilst in Rome- so as you can see we had a great time -saw everything very easily and want to go back already , i would reccomend San Remo Hotel to anyone who wants to be in a central location - we stayed on the 5th floor room 509, the room was basic with new laminate flooring and they were cleaned daily, our room was at the back with no view but hey - it was quite after great days out, staff are friendly, nothing wrong with the Lifts ! yeah the Towels are thin but when in Rome and all that !!!!for a 3* hotel in a great location GO GO GO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rural Nova Scotia", "Title": "\u201cConvenient hotel\u201d", "Author": "Soulee", "ReviewID": "UR6825106", "Content": "My 16 year old son and I (single mom) stayed at the San Remo Hotel from August 12 to 16, 2006 in a nice double-room with a balcony overlooking the street.

There was a faint cigarette smell in one room, but an open window took care of that quickly. The baths were also clean, but the tubs were not in great shape and the bathrooms could use an update. The hairdryers needed replacing. The triple room was nicer than the doubles. It contained a small room with a twin bed, a larger room with two twins and a much larger bath than the double rooms contained.

For a budget accommodation this hotel was fine.", "Date": "January 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, England", "Title": "\u201c++ Pleasant Hotel ++\u201d", "Author": "SanRemoSurvivor", "ReviewID": "UR6025568", "Content": "We arrived at the San Remo on the 23rd Oct 2006 and stayed 2 nights leaving early on the 25th. We found that the hotel was a pleasant and friendly hotel in a quiet area (compared to the rest of Rome) with some good restaurants near by. It was somewhere which made a good base to come back to to rest our tired feet after a long day of walking and touring the many fabulous sites of Rome. All of the hotel staff spoke reasonable English and had no problems in understanding what we were saying to them. We got a nice double bed room on the 4th floor (room 401) which from a small balcony overlooked the front street. The room was basic but had everything you would want and was clean and in a good condition. (cleaned every morning by cleaners who always gave a cheery hello). Another benefit was that the room was air conditioned which made a nice change to the hot weather outside. The only downside was that the shower had very little power and was more of a dribble than a spray, but it got you cleaned. Oh and if you like to dry your hair with a hairdryer I would recommend you bring your own... However apart from this the room was totally adequate and we were very happy with it. (don't worry about the dreaded towels you may have been reading about, they were fine). Finally breakfast, very continental will sum it up well. The grub included pastries, cakes, bread, jam, chocolate spread, yogurt, fruit salad, cheese, ham, fruit juices, tea and coffee and one tub of cornflakes. (how do you like that for specific)? There are a few bad reviews for the San Remo on this site but have no fear, they were either written along time ago or they were looking for bad things to say (in my opinion). Yeah, the lift was a bit slow and shuddery and you feared for your life everytime you went in it, but it got you there and I'm still alive and yes the towels were slightly thin, but they dried you perfectly. Everyone has their own opinions I suppose. I personally enjoyed my trip to Rome very much and the hotel was not a worry at all, I would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a nicely priced, adequate 3 star hotel. Hope you enjoy your holiday to Rome and that this review has been of some use and reassurance to you.
