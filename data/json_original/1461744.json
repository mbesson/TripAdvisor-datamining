It's a 15 minute walk to the main sites, but I wouldn't choose this area again - it's teeming with low-quality clothes retailers who continually pester every foreign-looking passerby. The hotel seemed clean, which is obviously a good thing, but that's not enough to merit a four-star rating. By EU standards this would be a 2-3 star - for example, I stayed at a 2-star Ibis in France that was much nicer. The Wi-Fi didn't work, which was enormously inconvenient, and meant I had to go out hunting for Wi-Fi elsewhere. On checking in, I was required to pay for all four nights up-front - this is an unusual requirement, and sends a very bad signal to the guest. The room was very small and a bit gloomy. The window opened on a quiet, narrow street, but with no view to speak of. The staff were actually fine, and one of them spoke good English. There's a five-star review below that seems to me to have been written by a non-neutral party. I can't prove that, but it seems fairly clear. That should be enough to send alarm bells ringing.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brokind", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location with healthy breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Christer L", "ReviewID": "UR122658292", "Content": "This hotel has an excellent location and is very good value considering the rate.

I.e. no bacon or greasy sausages but lots of fresh vegetables and such.

The hotel is located on a relatively quiet street with rooms overlooking the street as well as an interior patio. The rooms in the hotel are spacious, extremely well appointed the beds are super comfy and a huge rating for cleanliness. The breakfast was excellent great service and enjoyed the relaxing roof top overlooking the great view. What I found incredibly charming about the hotel was its lovely space for dining as well as comfortable sofas to hang out. The Hotel is located in the heart of Sultanahmet area and just a few minutes from all major attractions. What makes Samir Hotel truly special is the warmth and friendliness of the staff and the very high level of service. The staff was delightful and thoughtful in trying to respond to all our requests. A special thanks to Kadir he is an absolute gem he is very welcoming, very helpful and goes out of his way to ensure that the hotel guests have a good stay. I am definitely planning to stay at Samir Hotel during my next visit to Istanbul and highly recommend it to all.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Samir Hotel-Old City Istanbul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1461744-Reviews-Samir_Hotel_Old_City_Istanbul-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$74 - $310*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Buyu Resitpasa Caddesi Ahmet Suayip Sokak</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">No: 22 Sehzadebasi</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34470</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1461744", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8c/ae/4e/instanbul-samir-hotel.jpg"}}
