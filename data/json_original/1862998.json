It is a small and nice hotel. Room we were staying in is really petite- small but cosy. I got stomach poisoning the last day of our stay and had to lie down because of high fewer and cramps and the stuff was super nice to let me stay in the room -no extra charge -for the whole day although we have already checked out. Nice breakfast at the small but nice terrace every day. All in all - good pick. Istanbul is really expensive these days- much higher prices than 5 years ago when I first came to the city, so I would say that stay in the hotel wasn't really price for worth but the stuff compensates for all!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201ccannot recommend this hotel highly enough.\u201d", "Author": "hallowman m", "ReviewID": "UR127693682", "Content": "This was our first visit to Istanbul, we had seen Serenity Hotel online and booked it direct meaning we got a free airport transfer, which was fantastic! The hotel is just lovely, staff so helpful, Esat on Reception was brilliant, so friendly and helpful, he helped make our holiday! The hotel itself is fantastic, we were lucky enough to stay in the penthouse, the views over the Bosphorous were amazing. The roof terrace in the warmer weather would be just perfect, I need to visit again in the summer! We loved Istanbul, such an amazing historical city, can't wait to visit again, 4 days wasn't long enough, will definitely be visiting Serenity Hotel again too, cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salamanca, Castilla y Leon, Spain", "Title": "\u201cShort stopover in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "CDMalano", "ReviewID": "UR126637035", "Content": "After extending a simple stopover in Istanbul into a two-night stay, I needed to find a place to stay without having any access to internet to do research. A friend recommended Serenity to me, and now after staying there, I would have no reservations doing the same in recommending it to others. The staff were very friendly, always helpful, and I always felt welcomed with each return from an excusion, etc. The hotel is located only several minutes from the Blue Mosque, in other words, very close to all the attractions, but in a calm corner of the neighbourhood. The beds were comfortable and the toilets are clean, which are a very important aspect for me.

My first impression when I arrived at night to this hotel was rather negative. It is very very small, only 14 rooms, in a rather dark small street. I got more comfortable when I found that the rooms are rather comfortable, reasonably sized, and everything was quite new. In the daylight, I got my bearings and found the hotel to be less than 5 minutes walk from the Blue Mosque and a short walk to all the other main Istanbul tourist ites: Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, and Grand Bazaar. You can skip taking a city tour, just stay at this hotel and walk to the sights yourself. It is also a close walk to restaurants and small groceries. The fact that hotel was on a small side street turned out to be an advantage and you don't get some of the road and street noise of those hotels on the main street. I also got great travel advice from Yasin Yesil, he was the door man, bell hop, concierge, Mr. Everything of the hotel. The first room on my first stay was on the second floor and had a street view. The second room was on the third floor and was larger and a roof top view of the Bosphorus. On the basis of the second room, I am giving this hotel 4 stars. Couple of hints if you stay at the hotel. First, bring the hotel business card with you. It will help tell your taxi driver how to get to your hotel. Because the hotel is so small, most people don't know where it is. Second, either bring a bar of soap or buy it from the store close by. The hotel gives out free slippers but does not seem to give out soap. A small complaint on my part. This is not a luxury hotel but it is a good bargain hotel with a unbeatable location.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Serenity Hotel Istanbul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1862998-Reviews-Serenity_Hotel_Istanbul-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$71 - $110*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kucukayasofya mahallesi Kasaposman sokak no 27</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Sultanahmet</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34122</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1862998", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/a1/8f/da/serenity-hotel-istanbul.jpg"}}
