The hotel has been tailored into a late-Victorian/Arts and Crafts mansion which offers privacy, casual comfort and a personal rapport with the owners and management. Simpson's is not the place for those who like the often grand but formulaic five star chain hotels in the CBD. It is a good (and very pleasant) 15 to 20 minute walk from the city centre or five minutes from the rail network if walking doesn't appeal. The rooms are not five star and don't purport to be but they are spacious and well appointed in a \"lived-in\" fashion. Breakfast is served in an airy atrium room and provides a good range of cereals, fruit, cold selections, breads, juices, tea and coffee. Some may decry a lack of hot options but the choice is ample, constantly refreshed and attractively presented. As a base for accessing the harbour foreshores and parklands or for running or walking through some of the most appealing parts of the city, Simpson's is in an ideal location. It is also close to some of the city's liveliest cafes, restaurants and bars and a short taxi ride to delightful Paddington, bustling Surry Hills and the Eastern Suburbs beaches. For the unashamedly self indulgent there is a particularly well stocked delicatessen and specialty wine shop only 150 metres away. This hotel is an intimate and casual alternative for guests who wish to experience Sydney rather than simply pass through it and staying there feels like being at a friend's house.

After a long and careful research we \"felt\" that Simpsons of Potts Point is the place we would like to spend our 16 days of adventure. Now, after almost 3 months the trip to Sydney feels almost surreal. In the beginning we thought it will be a nice time spent in a nice and big metropolis .... it wasn't like that ... Sydney manged to blew our minds, I never thought Sydney would be so amazing. A very big part of this great surprise was Simpsons of Potts Point. On one side the building is a superb piece of victorian architecture full with small details, like the brick facade, the wooden pieces, the distinct but discrete ornaments on the walls, the old air vents in the rooms, the large and generous staircase, etc. Not to mention the details of the furnishing, vintage solid wooden chest-drawers, large crystal mirrors, the fireplace and paintings. In our travel experience, a very beautiful place, in the end, is just a place. What really makes a place special is the people that run it and, in our case, Keith, Marie, Ree and Damion were more then hosts ... I, for one, could have stayed for hours just chatting and sharing experiences with them. When we needed them they made the impossible possible. I remember discovering that there is a big event on 26th of December, the Sydney-Hobart sailing race. That morning Keith asked if we booked a place on one of the ships that follow the starting of the race in the Sydney harbor... of course we did not, but with Keith's help we had a very exciting, adrenalin-pumping experience. As for the location, after we visited a lot of what Sydney has to offer, I do not think (in our case) there is a better place to stay in Sydney... Lots of restaurants to choose from and in walking distance, quite and peaceful, but with a little bit of color and taste. We read about the people being sceptic about the King Cross area, but I do not understand why. It is a lively, nice and colorful area. We did not know how to make it possible to come back home through this area, just because of its interesting contrast, not feeling the need to be cautious at any time.... and after crossing this \"busy\" part and stopping for a delicious meal at one of the restaurants, our daily journey ended on the calm and quiet steps of Simpsons. ... Can anyone imagine that every morning we were getting up on the tuning wave of cockatoo's singing. There were free parrots strolling freely around the Potts Point... Amazing....

But for those who have not yet been, you will appreciate the location, which is convenient to the airport (about $40 taxi) and to local restaurants (Fratelli and Lotus right next door) and the Woloomoloo Wharf (incidentally the longest wooden structure in the world), a ten minute walk which does involve traversing what we now term the \"stairs of death.\" We plan to return in August!", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cSweet little B&B\u201d", "Author": "SumiRajoo", "ReviewID": "UR124474213", "Content": "It was a memorable 2 night stay here...loved hopping down the steps to walk up to Victoria wharf and across the gardens to the Opera house!

Located in Potts Point, an area rather like Primrose Hill, only better, there are over a dozen privately owned restaurants within toddling distance, all really good. Best in our opinion is Angela's Sardine Room, opposite, and Brass, just around the corner. The Opium Den, Asian/Thai is a must also. Always busy, tasty stuff. Top tip - Oz is expensive, so the happy hour at the Fountain Bar overlooking the El Alemain Fountain is a bargain. BOGOFs from 3 to 8pm!

Within minutes I was having a nap. Simpsons is best described as a private multi-storey home of antiquean character which oozes lots of charm. The building has been modified to accommodate fully self-contained suites of various size and retain the original structure. A pleasure to view. Located less than 10 minutes walk from Kings Cross Station, this hotel is reasonably centrally located for public transport and ease of walking to several tourist features of inner Sydney. The building has security and access is via an encoded fob or keypad code; works well once you master the E-button (hi Keith) :-) Aside from your suite, guests are welcome to use the common-areas, dining room, extended-lounge which also has a computer for free internet access. There is Wi-Fi throughout and it is only a matter of getting the code for access should you have your own computer; networked printing is also available; again, just ask Keith. Breakfast is a breeze with plenty to get you going; fresh fruit, cereal, toasts and lots of accompaniments and the days newspapers to read if you like. In fact, breakfast is so well organised I had two on my last morning with no complaints (Hi Damien) :-) In the evening, if finding a quiet moment is needed, feel free to sit back in the lounge, in front of the open-hearth fire and sip on the complimentary port and brandy (open-bar), I did and eased into the fine leather chairs. Of note, there is a continuous flow of classical and operatic music when in the dining room and lounge, a delight to listen, not overly loud or distracting, but fine enough to compliment the building and accommodation features. Limited car-parking is available, check with the hotel when making your booking is highly recommended.

Potts Point is also a lively area with a few good restaurants as other reveiwers have mentioned - the Italian restaurant Fratelli Paradiso being one of them. There is also a good book shop at the end of the street. The hotel itself is a great old building in a street with some nice period buildings across the road. The public rooms in the hotel are lovely with old furniture a couple of fireplaces and a computer with internet access, a great place to sit and read the paper or one of the many books provided. The breakfast room at the back of the building is also quite pleasant. Booking was very simple and the staff were quick to reply to emails and generally very helpful. My only (minor) gripe would be that the rooms on the ground floor are fairly dark and a tiny bit tired, plaster is chipped and we had a dead refrigerator taking up space in our cupboard (as well as a functional one). I didn't get the feeling that any of the rooms would be hugely brighter or have much of a view. The bathrooms are also quite basic for a place with some pretension to be special. Lastly, tea and coffee making in the room is a nice thought, but for the level of the hotel it would be nice to offer something better than sachets of instant coffee. Breakfast is pleasant if unspectacular. I guess overall it is reasonably good value for money - our room was not overly expensive (and breakfast was included), but I'm surpirsed a little that this ranks #1 in Sydney.

One of the managers was always handy to guide you to the best day trips around and advice on how to negotiate the ferries, trains, and busses. We loved it so much that we extended our stay by two days, necessitating a move to the large suite in front - Cloud Suite. The stained glass and gracious proportions wowed us from the start. It was a bit more expensive, but it was even lovelier and more comfy than our first room. The jacuzzi tub and separate glassed-in shower were definitely a plus, as was the excellent air conditioner for the warm evenings. Other ideas for Sydney: 1 - the Bridge Climb of Sydney Harbour Bridge is great, but we'd suggest doing the shortened version. It's not cheaper, but a brisker pace would have been better for us. We went at 5pm and caught sunset a bit before 7. Not as pricey as the twilight climb but quite spectacular. 2 - Ferries to Watsons Bay and bus to Bondi Beach. Doyle's serves a great but very pricey lunch with great view back to Sydney's skyline, Nice walks along South Head. At Bondi Beach Iceberg Club (available to out-of-country visitors for a day) serves food comparable to Doyle's in quality if not in the wide selection for half the price with entertaining views of the lovely beach and surf.

The management had the balance just right between being very helpful and not too intrusive. We also enjoyed meeting other guests in the lounge in the evening or the breakfast room in the morning. The room and amenities were great with lots of space in the room and plenty of character in the hotel.

We were welcomed by Ree who was delightful to work with on getting us checked in. We arrived in the morning and a room wasn't ready, but the hotel's downstairs bathroom has a full tub and shower which Ree invited to use to freshen up. That was really appreciated considering we had just completed 20+ hours of flying! We stayed four nights in one of the top floor Dormer rooms. These rooms are billed as smaller but we found it to be just fine. The rooms featured a refrigerator, tea service, and a flat screen TV. Also included was free wireless internet...yep, FREE. Most hotels would likely charge A$20 or more a day for that service. The room and bathroom were clean and the bed was comfortable. A night's stay includes a continental breakfast which we really enjoyed. Included were cereals, fruit, yogurt, breads, juice, coffee and tea. Keith, Ree and the kitchen and housekeeping staff were all very pleasant and nice, as if we were guests in their own house. A few quick observations about the hotel that might be helpful in deciding if you should book: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lift/elevator (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old house after all) so if have trouble climbing stairs you should request a ground floor room. The hotel was very quiet while we were there, which was fine with me, but if you tend be up late and loud, you might want to stay in a larger hotel (just my opinion). We found the Potts Point area to be a great place to use as our base in Sydney. The hotel is about 10 minute walk from the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cross rail station and the area seemed very safe during the day and at night. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and it seems more residential when compared to the CBD. Our trip to Australia started in Sydney at the Simpsons Hotel, then on to two others cities and then back to Sydney for two days before returning to the US. We had planned to return to the Simpsons hotel during our last two days in Sydney, but there was a miscommunication between myself and the hotel regarding the return visit and a room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reserved for us those last two days. Once this oversight was realized, Keith quickly made a reservation for us at another hotel. The rate at the other hotel was slightly higher than the rate at the Simpsons for the same room, so Keith refunded the difference back to me. Now that is great service. We look forward to our next stay.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "canberra", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay...\u201d", "Author": "renaust", "ReviewID": "UR89960346", "Content": "Had a enjoyable few days at this hotel- one very small gripe would be the washing powder they use on all the bedding, towels etc... is fairly toxic and the smell is pretty awful.

The library on the main floor is stocked with leisure and travel books, a computer to use, and always some port for sipping. Breakfasts are good as others have said; Keith and Ree very charming hosts; knowledgeable about the area and helpful to plan outings. Location is interesting.. going out to the right, you go down a large set of stone stairs which brings you directly to the water where the Royal gardens are located, and the paths to get to the opera house. In contrast, going out of the house to the left, you first go thru a few streets with some nice cafes and restaurants, but soon get to Kings Cross which caters to the late nite adult oriented activiities (men's clubs,etc.).

We loved it. While it is not inexpensive for being somewhat removed from the center of town, we thought it more than justified its price with its charm and the great care that the staff gave us. Because it is small, the staff is able to make decisions--we were pleasantly surprised upon arrival to learn that we'd been upgraded to a nicer room. We did not ask for this, and they only did this because there was an extra room--still we liked that such decisions could be easily made. We received what amounts to incomparable personal attention from the staff--each day we were provided with detailed maps and ideas of places in town and at the beaches to explore, and when we had to catch an early flight out one morning the hotel booked the cab and even left a hand printed note in our room to confirm that they had made the booking. There was also a computer free for guest use and breakfast--two things that I think should be included in any good hotel. While a bit out of the way, Potts Point is lovely, and staying there gives you more a sense of staying in a working neighborhood. The walk through the Botanical Gardens is fabulous, so no real harm staying here as opposed to in the Rocks, for example. I would highly recommend staying at Simpsons. I have a hard time imagining anyone not enjoying their stay, unless they were really looking for the pools, gyms etc that comes with luxury high rise places. That is not Simpsons.

My first impression was of a well run hotel. I was fortunate enough to get a quick look through most of the rooms due to them being vacant when I arrived. The Cloud suite is the best appointed of the rooms I viewed (though I was informed another was also as good) and was spacious and appeared to be comfortable. Having read a previous review where pictures of grumpy judges were referred to I was also interested to see these pictures. I found them and indeed there grumpy in enjoyably comical way which I did not find offensive, but can imagine why some may not like them whilst on a romantic type stay. Perhaps the setting of the judges could be in a better suited room where they could be appreciated? The sitting room at the front center of the hotel is no doubt the best part of the hotel and filled with comfortable vintage furniture, a cosy gas fire, some complimentary fortified wines and some very interesting books. I found myself enjoying this area on more than one occasion to wind down after and hustle and bustle of the Sydney way of life and in fact wish I could have enjoyed it somewhat more. I stayed in a loft apartment which was quite small, but was warm and very quiet with AC. I was not disturbed at any time by outside or inside noise. It had a nice HD tv and was very clean. The installed furniture was very dated being at the end of its lifespan and not really what I would have expected from the reviews I had read of the hotel. It would have benefited from some geniuine vintage furniture. Some of the bedrooms would benefit from some new cabinets being installed so as to not deract from the overall excellent quality of the hotel. I had cane type chairs in the bedroom which I didnt find comfortable. Unfortuntely the bed was hard (and needs replacing) with no real cushioning and I awoke with a dead arm on one occasion. The manager Ree was pleasant and informative regarding the hotel and things to do in Sydney. Breakfast was reasonable for a continental breakfast. I felt that hotel was pitched at couples and singles were not entirely encouraged, perhaps due to the problems that could arise from some with noise and the such. Simpsons is close to several excellent cafes/delis and a short walk to the vibrant nightlife of Kings Cross. I never felt unsafe walking around the area and found the Sydneysiders most friendly and engaging. I observed that people would pick up trash on the street (it was scarce indeed) and took a lot of pride in the beautiful Potts Point area.

Simpson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is not trendy, sparse, or sterile but it oozes Australian history and possesses beautiful Australian antiques and artwork. There is an unspoken tranquil atmosphere here surrounded by quality furniture in a historic 120 year old house. The lounge-library is an excellent place to retreat after a long day traipsing around Sydney. The warm and sincere hospitality is almost unmatched. I arrived at 8am after an overseas Emirates business class flight. My room was not ready of course but I had use of a bathroom to shower and change in, as well as breakfast (not charged for). It's clear why this hotel is currently No.1 in Trip Advisor's list for Sydney. If you are a bit-old fashioned or romantic, you can not beat a place like this.

Considering the cost of staying at Simpsons, to which is added a Credit Card charge - the only hotel or B&B that did this - plus the quoted price does NOT include GST makes this hotel an expensive experience compared with what else is on offer in Sydney.

Think (very) up market B&B rather than a traditional hotel format. Thus apart from the good in-house light breakfast served each day as part of the room tariff, you have to eat out. Ditto for laundry and dry cleaning. That said, on the same (very quiet) street there are at least three good restaurants and a dry cleaners/laundry with more of both on the main road. Staff/proprietors very very helpful and managed to get my internet access problem sorted out quickly - note internet is free, unlike many Sydney hotels that can charge quite heavily. The location (Challis Avenue in Potts Point) is outside central Sydney but well connected by either taxi or train from the nearby (10 min walk) Kings Cross Station.

Over the years the breakfast has remained the same; that's one of the attractions, I do love the rhubarb compote! There's a choice of food available which will set you up nicely for the day. There's a huge comfy loungeroom on the groundfloor with internet provided. In winter, which is when we tend to go, there's a lovely warm fire in the lounge, masses of books to read and lovely music playing. This isn't like your typical hotel with masses of staff. Keith and Marie run Simpsons with the assistance of a few other excellent staff. If you have any questions about how to get somewhere or where to go then Keith and the others are a mine of information. We had no hesitation in recommending Simpsons to friends coming from Britain (who were going to arrive jetlagged in Sydney) and had only four days there. The location is absolutely the best; if we lived in Sydney we'd choose Potts Point. We always walk throught the Botanic Gardens to the Opera House (40 mins or more) but you can catch a bus (?$) or a taxi ($8 -1$12) to the city or catch the train from Kings Cross which is just a short walk away. We have often walked back to Simpsons from the station at Kings Cross (ten minutes at max) late at night and, despite its reputation, the area feels very safe. I should add that Points Pott feels a world away from Kings Cross. It's quiet at night and you'd never think you were in the middle of a big city. The local deli's are fantastic. I don't think you'd need to cook if you lived there. Check out \"Fratelli Fresh\", \"Yellow\" and our favourite \"Bottega del Vino\" - their Nepalese Lentil Soup is out of this world. There's even a Woolworths which is open from 7am to 12 midnight seven days a week.There's are numerous restaurants but book ahead if you want to go to one of the popular ones.

The charm of the neighborhood and Simpson's quaint facade were only exceeded by Ree's big Aussie smile and warm welcome. She ushered us into a perfectly appointed, spotlessly clean, but simple, room. The small refrig was apportioned with cold drinks - no charge. Ree brought hot tea and snacks, then designed a site seeing to-do list for our 1st day out-and-about. That night, we met again in the drawing room... sitting by the fire with desserts and sherry... very pleasant way to get the jet lag out of one's head. We felt part of Sydney versus the typical tourist who views at a distance from a cookie cutter, impersonal hotel room. We met Keith and Maryie, the owners, the next day over breakfast. (Wait until 8:30 after the other guests leave and you have this delightful couple to yourself for always intriguing conversation.) Keith became known as AK for 'Ask Keith.' He simply had all the answers. Maryie, always informally elegant, served us a gritty, french pressed coffee that we grew to enjoy much more than the smooth, filtered java served in the US. If you want to feel like you are coming home to family after a long absence, Simpsons is your place. Some suggestions: 1) Planes cannot land before 6 a.m. so they hit all at once in the morning. A later flight avoids some of the crush. 2) Pack 1/2 the clothes and have them laundered at the corner of Challis and McCleah. 8 bucks for a large load. 3) Yellow Restaurant has the best desserts, Potts Wine Store the best prices. 4) Sappros is great for lunch; Opium Den very loud 5) Skip the opera house restaurant for the Custom House Restaurant. 6) The Sydney Art Museum, free, is far better than the Aquarium, $38A a person. 7) Few establishments accept travelers' checks. 8) The best money exchanges are near the Victoria Building. 9) Aust. is rightfully serious about confiscating foodstuffs brought into the country. Research the Aussie quaranteen before entering. 10) Be sure to book the Hunter Valley wine tour. Richard is a wine genius.

However, we were a little underwhelmed by our room, what with the price (It's not expensive as such but it's not cheap and we expected a little better) and all the glowing reviews Simpsons gets. Our room was a bit old-fashioned and we didn't much like the colours or the furniture (I know that's just a matter of personal taste though) and a couple of things were off; for example the light switch in the bathroom was hanging off, the windows rattled a bit in the wind, and the bathroom was cramped and toiletries strange (body lotion but no shower gel) and in tiny bottles. Someone else on this site has mentioned similar small minus points and then said that they don't matter because you'd overlook them if you were staying with a friend. I'd say to that though that you don't normally pay to stay with a friend! On the plus side the bed was huge and very comfortable with nice linen, the room was large and had comfy chairs and a sofa, they have free wifi in the rooms, and the minibar contains complimentary soft drinks, water and fruit juice as well as teabags and coffee, although only instant coffee as far as I remember. HOWEVER, the hotel has some really lovely aspects. The most striking is how personable, hospitable and lovely Keith is. He rang us when we arrived (he was off-site as it was late) to make sure we were OK and see if we needed anything, and at breakfast the next day he came over, addressed us by name and was chatty, courteous and charming. He seemed to know all the guests' names and chatted easily to everyone. When we came to leave he called a taxi for us, helped us out to it with our bags and waved us off like old friends. Breakfast is billed as 'continental', which sometimes means in my experience a bit mean and basic, but Simpsons breakfast is gorgeous. Cereal, yoghurt, a selection of fresh and canned fruit, nuts and seeds (very nice touch!), hard-boiled eggs, breads, muffins and crumpets to toast and various jams, sliced cheeses and cold meats. Coffee was excellent and delivered very quickly by a friendly waiter. You eat in the conservatory, which is beautiful, as is the guest drawing-room. So all in all I would go back to Simpsons or recommend it to a friend for the friendly welcome, the gorgeous breakfast, the generous complimentary drinks and the building itself. What would make me hesitate to be really enthusiastic about it is that I found it a little overpriced for the overall impression I had of our room. By all accounts the Cloud Suite is beautiful so perhaps if I stayed there I'd feel that it was better value. I would go back to Simpsons I think, but they'd have to offer me a very good deal as I think the advertised room rates, and even the deal we got, don't really make this hotel the best value for money.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hants", "Title": "\u201cSimply Fantastic & Friendly\u201d", "Author": "HantsFamilyof4", "ReviewID": "UR25624898", "Content": "We were visiting Sydney for a few days before making the long trip back to England and our stay at Simpson's couldn't have been better.

This was my first experience in boutique hotel, and I think this a great one to be used as reference for all others!

We got a large room (Challis Room) downstairs next to the breakfast area, and my sister got a smaller room in the last floor. Service: Great personalized service! Vanessa, our host for most of the days, was great at welcoming us into the establishment as soon as we arrived, and catered to our requests whenever had one, including heaps of useful info about what to do and where to go in Sydney. We arrived very early from Dubai, and Vanessa was able to get us our rooms early so we can sleep off the 14 hours of flight we got into! I thought that was great! Rooms: Great spacious rooms with comfy beds. They had everything you needed for your stay tucked away in the closet (iron, ironing board etc etc). The bathroom is good - not extremely spacious, but still nice. My concern there is that when you flush the toilet, it takes a really long time to \"reload\", and with it comes the sound, which could be slightly annoying at night. I found that in both my room and my sister's room so I assume it is across. Nothing major, but a small concern. My only advice, regarding our room location, if you are someone who is a light sleeper, and would like to sleep through the morning hours, is to book a room \"away\" from the breakfast area. Our room was right next to it, so we heard early breakfast go-ers sometimes. Location: Fabulous! A 10 minutes walk from the KingsCross metro station, a 20 minutes walk to Circular Quay ... makes this place superb! Botanical gardens are on the way to Circular Quay and the Opera, so you even opt for longer scenic walks if you want to! Many grocery stores are close by, laundry is also close by as well as some restaurants, all found on your way to the KingsCross metro station. Our only initial concern was the proximity of KingsCross road - but everyone told us that is safe to walk through if needed. Breakfast was nice. Being Egyptians, we were the loudest in the room for sure, but the people were friendly, and did not mind us! I think what made us love the place is that it felt like home ... and that really counts! If you are going to Sydney and thinking of a place to stay ... forget the idea of all those 5 & 4 star hotels around there and just book in the Simpsons ... you will not regret it! Thanks Vanessa & Keith for your great hospitality and help! P.S.

After an evening out, we'd sit in the lounge enjoying a complementary glass of sherry whilst checking our emails and the BBC News (for free... why do so few hotels offer that?). At breakfast, Marie (or Keith) would enquire as to what we were planning to do that day and would offer suggestions of sights to see or hidden treasures whilst they served up the coffee.

There is also free internet in the lounge and lots of reading material including lonely planet guides to Sydney. On our first morning we walked through the botanical gardens to the Harbour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is a lovely walk and only took about 25 minutes. Potts Point is a great location as there are loads of restaurants and lovely boutiques in the area. Be careful of the Sydney taxi drivers however. We paid $22 for a trip to Darling Harbour and were only charged $11 for the same trip on the way back later that night! It also only cost around $10 to get a cab to the Harbour so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the fact you are not in the hustle and bustle put you off staying at this wonderful hotel. It is exceptionally good value for money. We looked at many other hotels in the CBD to stay but the prices are astronomical. You get great value for money at Simpsons Hotel and a friendly personable service. Vanessa really makes you feel at home during your stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a service you would not receive at a big hotel. We will definitely be staying at Simpsons Hotel again the next time we are in Sydney and have recommended it to family and friends.

Vanessa was also very helpful with tips on where to go and what to do, and even booked reservations for us. The only drawbacks are: you have to be super-quiet at night so as not to disturb your neighbors. It really feels like you're staying at someone's home. Also, no room service. The location is excellent. I enjoyed the walk down the steps to the meat pie stand and on to the Botannical Gardens. Go to the Indian restaurant at the base of the pier past the meat pie stand.

The hotel itself is in a quiet street off the main drag so there's no disturbance. Breakfast was fine - coffee, tea, juices and toast with jams or soft cheese.

It was a first trip to Australia for both of us, and I believe we fell in love with Sydney certainly partially as a result of the staff at Simpsons and the place itself. We were immediately struck by the warm and personal welcome from Vanessa who greeted us by name and shook our hands even before we had introduced ourselves. She showed us around and painstakingly (not perfunctorily, as is usually the case) marked useful information on a map. She patiently addressed all our questions. That first impression was a strong and very positive one, created by a genuinely service-oriented young woman. It was followed by pleasant interactions with both Marie and Keith - consistently gracious hosts. Room 10 was the brightest room on the second floor. In addition to its charm, it was appointed with small conveniences that one doesn't usually find in one accomodation. They were all present in Room 10 - windows in two directions that opened, a loveseat and coffee table, effective sconces and lamps, a good-sized desk, a small fridge, ample storage room for shoes, hanging and folded clothes, and lots of surface areas for knick-knacks such as sunglasses, guidebooks etc. The bathroom was very small and steamed up quickly, but the rain shower was wonderful. The \"king\" bed was two doubles pushed together - not optimal, but perfectly adequate. We made much use of the coffee and tea making service, as we did the computer (and the sherry!) in the drawing room downstairs. The only \"issue\" with the room was that, due to a misunderstanding, it did not have the balcony we were expecting. (I believe only one room has a balcony). Vanessa handled this problem promptly, forthrtightly and pleasantly and, after checking their file, offered a 10% discount on the price, which we gladly accepted. The breakfasts were served in an attractive, albeit cold, solarium, with a good selection of continental fare - pastries, toasted breads, bagels and english muffins (with cream cheese and jams), cereals, juices, fresh and dried fruits, and yogurt. Newspapers were provided. The breakfasts were satisfying and we did not leave the table wanting. The neighbourhood could not have been better. It was ideal - replete with trendy bars, restaurants, and shops and close to the sites without being \"downtown\" alongside large chain hotels. It had a chic but lived-in feel. Simpsons itself is on Challis, a gorgeous street, with gracious and elegant period establishments. Bus stops were within a block or two - and one bus gets you directly to the harbour, opera house, and all the sites on every visitor's must-see list. We used the busses a lot to get around inexpensively. The only small blemish was on the morning of our departure when unbeknownst to us, we came down to breakfast 30 minutes early (it was a Saturday and breakfast times started and ended later) and were met by server who was less than gracious. I believe difficulty with engligh may have been part of the problem, but she did not smile or explain that unfortunately we were early, or that to try and accomodate us she would try to have things out sooner. Nor did she even try to \"act\" or \"sound\" accomodating, understanding or reassuring. Rather she appeared annoyed with and disapproving of us, a reaction that was a bit surprising for an inn that otherwise exemplified first-rate, personal service. We will without doubt stay at Simpsons should we return to Sydney, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. If you are looking for accomodations in Sydney, I can assure you that you will love the vibrant neighbourhood, the charming rooms, the gracious owners, and the attention paid to all the little extra details that made this for us such an enjoyable stay.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beechy Bucks", "Title": "\u201cCould not have been better\u201d", "Author": "greenspecs99", "ReviewID": "UR15789538", "Content": "There's not much to add that hasn't already been said!

Best Western immediately called \"Simpsons\" nearby, to see if they had a room to accomodate us & they did. Although it wasn't in the B&B itself, it was right next door in an apt. building. (I don't know if its part of the B&B or a separate business because I didnt see it mentioned on their website) The apt. was immaculate. It was a contemporary styled one bedroom apartment w/a small complete kitchenette, & nice view. Nicer than the room, were the staff. The owners were beyond pleasant.

Their breakfast area was a beautiful, bright & airy room; exactly like their website pic. Their breakfast was basic but good; breads, fruits, juices, cereal, fresh coffee. Satisfying.

Keith, Marie, John and the rest of the team made us very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. They were always on-hand to offer any advice regarding our stay. The hotel has been beautifully renovated and was very homely and had a great character which is more preferable than the impersonal larger hotels that are on offer. The hotel is very well looked after and our room was very clean and comfortable. There was a varied selection of food for breakfast which was served in a lovely, airy dining room. Free use of the internet and the complimentary port while using it were also very much appreciated. The hotel is situated in a great area and the main CBD and main sights are a lovely walk through the Botanical Gardens.

When the jacussi was on it sounded like the bath was going to take off but that all added to the experience. One of the best aspects of the hotel in the communal areas including a big living room with board games, books and free broadband internet access. This room also has a bathroom with shower which makes it ideal if you have a late flight out like we did. Keith the owner was also very helpful with suggestions and tips.

Having seen the reviews already posted we had high expectations of this hotel and were not disappointed in any way whatsoever. It was important to us that the hotel met our expectations as it was the start of a very special 3 wk holiday in Australia and we have booked to stay with them for 4 nights. We arrived very early in the morning after a long flight from Hong Kong and were given a very personal welcome by John, the Hotel Manager. As it was so early, our room was not available, but we were given facilities to shower, change and leave our luggage until later in the day. Turning to the accommodation, we usually look to stay in 4*+ large hotels, and had chosen a boutique hotel for the first time. We booked the Cloud Suite as we were travelling with our 15 yr old daughter and needed the extra space. We felt that the Cloud Suite was very reasonably priced and it also included sparkliing wine and chocolates which was appreciated by my wife! The room itself was large, beautifully decorated in an individual style, and also comprised a huge bathroom with a large circular jacuzzi bath and walk-in shower. The room was fresh, immaculately clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. Having peeked in and seen other rooms in the hotel whilst they were being cleaned, it is apparent that all the rooms are decorated individually and are of a very high standard throughout. We loved the whole feel of the hotel and our daughter appreciated the free internet access in the downstairs drawing room! We were treated as if we were personal guests in a English Country House and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was served in a gloriously light room with glass ceilings which allowed the sun to stream through. Both Keith and Marie were on hand at this time in the day to provide advice and ideas when planning the day's itinerary. With respect to the location, do not be concerned that this hotel is not in the city centre. We felt it was better that it is not , because you have the benefit of a delightful 20 min walk to central locations through the Botanical Gardens including great views of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge (the Opera House can be seen from the end of the road that Simpsons is in). In the evenings it is a quick taxi ride back (10 AUD) to the hotel from most central points. A lovely stay, a great start to our holiday and we will always stay at Simpsons Hotel when we return to Australia in the future.", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Simpsons of Potts Point Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d257312-Reviews-Simpsons_of_Potts_Point_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$253 - $346*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8 Challis Ave</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Potts Point</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2011</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "257312", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a2/27/a2279b567b592dc9695da072bfc4c57b8large.jpg"}}
