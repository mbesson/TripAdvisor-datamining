We could not be more pleased with our choice! The hotel is located in the Eixample neighborhood very near an L5 metro stop, and is a reasonable walking distance from La Pedrera/Casa Batllo. There are plenty of excellent restaurants, cafes, and shops in the surrounding blocks, and high-end shopping on Passeig de Gracia is within 15 min. on foot. Rooms are cozy and efficiently decorated, and the cleaning staff kept both the room space and public areas immaculate. The free Wi-Fi service was unfailingly stable, and it was a real treat to be able to Skype with our kids while we were away. Most importantly, the staff provided customer service as good as any hotel we have patronized in the US or abroad. The reception staff patiently and courteously provided answers to our questions, outstanding recommendations for transportation and eating, and were ready to make us as comfortable as possible in every regard. We loved Barcelona and would readily have added a few more days to the trip if it were possible, and our stay at Acacia was a big part of that sentiment! Meal service is available, but we chose not to partake of this. A few reviewers mentioned that the beds were very firm, and this is very much the case. Mattresses are firmer in Europe that those we are accustomed to in the States anyway, but these are really hard--something to consider if you prefer to really sink into your bed. Also, Carrer del Comte d'Urgell is a fairly busy street, and given the late hours the Spanish keep the traffic noise can go on well into the night. We were not terribly disturbed by this, but if you are used to very quiet nights, you should come prepared. If you are planning a trip to Barcelona, Aparthotel Acacia should absolutely be on your shortlist of potential hotels.

The room was clean and maintained well by the cleaning staff. The staff spoke English and were helpful in providing suggestions etc. During time of booking, we requested a non-smoking room closer to the upper floors of the hotel. You can request additional items (check website to determine what is available) prior to booking or even during your stay. The hotel will try to accomodate your requests. Hotel is well situated in a quiet neighbourhood not too far from Las Ramblas. We felt safe walking around the area with our 2 children even late at night! The hotel is very close to one of the Metro stations (Hospital Clinic) and you can easily access the main tourist sites from the Metro. Beware of PICKPOCKETS - especially in the Metro!!! Our room was a large room consisting of a tiny kitchenette, main bedroom, sofa bed (all prepped) and of course bathroom. We found the mattress on the main bed to be very firm and for some this may be hard to sleep in. For us, we were generally so tired from the long days of site-seeing that this didn't make a difference. The sofa bed was more softer! Originally, we ordered breakfast in our room (served by very friendly staff) but later we utilized our kitchenette more and bought our own supplies. For 10 euro, the breakfast consisted of pastries, bread, cereal (very small amount), hams (different types), hot drink and cold drink. We generally ordered 2 orders (total 20euros) which was sufficient for us. To be more economical, we started purchasing food for our own meals -- there are groceries stores close by offering fresh foods. If you require more items for your kitchenette, you can always ask the hotel whether they can supply it (i.e., kettle, microwave). If you were planning of utilizing the kitchenette more, would recommend bringing/ buying paper towels or dishtowels. Would probably have benefited if we had a cutting board (this was on menitoned in another review). We were supplied with at least 2 steak knives that we used for cutting.

What you do get is a very good sized room at a low rate near to the metro in a nice suburb of Barcelona. The location. Not within reasonable walking distance of the centre but very close to the hospital clinc metro stop on the blue line. You do have to change lines to get into the centre on to the green line but it's only three stops in all. The neighbourhood is nice, middle class - we felt really safe. There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby but it's all a little quiet, you need to head into the centre to find the real night life. There's a supermarket close by and a couple of smaller more expensive shops. We never felt too far out but you need to be happy to use the metro. Hotel Clean, friendly staff, solarium on the roof (has to be requested to be setup the day before use). 24hr manned reception, you need to hand the huge room key in to reception everything to leave. Room Large, very very clean, firm but comfy beds. Small kitchenette, you have to request at reception if you want extra equipment like a toaster, microwave and kettle. Ironing board and iron also available on request however they take it away the next day which was a little annoying. Bathroom is large, but as other reviews had said the shower is good but the door leaks. There's a hair dryer, a TV with a few English channels and more importantly free WIFI. Rate We paid about \u00a380 a night, which is pretty good for Barca, Cons: As has mentioned before the rooms have really thin walls, we didn't luckily have any neighbours but we still got a fair bit of plumbing noise (pipes gurgling in the bathroom), phones going - lift noises etc. Having said that I'm a fairly light sleeper and it didn't disturb me too much overall, I wouldn't let it put you off hotel. and of course the location isn't perfect but at least you have the metro stop nearby (which runs all night Saturday and till 2am Fridays). So in short a big room, with handy self catering and a good room rate, in a nice suburb of Barcelona. As for Barca don't believe all the pick pocket scare stories you'll hear on the forums, just take the normal precautions you'd normally take in a large city.

Good Bars, Cafes and Restaurants around. There is a small supermarket 200 mts. from the hotel, and a couple of mini-markets very near. The hotel is situated in a main street, but the rooms have double-glass windows, so there is no noise from the street. Most of the staff at the reception were very helpful, nice, cordial, etc. (I speak Spanish, so I can't tell about their English). When ever we needed something (microwave, kettle) or ask for something to be fixed, the matter was treated care very quickly. The Kitchenette was well provided and as I wrote above if you need something, you will get it if they have what you need. The utensils at the Kitchenette were cleaned every day (we couldn't clean them anyway because of the lack of soap and cleaning tools). The \"rooms\" are nice and big, as well is the bathroom. The room have wireless and free Internet (fast enough. Have to ask for a password at the reception) and get a free local newspaper every day (in Spanish, don't know if they provide in other languages). the cons: The apartment is actually A big nice room, but it is NOT separated into a bedroom and a salon by a wall, but rather by a nice wood 3/4 high partition, and a sliding door (difficult to notice in the pictures shown at the hotel site, that seems like 2 well separated rooms by a wall) . If you are alone or a couple (even with a young child), then there is no problem. But if you want some privacy or light and noise (laptop keyboard, cooking, etc.) from the other side of the room disturbs you, then there is a problem. We were a couple with our young adult son and it was disturbing. The bathroom is next/linked to the \"bedroom\" so from the \"living-room\" you have to go through it. The bed (or sofa) for a third adult is uncomfortable! For a child is good enough. Although there was no noise from the street, we did hear here and there the high volume TV from the neighbor from the other side of the hotel/building wall. (not something the hotel can do about. But I knocked the wall and they understood the hint). By the way TV, I think they should install a second one in the \"living room\". You can't open windows (besides the bathroom window) in order to refresh the air in the room. We had to ask for toilet paper from the cleaning lady (luckily saw her), something that usually you don't have to ask for in a hotel. Had to buy soap, because when the soap they gave finished, we didn't get any more. We didn't complaint at the reception about those 2 things because we thought it wasn't such a big issue. (but I feel that I have to write it in my review). In conclusion: It seems from my review, that there are more cons than pros. But that is not so. The cons are not cons if you know them in advance when you choose this hotel. The Hotel is nice, clean, very well located and the Room/s is/are big and well equipped.

I needed a room for three persons and the Aparthotel Acacia was the highest rated hotel that slept three. The location was in a residential area not a tourist area. But with a metro stop located so nearby - access to Barcelona was easy. The rooms were large by European standards with a small refrigerator and kitchenette. Wi-fi was free. But my concern involves BED BUGS! The morning following our first night there - I noticed four bites on my stomach. But as I had never in my years of travelling experienced bed bugs, I thought nothing of the bites. We spent all day out seeing the sites and went to a late dinner. When we returned for the night, I wen to change into my bed clothes and realized that I was covered with bites on my torso - almost 90 of them!! We were tired and worn out from our first full day in Spain but there was NO WAY that I could sleep in that room (401) . I called to the front desk told them of the bed bug bites and they gave us another room. We packed up all of our belongings and moved to the 6th floor. Just as we were unpacking everything, we were called and told that we needed to move to another room. By the time that we got moved and settled and all keys down to the front desk - it was 1:30. My husband was tired and frustrated and talked to the front desk about compensation - he asked for one night on a five night stay and the front desk told him that he could not authorize it but he was sure that we could do something agreeable. I was freaked out, I spent time researching bed bugs on the internet. And the news is not pleasant. They are difficult to see and terrible to get rid of. They are not necessarily caused by a lack of cleanliness but actually travel with people on their luggage. They hide and come out an hour before dawn. They are very transient and move from room to room and can live for 18 months without feeding but typically feed every 4-5 nights. Needless to say I did not sleep well that night or during our stay there. In hindsight, we should have moved hotels but it was a busy Easter weekend and finding a room for three persons would be difficult. The next morning I went down to the front desk and spoke with the day manager. I even showed him a photo of my back with the bites to show that they did exist. I wanted to know that they took me seriously and treated room 401 extensively. When we returned from that day of touring, I was told that they did not have bugs. They did not allow animals in their hotels and that their hotel is very clean. They offered me a 5% discount or 35 euros not because they believed there to be bed bugs but because they had incovenienced us and had us move twice- ha! - what a joke. I tried to contact the hotel owner directly to ensure that he was aware of my concerns and to ask for further compensation. But I received no response. My bites did not multiply but did continue to get moe uncomfortable and affected my pleasure in the vacation. My husband and daughter also wound up with several bites on them. I continued to read about bed bugs and how to keep from taking them home with me. BED BUGS are nasty - people actually move from their homes because they cannot get rid of them. Upon our arrival home - we were forced to wash everything in the hottest possible water and dry for 20 minutes. Everything and I mean everything was sealed and sterilized or frozen, They even have been known to get into computers so nothing is safe from bed bugs. I have done everything possible to stop the contamination of my home. But I want to warn future travellers to beware of Aparthotel Acacia. Even the cleanest of hotels can suffer with bed bugs. And if the Aparthotel Acacia did not take my situation seriously and treat not only room 401 but the entire hotel as recommended by pest control specialists - the BED BUG infestation will only continue.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville", "Title": "\u201cLacks good customer service\u201d", "Author": "romalu", "ReviewID": "UR13098209", "Content": "Requested room (non-smoking, back of hotel) was not ready when promised so we waited in the lobby for about one hour. When it was still not ready after an hour wait, we decided to go out to eat. When we came back to see our room, it was obviously a smoking room as the air reaked of cigarette smoke. By this time there were no other non-smoking rooms available on the back side of the hotel away from the street so we had to settle with a room facing the noisy street. The room was okay except for ambulance sirens all night long (hotel is near a hospital) and motorcycle noise (numerous in Barcelona). We arrived at the hotel after more than 10 hours of traveling, so we were anxious to get into our room to wash up and relax before we went out to eat. The ensuing problem with the hotel room not being ready, and then not getting the requested room was very disappointing. Also, it was impossible to prevent the shower water from splashing onto the bathroom floor because of the inadequate, dangerous shower door. The room's lights only work when you put the hotel's card key in a slot on the wall. Actually, you can use any hard card, like a credit card to keep the lights on when you go out while someone stays in the room. Avoid wasting your money on the coffee machine in the lobby as the coffee tasted somewhat like sewer water and hotel staff would not reimburse us. Parking (for a fee) under the hotel was very cramped and required numerous maneuvers in reverse to get around the turns.

Despite their insistence on knowing when we would arrive the rooms were not ready when we did arrive despite this being later than the check in time and later then we had estimated. One of our party had been taken ill hence our slightly later arrival and despite reception knowng about this distinct lack of interest in getting us our rooms. The light in the kitchenette area in one of the rooms didn't work in all the time we are there and on the last night they offered to change our rooms the next day - when we were due to check out! Shame as the rooms were spotless and well equipped. Arriving on a sunday means that the main supermarket and lots of bars and restuarants in the area were closed - better to get there one day earlier or later. Also in an area called Hospital Clinic gives you a clue - ambulances racing through the traffic sirens blaring!

Cons: - shower leaks (due to 1.5 foot length of glass that acts as a curtain) - hard beds - you give them your room key anytime you leave (as with all the hotels I stayed in while in Spain and Portugal) which is very insecure because anyone could go to reception and say \"room 210\" or whatever, and they would just hand you the key. _______ I would recommend this place to anyone for it is a good deal.

This means that it's about 4 blocks from the Passeig de Gracia - the upper level of the most famous Rambla - so about 10-15 minutes flat walk from the main Gaudi houses of La Pedrera and Casa Batillo. There's a metro stop - Hospital Clinic - 50m away. Having lived in Barcelona between 94 and 96, I wanted a hotel that would have on-street parking overnight, bigger rooms but not be too expensive for a family of 5 (although we needed 2 rooms). You don't get this in the Barri Gotic without paying lots of 5* money, and the rooms tend to be smaller. As other reviews remark, you get about 45m2 of space with a separate living area (which has a very comfortable fold-out double bed), small kitchenette with fridge, hob, and basic pots, pans, glasses and cutlery, a good double bedroom and a comfortable spacious bathroom, with good water pressure. All spotlessly clean, with very comfortable beds and (a real blessing) totally silent, yet very effective air-conditioning (and opening windows). Loads of really good restaurants nearby - both tapas style and plenty of pizza/pasta ones too. There's a very classy, consistently good one called Vinya-Roel, at c/Villaroel, 190-192 (tel 93-430 7279) that has been in the same hands for more than 13 years - and serves very high quality Spanish food (English, French, menus too) with really reasonably priced wine. About 2 blocks away. There are very fresh patisseries - including a really spendid, traditional one - just opposite - which serve great breakfast pastries and coffee; a Caprabo supermarket one block away (open 9am -9pm) and several late night small shops which will sell you beer, wine, milk and other late night essentials. Reception, chambermaids all very helpful - excellent English too. Can't stress enough that everything very clean, efficient and friendly. We slept really well - it's quiet there too - unlike the Barri Gotic where you get street noise at all hours. It's a few stops away on the metro to get to Plaza Catalu\u00f1a - the main square at the top of the Ramblas - or you could walk it in about 20 brisk minutes. It made a great base for a 6 day family holiday. We'd certainly go back. Any quibbles - the car park under the hotel would only take very small cars - (but we fed the meter for 2 hours in the morning, and parking is free after 8pm at night, and generally easy to find); and you get \"bath gel\" rather than shampoo - so we bought our own for a couple of euros. I've stayed in a lot of Barcelona hotels on business - and I would rate this one highly for space, cleanliness, friendliness, and the things that matter like comfortable beds, efficient, quiet AC, a fridge to keep the milk (for cereal and coffee) and beer in. I'd certainly stay there again.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Aparthotel Acacia", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d238722-Reviews-Aparthotel_Acacia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$171 - $277*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Comte d'Urgell, 194</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08036</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "238722", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8c/05/da/aparthotel-acacia.jpg"}}
