{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Don't judge a book by its cover... As my taxi approached the hotel, a sense of mild dread came over me, spurred-on by the bleak external facades of a building whose design inspiration appeared to be melancholy.However.Once past the entrance, as if playing some kind of Germanic prank, the hotel reveals a very modern, minimalist interior with fast shiny lifts, funky mood lighting and a team of helpful, uber-efficient desk staff.The breakfast spread is business class and caters to most tastes and you can use a local gym (5 minute walk) free of charge. The rooms are also well insulated from any traffic noise outside.The town centre is approx. 3km away, but the hotel itself was perfect for a business stop-over.", "Date": "Oct 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR150291614", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Wotski"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Experience This was my first time to Europe and I was worried that I would not be satisfied with the entire hotel experience in general as I heard it is a much different experience than accomodations in the states. I did not find this to be the case at all. I was very impressed with my stay. I took the shuttle from FRA directly to the hotel. It arrives on the hour and on the half-hour. It arrives outside of the Terminal 1 Hall A arrival area. It took me a while to find the location but once I did the shuttle arrived right on schedule. The driver was nice but spoke little English. The shuttle is free but I tipped him $10 euro. Once arriving at the hotel, check in was quick and I was offered help with my bags up to my room. Once inside the room, I found it to be somewhat smaller than the average American hotel but certainly not cramped. The room, bedding and bathroom was very clean. The bed was as large as a King but had a King size box-springs and 2 twin mattresses on top of that. At first it was a bit awkward, however it was very comfortable. There were four pillows all very comfy as well. The overall room decor was pretty and modern. The bathroom had a shower only, glass enclosed with wonderful water pressure. Every travel sized personal item you could ever need was in a basket on the counter top. Soaps, shampoo, conditioner, body gel, mini-sponges, toothbrush, toothpaste, mouth-wash.....even lip balm and a sewing kit. There was a hair-dryer as well. Hung in the closet was a fresh robe and slippers. There was a well-stocked mini-bar that is computerized so be careful before you just pull something out as you will be automatically charged. No microwave but that wasn't a big deal to me because I didn't actually need one. The hotel bar was nice although it closes rather early at mid-night. In house meals were good too. I never ate in the acutal dining room but ordered room service twice which was prompt and tasty. The breakfast buffet was tasty and extensive with selection but pricey as well, $17 euro to be exact. There are two computers in the lobby with free internet access. I learned that the German keyboard is slightly different than the American one, so I googled German keyboard to get a quick lesson. There is also a large covered parking deck and that was nice as I had someone visiting me who lived in country, however parking is not free. It was $13 euro per day. I took the shuttle back to the airport upon departure and it leaves at 15 til and 15 past the hour. Again prompt and courteous. There was a small language barrier at the hotel but not so much that it can't be worked around. All of the staff I experienced spoke at least some English. Again, overall, very, very impressed. Would definitely stay again if I return to Frankfurt.", "Date": "Sep 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR948858434", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "layla_lou"}, {"Content": "Great lay-over hotel Stayed at NH Frankfurt Niederrad overnight. Our flight landed at 8:00 pm, and we easily located the shuttle pick-up location on arrivals level, right outside the baggage hall. After calling the hotel, the shuttle picked us up within 15 minutes. Upon arrival, we were quickly and efficiently checked in (the front desk lady was very quick, but a little cold). Our room was on the fifth floor, and very nice and modern. The bathroom only had a shower, but it was HUGE. We didn't eat at the hotel due to the cost, however, there are several supermarkets in the area. We went to the one next door to grab snacks for the night and to grab breakfast for the morning.We received a very friendly wake-up call, and were able to catch the complimentary shuttle (which runs every half hour). The ride to the airport was quick, although they drop you off at arrivals, rather than on the departures level.Overall, a very nice hotel for an overnight trip!", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR283793946", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tippy012"}, {"Content": "4 star Stayed one night before flying out of Frankfurt.

But due to the above mentioned hotel being sold out I tried their branch in Niederrad. Very similar hotel in terms of style and comfort. Much like a Westin, in my opinion. My only complaint is that it is a 15 min walk to the Niederrad train station, and trains are not that frequent at certain times of day. And if you are carrying or wheeling luggage, this is a real annoyance. At night they can be 30 mins apart, which means the entire commute can be bothersome, especially if you are having business meetings and dinners near the center. I would stay there again if I had to, but would still prefer the NH Frankfurt City", "Date": "Oct 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR510020751", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "gourmet2go"}, {"Content": "A pleasant surprise! I'd booked this hotel for a quick overnight and found it a very pleasant stay. Like the Novotel Bern Expo in which we'd stayed a few nights earlier, this hotel is very clean, modern and comfortable. Personnel is multilingual and extremely pleasant. Prices were friendly enough so that we were able to reserve two rooms for our family rather than sharing a triple as we had in Switzerland. Both rooms were spacious and comfortable. Worth noting is that there is a train track right behind the hotel, so it's advised that you leave the windows shut. We were on the railway side of the hotel and with the windows shut didn't notice a sound.This Novotel has a good assortment of dishes on the dinner menu which are both well executed and beautifully presented. We chose to dine on the windy outside patio which isn't far from the train tracks. Even outside, the trains are quiet enough not to interfere with normal dinner conversation. Dinner was tasty from start to finish.The breakfast buffet is well worth the supplemental cost -- there is something for everybody and plenty of it. Breads, meats, cheeses, muesli, yogurts, eggs, sausages, pastries, cereals, waffles, fruits and more are all set out in a huge buffet-- all of it very tasty. We arrived via rail and left via air, opting to handle both transfers by taxi. Both were about 10 minutes from the Novotel. There was a computer terminal and printer in the lobby which I was able to use to check in with the airline and print out our boarding passes. Based upon our flight departure time, the hotel arranged our taxi pickup perfectly the night before and we arrived at the airport in the morning with plenty of time to spare.A firm thumbs-up for this hotel!", "Date": "Aug 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR757403459", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Neanne"}, {"Content": "a lovely clean hotel A pleasant, clean, modern hotel. very helpful staff who speak excellant English and cannot do enough to help.

Bathroom was good with all the usual amenities plus some unexpected ones such as a toothbrush, toothpaste and a razor! Very nice touch. Also it was the only hotel we stayed at in all of Germany that had a coffeemaker in the room! Only thing it lacked was an iron and ironing board, strange since everything else seemed to have been thought of. Staff was nice and accommodating. Dining room was pleasant and attractively furnished in ultra modern style. We only had a light snack there, but it was good.
