The room was the best value hotel that we could locate (location and standard Vs price). The rooms were basic, but contained everything we needed. The only issue was the lack of heating. We had a radiator in the room however only one small section of the heater was working. We asked reception for a small fan heater however we were told that all heaters were in the basement and not available for use. For this reason we were forced to sleep in thermals - so perhaps only stay here in summer. It is around a 20 minute walk to Dam square, with Museum district being 12 minute walk. The hotel is also right by a tram stop, so one train, and one tram from the airport to the hotel. Even in the dark it was easy to locate this hotel. In terms of location this residential area is perfect for a bit of quiet while still being close to all the action. We did not get breakfast based on other reviews on here.

From the start we were given a room on the top floor which required mountaineering expertise to climb the steep stairs with heavy luggage. As two young girls we were not offered any assistance and as a result I ended up with numerous bruises on my leg from the struggle. Our room was clean and overall on first inspection I was very satisfied, until we opened the patio doors and realised that they were rather difficult to close. The first night we were awoken to the sound of heavy wind rushing throughout the room, I thought someone had intruded but in actual fact it was the patio doors that had given in to the forces of the January winds. On the first morning we attempted to have a shower however there was no water flow, we tried to call down to the reception but the phone line was dead. We abseiled down the cliff (stairs) and told the staff of our problems, they said they could ring to our room no problem and that they would have a look at the shower. That evening when we returned to have a shower before hitting the bars we were bemused to find that the shower had not been fixed, so we again went to reception and told the staff, who then rang up her colleague and found out that he had 'forgot' to fix the shower. She offered us a free breakfast and to use the communal shower at the reception, however we had paid for en suite facilities not hostel communal facilities. Returning to our room another member of staff came with a new shower which worked perfectly for the duration of our stay. (The phone still did not work from our room) The rest of the stay was okay, apart from the lack of sleep due to feather pillows but that is down to preference and loud Russian people shouting at 3am. However, on the last night the apple inn dealt its final blow, by locking our room due to \"damage of a towel\" this towel had been used to wipe half a cup of Latte coffee that had been spilt previously. The staff then had the audacity to charge us 15 euro for this 'damage' and said that their maid was a 'professional' and could not use this towel again. Hearing this nonsense I asked if I was able to take it to the launderettes personally as I refused to be charged 15 euro for a coffee stain that could be easily washed out. Which of course it was, for roughly 4 euro at a nearby (10 minutes walk) launderette. The staff then replied that their maid had 'not tired hard enough' to remove the stain, which in reality meant that she had not washed it at all as it still smelt of damp and coffee. They then removed the charge as the towel was fresh as a daisy after a nice wash in the washing machine. Personally, being young females I think this was just a ploy to try scare us into paying the charge without questioning their authority, on reflection I should not have spent my own money cleaning a towel which should have been included in their services. Be warned it is a scam to earn extra money! And do not indulge in any mud wrestling activities as you will be charged for any dirt mark on your towels... such a joke. Overall, Amsterdam was an amazing experience and loved spending the start of my new year in the city, however this hotel has a lot of explaining to do on the treatment of customers. P.S. I would advise you to take your own towels. And maybe some new patio doors...", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "hollingee", "ReviewID": "UR120920697", "Content": "Stayed 8-11 Nov room ok,clean,staff helpful,didnt bother with breakfast though.You can get breakfast cheaper in the city.Tram 2 stops 2 minutes walk away,get off at Valursplein.

On the plus side all the breakfast room was very nice and the Dutch breakfast plenty and filling. We were very impressed with the staff at The Apple Inn, who were very friendly.

The hotel is also quite close to the Van Gough museum and also an amazing park - so enjoy these places! To get to the hotel from the train station is not so tricky once you figure it out. The hotel website tells you what street car to take to get to the hotel and it's perfectly right (and cheap!) Enjoy your stay in Amsterdam!

Upon arriving in Amsterdam we got the number 2 tram from Central station (the number 2 tram can be picked up from nearly everywhere in Amsterdam centre, just look for the number on the tram stops to find out if it stops at the stop), we paid a one off fee of 1.60 euros which is valid for as many journeys as you can make within the hour. The tram ride from central station was about a 12/15 min journey and about 7/10 mins from the Leidesplien area which was what we wanted to be near. To walk to central station it would probably take you well over 1hour and to walk to Leidesplien it would probably take you about 20/25 mins. Upon arriving at the hotel (the tram stop is either at the end of the street or the middle of the street - the street name is announced on the tram so you know where to get off) we checked in with a helpful member of staff, as we were 2 hours early for check in only one room was available, but the staff member was most helpful and allowed us to store our luggage in this one room till our other rooms were available after 1400hrs. All the rooms were twin beds, which is a little annoying if you want to snuggle up to your partner, but then good if you have had a row!!! The rooms we had were all similar but different in size. Room 1 was a very good size with a big bathroom and the worlds biggest mirror, room 2 was a reasonable size with an odd layout and reasonable bathroom and room 3 was the smallest of the rooms with a small bathroom, although adequate. The rooms were basically decorated and a little dated, but all was clean so it wasnt an issue. The mattress was very soft which isnt too good for the back but I slept ok so it wasnt too much of an issue. The bathroom in room 3 smelt a little but soon went away. Sadly noone got to sample the breakfast as noone got out of bed so sadly I cant comment on if it was any good or not. Some of the friends I went with purchased some food and drinks from the fridge at reception, the prices were very expensive, but I think this is standard in Amsterdam as everywhere food and drink is rather expensive which isnt good! Overall the stay at the Apple Inn was good, its situated quite out of the way in a quiet street so ideal for those who want a good nights sleep but not if you want to be in staggering distance from the pubs and clubs in Leidesplien area! If you want to be in staggering distance I wouldnt recommend staying here but somewhere closer. I would stay at the Applie Inn again as it was fantastic value for money, only 59 euros per room which is very cheap and I would recommend to others too if they want a nice quiet stay. We did have a walk when we got there and its within about 15mins walk to the RIKJS (maybe spelt wrong) and the Van Gough museums so ideal location for these places. Amsterdam was very rainy whilst we were there but we still had a fun time. All I would say is make sure you take plenty of money as the food and drink is fairly expensive, you are talking just less than 10 euros for a decent breakky (try the Irish Bar in Liedesplien) and 5 euros for a pint of strongbow!", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester, England", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel for short break!\u201d", "Author": "B777-300", "ReviewID": "UR6744297", "Content": "Nice simple hotel in Amsterdam and perfect for a short break.

The hotel room we had was quite small but quite adequete for a couple for a few nights. Daily breakfast that finished at 9.30am when we stayed. Included tea, coffee, orange juice (watered!) , apple juice, bread, jams, cheese and sliced meats. Stair case a little steep to some of the rooms which could be difficult for someone with walking difficulties. Overall a very pleasant stay.

Found it a little difficult to get to, as neither the hotel, nor the website we booked it thru gave us much of a clue, but I suspect if you're good at reading maps you'll not find it a problem. Basically, once you get out of the train station, its in a North East direction. We paid about 14 euro's in a taxi from the Dam Square and once we got to the hotel, we realised that it was right outside the number 2 tram stop. So if you get to the Dam Square or indeed outside the central station, you need the number 2 tram and it will drop you off practically outside the hotel. The trams are 1.60 euro's per journey, but are valid for an hour. So you can jump on as many trams as you want within an hour for the same price. The hotel itself is really clean and tidy, the rooms are to a nice standard and we found the reception staff really helpful, especially when our bags were not put on the flight and they spoke to the handling agents in dutch.

The hotel is also a short walk away from the Rijks and Van Gogh Museums - if you fancy being cultural. We walked into Amsterdam centre twice a day for 3 days so it's really handy (about 1 mile), but if you;re feeling lazy the trams run regularly right outside the hotel door. There is also a shuttle bus that can take you to and from Schipol Airport for 12euros per person. It's called Connexions and you can buy tickets at the Airport Connexions Booth and the Hotel Reception - very handy! So, if you're a couple or family I would recommend this.
