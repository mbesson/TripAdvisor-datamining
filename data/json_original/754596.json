Not really knowing Madrid we expected big things. Its been a long while since I arrived in a taxi in a foregin country where the taxi pulls up to your hotel and laughs followed by the words 'I'm Sorry'. The reception staff although nice enough did not have a decent enough grasp of English to understand us and vice versa. Check in was brief and we went up to the room. We though the room was OK for the price, however when we got into bed we could hear everything either side of us and I mean EVERYTHING! Which isn't particularly private for one couple on one side of our room. The hotel is actually in Esperanza which is about 35 minutes from the centre of Madrid. This is accessable from the Metro which is a 5 minute walk away but up a steep hill at one point which wouldn't be suitable for some people to climb. The Metro terminates its service at 1am so once back to Esperanza there is not much to do. We found 3 bars and a shop and really there is not much there. The 'most sought after location in Madrid' actually is better described as 'The Projects', not a town full of nice house and cars but more Graphitti and boarded up buildings. Would not stay in the hotel again due to location and noise at Bedtime, we in fact spent about 2 hours there in total during our 3 day trip excluding sleep time and couldn't wait to get away on the Metro the first chance we had and stayed away all day.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corralejo, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Clairebear1974", "ReviewID": "UR123300163", "Content": "Stayed for 2 nights, great location to get to from the airport, and into the centre of madrid on the metro.

This is a big plus. It is true rooms are quite small. Very clean, well furnished. No issue with the beds. Staff was incredibly helpful. Virginia and Alvaro went well above and beyond to try to guide us through madrid and help us in whichever way possible. This was was excellent. The hotel is in a nice residential area located probably 30-45 minutes from the city center going by Metro. This is ok if you don't mind taking the metro, to get the good deal here. We paid 45-50 euro per night. Of course the metro is about 5 minutes walking distance. Metro ends service close to 1am. A mall is 10 minute walk where you can great a good lunch at Gambrinus (10 euro). I would stay here again at this rate for sure.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cNothing \"Suite\" About It\u201d", "Author": "JoeSchlambe", "ReviewID": "UR16866163", "Content": "Don't be misled by the word \"Suites\" in the name. We got a tiny room with three steel cots, each containing one hard mattress. Each of us banged shins and stubbed toes on bed legs because the room was so small. No stores or cafes anywhere near. We asked desk clerk for directions to restaurant and directions were not correct and we wandered around two or three neighborhoods for almost an hour. Bathroom shower amounts to a curtain hanging over a drain in the floor and if anyone showered, the whole bathroom floor was standing in water. Way too expensive for a hard-to-find place offering NOT a suite but a tiny room with steel cots. Avoid this one.
