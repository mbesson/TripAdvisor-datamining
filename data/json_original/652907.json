The hotel is very nice and with comparable room size and quality to 5 star hotels at a 3 star price. The bed and towels are very clean as well as the bathroom, which is adequately supplied with toiletries. They also provide complimentary bottled drinking water. They serve set meals for breakfast maybe because that\u2019s the package our agent took for us but they also have a buffet. Food taste is average same as what you can expect from fast food restaurants but I do not know about the buffet since I never tried it. The pool is clean and with enough number of chairs and pool beds. It has a running water designed like a falls that flows to the pool. This is the place in the hotel that I really enjoyed and appreciated. They also have a gym with basic exercise equipment. The front desk needs a lot of improvement though. The staffs are not consistent. They could be warm for a while and very cold after sometime, actually cold most of the time. Checking in and out is slower than most of the hotels I stayed in. The hotel should provide more seats for waiting guests considering their slow process in checking in and out hotel guests. Another negative thing I can say about the hotel is the location which is in Tsuen Wan that is far from where the action is but it could turn out to be a positive thing to those who are looking for tranquility and peace. The hotel tries to remedy this condition by providing a round trip free shuttle ride to the Tsim Sha Tsui area where most of the shops and restaurants are. It leaves about every 30 minutes but it may leave late depending maybe on the number of passengers. However going back to the hotel could cost you a small fortune if you miss the last trip of the shuttle bus from Tsim Sha Tsui if you would take a taxi. So if you are planning to stay late outside don't count on the free shuttle bus to be there to bring you back to the hotel. You can try the MTR if you want to save some money and either walk from the station or take a short taxi ride to the hotel.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hong kong", "Title": "\u201cvery helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "biky w", "ReviewID": "UR138385506", "Content": "My family just came back from a stay at the hotel on 25 - 26 August.

Everyone at the front desk was very helpful and spoke fairly good English. The second room we were in was much better, beds were a little softer and it smelled 95% better than the original room.

Aircon of course, customable lighting and a plasma tv. Non openable windows. I had ordered a king-size-bed which turned out to be king-size only in asian terms, in European/American terms it would be classified as a queen bed, but as such it was of high quality and the sleep experience was a nice one. The bathroom is probably the highlight of the room and especially important to me on a trip. Amenities including a tooth brush and a comb leave you fully covered in any event, a strong toilet, separate ventilation, sufficient towels and a really well done shower area with strong hot/cold water flow and a choice of hand-held shower and rain shower completed the perfect offering. I also used the hotel restaurant for an absolutely fabulous buffet dinner, that set me back about HKD 400.00 including a couple of beers. It\u00b4s impossible not to find something at the buffet, there are international offerings as well as local and Chinese ones. The dessert area is especially intriguing. The hotel also offers a pool area and a massage/spa area, both of which I did not try. On the slightly negative side are definitely the for-pay internet offerings and also I was missing a bathrobe in the room.

The hotel room is clean, and design is contemporary. The bed is extremely firm, so if you are not used to it like my husband, it may be difficult to get some good night sleep. However, I'm used to sleeping on a firm bed before marriage, so I had no issues with it. The pillow is super soft, and usually by the middle of the night, there is no support for the neck left. Having two pillows would be far too high for me. My husband and I arrived on an early flight to Hong Kong, so we were trying to check in at 9:30am. We were advised that check in is not until 2pm. We had to store our luggage at the hotel, so we wanted to get some stuff out of it first. There was absolutely NO seats at the lobby area. The only area they had with sofas were blocked off and you'd have to pay to sit in there (with some food offered, I guess). So I asked the front desk where I could find some space to get my luggage - she suggested I go into the hotel shop around the corner... I went in the shop, and right away, the staff in there told me to get out and deal with my luggage outside. So guess what, I got the stuff from my luggage in the elevator area. There is nothing near the hotel, so be prepared. The first two nights were fine at the hotel. The third night when we returned to the hotel, it was full of cigarette smell. Our floor is a non-smoking floor, so I called the front desk to complain. They got someone up right away, and sprayed air fresheners all over the carpet in our room... and that's it. Next night, it happened again. This time, I asked for a reason, and whether they could do something about it... the staff just basically ignored me and he said he didn't know anything. The good thing about the hotel is that it offers shuttle bus every 15 minutes to Tsuen Wan MTR station. They also have a tight schedule returning from the Tsuen Wan MTR station. We took the shuttle to Tsim Sha Tsui on the first day, and never did that again. The time on the shuttle took so long... I'd rather pay a few dollars HKD (equals $1 USD) to get to TST from Tsuen Wan via MTR. I was very busy in HK this time, so I did not get a chance to try their gym, pool, or restaurant.

We all loved it because all 3 rooms we stayed in (1 for my parents, 1 for my sister and her husband and 1 for us siblings) had great views! My parents' and sister's rooms had the view of the beach/bay and the adjacent bridge with really nice architectural form. Us, siblings had our room at the back but still had a wonderful view of the mountain and hotel's outdoor pool. We also loved the facilities which included a nice outdoor pool, big locker/shower area with jacuzzi, steam and sauna rooms. Although not all staff speaks English, they were all definitely very accommodating. Though this hotel is quite far from other restaurants, tourist spots and even public transportation (nearest MTR station is at Tsuen Wan, an 8 min cab ride from the hotel). it would be a very GOOD choice if you're getting an HK tour package, which means you'll be provided transportation to and from your hotel most, if not all of the time. Just be sure to eat elsewhere before coming back to your hotel - unless you'd like to try their buffets, which are a bit costly (HKD165 per person). Also to note is that if your getting a tour package and chose this Hotel, remember to consider that the inclusive breakfast every morning is quite insufficient for most. For the free set breakfast, they serve only a few pcs of bread, pork & beans, sausage and coffee/tea/juice. You can avail of their buffet breakfast at HKD 60 if this may not be enough. Nothing amazing but choices are good enough. :) Aside from those few peeves, I think this hotel is best for a relaxing experience of Hongkong away from all the hustle and bustle of the city center.

Im sorry to say that the experience has made me decide never to stay at this hotel again, neither would I recommend it to any of my friends. This round I stayed for 4 nights at their Deluxe seaview room on the 19th Floor, attending a Trade business event with my mother. Location is at Ting Kau, which has a spectacular view of the bridge and waters, depending on which side your room is located. However, do note that traveling is required to get to the hotel, shuttle bus service is available from the hotel to the Tsuen Wan MTR station, which requires approximately 20 minutes traveling time from there onwards to any shopping / entertainment districts. Rooms are large and spacious, the ameneties assure a pleasant stay. Majority of Hong Kong Hotels within the city are small compared to this, with exception to the 5 star hotels. My trip was pleasant overall, only to be dissapointed greatly by a certain Security staff which caused me and my mother great upset and lateness for a meeting. To relate, I was travelling with my mother (aged near 60 - I won't disclose actual age, women don't like that :) We were first in queue for the shuttle bus. There was a Lady and a Bloke behind us, my mother has heart problems, and you will notice that the hotel has a strong stench of Laundry smells when you enter, i do not know if this is their idea of aroma or it really is laundry escaping the exhaust. Anyway, my mum felt discomfort while waiting in line, hence she went out for a breath of fresh air. I had to accompany her, being she is my mother and she has heart complications. We were waiting there for about 10 - 15 minutes. When the bus arrived, we were about to board the bus when a Mr. Alex who just came up to us out of no where and asked us where are we going, I replied Tsuen Wan MTR, and he asked us to go to the back of the queue. We politely explained to him that we were in the queue, and my mother's situation which was why we were waiting outside. He insisted not to let us board, he did not believe our side of the story, we asked him to question the guests behind us, however he never did so despite being invited by us repeatedly. We were late for our meeting, and did not get to board the shuttle bus. A Mr Eric who was the Hotel Manager on duty came out - By then Mr Alex was no where to be seen, hiding somewhere i presume. My question to the Hotel is, why didn't Mr Alex question the other Hotel guests when we invited him to do so? Or is he afraid that the guests will defend us? I am very displeased with this Hotel for causing us such embarassment (He just shouted and argued with us in front of all the boarding guests as if we were criminals and did something terribly wrong!!!!) and discomfort not to mention inconveniance even as a guest of 4 nights at their hotel. After 20 minutes or so of non-productive chat with their Hotel Manager - which insisted that his staff was right. Mr Eric agreed to pay for the cab fare to the MTR station (suggested by him). I suggested for Mr Alex to apologize to us instead. But it never happened. Is the Royal View Hotel too arrogant to humble themselves to apologize to their guests? I even requested that they play back the CCTV recording to prove us wrong, which they never even bothered to act upon!! I shall most definately bring this complaint to the highest authority rest assured.

Plus the prices seemed reasonable and I wanted a quieter location. I chose a room package which was to include discounts off spa, food and other amenities. Plus I was under the impression that the hotel offered airport transfers. I since found out prior to arrival that airport transfers were not included, and they recommended only a taxi or public bus, or very expensive limo service. When I arrived at the airport I took a taxi to the hotel...but it wasn't until I arrived that I found out about an additional charge with the taxi that was not included with the stated meter rate...needless to say this resulted in a little tiff with the taxi driver and I was told by the porter that was rather common...nice. ...For transportation / airport transfers, I recommend instead using Trans-Island Limousine Service Limited which you can find on the Hong Kong airport (HKG) web site, I hired one of their private town cars from the hotel back to the airport and its well worth the money. Forget the taxis! My room was a \"deluxe sea view\" room in which I had a limited view of the sea and by the way, the hotel is located right under the Tsuen Wan bridge. The room itself was spacious with a kitchenette and comfy bed and nice rainforest shower. Overall the amenities were quite nice within the room, but they charge for bottled water in the fridge so be aware if you take any water or soda from the in-room fridge! The carpet also could have used a good cleaning. The service could be improved: their free hotel shuttle goes to the MTR station which is convenient and runs every 30 minutes, however there is no sign at the MTR so pay attention to where they drop you off because it was hard to find where the shuttle bus picked up on the way back! Also pay attention to being overcharged: I did not receive the food discount that I was supposed to because they said the package did not include the lunch buffet I had (which was not clearly indicated in the package), plus they tried to charge me for the \"complimentary\" high tea service. I had a spa treatment which was quite nice, but again at Check Out I had to point out that they hadn't offered the discount from the package. Also the hotel is more for Chinese tourists than Western tourists and is a bit out of the way of everything all things considered...and it was further away from the airport than the 20 minutes they indicate on their web site and not that quiet.

Although, the area is quite small for their many guest. They could put more chairs/sofa in their lobby coz the other guest are just standing waiting for their turn to check-in/check-out. Buffet breakfast = not so lavish but atleast there is a variety of food. I could rate it very good! their cafe Lido has a nice view facing the beach. So relaxing. Complimentary shuttle service = the schedule is very accurate and on-time! This free service is very convenient for their guest. This is a good plus for their customer. Once you reached the MTR station, it\u2019s easy for you to move around hongkong. Dont worry if there's no convenient store near the hotel, just hop-in to their shuttle bus (from 7am till 10:40pm daily) going to Tsuen Wan MTR station, there are lots of restaurants and store in that area. If i will go back to HK, no doubt i will stay again to this hotel.

The frontdesk staff is good but will make you somewhat wait for a while but its okay. Well, for those who intend to get a set breakfast from the hotel (if you registered in a travel agency and sees that you will have a breakfast outside or set breakfast), beware since your menu will be just be bread, beans and sausages, however for the buffet, its just like buffet breakfast of any other hotel. Corridors in this hotel is not airconditioned; so dont get irritated if it's hot in there. If you went outside the city, dont forget to buy water as well as food, since there is no convenience store nearby and these goods are expensive if you will buy it in the mini bar. Food in the restaurant (ala carte) is also expensive, so just hop on their shuttle that goes (I think) every 15 minutes going to the MTR station where you can dine without getting your wallet shrink.

The hotel is remote from Hong Kong's wonderful public transportation system, and so it is remote from restaurants, shopping,and street life, yet doesn't make up for the lost amenities. When we asked for an ATM, the desk suggested we take a taxi. (The hotel can charge your credit card for things like drinking water, which is not provided, but cannot arrange a cash advance on the same card). When we tried to set up transportation the night before going to the airport, the desk said it was too late to arrange their advertised airport shuttle, and recommended another taxi. The fare was HK$240, a rude shock compared to our experience a week before at the Royal Park Hotel, where a bellman escorted us across the street to an express public bus which cost HK$12 and took about only 20 minutes longer. Because there's no nearby dining, we ordered the only vegetarian option from room service, tomato and egg sandwiches (HK$7 + $7 \"service fee\"). We've had better sandwiches for the cost of the service fee. In fact, we can't remember worse sandwiches at any price.

Staff was considered enough to ask whether the other guests needed registration, to enable phone calls or any other enquires.

The hotel is very nice looking, with pool, fitness facilities, and a lovely view of the sea under the Ting Kau bridge. That is where the compliments end. The customer service representatives are friendly and must say, \"I am sorry\" often. After doing so, there is no resolution to the many problems that we faced. The rooms are very damp, my sofa was replaced 3 times. I needed two dehumidifiers in the room, running 24 hours a day, just to take the moisture out of the room so it would be livable. These machines did a good job, but sleeping through the noise of the machines could be difficult. My colleague chose not to have the machines in his room, so lived with the mildew building up on the walls. I was offered other rooms to move to, but they were all damp. The customer service rep. apologized and said the building engineers are looking into the problem. They offer internet in each room. It worked only sometimes. For one week, I had no internet at all, so working in my room became impossible. I was advised to go to the business centre in the hotel, where 2 computers were available, but the waiting time to use these computers was often long. The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere. There are no amenities within walking distance. The shuttle from the hotel runs every half hour to the subway. You must get in line early enough to ensure your space on the 29 seat shuttle, because if you don't get a seat on the shuttle, you don't get on the shuttle and then must wait another half hour. We were in Hong Kong during a typhoon, the shuttle doesn't run during a typhoon, so we had to find a taxi back to the hotel, which was difficult. Some people in my group used the hotel laundry service. Clothes got \"misplaced\" but were later found. Some did not have their clothes picked up from their room, due to lack of good communication amongst the hotel staff, which was an ongoing problem. Large tour groups use the hotel, so the lobby is frequently filled with excited, loud tourists numbering anywhere from 30 - 100 at any given morning or evening. This also makes it difficult to get to the front desk and make inquiries or requests. The carpets in the halls are new and full of fluff balls all the time; the fluff balls enter into your room. Unfortunately, I was placed on a smoking floor,and while my next door neighbour smoked, I felt the affects of second hand smoke in my room, coming through the ventilation. You cannot open the windows in the hotel. It took me several attempts to establish a wake up call, on a number of occasions, they forgot to call me for my wake up call, \"I'm sorry was the response\". The hotel staff are very nice and friendly, but very inefficient. They have staffed this brand new hotel with untrained employees. Sometimes I was not sure if they did not understand the question or they simply did not know the answer. For instance, when I asked if the boom box in the room played DVD's they said no, but I later found out it did. My telephone had to be replaced because it was not working. My friend did not have any lights in his room for 2 days, until engineering finally came to fix the problem. The list goes on and on. It was a horror show, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel SUCKS bad....\u201d", "Author": "Arachides", "ReviewID": "UR8392361", "Content": "I just spent a month at Royal View, which was the place I was set up in for my stint teaching for a month in Hong Kong. This is the worst place I have had the displeasure of ever staying in. #1 - The humidity in the rooms is ridiculous. If you sit on the couch, your ass gets wet. Other teacher friends requied dehumidifiers for their rooms because they had condensation dripping down the cupboards. The hotel keeps 30 dehumidifiers on hand - does this tell you anything? #2 - Because of the humidity in my room, I had black mildew forming on the ceiling/wall right near my main air conditioning vent. The cleaning staff did not seem to care as they never once tried to clean it. I came to view it as my pet, which I named Millie. #3 - The bathroom is poorly designed. The sink is buried under the medicine cabinet such that it is impossible to get your face in their to wash it and/or rinse for shaving. #4 - Housekeeping sucks. They wipe, but they don't clean. The soap scum in my shower stall just kept building and building, particularly on the glass door. I asked for my laundry bag to be picked up from my room for \"by the pound\" wash service. They never showed up. I called back and they said they would send a person up to fetch it, since I had to leave for work. It was still there when I returned at the end of the day. At least one day I knew they had changed my sheets, since they left the used ones in a big ball on my aforementioned moist couch. The hallways and are full of dust bunnies from the carpet fibres that are EVERYWHERE. They are enitely clueless. #5 - The place stinks - literally. They have got a SERIOUS air exchange problem at this place. If they do not bring in some engineering consultants to fix things, they will be screwed. As I mentioned, my room had mildew growing openly on the wall. The hallways smell disgustingly musty from dampness, mould and mildew. I wouldn't be surprised if they have black mould forming within the building. Some parts of the hallway smell worse than some of the streets in Mong Kok. #6 - Their shuttle service in inadequate. both in frequency and the size of the shuttle bus itself. #7 - They have a Reading Room, where there are two computers available for use in a hotel of 17 floors. Their internet drops constantly. The computers have no Microsoft Office Applications; they're simply for surfing. They are extremely hard to even get on as they become monopolized by little kids playing games for hours. In summary, for a hotel that bills itself as a 4-star facility in Central Hong Kong (...that's a laugh, it's in the New Territories at the very end of the Tsuen Wan subway line + ten minutes, i.e. about as far away from Hong Kong island or downtown as you can be...) this place is a joke. The majority of the staff are truly clueless, both in capability as well as level of service. One minute issues always take 10 to remedy. Truly I think it's a management problem. The staff has not been trained properly in how to serve paying customers. They cannot think beyond their little function, whatever that may be, and their myopia drives you nuts. And the facilty management is pathetic. DO NOT STAY HERE. EVER. YOU WILL DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY BEYOND BELIEF. Stay anywhere else. Anywhere in Hong Kong is better. A decent view and a great pool are not enough to deserve your travel dollars. This place just sucks...", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cA Traveller's Nightmare\u201d", "Author": "walwalf", "ReviewID": "UR8214567", "Content": "The Royal View Hotel is a relatively new hotel, and thus some of it's incompetencies can be excused. However, as a traveller I found the hotel and it's staff to be unbelievably incompetent in their customer service skills. For one, the first thing I noticed was the new carpets they set down on each floor. Although it very effectively reduces the sound of footsteps, since it's new, it's very easy for \"hairballs\" to stir up. The result of that is a layer of hairballs that cover more than half of the carpet's surface area. Now for someone who's allergic to dust, this raises some concern. Upon raising this concern to the management staff at the hotel, they did agree to send housekeeping to vacuum the carpets... however this action was not taken until several days later. Secondly the appliances are, to a traveller, quite confusing. For example, the microwave took me 2 days to figure out since all the function buttons had no words and were all represented by symbols or pictures. The laundry machine was the hardest to figure out: I required the assistance of housekeeping staff to help me. Now here's the catch. The housekeeping staff ALSO did not know how to operate the laundry machine, which is perhaps the most surprising event that happened during my stay. A less serious problem I found was with the TVs in the room. Upon my previous stay at a nearby hotel, the hotel included a piece of paper that detailed what channels were available. This I did not find at The Royal View Hotel. The most serious problem I found with this hotel as a traveller was the fact that transportation was unbelievably inconvenient. Let us compare this to a previous hotel I stayed at (which is located minutes away from the Royal View). At that hotel that shall remain unnamed, they provide transportation services from their hotel to the Tsuen Wan MTR station with two large tour buses, with buses every 30 minutes or so. Here at Royal View, there is only one 29 seat shuttle bus that goes to Tsuen Wan MTR, and this shuttle bus doesn't come around until an hour later, so if one misses the bus, they would either have to take a long walk out to take the minibus or wait an hour for the next shuttle bus. Also, the staff was at first very reluctant in forming a line for guests to line up in to board the shuttle buses, resulting in obvious chaos. On a final note, the broadband internet service here is horrible and often kicks you off the system, a problem that rarely occurs in other hotels. On the bright side, the view really is very nice, the air conditioning is amazing and the swimming pool is pretty nice to dip in in the evening. Overall my stay at the Royal View hotel was horrific compared to that of other hotels I have stayed in over the years as a constant visitor to Hong Kong.", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cFun to stay in a brand new hotel!\u201d", "Author": "contentedcow", "ReviewID": "UR7727914", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights 22nd and 23rd May. The hotel was not fully open and there was still some work going on, but it wasn't noisy or intrusive. We got the impression that we were acting as guinea-pigs for staff training and that there were very few other guests. All staff that we interacted with were eager to please and spoke a little English. Our first impression on arriving at the hotel was that we'd made a big mistake in booking it because it is built right underneath one of the bridges connecting the New Territories to the other islands and also there are several busy roads all around. However, once inside the hotel we were not aware of this at all, and I am really sensitive to noise. The whole ambiance is of peacefulness and elegance. The rooms were average sized, even quite generous by Hong Kong standards, and very comfortable. The beds were firm, but not hard and had good quality bedding. I have not stayed in a brand new hotel before and it was very nice to think that we were probably the first people to sleep in them! The view from the window was of the sea, with a variety of boats constantly passing by and was quite mesmeric! The TV only has a couple of non-Chinese channels, which didn't bother us other than our daughter being unable to catch American Idol! There is a small kitchen area with tea/coffee making facilities, a sink and a fridge, but no microwave or plates or anything. Plenty of cupboard space, but I don't know what for! The bathrooms are nice, although not very big. It took us a while to realise that to get hot water in there we had to use a switch on the wall outside! The shower has a regular removable shower head and also an overhead rain shower one, which was great. You can only use one at a time though. One minor point, the tap over the sink was fixed so close to the edge of the basin that it was difficult not to splash water everywhere when washing your hands. Obviously everything was brand new, so very clean and in excellent condition. The health club and pool area were not open, but we had a look round and they are very nice, with some good fitness equipment. The gym looks out over the pool, which is in a garden setting and would be very relaxing to sit by or swim in. We ate two meals in the hotel's Cafe Lido and would recommend both. The first day we had the buffet lunch, which was under 100 HKD each and included a main course chosen from a menu of about half a dozen items, plus the soup, salad and dessert buffet. All the food was beautifully presented and well prepared, with freshly baked bread rolls and was good value, although the drinks were expensive - my coke cost half as much again as the meal - but there was water provided and continually refilled, so another time I would stick with that. The next day we tried the set breakfast in the same cafe, including fresh fruit, a cooked main course, toast and jams/marmalades, plus tea or coffee, which they kept filled up. I think it was around 70HKD, so not particularly cheap, but it was good and there was plenty of it. There isn't anything else around the hotel, so you are stuck with the hotel food unless you want to go the 5 minutes or so into Tsuen Wan. There are 2 free hotel shuttle buses which go on separate, circular routes at scheduled times. One goes to Tsuen Wan MTR and the Tsing Yi Airport Express stations, the other into Kowloon. Again, they were brand new. There wasn't much room for luggage, so you'd be better off getting a taxi if you had much luggage, also they are not that frequent and we needed to be at the airport before the first scheduled bus. the hotel desk ordered us a taxi to be there for 6:30 am and it was waiting for us. It was about 200 HKD, plus luggage charges of another 50, to the airport. We chose this hotel because of the early flight and it was much cheaper than the airport hotels. However, it isn't in a particularly convenient position and we spent quite a bit of time on the subway in and out of Hong Kong, which wasn't a problem for us. It's not very close to the airport though - I would guess about 30 minutes door to door and about the same into Central. I think this would be a good hotel to say in if you want to spend time relaxing at the hotel and don't mind some travelling to get to the main tourist parts of Hong Kong and we would definitely go back, at least while it is cheap and new.", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Royal View Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d652907-Reviews-Royal_View_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$90 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.353 Castle Peak Road, Tsuen Wan</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "652907", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bc/32/bc32b8f1fa0aab2b84c71d62fc39bf5f1large.jpg"}}
