{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fantastic! This hotel was fantastic. It is clean and spacious, in a safe, quiet residential area. The hotel staff were helpful and the full complimentary buffet breakfast was amazing! There was a wide choice of meats, cheeses, cereals, salad, yoghurt, fresh breads as well as hot eggs, bacon and sausages. The hotel is directly behind the zoo and is only about 200ms to the nearest metro stop (Hasburgeralle on the U7 line). For an easy dinner, try the little pizza place at the end of the street! I would definitely recommend this hotel to other visitors to Frankfurt.", "Date": "Nov 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR100330324", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "adelaidemum"}, {"Content": "Loved the staff, sauna and location The staff was the best thing about this hotel. They were helpful, easily reachable and they speaked quite good English (witch we learned was not typical in Germany). The breakfast was excellent with warm sausages, scrambled eggs, bacon and colourful array of vegetables, cheese, etc. Talkative breakfast hostess was helpful and she waitered inclusive coffees (macchiato, latte, cappuccino, etc.) and tea to the tables.Sauna department was quite small but it was very pleasant with hot room (sauna) and a steamroom. The relaxation room was equipped with some magazines. Bathrobes and slippers you could get for no extra charge at the reception.Hotel's own car park was cheap (12 e per day and 6 e per half day, witch was convenient as our flight back to Finland left as late as 10 pm.Amenities were great and of quite a good quality and taste. We got upgraded to the Alexander Suite witch is the best room in the hotel (with a jacuzzi and with separete bathroom and wc) but still the overall quality and decorative taste was good and calming.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR998153792", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Wille81"}, {"Content": "Great value for money We have choosen this hotel due it's proximity to the zoo. It isonly two minutes walk from the zoo as well as from the U bahn station . The rooms although are not huge are very comfortable and clean. We were surprised by the quantity and quality of the breakfast and the stuff is really nice and polite. When we checked in with my son they were kind enough to offer him a chocolate bar (of course he loved them and the hotel ). It is true there are not many restaurants around but there is a steak house next to the zoo that is ok. For the amount of money we paid it was really a pleasant surprise.The area around is residential so it was really peaceful and safe during the night .", "Date": "Feb 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR386006374", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "HarisAthens"}, {"Content": "An overnight Moderately priced hotel in east Frankfort. Close to the u-bahn in a residential area. Seemed safe apart from two crackheads in the subway station (literally). Two stops into central town.The rooms were a good size and there was a very good bathroom. Breakfasts were great.One major drawback - the garage was terrible. I found it almost impossible to park in their cramped grage and ended up seriously damaging my hire car which cost me a lot of money.Also there are no decent local restaurants. They reccomended a local Italian which was a rip off with terrible food.

I had to go abroad for business and found this gem on the Best Western website.The price was very reasonable and the cleanliness of the hotel was very good! I had a single room with a queen bed and it was a good size considering that I spent 26 nights at this location. The hotel is located in a residential area of Frankfurt and the back entrance to the zoo is literally across the street. This hotel is about 200 meters to the U-Bahn (the German metro system). No hills to climb as you walk through this very clean and safe neighborhood. The closest metro stop is Hasburgeralle which is on the U-7 line. If your landing at Frankfurt International, and are adventurous, then ask how to take the metro system to this stop. A metro tip: If buying a single trip ticket then chose 50 when using the ticket machines - this allows you a single (one way) journey within the Frankfurt district. The front desk staff were friendly and the housekeeping staff kept the room very tidy. The best feature of this hotel was the complimentary full breakfast. The daily offerings were: scrambled eggs; hard boiled eggs; bacon/sausage; three different juices; fresh coffee (as well as cappucino/lattes); meats, cheeses; yogurts; cereals and fresh delivered breads, rolls and croissants. The dining room is very big with fresh flowers and linen table cloths and the staff are very quick with the fresh coffee. One thing to mention, the hotel does not offer complimentary toileteries or washcloths (as in the United States) but, this seems to be the standard in Europe. So, bring your own shampoo and lotion (and a washcloth). They do offer the basics: bath/hand towels and liquid soap. This hotel also had an in room hair-dryer as well as an electronic safe (complimentary). There is also a mini-bar where you can make your own purchases and keep in the small fridge. Also note, smoking is allowed in ALL hotels, restaurants and just everywhere in Europe. If smoke is an issue then be sure to ask for a non-smoking room; however, because smoking is allowed you will still smell a trace in your room.Overall, a great experience and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet, clean location with a tremendous breakfast!", "Date": "Aug 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR605154091", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "World_Traveler37"}, {"Content": "quaint restaurants and zoo nearby I was looking for reasonable accomodations in Frankfurt and realized that I could book this through some Air Canada points I had. I would have paid for this hotel anyways, had I not had the points because of its location and its reasonable price. The hotel was easy to find using maps given on travelocity or orbitz websites. We took the S-bahn to get there. We also got a Frankfurt two day pass that gave us half price zoo admission and unlimited transportation for 12 euro per person. (You could also use this for 1/2 price on other museums too we just ran out of time.) The zoo was literally two hundred metres from our hotel. We also asked the front desk person to help us find places to eat. She gave us directions and we walked a couple blocks through a really neat livable community to a street full of trendy restaurants with outdoor dining. My husband and I really enjoyed this hotel for its amenities and its lovely breakfast. We also thought the community nearby would be such a lovely place to live in, if we were ever to move to Frankfurt.", "Date": "Apr 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR315511543", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "hawaiiinaugust"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Hotel, Hidden Away in Corner of Frankfurt Although on a map of Frankfurt the hotel does appear on the eastern edge of Central Frankfurt, U-Bahn lines u6 and u7 (after a transfer at Konstablewache) provide convenient access to the hotel. From the Zoo stop it can be a long walk if you have a lot of luggage, but if you take the u7 and get off one stop past the Zoo there is a smaller more conveniently located station there. If you have business in the area of the Messe or need to get to the Hautbahnhopf early in the morning, a hotel more centrally located would be a much better bet, but as I was staying during the World Cup and desperately hoped to avoid the crowds, this hotel was the perfect choice, and fairly priced (about 125 EUR). I imagine that during low season you might be able to get even lower rates. The hotel itself is (as previous reviews state) in a quiet neighborhood, with a supermarket located nearby (good for stocking up on fruits, rations, water, beer), as well as a fantastic Italian restaurant whose food is excellent and prices reasonable (7-10 EUR each). The zoo is a little bit pricey (8 EUR) but a possible destination if you are travelling with children.The room I stayed in appeared to have been recently renovated, but it was a terrific room, much larger than the one in another Best Western hotel where I stayed at in Frankfurt. Huge king-sized bed, large TV, a mini-bar, large writing desk, comfortable chairs and large windows, air conditioning (this can be crucial in the summertime), a larger shower and bath area with two sinks. An ideal hotel for couples or families. Also, hangers, fluffy towels, rubber ducky (placed on the towels each night, for decoration only), and in-house electronic safe. Very excellent cost-performance.Staff there are helpful and friendly. Be sure to ask for the Hotel Gast Card on there if you want to buy a two-day pass for the Frankfurt U/S-Bahn transport network, a steal at only 7,40 EUR. At the front desk you can also read English newspapers (Wall Street Journal, Herald-Tribune.)Strongly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Jun 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR113080062", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LyonZ"}, {"Content": "You get what you expect and a bit more At almost 200 euro for a single room it's not really cheap, but it was during a trade shows - and these are the prices in all the area.Besides that, the hotel is nice and new.
