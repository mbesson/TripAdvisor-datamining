You can tend to business at SU and then take advantage of the free shuttle service provided by the hotel to at least 4 points of interest in the downtown area. It runs until 10pm and all that is required is a phone call for a return trip. We had a rental but was so grateful to not have to drive in the downtown area with parking not cheap and dealing with traffic. The rooms were clean and bathroom adequate. The staff was very friendly. There is a restaurant on site with a bar . We stayed in a room facing Madison where there is noise but not as loud as staying near broadway.

We had a large bow window that added some floor space, light and was a nice detail. The amenities in the room were great! A mini-fridge, micro wave, coffee maker and small kitchen style sink made it feel like we had a kitchenette! The room was stocked with real glasses and china mugs, which always counts for something with me! The only thing I would change about the room is the bed cover. It is a traditional hotel quilt, heavy brocade, that obviously is not washed between guests. This always bothers me, as I have seen an expose' on possible sources of germs in hotel rooms and what can be found on bed covers is pretty bad! I prefer to see a white duvet covered with sheets for extra sanitation measures. The Silver Cloud staff were very service-oriented. They made sure to tell me about their towncar service when I booked the room. They offered to book this service to meet me at the airport and bring me back, which saved $30 round trip, over a taxi fare.

You can walk to Pike's Place Market in about 20 minutes, but be prepared for some hilly terrain! The free hotel shuttle will take you to this area also. The hotel bar is not your typical, depressing, quiet retreat for hotel guests! It is obviously a favorite spot for locals who work in the area. The place is hopping during nightly happy hour and they have an excellent selection of draft beers, domestic, microbrew, and import for $3.50 to $4.00 a pint during happy hour.

I booked a block of rooms for course at a nearby hospital, at an another Silver Cloud in Seattle, and then found out that the hotel was not the closest to the meeting site, and would not offer our meeting attendees shuttle service.

I question why this location would be included, but technically it is downtown. My initial reaction from getting this property on Priceline was disappointment, however that changed once we arrived. The hotel is less than 10 years old and is in excellent condition. The lobby is very comfortable with friendly staff and complimentary coffee/tea station. This in one of the only hotels (per bellmen) that still operates a complimentary shuttle van service. This is a must in my opinion to attract guests to this hotel. The van runs on the half hour for a short ride to several locations, including Safeco on game days. You call the hotel when ready for a pick-up. There is a parking garage for $16 per day, a bargain compared to other cities. There is a bus that goes by the hotel, but I did not use it. I did walk to Westlake Center which took about 20 minutes, downhill there, uphill back. The restaurant at the hotel, Jimmy's was surprisingly good. It is overpriced, as hotel restaurants tend to be, but quality was good and they had happy hour for discount drinks and appetizers. They also have room service. For off property food, there is an International House of Pancakes behind the hotel, and a McDonalds a couple blocks away, as well as a couple other breakfast/lunch places a few blocks away. there was a list in the hotel directory in the room. The bed was very comfortable with a fairly large room with mini-fride and microwave. Large screen flat panel TV in room. The bathroom was decent size with hot water and nice shower. The tub did drain slowly. Security enabled elevators need room key to access guest floors. I do not know about safety of neighborhood, but it did not seem so bad. there are two hospitals within a couple blocks and there were some homelss people panhandling in the city. but this was not an issue near the hotel that I encountered.

I checked out the light link for one stop downtown. nice clean stations.

The lobby is lovely and the rooms are spacious enough. The bathroom isn't special but it is definitely sufficient...except for the hair dryer. Unless I completely missed something, this could be the most annoying dryer I have ever encountered - you have to hold the button in the ENTIRE time you are drying your hair. Forget it if you want to use the cool shot button - it was like acrobatics. Ladies you know what I am talking about. For a nice hotel, they need different dryers!

It runs on the half hour from the hotel and picks up from the 4 locations (Pike Place, i.e.) on the quarter hour. You just call the hotel and they let the driver know where you are. I went running one morning along the water and was dropped off and picked up promptly. Now if I had done my research ahead of time, I would have just run back to the hotel!

There are a few restaurants (chains - Subway and Panera, and non-chains), coffee shops (Starbucks and otherwise), a college, a hospital and boutiques.

Our extra towels did finally show up when our room was cleaned, however our room wasnt cleaned until after 4:00 pm even though housekeeping was working down the hall when we left the hotel at 10:30 am. Upon checkin they give you a card for a free appitizer at the hotel restaurant/bar with a $15 purchase. We didn't get a chance to use it as the place closes at 11:00 pm and we got back too late.

It is a very nice hotel, and quite clean, and the room was nice sized with a very small refrigerator, bar sink and microwave. The front desk staff was not overly friendly: I stayed there for almost two weeks, and so saw most of the same people every day, and rarely even got a smile or \"Hi\". They were not very communicative at check in about how much parking would be, I had no idea until I saw the charges show up on my card about a week into my stay. Every three days or so, my room key would cease to work, so I'd have to have it rescanned. The beds were very uncomfortable. The queen mattresses were lumpy, and seemed like they were just slightly larger than the box springs, so that if you didn't lie directly in the center of the bed, it would shift to one side or the other. That, coupled with the fact that the sheets were too small for the mattress so were constantly coming off anytime you moved, made for an uncomfortable night's sleep. The business center left a lot to be desired, as the fax machine wouldn't work the one time I needed it, and one of the two computers that were available for public internet access seemed to constantly be flashing virus warnings. I also didn't like the fact that they don't offer anything for breakfast except for Jimmy's (the restaurant on premises), since I ate there one morning and was not impressed. About the only thing I can say truly impressed me about this hotel was the shuttle drivers. They were very knowledgeable about the city and made the rides fun. As I said in the title, its a nice hotel, and might work for a few nights, but if you're planning an extended stay I'd recommend Homewood Suites. I've stayed there in other cities, and will recommend them to my company for future visits.

There is street and underground parking for those driving. I flew into SEA and took the new Sound Link streetcar and then simply got on the hotel shuttle downtown for a total cost of only $2.50.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and the decor was upscale from the box hotels. The rates were the same as the Holiday Inn or Travelodge but the feel was more elegant. The breakfast buffet is pretty basic; cereal, bagels, waffles; that type of stuff. We paid for parking in the underground garage but that's standard in the downtown area. The room was your basic two queens room with a comfy reading chair and ottoman and a well appointed desk. We were able to use wireless internet with our laptop for no additional fee. There is a large flat screen tv which is much nicer than a typical unit that takes a lot of space. The small things were nice; the hangers come off the rod. The towels are softer than your usual box hotel. There is a complimentary laundry room on each floor. The beds were super comfy. We didn't use the pool and spa but the area was clean. I used the small gym; it was unremarkable but does have a tv. We ordered dinner from room service (from the Cayenne Grille downstairs) and it was prompt and yummy. My Captain and Coke was just right and a at good price. We'll definitely stay again. I'm not sure what it is about the S.C.; it's not a remarkable hotel in any one area but the atmosphere and staff make you feel comfortable and just a bit pampered.

I had a rate of $124 a night, and though this is a good rate, along with added taxes and parking it was not outlandish, but I would have paid a little more for a little more class.
