The sit-down tables had individual televisions which was a nice touch. There were also taller tables with bar stool style seats. The Lounge area was modern and very comfortable.

I have to say, we took full advantage of most of the ammenities offered here and were greatly pleased. We checked in on a Thursday and had very friendly service from the front desk staff. Our room was clean, nicely decorated and the two queen sized beds were very comfortable for everyone in our party. We ate breakfast each day at the bistro and it was wonderful- very tasty and, again, great service. The front desk staff was very knowledgeable about area attractions and helpful with suggestions for restaurants and directions. They even provided us with a sheet of paper that listed directions, addresses and phone numbers for area points of interest. Housekeeping was great- the room was always clean when we came back from our daily adventures and any requests (extra towels) were filled promptly and with a smile. My daughter and aunt used the pool and loved it- the pool area is very nice, clean and relaxing. I utilized the on site laundry facility and found it to also be clean and reasonably priced. We found the location of Hotel Circle to be extremely easy access- you just hop on and hop off the highway to get anywhere- we found very easy and quick access to everything we were looking for- Sea World, the SD Zoo, Gas lamp District, Old Town, Mission Beach and Sea Port Village. Every place that we wanted to visit was quickly accessible and within a 10-15 minute drive from this centrally located hotel. The parking fee of $16 is clearly spelled out on the hotel's website, so I don't really understand why it is an issue for other patrons... we went to the hotel knowing full well what to expect. The parking lot was safe, clean and provided easy access to the rooms with keyed access.

So plan ahead for this extra cost. We knew about this cost ahead of time so it wasn't an issue. The rooms were clean and comfortable. However our room faced the Highway. It was extremely noisy and if you have a hard time sleeping with noise I would have a hard time recommending this hotel. Perhaps you could request a rear facing room if it is a problem? I can sleep through anything and so can the rest of my family so it didn't bother us too much. The pool area is also really nice looking for a Courtyard. They have furnished it with some classy outdoor furniture that is also very comfortable. However when we arrived at the pool there were no pool towels available. There was a stack of hand cloths from the gym stacked up but they must have been a joke. There is no way those would have been able to dry off a baby let alone a full sized adult with a hand towel. It think this Marriott really dropped the ball there. It appears that this location caters to youth sports teams on the weekends. There were a bunch of different youth soccer and football teams staying there. They even had a special breakfast set up for them every morning. So if you are a coach of a sports team you might want to look into that. For us it was more of a negative. There were a lot of young kids / teenagers running around unsupervised. It made a noisy hotel even more chaotic. Lets just say you don't want to stay here over a weekend if you are looking for a quite place to relax. We were at Sea World and Legoland all day so it didn't bother us too much.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay for a great deal\u201d", "Author": "snickers3924", "ReviewID": "UR117561711", "Content": "Great contemporary look and close to great outdoor mall outlets.

It wasn't convenient for me with respect to where I was working, but for most people the location would be good. The lobby and rooms have been renovated so it's nice. Bed is good. Bathroom is nice. Tv is flatscreen but on some channels the reception is spotty. Parking is for a fee which I disagree with but we will let that factor slide. They have a cool lobby set up with the bistro and bar which has drinks and good food but they don't have room service. My real issue with the hotel is the air conditioning and the service. I am one of those people who needs their room cold- like arctic cold. And I also am one of those people who believe that if I'm paying for the room then I ought to be allowed to make it as hot or as cold as I like. Well, as soon as I got in, I cranked the digital wall control down to 60. I woke up at 2am thinking it was warm and looked at the wall control only to then notice the fine print sticker on it which says that the AC will not go lower than 68 and if you need help contact maintenance. Alright, so the next morning on the way out I called the front desk and asked for maintenance to come fix whatever limits they had set on the control so I would get cooler. I came back from work 12 hours later and no one had come up. The room was 68 although the thermostat was set to 60 all day. I called maintenance again. 20 minutes later the maintenance guy shows up. I ask him to please make it colder. He looks baffled and essentially fiddles with the wall unit and the actual AC by the window and then unplugs the AC then plugs it back it. He then proceeds to tell me he reset it so it will be better. I tell him the system is clearly set with a limit on how cold it allows you to make it and that there must be a button sequence or something to lower it. I know this is true but I also know it because otherwise there wouldn't be a notice on the wall saying call maintenance if you need it colder than 68. He doesn't know how to do that and insists he fixed it. I let him leave and sure enough 10 minutes later the air turns off again. Room temp is of course 68. What do I do? I proceed to take the condenser by the window apart and google the manual for it and then change the dipswitches on it so it now works as a standalone unit (sans wall controller). I turn the AC itself down to 60. And what do you know? It gets down to 60. I am writing this from my room right now which is wonderfully cold, no thanks to maintenance. All too many hotels these days are doing this- limiting your ability to control your own environment because they want to try and cut costs. Well eff em. I want it cold. And if you do too, almost every AC that is \"limited\" has a way to \"unlimit\" it. Most models are online if you google it. If you need help, message me. So yeah.

This appears to be an older hotel that was purchased by the Marriott franchisee and converted into a Courtyard format, but only in the main lobby and rooms. I had requested an early check-in and admittedly got to the hotel even earlier than I had planned. The front desk said that the room that was reserved for me wasn't ready yet and there would be a 1-2 hour wait. Instead, I opted to take another room they offered that was ready. It was very small and dark, but since I was only there one night, I accepted it. First mistake. The air conditioning was via a standard through the wall unit, but was controlled by a wall thermostat that did not allow control of the mode (that changed automatically depending on what the set temperature was vs. room temp) and only one fan speed (high) which was noisy and woke me up several times during the night when it cycled on and off. The front desk gave me a VIP drink pass and gave me the impression the drink was complimentary. This was a miscommunication, as when I gave the pass to the bartender, he told me it was for a 50% reduction on the price, but was not free. This was a bit disconcerting, but I bought the drink anyway. To their credit, the spinach dip and chips I ordered was very good and a generous portion. Be aware that this hotel can be noisy. It appears to be oriented to groups, conventions and sports fans who attend games at the nearby stadium. They weren't rowdy, but were noisy in the halls and took over all the computers in the business center to play games, making it hard for those who wanted to use them for legitimate business. The computers are in an open area accessible to the public, rather than in a locked business center. Although they had a huge open parking lot in the rear of the hotel which was 1/4 full, they still charged $16.00/night for parking. While this may be acceptable in a congested city center, I have never been charged for parking in a suburban Courtyard. Another irritation!

I was thrilled to find that there was a new Courtyard within minutes of the convention center. The rooms and service were adequate: the A/C didn't work @check in, the bathroom light burned out on my 2nd night, noticed black mold the ceiling hallways on the 4th floor and my vehicle was broken into in the parking lot. I contacted the manager John Belm and felt victimized all over again with the debating and judging of the items in the vehicle being fully exposed to the public for theft! Then he continued to inform me that the signage posted \"Video Surveillance on Premises\" does not mean that the property/parking lot has video. \"Premises means building and that is what is under video\". Mr. Belm continued to debate the establishments accountablility of liability without any concern for my ordeal. I was contacting the manager, Mr. Belm to request the corporations insurance information for my insurance company; I didn't need to be victimized again by someone who should be more concerned with the welfare of their customers than debating and argumentative over the liability of the establishment. That is why we have insurance company to sort out this sort of situations. If Mr. Belm had taken the time to look up my account information he would have seen that I am a long time customer of the Marriott Corporation and that for whatever the insurance company come to a compromise, the amount I spend in any given year with the Corporation would exceed by 10X or more. I know that that review may or may not persuade you to stay at this establishment, but the more you know about the \"premises\" or property/grounds security especially when they are charging a fee to utilize the establishments parking lot the more educational decision can be made. Also I am not impressed with the chosen person of their customer relations for this establishment. Maybe I caught him on a bad day; but I think my situation warranted some sort of compassion from a person in that position.

In the past decade of attending a particular professional conference, something weird happens the vast majority of the time. Sometimes, it's dangerous and unacceptable; other times (like last year, getting a room shaped like an arrowhead), it's just weird. I'm so happy to say my experience at the Courtyard Marriott on San Diego's Hotel Circle was a complete delight and offered no surprises. Check-in went smoothly, taking no more than five minutes. Our room was clean (and my companion and I are both VERY picky about such things), the towels were plentiful, and housekeeping left the room tidy and organized before our return each day. The fridge housing could have been dusted a little better, but the bathroom and bedroom were spotless. The bed was firm, but so comfortable I had the five best night's sleep of the entire year, and the comforter was just the right weight. The air conditioning/heating control let us make the room the perfect temperature without excessive noise. This is the second time in six months I've stayed in a Courtyard, and I like the little touches like the mini-mantels with the black and white paintings, the excellent flat-screen TV with high-quality cable and spiffy, fashionable bathrooms, comfortable desk chair and numerous electronic input panels, easily accessible on the visible wall behind the desk. Two outlets at bedside, right under the bedside lights, enable charging of digital devices. This is a perfect room for the modern traveler. We loved that the free WiFi was blazingly fast; at our conference hotel (a five minute walk away), my colleagues were complaining that the paid-for Wi-Fi was unpredictable and slow, but because I'd read Trip Advisor, I knew to stay away from that venue for sleeping. If you're staying at an (ahem) conference center on Hotel Circle, stay here and walk the five minutes. The staff was friendly, and helpful, though a little unimaginative. The snack bar is right next to the bar; when the snack bar was closed at 11:05p and I wanted a juice, the young men behind the counter shrugged apologetically. I suggested they hand the juice bottle to the bartender and let her ring it up. After much discussion among themselves, they did that, but then the bartender gave me the wrong change without comment. When I pointed out the error, she noted that the bar only had quarters because of the bar's pricing methods. I had her give me back one of the quarters I gave her so that I could provide exact change. (It wasn't the money, but the principle of thinking someone wouldn't expect to get their change back.) All other experiences with the staff were exemplary. They called taxis for us which arrived (with the exception of our middle-of-the-night airport request) within five minutes. My requests for extra hangers and foam pillows were acted upon within minutes.

I took everything out of my bank account so I could specifically use all cash. Due to that she informed me that my credit card is not valid. I told her that I only had $.40 in my account, but wanted to pay everything in cash. She spoke to me so fast that I can't even remember what she told me, but said it was fine and gave me my room keys.

This time I dealt with two unfriendly front desk girls that treated me like I should have known their credit card policy and how all hotels have the same policy. This was never informed to me when I booked the room at all, would have been a nice detail to know. The room was nice looking, but there were little things that showed that there was not enough attention to detail. Such as the nice looking chair had one arm rest cover missing and the arm rest had the zipper broken was half zipped down. The compartment that housed the refrigerator had some nasty white grease all over the bottom of the flooring. Personally the bed was uncomfortable because the mattress was posterpedic. Also the room only came with one packet of caffeinated coffee when it was obvious that there was gonna be at least two people staying in the room being that there were two queen beds. Hello!

I should have spent the extra 5K/nt. At first glance, Courtyard did a nice remodel on this place. The Lobby is really modern and nice. Granite countertops in the bathroom and great furnishings make the place feel like a full Marriott instead of just a Courtyard. But then you start to notice the details they didn't get right. First off, the bathroom light above the mirror had burnt out. To their credit, maintenance came and put in new bulbs in about 15 minutes. But why wasn't it fixed before? I'd rather have taken a shower than waited around wondering when somebody would arrive. Next, we noticed that the faucet is set back a little too far from the sink. Really, it's impossible to wash your hands without rubbing your hands against the back wall of the porcelain. And then there were the towel issues. There's no towel hook on the back of the door, so I had to hang mine over the shower rod. But where do I put my towel while my wife is showering? Plus, why were there only 2 towels in a room when we had 3 people on our reservation? And as for the towels themselves, they were more threadbare than a truck stop Motel 6. These are minor problems to be sure, but I didn't have to deal with them at other hotels, especially other Marriott properties (including Fairfields!). The room itself was quite comfortable. King-sized Marriott Bed, sofa, desk, LCD TV. Again though with the details. The closet doors are hung so poorly that it's impossible to close them properly. And there's a neat bank of four electrical outlets built above the desk... that don't work. Left my phone charged in for a couple of hours before realizing that it wasn't charging. At least there were no bed bugs. But probably the biggest problem was with the paper-thin walls. We have a toddler and specifically requested a room far from the elevators to minimize hallway noise. Didn't help. I've stayed at a zillion different hotels and this was possibly the thinnest-walled hotel I've ever been at. You try sleeping when rowdy football fans come back to their room at 1am, and things are so loud that you can hear every f-bomb and sarcastic comment in clear English right behind your head. Seriously, I've never been able to eavesdrop on a full conversation the way I was in this hotel. Last, the parking lot. $16/parking is highway robbery, but I won't dwell on that. More annoying is that you have to ascend 15 steps to get from the parking lot up to the lobby. We were able to drive our car up to the front doors for loading and unloading, but it's a hassle. Beware for the handicapped or those who have difficulty with stairs. The hotel is very pretty on the outside. The furnishings are very nice. And it IS clean.

They put the latch between the door and the wall and were going in and out of the room back and forth to another room letting it slam! at all hours of the night talking on their cell phones in the hall right in front of our door, and then starting at 6 a.m. with the slamming of the door again!

I was not able to connect to the WiFi network. The front desk was unable to assist me so they referred me to an 800 number.

The second night we were there, we decided to go down to the hot tub before dinner. There was already a young lady in there and she started a convo with us, then her aunt later joined. After a few minutes, I started smelling a very strong ammonia like smell and so did the other guests, soon after that, it seemed like the water continued to get hotter to where it was no longer comfortable and my skin started to itch! Needless to say, hubby and I got out and headed upstairs to shower and change for dinner. While on the elevator, another guests commented that the chlorine must be strong tonight. I go upstairs, take off my swimsuit and saw that the hot tub water faded my brand new suit I had only just purchased the day before when we arrived in San Diego. I informed the front desk thaty maybe someone needed to check the water and they said they would do so. Upon checkout, after having washed my suit twice and the smell was still there (and of course the color was ruined), I asked if it were possible to refund my money for the suit since I had just purchased it ( I presented the receipt and everything). The front desk clerk took the suit and receipt to the back to a manager, I guess and they refused to refund because the suit's label said \"do not bleach\". Well, I told her I didn't bleach it, I went swimming in THEIR hot tub which is what swimsuits are made for. She couldn't help me though and it really put a damper on our trip! Well, I finally contacted corporate when we got back to Texas and dealt with a very nice man from the executive offices who refunded the price of my suit and offered us 2 nights free stay!

One night when we were watching a movie after a long day at Sea World our room suddenly smelled of cigarette smoke. We sniffed around our room and looked in the hallway outside our room and couldn't determine where the smell was coming from. A couple hours later our room smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke again. Once again we tried following our noses to figure out from whence the odor was emanating and couldn't find a thing. The next morning as we were preparing for the day our room reeked of the smoke. We went out into the hallway and saw someone exiting the stairwell which was just a few feet away and the scent of smoke followed him as he walked past. The next time we smelled the smoke in our room we quickly looked at the door to the stairs and saw the culprit smoking in the stairwell. At this point we called the front desk to complain that someone was smoking in the stairwell in this supposedly \"smoke-free\" establishment and each time he lit up the smoke was coming in through the vents in our room. We asked if something could be done to dissuade said smoker from infecting our lungs and we were told that while they do have a no smoking policy, it was not something they could/would enforce and, basically, it was too bad for us. We complained a couple more times when our friend lit up, but were always told the same thing--they just didn't have power to enforce their own rules. Seriously people.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. This is a non-smoking hotel located near everything. At first I had wanted to stay near the downtown area thinking there would be more going on but couldn't be happier with the location of this hotel. The hotel had a recent renovation and was very upscale. The Bistro had good food and while a tad pricey, the portions were large. Convenient computer area, wireless service, boarding pass printers and an area with tv and Wii gaming for the kids.The pool was just the right temperature and had towels available and there is a 24 hour fitness center. Our room was very modern we had a king bed and the mattress was excellent, it was so comfortable! We didn't use the maid service daily but she was always in the halls and gladly gave us anything we needed. Flat screen tv, refridgerator, coffee maker (Starbucks served downstairs) and plenty of outlets to plug in cell phones, laptops, etc. Only complaint would be the amount of closet/drawer space but we managed to make it work. Most places do not offer free parking and downtown there were places I researched that were up to $35 per night, this was $14 per night. You are able to jump on all the major road within a minute of leaving the hotel making it very easy to get to Sea World, Zoo, Balboa Park, Downtown, Beaches, Harbor. Also just the other side of the highway are many nice dining places and shopping at the Fashion Valley Mall. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend staying here for your trip as well.

The Marriott was a lovely choice. It is updated and modern and has fun, elegant touches everywhere you look. The bistro located off the lobby has pretty good food and a good happy hour. They have private televisions at a lot of the tables and a Wii set up for the families and children. They also serve Starbucks coffee. The 24 hour market in the lobby is also a nice touch. The fitness center is a dream. Loved it and want to go back just so I can work out in it. Pool was small but nice. On site guest laundry, business center and plenty of meeting rooms. The particular room I had was a wee bit small but the price was right so it was no biggie. Theres a coffee bar, a fridge, updated bathroom, flatscreen, a business desk with plenty of outlets for all your electronic items and a SUPER soft bed. CONS: As so many people have mentioned, one MAJOR issue is the 14.00 parking. I am from Los Angeles, the land of expensive parking, so I wasnt so shocked about this but for 14.00 I expect (AT LEAST) a secured, covered lot. This lot is not secured, (although they claim it is) and there are NO places to park your car in the shade during the vast majority of the day. So, most of the time you come out to a car that has been in direct sun and is 110 degrees inside. Why am I paying 14.00 a day for that??? [To management-- I get it, you need to make some money off of parking but, for what you are providing, 14.00/day is ENTIRELY too much money and it leaves people with a bad taste in their mouths and takes away from the fact that this is a fab hotel.]", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Ridiculous Parking Fee\u201d", "Author": "mimiKc", "ReviewID": "UR37404122", "Content": "I would be very upset if I paid full price for this room. I got them for $79 a night through priceline. Room is nicely decorated with modern contemporary decor. The 2 queen beds was more than enough room for 2 adults and one 10yr old. Overall I was pleaseed with our stay and would stay here again for the right price. Pros: Beds are soft and the swimming pool was nice Free Wifi Food-They have a place called the Bistro in the hotel that's open until 10pm, a bit pricey and they don't deliver to your room. The food tasted OK. HD flat panel Cons: $14 a day parking. We were told we needed our hotel key to gain entrance after 11pm as the lot is secured, we never once saw a guard or had to use our card to gain entry when coming in late. I think this fee should be eliminated if it is not truly a secured lot, especially for those paying $200 or more per night. Bathroom Sink-Drains really slow but it woudnt stop me from staying here. Bed bugs or Spiders-We slept in one bed instead of using both as the first 2 days 2 out of 3 of us had little bites on us. I think I was bitten by a spider as it swelled and stayed swollen our entire trip (7days) **This one makes me hesitant about staying again** Staff-Overall they were nice, but they seemed a little irritated when we called to tell them our house keeper failed to give us new bath towels. They promised to send someone up with towels and never did, we had to grab some from a housekeeper's cart that went by. She acted as if I was disturbing her when she picked up. Maybe because we booked through priceline.

Our trip was with friends & kids for two nights, visiting Sea World (twice), the Zoo, and a school trip to Balboa Park. For those of you considering both Sea World and the Zoo in one trip, the hotel is right in the middle of those attractions; with GPS driving time to either is only 10 minutes. Complaints about air conditioner noise - our's (at least) was in the room, not central air. Fans make some noise but we didn't hear any from neighboring rooms. Yeah, no, it is not a brand new, first class hotel but you aren't paying for that either. The elevators work fine now, everything was clean, the pool & spa was a pleasant surprise, and the staff was friendly and efficient (i.e. can we have more pillows). You can use one of those wheelie carts for luggage without having to tip a Bellman, so that makes up for parking and counts for Marriott points. If the hotel is gulty of anything, it is probably for trying to be something for everyone - the Bistro, open area business center, bar and sitting areas all being together on one side of the lobby.

Well, can't let a little thing like that get in the way of love. I took a shower, and noticed the screws attaching the holder to the tile wall were starting to rust already. Some were missing caps. I used the toilet, and noticed the seat was the cheap thin plastic kind. I started to wonder... is the honeymoon already over? How long will the renovation last? As the night wore on, I realized this love affair cannot go on. I started to hear my neighbors talking. Yes, I could hear their conversations. Not a good sign. At around 10PM, my adjacent neighbors in room 915 were in the mood for, shall I say, romance. Without getting into details, let me just say that I could hear EVERYTHING! Later, my other neighbors in room 919.... well, you get the point. In the end, this was a one night stand for me. I need much more than a pretty face for a lasting relationship.

I love how they completely updated the decor inside and out, everything is very modern and contemporary looking now, Plus the addition of the Bistro in the lobby is excellent. The thing I love most about this hotel is the rooms, everything is very spaced out from the moment you walk in the door. The beds are very comfortable, the linens and carperting are always clean, along with the bathroom being completely spotless. I love the fact that there is a mini fridge in the room. Plus i love the fact that they added a flat panel television into every room, with some free HD channels as a bonus. The desk is great and I think the panel built into the wall to connect your computer to the television is an amazing idea, I want one in my own house. Also the cabinent they chose for the housing of the television/ desk/ lighting is really unique and I think looks great. The bathroom is spacious enough, although my only complaint is while the air conditioning is controlled through a remote unit, it is still an old fashioned air conditioner and not built in, meaning it is suprisingly loud and when on automatic setting turns on and off at randoms times waking me in the middle of the night. However becasue the room is so nice I can put up with it. The little restaurant they have downstairs called \"Bistro\" is great, I wen't down there one morning expecting to find extremely overpriced food and was pleasantly suprised to see somewhat reasonable prices on good portion of food. I had their breakfast sandwich with a side of fruit and it was delicious, especially the fresh fruit. The lobby itself looks great and I like that their is a main entrance in the front, plus an additional entrance in the rear allowing people who parked in the rear of the building easy access in and out. The only thing I wasn't too fond of was that they charged a parking fee of $14 a night. I understand that at the Doubletree because it's underground parking and patrolled, however here at the Courtyard it's outside parking and I doubt they hire someone to patrol it. There is a security gate however but I doubt thats doing much work, every time I drive in and out no matter what time at night the gate is always open. The staff was pretty good overall, I have stayed here a couple of times and the first time I was waiting in line at check in and as soon as one of the clerks freed up I started to walk up to check in, however I was cut in front of by an employee so she may purchase a snacked good, I figured i would just tell the manager, however as the associate left the clerk was standing at the computer so I walked up to check in and without saying a word she just turned around and went in some office. 5 or so minutes later she came out and before I could ask to see her manager because of the way I was ignored I glanced at her nametag and it said manager. That is unacceptable behavior by any employee to ignore guests, and it's worse when it's the manager doing it. Managers need to be re-evaluated for customer service skills. On the other hand the other few times I have stayed at this hotel the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. It is becasue of the room quality and the overall staff friendless that I will return to this hotel, if I had to be checked in by that manager each time I would definitely stay elsewhere.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cStarbucks in lobby a big++++\u201d", "Author": "chuck50", "ReviewID": "UR28991185", "Content": "This hotel has a great staff especially at the Bistro and having Starbucks so handy was a great plus for a business traveler BUT honestly $14.00 a day for parking!!!
