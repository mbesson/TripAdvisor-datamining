I thought we were arriving to the right station but then a couple of days before going to the hotel, i realised that we were arriving at gare de nord and the big train station next to the hotel was Gare Montparnasse train station. So if your coming in by train or plane or what so, remember to plan it right although if arriving near Gare Montparnasse then it should be alright. Ok so we arrived at Gare Nord and luckily the train line we were catching went to Gare Montparnasse subway station so we caught that. although upon arriving and not having GPS or google map, it was hard to find which was to go, luckily i did some print outs of how to get to the hotel. From the subway station to the hotel, you need to walk a good 20 minutes and you walk around Gare Montparnasse train station to the back (not sure if you can go through the station but you should i think) and then you get to the hotel. Arrived at the hotel and because it was late, we had to use the intercom to get in and they asked our names and we got in, interesting and i guess i was pleased by some form of security by the hotel. so we checked in and got our room keys and was streamless. We also got free wifi which was cool too. Got to our room and then realised whilst I requested a high floor, i should have asked a room facing the eiffel tower coz that would have been cool but we were facing the train tracks which was ok i guess but anyway. The room itself is spacious, just have a look at the photos. An interesting thing to note was that the toilet was by itself and not within the bathroom so after you do your business, you would need to go to the bathroom to wash your hands. The bed was comfy although the pillows were smaller than usual and they kinda were squarish but was suffice. The bathroom is new and the shower section was small but good water pressure. The hotel is close to the eiffel tower and whilst we only stayed 2 nights, on our day out, we managed to walk to the eiffel tower although it was probably a good hour walk i think. Overall no issues with this hotel apart from maybe the location but its within paris so its all good. If i come back to Paris, i wouldn't mind staying at this hotel but of course i'd try somewhere new just to try something different.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rogers, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat for Us\u201d", "Author": "Courtney G", "ReviewID": "UR123016224", "Content": "We love to walk, so the location was fine for us- probably 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and 10 minutes or less to restaurants.

Booked by mistake as I meant to book the Concorde which is the same rating and miles better. We were 3 sharing a room and it was terribly crowded. You could open the bathroom door from bed. Seperate bathroom and shower which we thought was great at first until we discovered there was no wash basin in the toilet :-S. There was a long queue at breakfast every morning with a 15-20minute or longer wait. We were told breakfast was from 7-9:30am. On the last morning we got to breakfast about 8:30, we got a table at 9, the staff made a remark that breakfast was over around 9:15 and the bacon,sausuages and many other items were not replenished. At 9:30 or soon after a number of people were coming to breakfast. A terrible argument broke out and the manager was called as the staff refused to let people in to breakfast but there were told breakfast ended at 11. Lots of confusion at this place. Staff dont seem to know whats going on. Other points: Dont attempt to take the train to the hotel at night unless you know exactly where you are going as it can be quite confusing from the train station. Get a tourist travel card for the trains and buses is you stay longer than 2 days and write the details on the card holder. It makes using the public transport easier Check online for information about museums as I have noticed on numerous occassions that they seem to close at random. The Louvre was closed on Tuesday for no reason leaving many peoples plans ruined. Always check weather conditions when going to the Eiffel tower as the lift to the top closes if the wind is too strong so you can only get as far as the second floor (still worth going to). All the information about the creation of the Eiffel Tower is on the first floor so dont skip this on your way down. Close (ish) to this hotel on Maine Street (behind the Gare Montparnasse station from hotel) is a tiny bistro, think its called St George, its next to a Chinese resturant.

To put things in perspective I'm use to staying in both hostels and 5 star hotels, you usually get what you pay for in my experience. However, this hotel does definitely not live up to its four star categorization. Firstly the room was smaller than the 3star I stayed in the night before. The only difference between this hotel room and the 3star was the tiny bottles of shampoo/conditioner and shower gel (which smelled amazing) and the rather cheap plastic kettle in the room. Not exactly what I was expecting, but I just shrugged it off. If you get the elevator to 7th floor the view of the Tour Eiffel is spectacular at night. The second thing that I thought was quiet odd for a four star was the fact that the room obviously was not properly cleaned during our stay. We were only there for three nights so I suppose some people wouldn't think this was too bad, but after spilling some tea on a bed sheet the first night it was easy to determine that even that sheet wasn't changed. Thirdly, which for me was the most important, was the service. Most people that I mentioned it too when I returned just rolled their eyes and said \"They're French.\" I really disagree with this stereotype as we found the people on the street to be very helpful and polite. I purposely choose to stay in a hotel with a four star rating as I was paying for the service more than anything else. I had never been to this part of Paris before and felt I would get more assistance in a four star hotel than a cheaper option. With this in mind, I did ask the people at reception 2 questions, one about the closest metro stop, one about taxi's to the airport/Paris Nord train station. Both times I was met with an attitude of indifference and I was made feel like I had no business asking them questions like this as it's \"not their job\". Emphasis on 'I was made feel like', nobody actually said this too me. I know I'm probably comparing it to my 5star experiences at bit, but I honestly feel that the service in the 3 star hotels was much more welcoming and helpful. I felt I had to write this review as the positive reviews listed here did definitely not reflect my experience. It's an OK hotel, don't pay four star prices for it.

Hotel prices in Paris are ridiculous, so when I found this online by hunting out the best price and got it for \u00a3125.00 GBP I was very pleased with myself. I took tips from prior reviewers and we found the hotel behind the Gare Montparnasse station easily enough; you can actually walk through a shortcut to get into the front of the train station from the hotel once you get your bearings, and then there's another few minutes walk to the Metro part of the station. So really the hotel is situated pretty close to public transport (we took Metro from Gare du Nord into Gare Montparnasse = 15 minutes tops, then walked around the side of the Montparnasse station for maybe another 5-10 minutes to get to hotel). Our room was spotlessly clean, really and truly, which is very important for us. It seemed recently refurbished and we didn't see any of the usual wear and tear you find in hotels. Both beds had fabulous mattresses (even the sofa bed), and spotlessly clean and comfortable/cotton sheets. Bathroom fixtures were of high quality, walk-in shower was superb, and sink very modern and swish. Again, bathroom was spotless. The room was a good size and had flat screen TV, mini-fridge (with complementary bottle of water: nice touch!), and coffee/tea-making tray. A prior reviewer complained about the view, and yes, when we pushed the curtains to the side we were facing a car park, but we weren't there to look at that, were we! We checked in on Saturday lunchtime, went out to sightsee and didn't return until 9pm that night, then had a brilliant sleep (after using very quick and courteous room service at 11pm for 2 glasses of wine). Our only complaint would be the price of the breakfast, which is \"free\" for kiddies but 15 euros for adults. It was a gorgeous breakfast, with almost everything you could wish for (eggs, bacon, sausages, crepes, breads & pastries, cereals, fruits, etc) and was truly delicious, but at the end of the day you could quite happily walk out to a nearby cafe for much less money and have just as nice a breakfast. So overall I'd highly recommend this hotel if you want a very clean budget-friendly and well-located hotel in Paris, with easy access to the Metro and all the sights.

To be honest, I couldn't be happier!! This hotel is excellent in so many ways: 1. Location: Located in a very convenient area where it's easily accessed by metro and bus. The walk from the metro station (Pasteur) to the hotel is around 6 minutes. If one chooses to take the air france bus #4 from CDG to the hotel, the walk is just around 7 minutes. I would recommend that if you have a lot of luggage. The hotel is also situated closely to bus stations that simply take you to most areas of Paris (such as sacred ceour, St. Germaine des Pres, Louvre, Seine river, Bastile, L'opera etc) For those who loves to bike, the velib station is just located outside the hotel, you can bike to many places from there! 2. Room: Our room is situated on the 6/F, though it's close to the elevator, it was quiet, spacious, and clean. Bathroom and toilet are separated, but it works out perfectly. Everything is great in the room! 3. Service: Staff are really nice and friendly. Also very helpful in many ways. The only down side about the service is the housekeeping staff keep entering the room despite the Do No Disturb sign was up. They did it for a few times. 4. Food: I didn't eat at the hotel at all, but there are quite some choices around the area, one of them is called La Salle a manager (something like that), that's right next to the metro station. 17.9 Euro for a fixed price 2 course meal. The food was very decent. Great service too! Also, the famous Pierre Herme is just next to the metro as well!

Note the shower was a typical shower stall (e.g. North American style) versus a tub with a shower head and a partial shower curtain more consistent with some of the older hotels in Paris. Our room had a mini fridge, a safe and a reasonably sized flat screen tv. We were able to manage the temperature of the room to our level of comfort through the heating/air conditioning system. We also had a window that we could open a few inches to allow fresh air in. Overall the room worked well for the two of us. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and housekeeping did a good job each day keeping our room clean. There's a computer in the lobby with free internet access that you can use for twenty minutes at a time (regulated by software that countsdown and then logs you off if you don't do it yourself). The hotel offers free wifi but I only managed to get it to work and connect with a strong enough signal in the lobby. There's a restaurant in the lobby, we had dinner there one night and my daughter and I both found our meals to be pretty bland. There are lots of other options within walking distance (4 to 5 blocks) in different directions. As some other guests have mentioned there is scent in the lobby area. We noticed misters against the wall that would shoot out streams of fragranced mist. It wasn't an issue for us but I can see that it could be a problem for some people who are sensitive to these sorts of things. The hotel is a little ouf of the way but if you are willing to walk a couple of blocks to get to the Metro then Paris is at your beck and call. We did a lot of metro riding (get one of the multi day passes for good value) and saw many areas of Paris. In terms of getting to or from the hotel we rode the Metro (subway) from Charles de Gaulle airport having to make 1 transfer along the way to get to the hotel. The nearest Metro stations (Pasteur, Montparnasse Bienvenue) are about 3 to 4 blocks away. For those who want a more direct route to/from the hotel to the airport, Air France runs a bus service (16.5 euros one way, cheaper for a return ticket) that drops off/picks up about 3 blocks from the hotel.

We had an issue with bathroom shower stall leaking water, but, when reported they sent the person right away and we were not ready for him. Another point is that the hotel staff just barge in instead of knocking and waiting for response - am not sure if it is cultural. The room, though small, did accomodate two adults and two young children (under 12). I am not sure it is the practice but the toilet and bathroom are separate - meaning you need to literally walk around to the bathroom as there is no wash basin in the toilet. Depending on whether you are a clean/washing type person, this can be a pain! Not sure why they have it that way! The general location is in a quieter neighborhood.

I too was there for business, which is the only reason I'd stay somewhere so modern and sterile. It may be lacking in character and soul (to the point that you won't even be aware you're in Paris!), but this is a big, efficient and comfortable hotel to stay in. The rooms are well appointed, spotlessly clean, and there's free wi-fi if you want it. Work commitments also meant that I ate in the restaurant there for 2 nights in a row. It's not a nice dining environment (the lights are VERY bright in there), but the food was OK. It's not somewhere I'd want to eat if it wasn't being paid for on expenses, but the steaks are pretty tasty, and there's a good wine list. I'd also point out that there's not a lot of restaurants within easy walk of this hotel, so you should do some homework of where to eat before you get there. The breakfasts are expensive (a 15 euro buffet with a limited choice of food) and not great quality, so I'd recommend that you find yourself somewhere else for coffee and croissants in the morning. The hotel is more or less part of the massive Montparnasse railway station, and surrounded by modern, characterless sprawl. So don't come here to be in the heart of culture or to see the more romantic side of Paris. And you're quite a long way from the best parts of Paris out here. A couple of minor niggles: the staff are a little arrogant and not particuarly helpful. I asked if they could book a taxi for an hour's time, and they refused. They told me to come back ten minutes before I needed one. That may be ok to them, but if you HAVE to be at a meeting at a particular time, it's a little scary to cut it that fine. Also, the lifts need your room key to activate them. This really got on my nerves in the end. All in all though, it's a comfortable if functional place to stay.

Compared to the north of England beer and food prices were universally expensive in Paris, you just have to grin and bare the 7+ euros per pint. Only disappointment with the hotel was breakfast which was poor and expensive. Try one of the cafes near Montparnasse station or Pasteur station for breakfast. This was our first time in Paris and I would recommend the Tour Montparnasse as a must for a great view of Paris. About 10 euros to go to the top floor and get access to the roof. Less queues (actually none when we went at 10am on a Monday) than the Eiffel Tower with equally good view. Visit the Louvre, which is great even if like, me, you are not a regular in art galleries. I suggest you get a ticket from the Tobacconists in the shopping centre that you go through to get to the Louvre entrance Rue de Rivoli from the Palais Royal - Mus\u00e9e du Louvre metro station.(or the machines in the same shopping centre.)

I recommend some of the brasserias on the way to the trainstation or directly at gare montparnasse. Even after the hotel there was a nice restaurant (croque madame was the meal name - very famous in france). The public transport system is very good. On every corner a metro station. We took also the taxi sometimes. But we advice you to keep small money in your wallet. They never could give back money on a 50 euro bank note. The taxi drivers even often don't know common routes or they wanted to cheat on us. If you call a taxi by phone or on the reception they charge you also the way to the pick up place (in our case 7 euro). All in all we were very satisfied to stay in that hotel. The bed was very good - even the safe helped us a lot. If you stay in a room with balcony (7th floor) you have free internet access too instead of 20 euro / day - you can use internet near the reception desk for free on a mac computer but as we have seen it was never available due to other users.

I recommend following the exit signs and then find the way to the hotel at street level and enjoy seeing some of the Montparnasse area as you walk to the hotel. Also metro line 6 Pasteur station was nearby. Enjoyed line 6 because it is elevated, so you are outside instead of underground most of the time. Line 6 will also take you to the Eiffel tower.

The hotel is generally very nice - modern furniture and a rather contemporary look and feel. Upon check-in, the staff was very courteous and professional. We arrived shortly before the noon check-in, but were not allowed to check-in early. We were, however, allowed to leave our luggage in the locked side office until our room was ready, so we used the time to walk around the neighborhood and get acquainted with what was nearby (which is A LOT in terms of coffee shops, restaurants, and the mall - which is one of the 'Gallerie Lafayette' shopping centers). When we did check-in, we were given a room on the second floor which was pleasantly clean and presentable. Linens were plentiful and we were generally overall happy with the accomodation. Interestingly, the room had two separate bathroom areas. The first was the actual toilet room, which was immediately to the right upon entering the hotel room. The other, the bathing room (equipped with full shower, sink, and tub) was in the general vacinity of the bedroom area. Although we are not traditionally accustomed to this set-up, we assumed it to be characteristic of the hotels in Paris. Compared to other hotel room stays, we found the room to be on the smaller end in size, so the separation of the two bathroom areas was not all too bothersome. Our only negative observation - which we had read about in another review - was that the shower door did not close properly. It appeared as if it had not been properly installed. It was difficult to close at times and it leaked water out onto the bathroom floor. We did not dine in the hotel restaurant, but we did frequent the bar area and were pleased with the drink selection as well as the late-night appetizer/tapas menu. The bar staff was courteous and the environment friendly. We did have breakfast in the restaurant area on our second day; however, we did not particularly care for our experience or the selection of food. In researching our stay at this hotel, we were aware that many of the guests are on business-related trips, as the hotel is in a financial/business district. As such, most of the quests staying at the hotel were on business, but we did find other guests traveling on vacation, as well as families with small children. In any case, upon coming down for breakfast on the second morning, we waited in line as the maitre d' seated guests in the restaurant area. Our turn came up in line, but rather than seating us, the maitre d' turned to a number of guests to our right and sat them beforehand. These folks were clearly dressed in business attire whereas my husband and I were more dressed down. I mentioned to the maitre d' that I didn't think it was very courteous of him to have seated others before us when we had clearly been waiting in line. He said he understood my concern, but then added that there was no need to make an issue of it. I thought otherwise, and later mentioned the incident at the front desk. The receptionist was very understanding and apologetic and offered to remove the charges for breakfast. She even made a point to say that the hotel treats all guests the same, whether they are on business or not. As for the breakfast, we were not entirely impressed with the selection and would highly recommend stopping at one of the many creperies or coffee shops in Paris as the selection tends to be plentiful and more characteristic of Paris. Lastly worth mentioning is that, one of the best features of this hotel is that it is located right next to the Gare Montparnesse which has easy train and metro access. Literally, almost every metro line can be picked up here. We were comforted in knowing how easy it was to travel about Paris and how accessible we were to this main hub. It definitely gave us a good feeling in knowing that we could get anywhere we needed to go in the city, without having to be directly in the center of Paris. If we were to return to Paris, we would highly consider staying at this hotel again. The accomodations were pleasing and the location was very convenient. If you are looking to stay here, we recommend booking directly through the Novotel's website.

I booked the hotel via their website and ordered a cot for our daughter. My booking this hotel was based on reading good reviews from other visitors. On arrival our impressions were mixed. The location is reasonable, but even though it is close to the departure end of Montparnasse SNCF station, the metro is a very lengthy 20 minute walk from the hotel through a packed station. Also, it is not on the RER line so travel across Paris to Gare du Nord can take about half an hour, not including the walk from hotel to metro. The receptionist was very much the pushy salesman, buttering us up by offering our daughter a cuddly toy and then giving her two (even though he gave two to every child!), then pushing their loyalty card on us with a big sales pitch about it all. It took ages to just check in and get to our room when we were all very tired. On both occasions there was no cot in the room and none forthcoming when asked, despite having booked this in advance. The website gave the impression that the hotel was very child friendly and that there was a play area in the hotel for young children, however, there was no such play area. The room was small with not that much storage space for clothes, but luckily we were only staying one night. We were told on the website that there was unlimited tea and coffee, but found in the room just one sachet of coffee and one very small sachet of milk, not even enough for one person to have one drink! Also, the cups were two of the most revolting plastic containers I've ever seen; I didn't even realise they were cups at first! Not what one expects from this class of hotel, especially as staying in a Mercure (supposedly a lower class of hotel) in Calais the night before we had a lot of coffee sachets and very nice real mugs. The Novotel also had no minibar, just a small bottle of water in the fridge. There was WIFI in the room but a payable service. There was a terminal in the lobby that was free to use for twenty minutes at a time. The one good thing about the hotel was the breakfast, which was varied, with cereals, fruit, cold meat, bacon, eggs and sausage etc., although no better than any other hotel we've stayed in. It did cost 16 euros each though! All in all we were not that impressed and won't stay there again, or in a Novotel. It just wasn't up to the standards one would expect from that class of hotel charging the high rate we paid for each night. There are also better located hotels nearer the RER lines as well as the metro if you want to enjoy Paris and get round quickly. The location was fine for us as we were travelling from Montparnasse SNCF station the next morning.

The room was lovely and the kids fold out beds were ideal for them as they're just kids and that's what they're designed for, there was a mini fridge and safe and TV / internet etc. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment but it's location is a 20 min walk to the eiffel tower which can be seen from 50yds from the hotel, the GARE MONTPARNASSE (Main railway station)and metro is about 100 metres away unless you choose PASTEUR metro stop which is a 5 to 10 min stroll which is fine for kids too. We really had no complaint at all with this hotel. They even allowed late check out without any quibble and we'd definetly stay again if we needed to visit paris again. The only minor thing I could pick them up on is we gave them 3 bits of luggage and only received 1 tag which I questioned, when returning our luggage was all still there so no problems but i suppose it could of been had a bag disappeared, however, that said if that's all I can complain about then I'm happy !!!, this was a really nice find in paris.

I give an A++ for cleanliness no doubt. The location puts you in a quiet area but yet easily accessible. It's in the mid-point of almost all spots you would want to see when you're in Paris. Like almost everything else there, you'll need to exercise your legs since you'll be walking alot. Familiarize yourself with the map and you'll see.

The bed was comfortable but as seems to be usual practice in some European hotels, the pillows were rubbish!! We managed to get a good early rate deal from Novotel's website for this trip which included breakfast. There was a selection of hot and cold self serve buffet food, but I don't think it warranted the individual breakfast price for those who wish to pay extra. The location was good - very quiet. After a couple of days we figured out which railway station exit to use - head for the Port Oceane exit followed by the signs for Vaugirard 3 - this exit brings you out 50 yards from the hotel. Alternatively, the elusive 'back way' from the railway station at Vaugirard opens directly onto the back door of the hotel - great if you can find it.

I did not appreciate mildew in the bathroom, as well as a dainky look of the chair and carpet. The next day things looked a little better, as house keeping touched up a little. Although the room looks futuristic it simply was to too small for me and my wife - especially the bath room which lead to a regular fight with splashes of water mounting into a puddle. The bed was ok, a bit too soft, but linen was changed daily - so no complaints after all. BREAKFAST was a real dissapointment! The selection is rather basic and lacks of fresh fruit and vegetables. You find croissants, white bread, eggs, bacon, sausages, youghurts, ham and cheese. Nothing really for the \"organic-lover\". The breakfast room was messy and slightly chaotic.
