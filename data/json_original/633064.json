Plenty of space, lots of light, a fully equipped, functioning kitchen. Big bathroom. The bedroom layout was fun. The appartment faced inwards, so no great views but nice and calm. But there were all sorts of small issues that were individually irrelevant, but jointly surprisingly annoying: when we arrived, there was no bed linen at all. There were pubes in the bathroom, though otherwise the place was clean. We had to pay for internet access. When leaving, the porters couldn't give us a receipt. We had to leave at 11, but they didn't want to keep our luggage anywhere until our flight. They told us to go to one of the train stations, but those were quite out of our way, so we had to lug our things about. Overall still great and good value, though.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMy Berlin Experience\u201d", "Author": "bikerjoe123", "ReviewID": "UR120510434", "Content": "My 1st visit to Berlin and to TopDomizil Apartments and certainly won't be my last.

The apartment was in a good location, located in Mitte just off Friedrichestrasse, which turned out to be a major shopping street and near to the Stadmitte underground (on the U6 line - don't leave at the U2 exit like we did at first. Those subway stations are HUGE and you have a long walk ahead of you!) There is also a supermarket around the corner and a Kaisers (decent supermarket) 2 small blocks away. It is also 2 blocks from Checkpoint Charlie and the Martin-Gropius-Bau musemu/gallery - one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever seen. The apartment itself was very clean and tidy on arrival with most of the basics you would require - (copious) towels, handwash and toiler paper in the bathroom; plates, cutlery and pans in the kitchen and bedding in the bedrooms. There was also a kettle, TV and DVD player, coffee machine, vacuum cleaner, ironing board and iron and a hair dryer. The apartment was a nice size for the 2 of us and the furniture was reasonably new and comfortable to use. The apartment was quite warm, which is good for some/bad for others I guess. A bit warm for us, but we coped with the balcony door open in the evening, but over-heated at night. This was during mild weather (16-18 degrees C). Now for the niggles: - the kettle and DVD player didn't work when we arrived. Nothing major since we aren't tea/coffee drinkers, but we did get a DVD one night and were disappointed to watch the player open and close randomly for 5 minutes - there was no welcome pack or information about, for example, what to do in the event of a fire (surely illegal in the EU? It would be a problem in the UK), where to dispose of rubbish (our under-sink bin was a bit ripe after 5 days in a hot flat), where to recycle cardboard/bottles, etc. Basic information that would have been really helpful to our stay. That's about it really. Nothing major, but it would have made a difference if everything worked and we had some basic information about the day-to-day running of the flat. I hope the management will address these points (I have fed back to them directly) and then I would be happy to give them 5 stars.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "pakistan", "Title": "\u201cgood apartment\u201d", "Author": "tanveerul", "ReviewID": "UR116289735", "Content": "Our family (2adults and 2 children) stayed in wallstrabe management suite for 3 nights in July 2011. The apartment was of very good size with separate one bed room having additional TV. The lounge / living room area was big with sofa bed and an additional sofa. The apartment was very clean. The kitchen was very well equipped with dishwasher but no microwave. Wifi was good but charged 5 Euro per day. Apartment price was reasonable. The area was quiet and little cut off from the down town but easily reachable via metro (few steps) to almost entire city. It is 6th floor but elevator was fast. Good views of the city from the windows. Large TV screen with DVD player and Mp3 and speakers. Negative features were, no answer whatsoever on email queries at the time of booking and later on. If the windows are open, millions of mosquitoes entered into the apartment and the ceiling is all full of them. We got afraid to see them on the first night and rang the person who made the check in but he said, call the office tomorrow. Fortunately, the mosquitoes never bit to any one of us. One should keep insecticides before entering into this apartment.

The apartment was fully-furnished and had nice decor, internet access and even a big-screen TV in the corner waiting to be set up. The kitchen was fully-equipped but unfortunately we didn't stay long enough to make use of it. Very spacious and nice, clean bathroom. Bad point - although there are air conditioning dials etc on the walls, there is actually no air-conditioning and so the apartment became quite hot at night (in July, when it was 36 degrees during the day!) and therefore we didn't sleep all that well. Although the apartments were in a quieter area of town, the U-Bahn was so convenient it was easy to get to the centre of town, and it was only a 15-20 minute walk to Checkpoint Charlie anyway.
