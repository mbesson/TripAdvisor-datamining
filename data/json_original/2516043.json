Located off the 405 fwy at the Ventura Fwy this hotel offers a very comfortable stay for the business or casual traveler or someone wanting to stay on Ventura Blvd in \"the Valley\". The rooms are clean and the well appointed. Big screen TV but it needs TIVO, coffee maker that should have instant coffee VIA instant instead of cheap coffee drip maker and paper cups. The rooms are not energy efficient.. they should make it so that you have to use your room card to activate lights and have to take the card out when you leave room.. which then turns off the lights....the fridge overheats under the counter so make sure you crank it to high if you want your beer cold. The gym is nice with a large TV and also individual TV on all machines. There is a large sun splashed deck and pool with a view south of Encino hills and the 405 Fwy. There is secure parking in the building and in/out access. The house staff is very nice,multi-lingual and the great service has the Marriott courtyard touch. The lobby is elegant and attractive, with a business center. The restaurant serves a nice breakfast for about $15. There is a lobby bar with big screen for sports but no happy hour and I would strongly recommend nice jazz music and even dancing in the lounge, because there is no nightlife or fun bars in the area. I saw Jim Simpson the famous sports announcer and his ABC crew. There in internet access. The paintings on the wll have nothing to do with LA life. The higher floors are accessed only with room card. The valley view rooms have a scenic view of the 405 Fwy interchange and in the morning before the smog you can see the entire valley to the mountain ranges. There is really nothing for entertainment in the Encino wastelands.. it is Ventura Blvd urban sprawl if you know what I mean. There is a Whole Foods nearby and you can easily walk 2 blocks under the fwy to the Sherman Oaks Galleria for movies at the Arclight and great happy hour dining @ Cheesecake Factory (4-6), El Torito Grill (4-8) or PF Changs (3-6). I would say walk because you get charged $10 for each hour you go over your 3 hour movie validation.. East toward Sherman Oaks has many nice restaurants. Marmalade and Mel's diner are great for BK, Fatburger is the best burger in LA, there is an In-N-Out, Izakaya on Ventura Blvd for Sushi is A+. Blue Dog is an excellent sports bar and burger grill... on the side street behind the Whole Foods parking lot. West on Ventura Blvd. is a Ralphs, high end Farfalla Italian restaurant and the only Starbucks in Encino. I did not like the homeless parking their shopping carts and smoking on the patio.. it messed up the aroma of my Kona Clover. If you have the guts and love seafood buffet.. Highly recommend Hokkaido seafood buffet...that is best buffet I have ever eaten at... just yummmy.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belvederian", "Title": "\u201cExcellent business traveler hotel\u201d", "Author": "Belvederian", "ReviewID": "UR129038652", "Content": "Service was prompt, friendly and efficient.

However, if one looks at a map, one will find that there are almost no hotels in this price range that are not located where they are subject to traffic noise. I stayed in the Hampton Inn on Sepulveda in Sherman Oaks in August and thought that noise was coming from Sepulveda. No! It's the 405. And on the other side of town, it could be any one of a number of different freeways. There is simply no escaping it. We were on the south side of the building 9 stories up and the noise, though constant, would peak in the early morning hours between 5:30 am and 7:30 am. The big trucks on the highway there make a ton of noise. But, since every other hotel in this price range has the same problem, it kind of cancels it out for me. The room did not smell bad. Housecleaning was thorough. Anything we needed, like toilet paper or shampoo was provided almost instantaneously. The lobby is large and nicely decorated. There is a bar area that was very convenient too. The staff at the front desk was always very helpful. When we checked in, there was a slight problem with the room. It was corrected and we were in a different room in less than two minutes. The elevators are FAST. This is especially helpful in getting in and out. We parked and while parking is expensive, again, its expensive everywhere. The parking garage was very convenient. I used the pool and spa and enjoyed it quite a bit. While the noise is always there and you can see the freeway, you can also see some mountains. The pool is heated just enough to make swimming possible in winter. (We were here in January.) The spa was clean and had strong jets. The beds were very comfortable and we had ample pillows. The TV was nice too. We stayed for 5 nights and will stay there again when we go to visit. While the location next to the freeway is not ideal because of the noise, it does make it very convenient to get wherever you want to go--as long as you don't want to go there during rush hour! I would also encourage the hotel to do something about the thermostat. It was frustrating that the unit could not simply be turned off. I didn't like it cycling on and off during the night.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sevierville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cQuiet Gem in Sherman Oaks,CA\u201d", "Author": "viappc", "ReviewID": "UR122633225", "Content": "This relatively small Marriott property, is very well maintained, and the staff is very professional.

The sound from the air conditioning unit was noticeable, but was not more noisy then most hotels I've stayed at. The beds were very comfortable, the room was clean, & the bathroom was a decent size. The front desk lady, Gema, was very professional & check-in was very easy. The hotel had also noted my request for a quieter room and also accommodated my request for a late check-out.

I always do reviews before I stay or eat anywhere but this is the first time I actually took the time to write a review. PROS: When I checked in staff at desk were very courteous and room key was ready --took less than 5 Min.Although I requested high floor I was given mid range. I was worried because I know in LA rooms are given away without a second thought even when you have reservations this was not the case at this hotel Loved that they had free ue of computer and printer. This was very important to me as I dont' like to tavel with my computer with all the new regulations in terms of flying and paying for luggage. I had to go to front desk twice for just general things --every time I was greeted and helped immediately. Security at parking garage always greeted me with smile, very helpful and seemed genuine. Convenient to CSUN, airport and anywhere I needed to go in the LA area as I am relocating so I was all over the place searching for apt. Housekeeping was very good, when we arrived room was clean and everyday she/he did a good job. I asked for more towels and was promptly brought to my room. I always check every inch of roon when /i check in--bedroom, sheets, bathroom etc all was in good order. Parking is cheap (15 day) and you can come and go as you like with no worries as there is a security guard always on duty and you need a card to access guest floors (felt very safe) Doors locked after hours, need card for entry --again felt very safe Free coffee and fresh cookies both very good and to my surprise the coffee was always hot! Walked to Sherman Oaks Galleria to movies and dinner --very convenient CONS: Two things that are most important cleanliness and condition of the bed and the shower/tub. Bathroom tub needs updating. Paint was chipping, some rust visible and there is no fan in bathroom, In terms of fan it was better than looking up and seeing a dirty vent that is never clean--on the other hand got a lot of steam after shower.
