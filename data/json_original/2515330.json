For such a nice hotel the ($60 one time fee) for our stay was well worth it to us to bring our dog. The beds.....oh the beds...lovely, with all the plush pillows and comforters......we slept great and even took a nap. Rather than using the valet parking for the night ($39 per night) we chose to park right across the street since we have a large F250 pickup and paid for 24 hours only $20 dollars where the machine accepted either cash or debit.

Very friendly and helpful front desk staff made sure everything was satisfactory. We were upgraded to a suite which was a nice perk. Some minor quibbles: like in many other old hotels, the bathroom was small; we were on the second floor above the entrance and noise and unwanted light were problems (we had to keep the bathroom door closed to keep out light but were unable to close the drapes in the bedroom) and there is an underlying odour (more in the halls, less in the rooms).

The couple chose The Sorrento as one of two in which they had blocks of rooms (the other was the Four Seasons). I had several questions in the weeks before the arrival, and the staff was always very knowledgeable and helpful, making dinner reservations for me the first night at the Hunt Club, and arranging for transportation back to the airport (I had made my own arrival arrangements). The car service they offer was a great help. Reservations can only be made the day you need the car, but both Friday and Saturday I was able to book the car for two trips each day (morning and afternoon, not evenings). On Friday, they figured out for me where a courthouse was located. The drivers were always prompt and friendly. You can call for a pick-up to return to the hotel, but not book a return. If the car is available, they will come get you. I used cabs or rode with friends and family on my return trips. I also used the safety deposit boxes, which are available 24/7. There is no private room, you access your box directly at the front desk. The room key is electronic, but rather than being a key card, it resembles a flash drive, and has a rather large tag on it. The combo of the tag and the key itself made it too large to fit into an evening purse. I don't know the purpose of the tag as there was neither a room number nor the hotel name on it. The key itself would've been small enough to fit in my purse. The Beauty Bar which is shown as being in the hotel is actually a spa at the Fairmont Olympic a few blocks away. I used them for a make-up session before the wedding as I was to be in formal family pictures that night. The Hunt Club was a bit noisy, with music playing from overhead speakers. When being seated, I asked to be moved away from an overhead speaker and they accommodated me. At my new table there was a group of 6 older guests next to me who because of hearing problems and issues with hearing aids were having great difficulties conversing. When they brought the problem to the attention of the hostess, they were moved to an adjacent room in the restaurant where it was much quieter, which I thought was a nice touch. I had a problem with the flapper valve in the toilet not closing properly the first day, but when I called to report it, it was fixed within two hours. Pretty good! Others have mentioned issues with the HVAC system. It is the older kind, controlled by a unit under the window, with no thermostat, just different fan speeds and and dial for warmer or cooler temperatures. It took a bit of experimenting, but I was finally able to adjust it to my satisfaction. However, I would suggest at their next renovation that they upgrade to a thermostat system. A small quibble was the location of the full-length mirror, which was hung in the darkest corner of the room, next to the walk-in closet, so the door to the closet blocked the mirror when it was opened. Even with all lights on and with light from the windows (not much from the windows in gray, rainy Seattle!), it was difficult to see. I suggested to them that it be hung instead inside the very large walk-in closet (almost a small room), which is very well lit. I had requested a room on the side of the hotel away from the main entrance and the hospitals nearby. I don't know if it was just a quiet weekend, but I never heard a single siren from ambulances. Wireless internet service was free and had a very fast connection. For breakfast and lunch I ate at the Corner Cafe across the street, which has very reasonable prices and the food is quite good. You also can buy bakery items there (breakfast rolls and cookies). I thought both breakfast and lunch were a bit overpriced at the hotel. There really are no restaurants suitable for dinner within walking distance of the hotel, but there are many a cab ride away either in downtown or up on Capitol Hill. As my Friday and Saturday dinners were part of the wedding celebration I never tried any of them. If you plan on walking down into town, be aware that Seattle is notorious for the steepness of the hills coming up from the water. Many of the buildings on 1st thru 4th Avenue actually have elevators that make a stop at 2nd Street as well as the 2nd floor, etc., as a consequence.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMy stay was pure perfection start to finish!\u201d", "Author": "StephG639", "ReviewID": "UR124826783", "Content": "Check in (with Jackie) was wonderful.

This can be both good and bad. Because the electrical supply to the room isn't controlled by putting a card in a slot, you have to go and turn lights on and off individually, and when I arrived the room was quite chilly because the heater wasn't on. But then why waste power unnecessarily heating a room when it's unoccupied? The lights aren't as bright as I'm accustommed to, but then you get free wifi, which is always a decent thing to have. Bathroom and shower are very good; bed also, although I was awed that there were so many pillows on it.

Luckily, the Sorrento Hotel is a clean, beautiful, and breathable place to be. I was able to breathe, and sleep well.

More than anything, it reminded me of the hotels I like in Europe, the sort of family-owned, off-the-beaten-path but always in the best locations kind of places one only ever discovers through word of mouth. Well here's a little secret for you: in Seattle, stay at the Sorrento. There's even a charming little book in the room detailing its history, as a Belle Epoque refuge in a tranquil setting that became the place to take an apartment for wealthy local families during the Roaring '20s. Much of this enchanted ambiance remains. Highlights? I enjoyed dinner in the Hunt Club, and the perfect cappuccino with the paper at breakfast the next day, a glass of wine by the fire in the main lounge, with its echoes of Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood, another of my favorites in the region (without the high-altitude dizziness here), curling up on six pillows on my bed to read in blissful silence with a view of a gargoyle standing guard on the roof outside, making a very civilized cup of tea in my room with Theo Chocolates from the well-stocked minibar... the list of memorable perfect touches goes on and on... I would encourage you to check in to the Sorrento and make your own. A perfect ten in my book; it gets its own chapter.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cFantastic service, very comfortable rooms\u201d", "Author": "Andrew M", "ReviewID": "UR120312912", "Content": "Just stayed for three nights at the Sorrento with a pretty large group of friends.

In the mornings I would go to the Sugar Bakery (2 mins from the hotel!) on my way to the hospital...FABULOUS lattes, homemade pastries/scones/muffins and soup for lunch....incredible staff as well) I made the original booking over the phone and spoke to Trevor. I mention his name because he is amazing...always helpful, friendly, courteous, and very welcoming. We found all the staff, from the valet crew to the concierge to the front desk staff, the staff in the Lounge and the Hunt Club, to the few housekeeping staff I encountered, excellent, always greeting you with a hello and a smile on your way in or out. We were in Room 600, a JR suite and loved the room; clean, spacious, comfortable, nice bright bathroom, nice warm robes, big closet, and I really liked the desk where I used my laptop frequently. My husband's one night in the hospital became 2 and I felt safe and comfortable on my own in the room. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and so we returned again the next week for 1 o/night. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is charming and has such great history and character. Beautiful high-back chairs in the lounge, nice warm atmosphere in the lobby and dining room. It was a bit of a stressful time under the circumstances (my husband's operation), but we felt very comfortable at the Sorrento and enjoyed our time there. We will definitely go back and hope to get room 600 again! Having eaten in the Hunt Club the first visit, which was good, we decided to try dining out on the 18th, as it happened it was Seattle Restaurant Week...so we ate at Osteria La Spiga and took the hotel 'town car' there and back. The concierge highly recommended it. It was excellent as well, authentic Italian food and excellent service.

Check-in was a breeze as we were warmly welcomed. Upon inspecting our corner room, I saw that it was 2 double beds for our romantic getaway, which was not what I had planned. In a few minutes after calling the front desk, the clerk personally came up to accompany us to the same room 2 floors higher with a king bed--perfect! It was a suite but we have never seen such spacious hotel accommodations. The living room was huge & the bedroom oversized as well. The bathroom was tiny, but not a problem. We have a round window that opened from the shower & it was fun to open it a crack & watch the street below as I showered! However, the street below was a problem overnight because the Sorrento is 2 blocks from the Virginia Mason emergency room entrance where all the ambulances begin & end. I was awakened by sirens all night long, & this wasn't even over a weekend! That is the only negative aspect of our stay, but it's enough to keep me from going back. We ate in their restaurant which was outstanding. We frequently utilized their free shuttle service to the downtown area. It is also close enough to walk if you have the energy and time and aren't carrying a boatload of shopping bags. We did not need a car while we were there which meant we did not use the valet. The staff was outstanding in every encounter I had with them. The beds were great, the view isn't great, but the windows were large. And the interior of the hotel is just plain gorgeous. The coffee bar is very nice since we love French-pressed coffee & there is a small frig in the room as well. I only wish it was in a quieter location.

My requested for early check-in was honored and I found Trevor the desk clerk to be extremely accommodating offering two rooms for us to actually view. Our room classification was a Jr. Suite and we choose room 600, a corner room, well appointed and comfortable. I greatly appreciate Trevor providing room options and allowed us to actually look at the rooms. Really, how often does that happen when you check in? Almost never in my experience. This is something that hotels use to do years ago, and I personally appreciate it. Bathroom space is often a valid concern with older hotels, I did not find that to be the case with this room; however I will note hot water was a bit of an issue only in the evening. It took about five to seven minutes before the bath water got hot, but once you are aware of this you can easily adjust. I appreciate the bathroom having a night light and the rooms providing comfortable robes, which always saves valuable luggage space. There is coffee and tea in the room with a French Press. After reading the instructions and two failed attempts of preparing coffee I requested a standard type of pour through coffee maker for the room which was immediately delivered. The hotel has a complementary car to bring you, and pick you up upon availability and request. We used this service three times during our stay. Our driver the first day was Lance, who was very friendly. All of our drivers were courteous and friendly. I met with Alex the hotel Concierge the first day and he took the time to sit down with me and review various tour options and places of interest. Alex was very helpful, and I truly appreciated the time he spent with me. We only had one meal at the hotel in the Hunt Club. Dining reviews are very subjective. With that said, I am sorry to say that I would not recommend the Hunt Club. I did not find my meal or my husband\u2019s to be what I would consider to be good, let alone outstanding. I would rate them as alright. The wait staff was excellent and attentive. The location of the hotel is in an area called \u201cPill Hill\u201d you are up a very steep hill from the waterfront. You can walk to Pikes Market and downtown, utilize the hotel car or take a city bus, which is actually almost outside the hotel front door. We had absolutely no problem navigating Seattle from the Sorrento Hotel. There are some neighborhood dining options by the Sorrento. The Corner Caf\u00e9 directly across the street, a bakery a few doors down from there. Across the street and down about two blocks towards the bay is \u201cGeorges Sausage & Delicatessen\u201d \u2013 this place is only open until 5:00 but I made sure we stopped the day we were flying home and purchased two wonderful deli sandwiches that were absolutely great, and extremely reasonably priced, this is worth the short walk. About two doors down from there the 1st Hill Bar & Grill is located, we had dinner and breakfast, both meals very good. This is a neighborhood restaurant; George the original owner is friendly, walks around and visits with customers. One evening we dined at the Metropolitan Grill, which is about 6 blocks from the hotel, we had an excellent meal. I only mention these dining options because I personally find it helpful when reading reviews of what fellow travelers have experienced in the area. Also, if you are down at Pikes Market, there are many options for fresh fruit, bakery items, wine, wonderful things to bring back to your room. Probably the only real disappointment I found with the Sorrento was my request to print our Southwest Boarding passes. Anyone who flies Southwest knows the game, bring up the site, enter your information, minimize your screen and click as absolute close to the departure time as possible. Unfortunately I received the standard excuse, they were busy and detained and I got B-28-29 passes which afforded me the very last aisle seat in the very last row of the plane. I am more than aware this can happen and took the chance this task would be a priority, it was not. I just want to be sure you are aware of this and if it is important to you, I strongly suggest you make other arrangements than having the hotel do this for you. I want to thank the staff at the Sorrento, everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I specifically selected this hotel based on the comments posted on Trip Advisor. I also always book my reservations directly through the hotel. I would highly recommend the Sorrento to anyone considering it and I would definitely stay again.

Sadly my whole view of the hotel turned around within the space of a few minutes. I had made a specific point of enquiring about using the complimentary shuttle car the day before I needed it to take me to the train station. I was told explicitly that I needn't worry and I couldn't book it ahead of time, I should call back a few minutes before needing it and there wouldn't be a problem. So the next day I called up half an hour before required to try and book the shuttle only to be told that it wouldn't be available for a few hours as the car along with many others was need for a very high value client activity. So my \u00a3850 is for my stay wasn't important enough for one short journey.

The atmosphere, decor and ambiance is classy and of a superior grade.

Few: (a) there is only one small elevator serving the entire hotel but this did not inconvenience us often despite the fact that the hotel was almost full during our visit, (b) we signed up for a bed-and-breakfast package and received a voucher for a free daily breakfast. The vouchers apparently have a face value of $32 which doesn't go very far if there's two of you and each has a $3 cup of coffee to start...

The room itself was smaller than our last (every room is different!), but just as cozy. The beds are heavenly (much to my chagrin, actually, as my wife insisted on sleeping in). The building has some of the \"quirks\" that come with older buildings (climate control is a challenge), but is elegant and clean. Did I mention free high speed wi-fi?

After being told by Priceline that I was booked at the Sorrento, I checked their individual website and tried to cancel the reservation because I knew it wouldn't work for a family. Here's why: the resort is TECHNICALLY \"downtown\" but in the First Hill district, past the I-5. HILL being the key word here. Yes, it is totally possible to walk to the waterfront and Pike's Place areas, but it is a very steep incline and you have to pass the I-5 there and back. Now, add a stroller to the equation and you're going to have a not so great time going down and a hell of time heading back up. There is NO shuttle service. NO shuttle service to the airport, NO shuttle service to the waterfront or Pike's place. As my family and I were walking down and up town, we were amazed at all the other hotels that offered shuttle services, it seems like that would be an amenity offered by a so-called 4 star resort. Well, not the Sorrento. Granted, the concierge or valet could dispatch you a taxi, but after paying $35.00/day for valet, plus tip, the last thing I wanted to do was pay $10.00 for a cab ride. And yes, we could've driven closer to the meca of downtown but parking can be problematic and will cost you just as much as our hotel valet fees. The Sorrento is in a \"quieter\" part of town; however, there is an Emergency room entrance within stone's throw of the hotel. Which means we were woken up only twice by ambulance sirens. Upon check-in we were told we were booked in a queen size suite (of course they don't tell you that all of their rooms are \"suites.\" When asked if we could get a room with two beds, due to traveling with kids, we were told that our \"suite\" had a pull-out sofa. After previewing the pull out, we opted for the roll-away that they also offered upon check-in. It barely fit in our \"living\" area and was not very comfortable. The air conditioning in the room is also located in the \"living\" area and didn't work very well. Which meant that the person sleeping on the pullout would be cold and the persons sleeping in the bedroom would be hot. I would have opened the windows; but they were positioned to low to the floor and having kids, would have been disastrous. The curtain rod in the living area kept falling down when we tried to close the curtains and the toilet \"ran\" unless you jiggled the handle after every flush. The caulking under the toilet is also cracking away which means that the toilet wobbles as you're using it. There is no indoor pool or hot tub, another amenity that I expected with a four star hotel. The customer service was above average and everyone we dealt with was pleasant. The internet was free but wired.

It's a very old hotel and I really respect the fact that they want to keep it as original as possible, however it's tiny and dark and not really equipped with any modern amenities. (ie: no ice machines, vending machines, gift shop, etc) We arrived early and our room wasn't ready (even though I called the day before to let them know we'd be early) so we had lunch in the \"restaurant.\" They have a very small menu with very brief descriptions and everything is pricey. The server was nice and friendly and the food was pretty good but I don't know if was worth the price. The atmosphere was dark and old and felt like a gentleman's club so we weren't totally comfortable there. After lunch our room was ready so that worked out nicely. We headed up the tiny elevator to our \"junior suite\" which was definitely not what we expected either! Very, very small for a suite of any kind. The room was stuffy and the AC doesn't work so we had to open the windows which don't have screens so we had a few insect visitors- oh great. The TV was a joke- totally basic cable with no guide channel, info button or TV guide anywhere in the room so you have to just flip through and hope you find something you want to watch (and all the channels had crappy reception, very fuzzy). The bathroom was adequate- nice sink and vanity, closet with robes, etc. Separate tiny area with toilet and tiniest shower ever (my 6'4\" husband was rather cramped). The \"suite\" area consisted of a loveseat, two chairs and a coffee table. Wow! So glad we upgraded. The king size bed was mostly comfortable, lots of nice pillows that reaked of hotel bleach. There was about 4 feet of space between the end of the bed and the \"suite\" area so we're talking small here people. Trying to get room service of any kind took a while but everyone was friendly and helpful. The other major con of this place is the location. There is nothing around there that is remotely interesting. Since we ate lunch at the hotel's only restaurant, we decided to wonder around outside to find something for dinner. There was no one around at the concierge desk or the reception desk to ask for recommedations so we set off on our own and were sorely disappointed by what we found. Nearly everything was already closed and it was 5pm on a Saturday! Hello?! We ended up eating fast food because it was the only thing open that looked even sort of clean and welcoming. Not how we wanted to spend the first night of our vacation! We had to leave really early the next morning to get to the Amtrak station and mysteriously the awesome hotel car was gone so we had to call a cab. We were hoping to utilize that car a couple of times to save money but it was never there for us!

The hotel is 100 years old and privately owned, all the staff were mutiskilled and very much hands on, the conciege team were friendly, polite and very professional and any requests that we had were dealt with immediately. Although this hotel is old it has elegance and charm throughout, even down to the squeaky floors, the lounge area is comfortable and peaceful, ideal for after dinner coffee or a read of the newspaper (complimentry). The restaurant was excellent, good food and a relaxing ambience, I must compliment the young lad who ran the bar and waitered, he was very pleasant and polite and always had a smile. All staff of this hotel are excellent ambassadors for the Sorrento and work well as a team. I cannot comment on valet parking as we did not have a car but from what I saw the valet parking was well organised, they have their own hotel cars which are well maintained, they even had a London Taxi which the guests seem to love, the hotel cars will take you downtown for free or you can use them to take you to the airport (for only $5 more than taxi). After our cruise we arranged to return to the hotel for the day as our flight to the UK was not until the evening, when we arrived at the hotel they greeted us like one of the family, our luggage was placed in a secure and safe room for the day, we asked if we could use the business centre for checking in online for our flight, again no problem and no charge for use of the internet, we enjoyed a late lunch and relaxed in the lounge before we set off to the airport, we were both sad to leave the hotel. I would love to spend Christmas at this hotel as I am sure it would be fabulous. With regards to Seattle itself, its ok for a few days sightseeing and ideal for cruise passengers coming in a day earlier for their cruise.

It was a special occasion for both of us (she lives in Seattle). I love the Capitol Hill area so I stayed at the Sorrento. Having made my reservations for a suite, I e-mailed the concierge and asked for a town car to be made available for the opera. The concierge responded promptly. When I arrived late Friday night, there was no desk staff but the concierge checked me in efficiently. I prudently took the precaution of handing out some green to make sure my stay went smoothly! The corner suite was very small, but well laid out and appointed. It was very clean. The hotel is old and the floor had some sags but it was also very quiet. As another poster noted, the bathroom has little counter space, but, mine had a window, shower and tub. Good thick towels. HiFi in room. Minibar and sink. Only one heater in the main room but the bedroom, and bath, stayed comfortable. No view from my northeast facing room, but not much noise other than usual city sounds. (Note to the reviewer who complained about train sounds: There isn't a train track for miles! You must have the hearing of a police dog.) The hospital is a block away, so there is an occasional siren, and, Madison is uphill at the Sorrento, so cars occasionally chug up the hill. I can confirm the hostess at the atrium bar was preoccupied with her seating computer. The atrium is crowded with Capitol Hill folks (read: middle aged and older) and appeared a bit pretentious, but the environment was pleasant. Entertainment was good, not too loud. True to promise the concierge arranged for a car to pickup my friend. She was delivered and seated in the atrium to wait for me, with true old-style concierge maximum class. In other words, he fussed over her. Our every need was taken care of expeditiously. We had a brief pre-opera meal in the Hunt Club. It was good without being extraordinary. There was practically no one there. The bar (tended to by \"Jill\") was old-style club, expensive, but generally efficient. Summary: Smaller rooms, even the suites, but clean, if a bit older. If you want to splurge a bit, try the \"Music Suite\", expensive but quite a bit larger. Bribe the concierge if you want stuff to \"happen\". Great location. Ignore the atrium hostess (she will ignore you) and just find yourself a seat. Try the small breakfast place immediately across the street from the entrance to the hotel. Cheap and good (2/2009).

We were pleasantly surprised to receive a warm reception and great service during our night's stay. Desmond the concierge was very friendly when we checked in and even upgraded our room to a junior suite in honor of the occasion. The lobby was as I remembered, with rich wood tones and an old-world charm, and the Fireside room was a welcome repose after the cold rain. The second concierge on call brought the bags up to the room and hung my husband's suit in the closet, pointed out the room's amenities and was very helpful, as would be expected from a hotel with its reputation. Our room had plenty of space for the two of us, with a full sitting area, desk, and mirrored bar/coffee area. The marble appointed bathroom was separated into two parts, with the vanity and closet in one space and the toilet and shower separated by another door. No bathtub, which made the room feel somewhat European, but for one night it wasn't a problem. The room also came with robes and a CD system that had some great CDs provided by the hotel, which was an extra treat. We did not use the free car service, as we had our own car, and we decided not to valet but to park on the street, which on a Saturday night was no problem and on Sundays allows for free parking. When we arrived back at the hotel late evening there was a bottle of champagne, berries, and a note from the concierge wishing us a happy anniversary. It's the special touches that make a hotel memorable, and we were pleased with all of them. The California king bed was also of note, and although the pillow top mattress was still a bit too hard for my liking the wide variety of pillows and the well appointed bed sheets made the bed a dream to even sit on, let alone sleep. Our suite was in the front of the hotel facing the main street, and while there was some street noise when we had the windows open once closed it didn't bother us at all.

Here are the pros and cons, keeping in mind this was planned as a romantic interlude. Pros: Fabulous, and I mean truly amazing staff. Jeffrey, a concierge, was especially charming. The staff members were beautifully dressed, low key and exceptionally professional. They knew our name each time we came down, and were very accommodating. Gorgeous king bed with excellent linens, including a variety of huge, fluffy pillows. Lovely decor throughout, dark and full of ambience. Beautiful Fireside Bar with soft Jazz entertainment. Pleasant restaurant. We didn't eat there as we are vegetarian and wanted to check out Caf\u00e9 Flora. Cute factor: The elevator mat is changed daily and incorporates that particular day of the week. Cons: No coffee/tea maker in room. We went out and bought a kettle. I found this hard to take as I like my wake-up cuppa. I found out after my return that I could have asked for one. (This information was provided by their very helpful and pleasant client services manager.) However, there was no card advertising this point, it was not (as far as I can recall) in the service guide, and no one told me at the front desk. This minor point bugged me as, being a Brit, I find I get very antsy when I can't make tea. Not-too-pleasant scent of \"old buildings\" in the bathroom, which was also cold and drafty and did not have it's own heat. Very pretty though and well equipped. Lovely bath robes. Location not central. While the hotel operates a \"town car\" we had out own wheels and drove into Seattle's city centre. We think we prefer to walk out into the thick of things. The hotel is in a residential area. This said, that is just out personal preference. We would definitely recommend the hotel to friends, but we would mention the cold bathroom and to ask for a coffee press.

We were also told by the valet that we needed to tip the driver because he only was paid by gratuities. Not only was this advice unnecessary but it was unprofessional. No car service meant taking taxi cabs to dinner and shopping because this hotel is not within an easy walk of the Market or many restaurants. We were also disappointed by the general lack of service. In our previous stays, we were warmly greeted and our bags taken to our room where the bell-hop would turn on classical music. Turn-down service was automatic and fresh ice delivered nightly to the room. None of this happened during this last trip. In fact, when we asked what hours the Market was opened we were met with a shrug. If we hadn't been treated so well in the past, perhaps this wouldn't have been so shocking.

We appreciated the gesture, however that weekend, a Bat Mitzvah was taking place. Also a very noisy occasion. So 2 young ladies enjoyed their big nights, while we did not. The hotel is lovely.

Yes, it is an old fashioned hotel with a tiny elevator and older rooms. However they have been appointed beautifully with luxury linens, coffee makers, TV and stereo, wonderful robes, lots of niceties etc. The bathroom while smaller than other high end hotels was wonderfully equipped with drawer organizers, a scale, hairdryer etc. It was also brightly lit. The desk in the room was a business center with free Internet access and a fax/printer under the desk. Opening the drawer I found a complete setup with tape, paper clips, stapler etc. The only downside was the AC system. It was a window unit that even running on high all night never seemed to rid the room of stuffiness. This was a 70 degree day in Seattle, I can't imagine what the summer is like. The windows in the room do open but the street noise was annoying. I heard one siren go by early in the morning through the closed windows. The front desk staff was very friendly. I didn't ask much of them but found no fault. I did not try the car service. I parked on the street since it was a Saturday night and avoided the valet parking fee. Room service came quickly and was delicious. I went to the Fireside Room to listen to a live jazz trio. This would have been more delightful if there were more servers. Service was VERY slow. The real mood killer (and this isn't the hotel's fault) was the 10 year old boy sitting in front of me with his parents who were allowing him to entertain himself by taking 30+ photos with a flash digital camera.

Upon checking in, the concierge came up to our room to show us the details of the room and comment on the conservative nature of the lounge/bar if we were inclined to go. I suppose we looked a little younger than their average guests (we're both in our mid-20s) and he wanted to make sure we knew what we were in for. He made dinner reservations for us and arranged for the towncar to take us there and back. While at dinner, Jerry - the incredible concierge, called in and sent complimentary crab cakes to our table. They never seemed put out that we requested towncar service several times a day. All the valet staff were extremely courteous and helpful - not to mention pleasant to look at :) My meal from the Hunt Club (via room service) was mediocre, but I wan't very hungry and I doubt that their tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich are the house specialty. Breakfast in the lounge was fantastic and I also liked the real in room coffee grounds and press. There is a definite musky odor in the hallways, but I think this could be fixed by a good Febrezing. The room did not have the same musky odor. Regarding a previous reviewer's comments about the lack of natural light - is the lobby darker than other hotels? Yes. However, I think this adds ambiance and beauty, rather than detracting from this hotel. You really feel like you are in the old world and the Sorrento is the longest operating hotel in Seattle - since 1908. I whole-heartedly recommend this hotel. My boyfriend regularly stays at the Seattle Westin and is switching his stays to the Sorrento after this week.

From there, unfortunately, my experience deteriorated rapidly. I was underwhelmed by the agent who checked me in. I received no eye contact and felt as if I was nothing more than a bother who had interrupted what sounded like a personal phone call she had taken while I was checking in. With room key in hand, I proceeded up the tiny lobby elevator to a room on the fifth floor. Upon entering the room, I immediately noticed a musty smell. It smelled like a cross between mold and old cigarette smoke. I called the front desk and asked for another room and I was quickly rebuked and told that \"nothing else\" was available and that the hotel was sold out. This, however, didn't jibe with the valet who told me how surprisingly slow the hotel had been that week. Nevertheless, I accepted the room I was in, reluctantly, as it was only for one night and I proceeded to order room service after a long day of travel. Within twenty minutes, a smiling server brought me dinner: A bowl of soup with bread and a half sandwich. Unfortunately, I had to eat almost the entire bowl of soup before I found, what appeared to be, a dead roach (or possibly beetle) at the bottom of the bowl. Needless to say, I didn't dare touch the sandwich. I called the restaurant to report my findings and the initial person who answered the phone sounded disbelieving. That person then put the manager on who apologized and offered to send something else to the room, on the house. I declined, and he informed me that I wouldn't see a charge on my bill for that particular meal when I checked out the next day. He apologized again, promised he'd take the charge off my bill, and hung up. For the most part, despite eating insect soup, I was satisfied with the situation. I skipped breakfast in the restaurant the next morning, checked out on my way to a meeting, and left the hotel. Three hours later, in a cab on my way to Sea-Tac, I looked at the receipt from the Sorrento Hotel. On it, I found a charge for in-room dining: $32.18. The exact cost of the meal I had the misfortune of eating the night before. For a moment, I was quite angry and pulled out my cellphone to call the hotel and give them a piece of my mind. But before I could dial the hotel's number, I started laughing about the ridiculousness of paying 32.18 for the privilege of eating roach soup at the famous Sorrento Hotel and decided to just leave well-enough alone.

The reason some are rating it that way(my best guess) are the cute/nice things that hotel has going on or possibly they've never really stayed at a true 5 star hotel so their expectations of that status are lower. The good parts of the hotel are: free town car around town, old fashioned pretty building, very comfortable bed, quiet atmosphere vs. hustle/bustle of bigger hotels, free internet, a lot of free movie/premium channels (HBO, etc.); my room had a small separate living room; a small French press coffee machine; and a very nice CD player with CD's provided; 2 free robes (but 1 was very thin); extra good lighting in bathroom with large mirrors. But again, I expect most of that (minus the free car) in any decent hotel. The bad parts are: the hotel is old and you don't have to look closely to realize that; check-in wasn't any more friendly or efficient than a 2 star hotel (they actually skipped over me and never even apologized, and yes they knew they did it); the room service/restaurant menus are very limited and over priced for no real reason (but the food was tasty); the view from my room was a dirty alley wall; limited closet space;front desk/concierge staff isn't very knowledgable when asked questions about area, etc.; clock in room didn't work; my bill on check-out was wrong (charged for parking and didn't have car); old dirty refrig. in room trying to pass as mini-bar; and the A/C and heat was impossible to control because it's not central but an old window ledge type.

The reviews on this site really influenced me to try the Sorrento as opposed to say the Inn at Market Place. This is a very nice property with many pluses, but my over all opinion is that it's nothing special, which is of course what you're looking for on these getaways. The Sorrento has an excellent concierge who gave very good recommendations, even when put to the test. They also have complimentary Town Car service to and from downtown destinations. This is a really nice thing. The public rooms of the hotel are top notch. The lobby lounge, for example is warm and inviting. I opted for a Junior Suite which ran around $300 a night. The room is a very small divided into a small sitting area with a tv in armoir and a bedroom that is tiny. The king size bed barely fits in the room, you have to squeeze buy it to get to the bathroom. The bedding was spectacular with super soft sheets and a large variety of pillows. The bedroom had an oversized desk that abutted the bed. The bathroom was nice with white marble and a spacious walk-in shower. Unfortunately, there's no tub in the bathroom and that's a minus for me. So here are there reasons for my average review: The room lacks any special aesthetic. The entire room is beige and boring and feels very, very cramped largely because of the poor layout. The bathroom is solid white. The room really needs the services of a good interior designer. The room temperature was impossible. They rely on small under window units that you just can\u2019t get right. We were either freezing or boiling. There are no views whatsoever. No evening turn-down service was provided, so no evening straighten up of the room either. No coffee or breakfast service provided. Seating was uncomfortable and dated.
