It is located in a suburb, only 3 blocks away from to the subwaystation. For only \u20ac6,80 you get a dayticket for all of the Berlin public transportation, so no need to go by car. The hotel offers free parking space for their guests. The area surrounding the hotel is very quiet and with good local ammenities. There is a little supermarket just round the corner. The hotel was a bit dated but spacious and clean . The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was excellent. The only thing that bothered me was the beds, they are of poor quality, so if you have backproblem dont sleep here. I booked online and paid \u20ac150 for 3 nights which I felt was worth it.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eindhoven, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cJust the place we wanted and will be back for sure!\u201d", "Author": "Peter_Ahouse", "ReviewID": "UR115963614", "Content": "When we booked the hotel on a special sale we were a bit scared as to what to expect as the price we paid per night was our lowest ever. Therefore we were pleasantly surprised! Spaceous rooms well equiped, good beds, nice bathroom, fabulous breakfast etc. Furthermore the location was excellent for our city trip. A quiet neighbourhood but 5 minutes walking from the U bahn station. In the end decided to add another day as we enjoyed the city and hotel so much! We will be back for sure!!", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh,Scotland", "Title": "\u201cA very good choice\u201d", "Author": "Garry05", "ReviewID": "UR5419213", "Content": "I stayed for 3 nights in the hotel Hanse. Although it is situated in a suburb it is only 3 blocks walk to the underground (5 mins). 3 stops on the underground and you are in central Berlin.The area is very quiet and quite affluent with good local ammenities. However not the place to stay if you are looking for a buzz or to be in the heart of things. The apartment was a bit dated but spacious and clean .

It's close to the U-bahn station, and therefore convenient to all parts of the city, but not within walking distance of any major attractions. Our room was reasonably large and well equipped, but in need of a good freshen-up. It looked a bit tired and run down. There was a balcony overlooking the street. Breakfast was good, and the staff were friendly and helpful.", "Date": "December 17, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "City Gallery Berlin Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d199382-Reviews-City_Gallery_Berlin_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$51 - $117*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Jenaer Strasse 2</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10717</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "199382", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2c/60/2c6046792f345ac26d8810544605cce75large.jpg"}}
