In mid-December 2011, I went w/ a group from work for a holiday luncheon at Club M. While the waitress was serving the 1st round of drinks, she spilled a whole glass of white wine on my new Marni handbag (I had rec\u2019d it as a Xmas gift from my boyfriend the previous evening). The management was apologetic and offered to send it to the cleaners but since I had another holiday event that evening I told them I would take it to the cleaners myself. They were fine w/ that and agreed to cover any cleaning costs. I took the bag to Margaret\u2019s (the premier cleaner in SD) and spoke to their leather expert. They cleaned the bag but the damage was irreparable. I was told that if they dyed the bag (super soft, dark green lambskin) they would have to re-color the entire bag and it may not cover the stains and definitely would change the texture (not acceptable to me). GdM refused to compensate me for the bag saying that they couldn\u2019t be sure that it was authentic. The GdM offered me $350 for the bag and $106 for the cleaning costs that I had incurred. I reluctantly agreed and then the GdM immediately said that they would \u201chave to do more research\u201d. I ended up sending the bag to the Marni headquarters in New York and received a letter of authenticity from the national sales director. The bag\u2019s replacement value was just under $1K. I filed a small claims case against GdM for $650 for the purse (which I thought was equitable) + $106 for the cleaning costs + shipping to/from NYC. Our court date was a couple of weeks ago and while the case was being heard, the GdM\u2019s representative LIED under oath. I was awarded only $100 (which didn\u2019t even cover the cleaning costs!). Later that day, my supervisor called Tom Voss (Pres of GdM) because of the way I had been treated by GdM. Mr. Voss agreed to pay me an extra $106 but was, to paraphrase my boss, not a very nice guy to deal with. Bottom line, my employer gives ALOT of business to GdM but they don\u2019t seem to value that relationship or to operate at a level that you would expect such a high tier property to conduct business at.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute Perfection!!!\u201d", "Author": "sjmacdee", "ReviewID": "UR126519005", "Content": "This is like stepping through the looking glass into perfect service heaven!

It is simply flawless. The service is perfect from the moment you bring your car to the valet, then on to reception, then on to the bellmen, houskeeping and the waistaff in the restaurants as well as all the supporting staff of a great hotel, spa and resort. The folks in charge of this establishment have created a superb culture of service that is consistently rendered with dignity, a complete lack of obsequiesness, and perfect performance and timing. My wife and I are travelers, high end travelers. We only stay at 4 (reluctantly) and 5 star properties. We have been doing this for 30 years. We have been doing this all over the world. We love to travel. We love high end properties. We both agree that this may be, overall, all aspects considered, the best property we have ever stayed at. This takes some thought and a good memory. We spent an entire evening reviewing our experiences and the meals we have had. We may have missed something but we stand by the notion that the Grand is, as it's name implies, THE Grand. If you are wealthy - you have nothing to worry about - you can stay here anytime. If you are middle to upper middle class - stay here while you can. Once the economy recovers and the reputation of the Grand builds, you will be priced out of this particular piece of paradise. And do eat at one of the two wonderful restauarnts. While the food at Addisons was, as espected, fautless, it was not our style. We prefer Amaya - a truely first class culinary experience that is without the minimalism that comes with many of today's absolutely top culinary establishments (which Addison's surely is amongst.)

From the time we arrive and the time we depart, there isn't a minute that we don't feel pampered or treated like royalty.

I want to preface by saying that I have stayed in a number of other top notch resorts (Ojai Valley Inn and Spa, Ritz Carlton, JW Marriott, La Quinta Reosrt and Spa, etc.) and none can compare. I will try to break it down for you all... Hotel and Checkin- This is a unique resort in that it is nestled in a gated community. I have never stayed here before and did not know anyone that has (much less heard of it). Upon driving up and valeting (pricey $30 per night), i was impressed to see a beautifully ornate lobby. Check in was a breeze. I requested a connecting room with the other family and that was quickly arranged. The receptionists actually greeted each of my children and offered them a toy from their treasure chest (never seen that before). He then walked us to the bellman and proceeded to lead us to the elevator. Very nice touch. Rooms: The rooms were on the 2nd floor. Beautifully decorated (made me feel as if I was staying in a palace). The bathroom was large and contained the closet. The bathroom was so large that we were able to put the pack n' play in their for my baby to sleep in. Each room had an espresso machine, as well as complimentary bottled water. Grounds: Immaculate. Very Very clean. Everything was in place. The pool area was very nice and even had soft white sand around the lounge chairs. They incorporated the golf course nicely and there were amazing views every where you look. Food/bar: We tried the snack shop (same kitchen as Amaya) once and Amaya twice (Dinner and Breakfast). The food was amazing everytime. Amaya for dinner had a great selection of food. I was not disappointed with anything that I tasted. They also have a huge selection of wine and scotch (my favorite). The lobby bar was great and I had my first taste of Absinthe there. The best thing I had was the complimentary cookie (and bottle of milk) that was provided during the turn-down service. Absolutely wonderful Golf: The course was in beautiful condition (even though it was at its prime condition). IT is pretty pricey but worth a shot if you are a golf fan. They included a fore caddie (my first experience with one) which made the experience wonderful. The practice facility was top notch (ProV-1 practice balls). Food/drink can be brought to you at anytime during your round. The course is private and closed to the public, thus the rounds are pretty fast pace and never crowded. Awesome golf experience. Spa: My wife is a self-proclaimed spa connoisseur and proclaims this to be one of the greatest spas that she has ever been too. Well ahead of the highly rated Ojai Valley Inn and Spa and on par with the Montage (Laguna Hill). She couldn't stop talking about the facility and service. Service: I have saved the best for last. The service is top notch. First class all around. I was expecting a snooty/snobby resort, but I could never have been more wrong. From the bellman to the waitress to the golf person to the cleaning lady, everyone was extremely polite and pleasant. Upon driving up, I initially laughed at the idea that this resort was \"family friendly\". I thought my family would be stared at and treated rudely, however, I could never have been more wrong. They bent over backwards to cater to my kids and family. They brought over a crib (with baby supplies) immediately. They found out it was my son's birthday and made him feel special the entire stay. They sent up a birthday dessert to the room. They gave him a gelato coupon (as well as one for each member of the family). He felt special the whole stay. There were also so many perks at this resort. I have also never been to a resort that offered 2 hrs of baby sitting (in the explorer club) while you are at your spa treatment. The wives and kids took advantage of the free shuttle (Mercedes Sprinter) to the local mall. Lastly, during our dinner at Amaya, everyone we encountered treated my family as if we were royalty. It wasn't the obvious things that caught my eye, but it was the attention to small details that amazed me. For example, my son was curious about our champagne, so the waiter went and put some Sprite in a decanter and pour it into a champagne glass for them (how awesome is that!). I can't say enough about their service... Sorry for the long detail, but as you can see, I thoroughly enjoyed our visit.

This ranks up there with best staff i have ever seen at a hotel property, and ranks in my top 3. The room was nice, but not very large. I was on the first floor and had patio access to a large shared lawn. Bathroom had bathtub, shower, and separate toilet. As i was there with a group we had several meals out on the front lawn, all of good quality. I also had an excellent Cobb Salad in the Amaya Restaurant on site, with some of the best lemonade i've ever tasted. We had one dinner at Addison, their signature restaurant, which was delicious and coupled with great local wines. I would highly recommend a meal there if staying at the hotel. Afterwards, go downstairs to Club M for some music and drinks. There's a great selection of on-site amenities including several pools, hiking trails, gym, horseriding, and a fun golf course. The golf course should get a better selection of left-handed rental clubs, as i was left with a mediocre set, with regular flex shafts and missing a putter (later brought to me on hole 5). What stood out the most during this stay was the level of service. Staff are trained very well and very respectful and assist in all possible ways. I haven't seen this level of service at any hotel in the world i've stayed at in the past 10 years. The only minor issues i had were: - In my opinion, bathroom amenities do not meet the level of this hotel. - Some issues with my TV. - Lengthy walk from self-park lot.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic way to end our holiday\u201d", "Author": "ET59", "ReviewID": "UR123535748", "Content": "After spending 10 days in theme parks and aquaria it was with great relief to roll into the Grand Del Mar.

Location is great for seeing San Diego , prob 30mins to anything yet peaceful and serene, almost the opposite to Disney. We had room service every night ( yes a bit of luxury but heck why not? and our kids just loved having dinner tucked in bed!) but I must say I havent seen such quality in a room service menu ( it was delicious) for a long time and it was much better value than you would expect. Room was more spacious than most , huge bath and complimentary water and wi-fi. Self parking worked a treat and with a $100 resort credit , I thought it was really good value against what Ive seen in the world at this level.

When I saw it was ranked #2 in US resorts (I believe that was the category) I felt I needed to weigh in. While this resort is very nice, it wouldn't be my top pick in the whole country. The room is beautifully furnished, but not that big. I don't know that I'd want to stay there for longer than a few days before I'd feel like we were on top of each other. The bathroom was certainly the best part of the room -- spacious and well appointed. But the opening into the room made no sense to me. Our \"shutters\" closing this opening kept popping open and we had to have housekeeping come and fix them closed. As other reviewers have noted, some of the rooms have no usable balcony, which was unfortunately the case with our room. Why would you not have a space in some of the rooms where you could sit and enjoy the lovely scenic grounds? Yes, the service is outstanding and they truly want to help you however they can. All staff was friendly, saying hello in the halls. About the halls -- our room was way at the end of the building so we spent a long time walking in freezing halls. When the temperature is only the low 70's I couldn't understand why they over air conditioned the halls. Thankfully we were here with a business group and someone else was picking up the tab. I inquired about additional nights and found it is very expensive. It is a very nice resort, but I didn't feel it was worth the price. The main reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that we were consistently disappointed by the food. We had a few dinners and cocktail parties, and there were flaws with each meal. Perhaps I am being picky, but if it's a top resort the food should be great too. We had better meals in the town of Del Mar. The activities they offered were a wonderful addition to our stay -- I took a canyon hike and had friends who took fitness classes.

Over the years this has led me up the food chain of hotels in the area, culminating this past Thanksgiving with a 5-day stay at the Grand Del Mar. Location: Far from the city proper and the beach. Think of it as a retreat. First impression upon driving up: I know someone's going to tell you it's chic, but the Grand Del Mar looks like the architectural love child of Hearst Castle and a Rapallo waterfront hotel. Car valet: I don't grok the \"cars impart status\" meme. I drive a Subaru Forester - very practical. After driving down I-5 from San Fran, my car looked like a dirty little troll next to all the Escalades, Mercedes, Audis, and BMWs in front of the Del Mar. Whatever. Front desk: Impeccable service at check-in. We asked for accommodations near the adult pool. Because I'd asked for a suite and one wasn't available, they gave us a room with an unusually large balcony. Thank you, front desk man. A+ Room: The room was extremely clean and about 1.5x the size of a typical hotel room, with fresh furnishings and upholstery. The bed was too soft for my taste but other people will probably like it. The bathroom was modern and spacious as well - lots of stone and glass and mirrors but didn't tip over into the Vegas Zone. Shampoos and lotions were of good quality. Overall, the room met expectations given the price. Room service: Completely awesome. Everything we ordered was always correct, on time, warm, well-prepared, and well-presented. Pool: I often choose hotels because I want to do lap swimming. The Del Mar's adult pool (they call it the Quiet Pool) was definitely usable for this purpose. It's longer than 25 meters, super clean, and non-crowded in November (I was often the only one in the pool). However, it's way too warm for exercise. Also, there was new age music playing *underwater* at one end of the pool, which was a little weird till I figured out that I wasn't experiencing auditory hallucinations. After my swim an attendant unobtrusively brought me a glass of ice water, which was a first for me and a very nice touch. He also brought a menu, and if the day had been warmer I'd have ordered lunch and some sort of fruity cocktail - the pool area just puts you in that sort of mood. Overall, I'd give the Quiet Pool and its surroundings an A for design and service, B- for lap swimming. Grounds: Cutesy, utterly non-creative landscape-design. Very well-manicured. Lots of courtyards, fountains, gazebos, tiny privet hedges, rose trees, citrus in amphorae, and other cliche'd frou-frou, but it's restful to the eye. There's a croquet lawn with a St. Francis statue, and we often saw people playing, which was anachronistically delightful. I very much enjoyed watching the Brits turning croquet into an extreme sport... don't ask. B- for the grounds because they was sort of fun to stroll through. Once. Addison restaurant: We had Thanksgiving dinner at Addison. The food was very good but no way was it worth $600 for two people. Service was good but a little slow - I'd give them a pass on this because it was Thanksgiving, but the restaurant was over half empty. I checked the prices on the wines we were offered on my phone: they were selling $18 bottles of wine for $80+. Not unusual, I guess, but I wouldn't eat here again. Amaya restaurant: We had brunch and lunch on Amaya's heated patio several times - everything was delicious and the service was great. They even brought a water bowl for our dog, and let him sit under the table while we ate. Top notch casual dining! A+! Golf course: Dunno. The grass was green and rolling and there were holes here and there for balls to roll in and dudes dressed all preppy and plaid-y driving little clown cars around. Some people like this sort of thing. Hiking and horseback riding: Ok, this is not a hiking destination but we were traveling with our dog, and he's large and needs exercise. So I took him out on the Del Mar's horseback riding trails. I appreciated the convenience of having a trail on-site. The horseback riding is for the kiddies: just a couple extremely agreeable horses, and some short trails 'round the golf course. Kids under 12 will like it fine. Hiking D-, dog-walking A, horses B+. Dog friendly: Their website says they're dog-friendly, and before booking my reservation I called to confirm - we were showing up on Thanksgiving day and I didn't want to have any problems. The agent assured me that our dog would be welcome. And sure enough, when we checked in, nobody raised an eyebrow when we walked in with our 80-lb Rottie mix. HOWEVER. In our room, the binder of hotel services said that they only welcome dogs under 25 lbs. Nobody questioned us or gave us a hard time in the 5 days we were there, but we were *aware* that he wasn't really supposed to be there. It cast a bit of a pall on our whole stay. One big demerit to the Del Mar for not stating this on their website or when I called. Overall, the hotel was expensive but served up the value. The food at Amaya and from room service was very good. The room was nice and the pool was usable for lap swimming. The place is a tad clubby / smug with itself, but after 5 days I felt relaxed and as if I had been well cared for, so I might return anyway. I still feel bad about the dog, though.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cTruly \"One of the Best Places in the World to Stay\"\u201d", "Author": "pascalphx", "ReviewID": "UR122590840", "Content": "This property is nested in a secluded area of San Diego.

The grounds are immense and perfectly landscaped. Even the golf course has waterfalls, a stream, and colorful flowers everywhere. I love the fact that you can \"self park\" your car FOR NO CHARGE! What a wonderful option for those of us who are quite capable of walking to our car, and do not like paying $20.00-$35.00(Four Seasons, Vail)a day to park our car. Every hotel should have this option available, and not just tell visitors they have no choice. Hurrah for the Grand del Mar on this matter. The lobby has various designs of marble flooring, classical furniture and wallhangings, and fresh flowers.The intercom system has nice Spanish music playing, even in the elevators! Right off of the lobby is a formal living area, library, and cocktail lounge. Stunning! Check-in went smoothly, and I \"held my breath\" that our room would be in a good location. When we walked in we were overwhelmed with the grandeur and opulence of the room. We have stayed in several Ritz Carlton's, some incredible hotels on 4 Hawaiian islands, as well as gorgeous properties in Mexico, and this one was the nicest by far. We lucked out for sure with a perfect location. Alot of grand hotels have fabulous grounds and commom areas, but the rooms are just regular- not this hotel! The bathroom had a large marble tub, large shower, closeted toilet, two sinks with a television in between the mirrors, a chandalier, and pass-through space that can be opened/closed as desired, opening the bath area to the bedroom. Marble, marble everywhere- \"Wow\"! The closet is substantial, has a safe, and bath robes. There was a mini-bar in the room hallway, but no microwave. The room was large, and the bed was extremely comfortable. My very favorite part was opening the sliding glass doors to find a large balcony\" looking out\" onto a huge courtyard, with a view of some plush homes on the hillside nearby. It was as if we were actually on the French Riviera. Our room was on the 3rd floor, and we couldn't have been happier. Instead of putting a tag on the doorknob for privacy or service needed, you punch a button that lights up in the hallway next to the door. Green light-room needs cleaning/ Red light-privacy please. Brillant idea! Because we had eaten a late lunch before checking in, we decided to order room service for a change. It was tasty, delivered promptly on a cart with a white tablecloth and flowers, and just nice to enjoy our room that night. This was the only good food we had from the hotel. The next morning, after getting espressos from the hotel coffee bar, we decided to \"take a tour\".The property is so large, that it took us about 2 hours just to walk around ! We kept saying \"Wow\" over and over. The golf course is right next door, and there are some privately owned Villa style homes adjacent to the main building. If any of you are planning a very special wedding, I'd highly recommend the Grand del Mar!They have a quaint European style chapel right on the property, and many rooms to choose for a reception, not to mention the outside covered areas with fireplaces and firepits.. You will be \"living like Royalty\" ! There is an olympic size \"adult's only\" pool, which is next to the hotel spa. Servers bring out chair cushions, towels, and drinks/snacks.The family pool was in another area, and the children seemed to be having a great time. We stayed at the adult pool, then took a walk on the path that goes around the property-peaceful, quiet, and as if we were in Tuscany. The only disappointing part of this visit was the food in the restaurants. We ate lunch at the golf club, sitting outside to enjoy the cool,\" sunshiny\" day. Our cocktails were fine, but the fish tacos were terrible, and I mean awful ! There were 4 small uncooked white shells, with a few morsels of grilled fish on each, topped by some tasteless white cabbage. No pico de gallo, no sour cream, no guacamole, no red cabbage or special sauce, It was bland and tasteless. We were very disappointed. That evening we ate at one of the hotel restaurants, and again were very disappointed in the food. It was nice sitting outside near a firepit, being able to gaze at the moon and stars, and smell the fresh air. However I could barely finish my dinner. To be honest, I don't even remember what I had, and my husband call tell you that I can verbally recite every superb meal I have ever had, even 20 years ago, in full detail. Both of us disappointed again. If we are in the area again we will definitely splurge (over $400.00 a night) for two nights and stay here again, but will go elsewhere for lunch and dinner. You may want to \"check out\" on the internet nearby places to eat that are good. The concierges were extremely friendly and efficient, but were hesitant to recommend nearby restaurants. Naturally the hotel wants visitors to stay there and eat at the hotel's restaurants.. Everything was expensive, and the food just wasn't worth the high price. We \"saved up\" a few years ago to stay at the Highlands Inn in Carmel, which was romantic and unique, and now we also have special memories of this\" splurge stay\" at the Grand del Mar. Special place!

We have a 2 and a half year old toddler, and so it was important for us to stay at a place that was both fun and relaxing. The grounds and the rooms are lavishly decorated, but not over the top... Our room was extremely comfortable with a wonderful bathroom and a view onto the courtyard. We ate salted caramel gelato every afternoon from their caf\u00c3\u00a9.

They used Peerless Coffee, and I am going to look up the site to buy some more after writing this review. The fitness center was great. It could be better lit (I \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in terms of spa-ambience). They had lots of room and equipment.

Outside the US, Exclusive Resorts -Costa Rica still beats it, but I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of the other amenities and amazing food we had in Costa Rica (see below). A few things to work on: 1.The Amaya restaurant is okay at best. A little too bland and the portions too big when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying so hard. I ate the crab cakes benedict and it was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 meh. That said, the staff was amazing with our son. They were so incredibly nice to him. I felt that they instinctively knew where the power really was in the family! The kids menu was simple and wonderful, and therefore, actually better than the adult menu. I think that Amaya would do well to focus on excellent.simple.organic.food. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if the prices stayed the same. 2.The staff at Club M could be a little more courteous. They seemed to be disconnected with the other eating establishments on the grounds in terms of quality of service. (A very hilarious side-note about the perception of Club M by my local friends from La Jolla\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 They referred to Club M as the perfect pouncing territory for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cougars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and golf caddies. So funny.) 3.We did valet every day/night. Complete ignorance on our part, but they had a garage conveniently attached to the hotel. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find this out until our very last night. It was truly a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153duh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment. FYI: $25 per night. 4.The place is HUGE. It took me 2 days to finally understand how to get back to my room. I think it would be a great investment to work on better signage and the map provided to guests. Every hallway looked the exact same (gorgeous framed tile and oil paintings of sheep), it was a little freaky at first\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but then I figured out the maze\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExcellent property...feels long established even open only 2 months\u201d", "Author": "Roselle N", "ReviewID": "UR120005208", "Content": "I had a recent business trip to the Grand Del Mar and found this new property to be a gem.

I tend to rate hotels based more on staff than amenities, so I will say that I received the BEST service at this hotel... at least as good as any hotel I've ever been in... and I have been in the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong, the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon (Hong Kong), Intercontinentals, Four Seasons, etc. Every person we came into contact with were both courteous and respectful. When they happened to ask you if you needed something, and you did NOT need something, they neither push for you to ask them if you need anything nor do they make you feel like you're wasting their time by sitting in their area and not doing anything. (it's a subtle line that they all seemed to do very well) Our family of three went (me, wife and 18 month old son) and they included a wooden crib in the room. When I had made the reservation, I included our son's name, and the crib had bedding that was geared toward boys. They also included a small bag of bath materials for babies, including soap, wash clothes, and toys ... these were complimentary. a VERY nice touch! Complimentary bottles of water were included in the room. They have 4 pools.... 1 adults only (18 and over), 2 large family friendly pools, and 1 smaller pool that is only 1 foot deep -- great for kids / babies. This is GREAT for kids. And yet, you never ever feel like this is a pool for families with kids running around. They seem to treat everyone like an adult with admiration and respect -- even our 18 month old! Upon checkout, they gave our son a small beanie baby toy. another great touch! We stayed in a Prado suite overlooking the golf course... it seems as though originally they were two individual rooms, and they knocked out a doorway.

The shops are overpriced, and there is not much to do there... We went to Sea World the next day and it was only about a 15 minute drive. I recommend checking in early, using the pool or spa or whatever relaxation facilities you'd like to use... enjoy the grounds, enjoy the hotel. Then the next day you can go off and explore or enjoy the San Diego activities as much as you like. It's not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of San Diego, and it's not near the beach...but in my opinion, as long as you'll have this to come back to at the end of the activity filled day, you really can't go wrong.

This is our second visit, but on the first we were with a corporate group, so we did not really get to experience the full treatment until this visit. We are already trying to figure out how we can get back here soon. My take on the place Resort - smacks of luxury from the moment you hit the gate and the long drive up the canyon. While located in an area that has various subdivisions, you never know it once you get on the property (save the homes dotting the ridgelines on either side). Fantastic golf course, tennis courts and pool areas - one adult, 3 family pools. Furnishings, marble, layout, lobby, restaurants, lounge - everything is done exceptionally well. A friend commented that some fine European resorts have taken decades to acheive the level that the GDM has achieved in only a few years. Service - top shelf. From the valet, to check in, the bell hop, everyone is just super. The teenagers wanted smores and they did not have any. Problem? Nope, they loaded them into the house car and off to the 24 hour Vons for smores fixins. Needless to say, the kids are ruined for life, but heck, its vacation. Room- We had a Prado suite which was even better than we hoped for. 1 bedroom suite, but the trick is it has 2 full size bathrooms. Critical when traveling with a teenage girl and a wife who each have their own bathroom routine. I would not get a bigger suite if it did not have that second batroom. Kid is on a pull out, but she says its actually more comfortable than she expected, Furnishings and details inside are all top shelf as well, Only letdown for the device laden family we are - not enough outlets! Food - Did not try their 5 star offering, Addison, but the Amaya was great. See separate review for it, Even the appetizers by the pool were well done. Wine list in the lounge is also quite good. Excellent list of single malts and they have cigars as well as a smoking balcony. Activities - you name it, they have it. Concierge arranged kayaking, snorkleing, horseback riding on the trails surrounding the resort, a beach trip (complete with umbrella, charis etc.). First class all around. I am a runner and if you like trail running you are in luck. The resorts own Shaw Trail connects into the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve on the other side of the south ridge. Lots of climbing but world class trail running, mountain biking and equestrian trails, Fitness Center - very, very good.

We take a family trip each year and have visited Maui (Kea Lani and Ritz Carlton), Grand Caymon (Ritz Carlton), and taken a Mediterranean and Alaskan Cruise with post-cruise stays at Four Seasons Vancouver. The level of service we received during our stay from top to bottom was head and shoulders above the rest. Upon arrival you immediately feel welcome and at check-in we helped ourselves to a snack of cookies and fruit juice and the delivery of our luggage was very prompt. A call to Housekeeping for more hangars took about five minutes at the most and they provided me with more than I requested. As we walked the beautiful grounds we were immediately relaxed and took in all of the scenic lawns, gardens and firepit areas. Our room was on the second floor (three floors total) and overlooked one of the firepit areas which I noticed in the evening would be popular with guests quietly sipping a glass of wine or just visiting. Each morning my husband and I would play tennis on one of their two courts and either had breakfast at Club M on the weekend or grabbed a quick bite at the Cent Anni Cafe. If looking for a quick and less expensive option, visit Cent Anni as one morning I had a bowl of oatmeal for $5, I believe, and it was served on white china with brown sugar, almonds, and raisins. Others in the family said that the sandwiches served there were delicious. Several of us also enjoyed Amaya for breakfast and dinner as well as the poolside lunch service. We did not try Addison. A few examples of their exemplary service include: 1. Opening Gift Shop up at 10 p.m. so that my niece could get aloe vera for her sunburn. 2. Locating a family member's cane which was lost somewhere within the Resort. 3. Delivering contact solution to another niece who forgot to pack hers in the suitcase. 4. Reserving a few areas for family pics taken by a photographer on our last day. I could go on and on but each and every Grand Del Mar staff member had an attitude of \"How may I help you\" and \"We can get that done\". The rooms are gorgeous and we loved the window which opens (or can be shut at night) between the bedroom and bathroom and, of course, my husband loved the tv built into the bathroom mirror. Housekeeping was very efficient and the chocolate covered oreos and gourmet chocolates left on the bed at night were a very nice touch as well as the comp. bottled water. Also, the beds were ultra-comfy. Mid-week they knocked on the door to switch out the padded seat cushions for our balcony chairs. They almost seem to anticipate your needs. One afternoon they set up tables, chairs, and umbrellas to present a wildlife display for the kids with an armadillo, boa constrictor, horned bull frog among others which amused not only my younger nieces and nephews but a few of the adults as well. The fresh lemonade served to all was a nice touch. The amount of activities available within the resort could keep you busy; however, if visiting the area for the first time you will want to visit the Zoo, Legoland, downtown San Diego, etc. They will provide you with precise directions if you drive anywhere or if it is within fourteen miles they can provide comp. car service. It is best to plan ahead so that you are able to reserve the shuttle or car service as I believe quite a few make use of this attractive amenity. Have to mention the mini hot tub for the kiddies. So cute and popular with my nieces and nephews. In closing the Grand Del Mar is the place to stay whether you just want to relax or as a base for sightseeing. We drove south to downtown San Diego and north to Carlsbad and both places took appr. 25-28 minutes as long as we were not driving during rush hour traffic. La Jolla is very close (fifteen minutes) and the village of Del Mar has a lot of nice restaurants and is a twelve minute drive. We went in between the San Diego Fair and Del Mar Thoroughbread Racing Season so traffic was not as congested.

It is attempting to be more gastronomic than it truly was. I think a different type of menu would be a good contrast to having the highly rated Addison and the chef isn't up to the menu presented. Also, the management of the restaurant was a bit off. We were kept waiting for 30 minutes for our reservation one night, yet there were many empty tables. Also, the large banquettes inside are horrible, awkward shapes for conversation with spotlights beaming down. The only people I would imagine enjoying these are the middle aged men with their 20 something mall chick girlfriends who were seated in two of them one night we were there. I guess they like to show off their...um...\"catch\" or that they can still \"catch\" something? Anyway, I didn't like Amaya but I loved everything else at the hotel.

I loved most things about this hotel and we plan to return to stay here again. Most of all I liked the friendly staff. When you travel with two children you can always tell if the staff is trained to be kind and helpful to children. This staff has had top training and are wonderful. The rooms are very nice despite the decor which is fake Italian (i.e. mirrors made to look worn and distressed and lights made to look like dripping candles). It is true that you have to walk down endless hallways to get to them but they are nice. I asked not to have any air fresheners placed in our room and they listened. We had a little porch with two chairs facing a golf course. My father had a porch (facing a pretty garden) that was too small for even one chair. A big plus would be an addition of screened doors for the porch because it would be nice to have the fresh air without getting mosquitos in the room. The family pool is not huge but is large enough when the hotel is not too busy. We had it almost to ourselves in April. The landscaping is attractive. The staff is helpful with towels, etc. The first time we used the pool the staff started to clean with a loud smelly machine and we left. I thought they might have waited until it was empty. Also, there was a bit of a mold problem around the pool drain areas that needed to be attended to. The Amaya restaurant is a great place for breakfast and we tried to go there every morning. We liked to sit on their outdoor terrace. The waiters give top notch service and are super friendly. My kids loved the pancakes and the adults liked the salmon bagels. All were happy with the fresh squeezed orange juice. Once the gardner came around just as we sat down and kept mowing the same patch of grass in front of the restaurant. After several of our requests to make him stop a staff person finally went over to ask him to leave. The hotel should arrange that gardeners come after breakfast and before lunch to work in that area. At night the hotel provides a variety of musical entertainers. We stayed up one night to listen to an older guy with a great voice play piano and sing standards. He even obliged us with a request for Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" complete with harmonica. The hotel has several walks on it's property and the surrounding area. We were lead by one of the staff to the beginning of two trails that started past the horse stables. We walked on the one that turned right (the less traveled one) and soon noticed that there were ticks crawling all over every one of us! Disgusting. We felt that the hotel should warn the guests that they have a tick problem on these paths and told them so when we returned to shower and change. We took a stroll around the hotel property and were surprised when a dog came barking out of a ground floor room. The owners stopped it before it reached us. It made me think that I would not be very pleased to have a dog barking in a room near me. Not relaxing. The spa is good one. My daughter and I went for a massage at the same time. She liked hers (my only complaint with hers was that the lady had a cold) and I liked mine. For Easter the hotel made it fun for kids by having an egg hunt and other activities. Advice to fellow travelers: stay at this place if you want a relaxed and upscale hotel with great service. Advice for the hotel: Get rid of that awful scented candle that is in the lobby area. It smells very artificial. Also, please get rid of all the fake books and yard sale non-English books that are glued together in the \"library\" area. Instead, get real books in English that guests can read while visiting you and leave for others.

We have stayed at many amazing resorts, including (to name a few, but not limited to....) Four Seasons in many locations, Ritz, Capella Pedregal in Cabo, Kea Lani in Maui, many locations in Italy, Trump and Penninsula in Chicago, Atlantis in Bahamas, the Fountain Blue in Miami and most of the high end resorts in Vegas, and the Grand Del Mar is our favorite by far. We were back for our second visit and brought our friends who are also very well travelled and they were completely blown away. The resort is independantly owned and the owner lives in a home on the grounds. You can tell he (Doug) has amazing pride. Every detail was thought through. The first time we stayed here was in terrace room at the adult pool and my husband and I had a wonderful stay. This time we were with our family (3 children-4, 6, and 8) and our friends who also have 2 children. We rented a villa and it was completely rock star. Totally worth the nightly rate and we will be back many times. I am already planning my 40th birthday party there for a destination party with friends. Tennis (most amazing tennis pavillion with great instructors-both Rick and Lynn are great! I have played with both of them and I have gone on tennis trips to saddle brook in tampa), amazing golf course, the kids love the explorers club (free to villa guests), great pools, fire pits all over the resort, and a brand new equestiran center with beautiful retired race horses. We did a group lesson with the kids and a trail ride-very beautiful and the kids loved it and it is steps away from the family pool. We had a meal cooked for us in the villa on the grill and Matt from Amaya was a pleasure to work with and his staff was friendly (jose was great!) and the chef prepared our steaks and sea bass to perfection. what a treat that night was!! The resort will provide a car for you within 15 miles-so you can get to del mar or la jolla for a nice dinner out. For those travelling with kids-legoland was only 20 minutes away and we didnt scratch the surface of all the san diego sites..... We worked with Amanda to plan our stay and activies and she was a complete delight. She was totally accomodating even though we kept changing our minds on daily schedules and activies. I can't say enough. If you can get there either as a couple (I did a spa day the first time I visited and it was amazing!!!) or as a family.....it is a hidden treasure. You will be completely blown away by the beauty of the grounds. If you can swing a villa, the most amazing vacation rental villa I have stepped into....I could go on and on, but totally perfect. My only feedback to management (if they read this) is when you build another phase of villas--PLEASE make them four bedrooms!!! 5000 square feet.....you should have accomodations for 2 families....3 bedrooms just is difficult. That said, it was our favorite spring break and we will be back again and again and again...and if you build a four bedroom villa, we will buy a fractrional share...promise. Thanks for a wonderful trip to the entire staff at the Grand del Mar-especially Amanda, Jon, Jose, Rick and everyone who helped make it a memorable trip!!! Absolutely 5 stars....all the way.... oh, I forgot to mention Amaya...delish!!!! and the workout room was top notch...and our kids loved the explorers club--totatly clean with tons to do!!!

Even when the hotel was full with a large group, it didn't feel jammed and the staff was still highly responsive to every request, maintaining a stellar attitude across the board. The Grand Del Mar even lacked the usual nickel-and-dime attitude of most hotels. For instance: they don't charge for fitness classes or tennis court time; and there's a small, reasonably priced cafe open 6am-6pm for those early morning lattes and light fare for the kids.

The Grand Del Mar was the best hotel of our trip by a clear country mile. The level of professionalism from the staff was truly amazing and I would return in a shot. The location is peaceful but only 20 minutes from downtown San Diego. The resort grounds are sprawling and gardens and pool areas are beautiful. Although it is clearly a modern hotel, the grounds are beginning to look well established and the pool areas are great. Different areas for couples and families so everyone can relax. The decor is over the top opulent which works really well in the public areas but is maybe a bit too much in the bedrooms but the rooms were spacious, quiet and exceptionally well equipped (great to have a Nespresso machine). What really sets this hotel apart is the service. Before arriving, we were contacted by a very helpful guest services manager who arranged a meal and taxi transportation for New Year's Eve over a week before we arrived. On arrival (it was our birthday), we received sparkling wine and a cake in the room. On New Year's Eve every guest was offered a complimentary bottle of wine from the in-room bar. You cannot imagine how surprised we were when my wife threw her deodorant in the bin before breakfast one morning, to find two new deodorants and a compliments card on the counter when we returned to the room. In short, they have an exceptionally well trained staff who really go out of their way to anticipate your needs. We were really pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and wine in the hotel. Amaya is no casual bistro and every meal we ate there was beautiful. We particularly appreciated the very well priced kids menu and the fact that we could enjoy fine dining with our children as a family. The restaurant staff were extremely professional and all remebered our names. This is despite the fact that this is a large resort. Attention to detail is superb. What I really appreciated was the fact that although this is not a cheap hotel, I never felt we were over-charged for anything. If you wanted a light breakfast, there was a take-away coffee shop and the prices for food and drinks were very reasonable, the quality superb. Both my sons spent an afternoon at the kids club where the staff actually made things with them and played games rather than leaving them to get on with it with the playstation. My only criticism was that the valets were not the most charming or professional. They were prompt, but didn't have the same attitude as the rest of the staff.

The resort is right near Del Mar and La Jolla and I was able to visit the Birch Aquarium and relax in a beautiful spot on the beach. ROOMS - the rooms at the resort are enormous (see photos). I had a standard room that overlooked a nice courtyard. I found the bed to be very comfortable and the room, quiet. There were several plush pillows on the bed which were a mix of soft and slightly firmer, giving you a choice without having to call the conceirge. I slept very well throughout the week. The room had plenty of space for all of my belongings, so I was able to unpack everything when I arrived. I used my laptop throughout the week- the resort's wireless internet was very fast and easy to connect to. The patio was small, but comfortable and no matter where your room is in the resort, it offers a nice view. FOOD - Although I am a picky eater and have several food allergies, the food was superb and the staff was more than willing to customize any meal that I ordered. The menus offer many different options and one of the best things is that there is a cafe where you can order sandwiches, cookies, smoothies, coffee and gelato. This made it easy when I wanted to grab a quick bite and carry it anywhere on the resort to eat. MEETING FACILITIES - The meeting facilities were excellent and the staff went above and beyond to make sure that everything went as planned without any issues. They offered flexible options for meals, meeting space, A/V and other amenities that a group may be looking for. I saw some pictures from weddings that took place there and they were just gorgeous.

A few negatives: The room service was a little spotty. We got a salad one night with hair in it. When we told the In room dining, they sent us a new one and removed the charge from our bill. One morning I got caffeinated tea when I asked for decaf and an opened and used mini jam jar! gross. Another negative was in the design of the hotel- nothing to do with the staff- but it is really long and spread out. This would be fine if you could drive your car to the part of the hotel you were staying in or the rooms were in little bungalows. Our room was at the far end of the hotel from the lobby/valet/ restaurants so it took FOREVER to walk down the never ending halls to our room. Especially carpeted halls in high heels. It was a little creepy too because there were no windows, it was just hall after hall... I did not like this. Also they had live music Wed- Sat night (a plus- it was pretty good) but it seamed to attract a very elderly crowd so it was not very lively.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary,Alberta,canada", "Title": "\u201cperfect little getaway\u201d", "Author": "abdott", "ReviewID": "UR89209802", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from a three night stay in heaven!!!

The relaxation pool is great -adult only and no mobiles. The only problem was the pool staff were a little too relaxed themselves. Sometimes you wouldn't see them for a long time (they seem to hide inside somehwere). When they were there you had to ask for iced water and refills. I would have expected them to be a bit more proactive! Secondly we had dinner one night in Amaya and after we were seated we were completely forgotten about for at least 20 minutes despite 4 waiters being in that part of the restaurant. We later established that the lady that seated us forgot to tell the waiters. They apologised and offered us drinks or dessert but left a bad feeling.The food in the restaurant is lovely though. All in all a great hotel. The coffee shop is great for snacks and drinks in the day when you dont want to have a meal.

This year after reading a number of reviews, and after correspondance with the Hotel we chose to stay here. Whilst a little more than we wanted to pay we made sacrifices elsewhere so that we could stay within our overall budget.(We were on a three week road trip). In summary: Pre-visit: We had excellent correspondance with Brianne and Josh in the Sales team ahead of our visit, with Brianne in particular helping to arrange restuarants, and Josh making a number of valuable recomendations. They continued to offer support and excellent service throughout our stay. Check in and arrival: After speaking with the hotel team we arrived at 12.30PM knowing that we could use the facilities whilst waiting for the room to be made ready. The valet, and Bell Boys did a great job and our first impression was extremely positive! The check in team were equally welcoming, and promised to get a \"rush on\" so that we could be in our room quickly. One we were told was almost ready. Great we thought, albeit the early check in did not arise, and I had to chase up the front office team. Jon the Front Office Manager got involved and recognised that there was a problem and made great efforts to get us into our room, and ensured that we recieved excellent service whilst waiting. This excellent service continued for the duration of the stay. Room: Many of the reviews on here \"wax lyrical\" about the rooms and we concur with all the positive comments. Hotel and facilities: The Swimming Pool, Spa, and Gym were first class, with the Service around the Pool the best we've come across. Jason and the team ensured a pleasant and restful time was add. Restuarants: With the exception of Addison we ate and drank at all of the Bars and Restaurants. We personally prefered breakfast at the Golf Club, Lunch by the pool, and Evening Meal at the Golf Club or in Amaya. We finished most nights in the wonderful bar area with a cocktail. At each location the Service was excellent and the Food Quality befitting of a Five Star Hotel! Golf: Whilst staying at the Hotel we played at Torrey Pines, and at the Grand Del Mar. The course here was in better shape, and a real test of Golf. All the staff associated with the Golf course were a credit to the Hotel. We particularly enjoyed using the practice facilties. General: What made an excellent stay into an unforgettable experience were the little extras. From the gifts in the room for special occasions to the courtesy car which we took advantage of. As mentioned by many what sets this hotel apart is the Service provided by the finest staff that i've come across on my travels. All of the Staff we encountered genuinely appeared to enjoy working here, and took great pride in the Service we offered.

We went into their website and after viewing the property immediately booked two nights. Upon arriving at the front gate of the complex we were checked by a security guard and given a valet parking ticket and allowed to enter. The driveway up to the complex and surrounding areas was stunning with the golf course around us. Driving up through the gates to the Hotel it was simply stunning, with the helicopter pad on one side and such lush gardens and surrounds. We were welcomed warmly in the driveway and our bags uppacked and taken to our rooms while we checked in and were offered wonderful home made lemonade. A wedding party was arriving as we checked it and the area was crowded but it didnt take away from gorgeous public rooms and flower arrangements. Check in was efficient and in fact at that time we had hardly seen any of the hotel other than the grounds and foyer but we immediately felt that we wanted to have our \"spare night\" at this property. We had booked a Grand King room, with breakfast each day (up to the value of $65usdollars) and this included valet parking and 20% off any retail products we purchased, it also came with an upgrade room. The hotel is gorgeous and we had an unbelivable room, with an enormeous bathroom, huge tub, double sink and plenty of vanity space, huge shower, separate toilet and walk in robe off the bathroom area. The hallway also had a wonderful timber wall unit with glass cabinets that held the glasses and mini bar products and also had a sink and water as well as the standard mini bar fridge, the good thing was it was not one of those automated ones, so we could store our own beverages in there, and as we still had champagne form our trip to the Napa Valley this came in handy. Also a bottle of champagne and a special desert was delivered to our room with a note from the manager wishing us a Happy 25th Wedding anniversay - very nice touch. The room was large and well appointed with a king bed, a separate make up dressing table, a large plasma tv another desk area and a lounge chair. Stepping out through glass patio doors we had a little patio area with chairs and table (although one chair was missing they soon found it). From there we went out a little gate and three steps later were at the Adults only pool. It was wonderful to have a pool for adults only as well as a spa as not everyone has children and in such a wonderful relaxing resorts its nice to have quiet time without other peoples children intruding on your quiet time. The family pool area was on the other side of the complex. The service from all the staff was exceptional and particulary around the pool area, where staff provided complimentary magazines, sun glasses, sun tan lotion, bottled water and frozen grapes. The restaurants are amazing. Amaya has wonderful fire places and great food try the lobster bisque and their other lobster signature dish, it was so good we had it two nights out of the three we were there. The other night we ate at their fine dining restuarant Addisons. The meal was wonderful and the service exceptional and also for a quality signature restaurant very reasonably priced compared to some of the other signature restaurants we have been in our trip. The hotel has a complimentary car service that takes guests anywhere they want with in 14 mile radious and we used this service to go into La Jolla, but they also took us a few mintues down the road to the restaurant in a lovely mercedes and then collected us after our meal. The hotel and its facilities were so wonderful that we didnt even get into San Diego we just enjoyed the resort so much and as we had been away almost eight weeks at this stage we deserved the well earned down time. If you dont have valet parking included in your room rate its a very reasonable $15.USD per day. This is one very special hotel and golf club and we will definately be back. We have decided never to stay in LA again but to hire a car and drive the two hours to Del Mar before we have to fly back to Australia. Amazing staff especially the boys at the front in valet parking, how they always remembered out names was amazing. A truly special experience.

We were drawn to the hotel as it had great suites, was family friendly and had supposedly had amazing service. Before we traveled, we received an email from the hotel's guest services asking us more details about our stay so that they could accomodate any requests. We requested a crib and a high chair and early check in since check in was scheduled for 4pm and we were arriving around noon. I was pleased to see the email from guest services as it seemed to set a nice tone for our arrival. When we arrived (around 1:30pm), we were told our room wasn't ready. We were a little disappointed but didn't really mind waiting. When I asked how long it would be, she said she would request a \"rush\" on the room for us. I also noticed that our room rate was incorrect and showed them a print out of our confirmation with our room rate. They said they would have to check with a manager. An hour and 45 minutes later, I checked in with the front desk again to see if our room was ready and they said they were just finishing up. Another 45 minutes after that (at 4pm...normal check in time), our room was available. Since we had our 2 small children, a 2 and 1/2 hr wait and the \"rush\" that the front desk promised but we didn't seem to get, set a bad tone for the rest of the stay. I later received a call from the hotel stating that the manager would \"honor\" my confirmed rate which I found the the way they handled it funny because they acted as if they were doing us a favor even though I had print out of our confirmation clearly stating what our booked rate was. We stayed in a Prado suite and the room was great. They also had cute animal travel neck pillows as gifts for our children which was a nice touch. The pools were great and they would bring out complimentary treats (mini oreo shakes, frozen pineapple). The hotel had turndown service which included bottled water until we received a used bottle of water. We also had breakfast at Amaya (brioche french toast was probably the best we've ever had)...service was great until the server just forgot about us and forgot to bring us our bill. Finally to top off the trip, when we got home, the bill was incorrect and I had to contact them as they overcharged us. Overall, we were very disappointed in our stay especially considering we're paying $700/night. The staff was all very friendly, but they just didn't deliver or we were just plagued with really really bad luck. We've stayed a the four seasons normally, and we'll probably stick to them as their service is impeccable.

We booked a different hotel for our last three nights in San Diego but wished we had just stayed at the Grand del Mar as it was a fantastic experience. We were stunned by the level of service at this hotel. Most of the staff could not do enough to help you and constantly offered us service above and beyond that required. We were very impressed by the room. It was extremely comfortable and quiet and exceptionally well cleaned. The bathtub and shower were both large and comfortable. More water pressure would be nice in the shower but I do understand the need to conserve water. The public areas of the hotel are very attractive as well. We played golf on the very nice golf course. Fortunately we were able to get the twilight rate as the regular rate is extremely expensive. The golf course was empty and I suspect that is because of the high prices. If you are willing to pay to golf bring your own clubs because the rentals are $85 for a round which is very steep. I spent two wonderful afternoons at the tranquility pool and enjoyed it very much. A chair cover and towels are laid out for you when you arrive and you will be offered a glass of ice water as well. Through out the day small drinks and frozen grapes are also offered. I had lunch out at the pool one afternoon and while good it was not worth $25 for a salad and a diet coke. There is a sign restricting access to adults only. For some reason a number of families ignored this and walked through but none stayed. There is also a sign stating no cell phones but most (to my disgust!) also chose to ignore this. It is not very tranquil to have a loud one-sided conversion going on beside you. The polite people got up and left the area when they got a call. I would love to see people leave the phones in their rooms and enjoy an afternoon not connected. I had breakfast at the resort three mornings and was shocked by the prices. The orange juice was the best I have ever had but at $6 it should be. One day my breakfast was $34 including a tip for an omlet, coffee and juice (yes that is the price for one person). The service is outstanding but this is too much for a meal. Breakfast at the golf course grill is a better deal and just as tasty with the added bonus of the view of the course. The resort is quite a distance from other restaurants or I would have left the resort for my meals because of the excessive prices. Overall it is a fantastic hotel with great service but the extras such as food and golf are too high even for a high end resort.

Set on a hillside overlooking a golf course, this Italian styled hotel is a treasure of a modern day hotel done beautifully to mimic an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Old World\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European grand hotel. From the moment you enter the hotel, you will be impressed with the grandeur of the hotel and of the amazing architectural details used, that clearly show that no corners were cut when building this almost new hotel. All the standard rooms seem to be the same, just with different views. We had a Fairway view room that overlooked a garden courtyard with the fairway off in the distance. The room was very large, formal but with modern touches. Once again the details in the room were impressive including extra moldings, ceiling stencils, and antique air vents. All the furniture was comfortable including the spacious curved couch that gave a splash of modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor, in an otherwise more traditionally elegant room setting. The large bathroom was full of marble and included a deep soaking tub, separate shower, and separate water closet. There were also three mirrors framed with faux gold edges that some may consider over the top d\u00c3\u00a9cor. This type of thing pops up in a few areas of the hotel. Our only complaint about the room was that the balcony did not have any furniture to sit outside and enjoy the view. It seemed that most balconies at the hotel lacked furniture. All the public areas of the hotel are stunning, some with amazing woodwork. It is all very impressive and fun just to walk around and discover each room and area of the hotel. The hotel information states that the design of the hotel is modeled after the work of Addison Minzer, the famed Palm Beach architect of The Breakers, and it is easy to see why. The exterior of the hotel is also very attractive. Walking around the hotel property is a must and it gives you the chance to enjoy the fountains, statues, and even an antique fire truck. The overall effect is a luxury old European resort, but completely modern and in excellent shape. We had breakfast each morning in Amaya which is a little less formal looking then other areas of the hotel and has outdoor seating available. The food and service were very good. We used the adult lap pool which is in a nice courtyard surrounded by the hotel on three sides. The family pools are in a more open area with nice views of the hillside and golf course. The gym is very nice with enough equipment to complete a full workout. Next to the gym is a full luxurious spa that is only available for a fee if you are not having a treatment. Since the hotel provides free internet, it is an even trade I guess. Although the hotel is not near anything, everything is easy to get to within a half an hour. We enjoyed making our way back at the end of our day to a beautiful and quiet oasis that was well worth a little extra drive. Not to be left out was the always friendly and helpful staff.

I suspect the food at the Addison, the adult dining spot in the resort, would be much better. Additionally, the drive to downtown San Diego is close to 30 to 45 minutes depending on traffic.

I rang the front desk to explain our concerns and express our unhappiness with all the noise from children etc, they were not one bit helpful or offering us alternative accommodation in the hotel, so i informed them we would be checking out two days earlier. On check out day the guy at the front desk was nothing but down right rude to us. I was just so disappointed this was part of our honeymoon and they'd taken the good out of it for us.

It was the perfect place to have a vacation with our 5-year old children. The Grounds of this Hotel are breathtaking. The scenery is lush and interesting, and the Hotel itself is extremely luxurious. We booked a Prado Suite and were blown away by the two huge \"Master\" Bathrooms. They really add a \"wow\" factor to the Suite. High quallity furnishings throughout the property. Our children enjoyed the well stocked Explorer's Club and Adriana and her team do a great job with their young charges. There are a vast assortment of restaurants within a short distance from the property, and LEGOLAND and the Zoo are about 25 minute drive. We enjoyed breakfast every morning at AMAYA. The food quality was consistently good, but not exceptional. Yes, the Hotel is definitely grand and beautiful, but the most impressive part of it, is the SERVICE! The Concierge Team is terrific. I asked Lynette about tickets for LEGOLAND, she not only gave me prices and directions, she printed out all of the height restrictions for the various rides, so my 5-year olds could plan their day! Eugenia & Samuel were equally helpful, all of the time. We had just spent 5 nights at the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco and I would say the Concierge Team at this property far exceeded the service level offered at the Ritz. The Children found lovely toys waiting for them in the Room when we checked in, and their names spelt out in bath sponges, which thrilled them. Every day, we received an edible treat in our Suite. Fruit, chocolates, macaroons... Bryan, the Greeters and the Valet Guys were always courteous, gave great restaurant recommendations and offered cold bottled water whenever we got into our car. The Family Pool area was also enjoyable. Wish I had the time for a Spa trip, but hopefully on our next visit. I had previously booked the Four Seasons Aviara for this trip, and then changed our reservations to the Grand Del Mar.

I'll assure you, we are foodies and quite picky when it comes to restaurant food, so I don't make this recommendation lightly. The food at Amaya is good but not in league with Addison.

Above all, remember that if a mistake is made with your order or with the service, let the manager know and he or she will be sure that you are happy or compensated for your trouble.

In the words of the in-room guest book: \"...inspired by the rich, decorative arts of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Morroco\"; \"colorful palette, graceful arched doorways, rotundas, vibrant tile, wood-beamed ceilings, ornate stone and wrought-iron accents, decorative columns, parquet flooring and gracious verandas.\". More simply put, you walk in and say \"Wow!\" - several times. First impressions were exceptional, from the eucalyptus-scented hand towels presented at the front desk during check-in, to the fresh lemonade, iced tea, and cookies and huge, aromatic, floral arrangement in the lobby. The concierge desk was very nice and helpful, especially Gabrielle and Lynette. We asked their advice every day. We requested and got a room with a fairway (golf course) view - the one downside is there's only a standing balcony, with insufficient room for chairs to sit and enjoy the view. We found the room to be very luxurious - all the amenities you could possibly want and more. The room (389) had a great layout, including a bathroom with a huge tub, two sinks, separate shower and toilet, and a folding window above the tub that opens into the main bedroom. There are lots of subtle, sometimes hidden extras, like a vanity with a top that opens up to reveal a large mirror and provide a compartment for your wife's things. The bedroom offered plenty of drawer space, slide-out table tops, a beautiful corner couch, cushions, and ottoman for relaxing, and a large flat screen TV on the wall. Two newspapers were delivered to the room each day, and we were asked if we wanted any others. Valet parking is the only available option, and they charge quite a bit for it ($30 plus tips). I complained because I didn't see this spelled out up front until my reservation was confirmed - the resort very kindly said they would waive the fee. Each time you leave the premises, the valet offers bottles of cold water for the road. Nice. A plus for us was that we rarely heard or saw any other people in the adjacent rooms - either the walls are nice and thick or no one was in them. A couple of relatively minor downsides: We only got turndown service on the first night of our four night stay. Not sure why. We loved it when we got it. We were offered and accepted an in-room coffee maker, but housekeeping just didn't seem to know how to handle this extra. They consistently failed to clean and provision it, even bringing coffee bags without filters on the last day. On a similar note, we requested extra towels (to their credit, the hotel asks before you arrive), but housekeeping had to be reminded to keep replacing them. We used in-room dining several times, but got tired of it. Would have liked some simpler, less \"frou frou\" options to choose from. We switched to muffins from the coffee shop (Cent'Anni) for the last couple of mornings. Speaking of dining, we opted not to eat at their highly touted restaurant, Addison - settling instead for \"second best\", Amaya. It was fine - great decor, nice waiters, good food, very classy - frankly it was hard for us to believe Amaya wasn't the best! I can't emphasize enough how pleasant and accommodating the staff was. We had the feeling they would do anything within their power to make our stay a nice one (and they succeeded). Also, the resort is absolutely beautiful. Be forewarned, though - it's about a half hour drive north of San Diego just off I-5, so it's not right in the heart of the city if that's what you're looking for. We loved it!", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular!!\u201d", "Author": "kissell_8", "ReviewID": "UR20729881", "Content": "We just returned from a 4 night stay at this resort, and it is easily one of the best resorts we have stayed at-worldwide. I only learned of the resort while researching private golf clubs in the area, and was directed to the resort site. We have stayed or visited the 4 Seasons, LA Quinta, Rancho Bernardo, etc., and our experience at the Del Mar far exceeded any experience we have had at any of those. From check in, we were treated like royalty. Our trip was planned for our anniversary, and they not only knew of the event, they knew what year anniversary it was (not sure how they figured that out yet). We were given an upgraded room overlooking the quiet spa pool. The room/suite was beautiful; the amenities were top notch (4 flat screens, enormous bathrooms, comfortable furniture, great bed, etc.). The room was extremely quiet, we never felt crowded or rushed, and the service staff and employees are extremely polite and helpful, knew us by name, and catered to us. Also, we were surprised by a very generous gift for our anniversary the first night. We decided to take the \"shuttle\" to La Jolla the first evening. The shuttle is a Mercedes S550! There was no fee, no charge, the driver was great, and they dropped us off at the restaurant, and picked us up 2 hours later right in front. I could not believe it. My wife asked what they use if there are more that two passengers, and we were told that have an Escalade and a Luxury Coach for the bigger groups. We ended up taking the ride again another night, and the driver gave us a nice guided tour through La Jolla before dinner. We never touched our car the entire time we were there. We ate each breakfast, most lunches, and 1 big dinner at the resort. One very pleasant surprise was that the cost of the food was very reasonable by resort standards. We had a big breakfast each morning on our porch, and I remember thinking that the bill was about half of what I was expecting. The food at the bigger pool was great, and there was never a big crowd or a lot of noise. The dinner we had at Addison, their signature restaurant. We spent about a half hour at the bar talking with the bartender and manager who were both very generous and thoughtful. Once we were seated, we told the server to surprise us, and he did. The service was great, I think we had 6 different people attending to us, and the food was spectacular. We enjoyed 6 courses, and were delighted and surprised by each serving. Even after the drinks, the food, dessert, etc., I was again surprised that the bill was not higher. I golfed two separate days. The clubhouse and personnel were great, and the caddies were very helpful. The course itself was not in the greatest shape as they had recently over-seeded., and they were undergoing some maintenance on a few of the holes. After the second round, I thought I might mention something to one of the starters but never did. After another day, I mentioned my experience to the manger back at the resort. I told him the truth that while the course was not in \"excellent\" shape, I still played out my round and enjoyed the course. He told me how important it was that I mentioned it to him and thanked me for bringing it to his attention. He was very sincere, seemed genuinely concerned, and told me he would take care of it. Later that night we had a hand written note and an expensive gift in our room to thank us for telling him, and I learned on our final day that he had given us a significant credit to our bill to accommodate our experience on the course. I will say that this is by far one of the best experiences we have had at an exclusive resort. I have not even mentioned the great work out room, the number of free exercise sessions available to guests, the tennis clinic we took, the mountain bikes and trails right outside the gate, the spa sessions my wife loved, etc. Lastly, one other point of note-there was a large wedding at the resort on Saturday night. We had heard from some of the staff about the wedding, and jokingly told each other that it might be the one night that we would have to wait for a drink, seat, etc. Just the opposite. The wedding and most of the big halls are on another side of the resort, so that we never heard or even saw most of the group. I never would have known that they were hosting such a large event that evening. We live less than 50 miles from this resort, but will absolutely go there again and recommend it to everyone we know. We felt as if we were miles away, and it is one of those experiences were we were in vacation mode the minute we walked through the front door. It was spectacular.", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!!!!

We stayed there for two nights in a beautiful room that overlooked one of the pools. The staff was amazing and exceeded my expectations. The rooms are gorgeous and the bathtub is gigantic, perfect for bubble baths. The food was excellent. We dined at the restaurants and we also ordered room service a couple of times. The spa was equally great with a beautiful lounge area. The only downside was that the golf course had recently been worked on, and my husband said that the grass was difficult to play on becayse of this. Overall, I highly recommend this resort to people who are looking for a great relaxing vacation.

We were extremely impressed with the quality of service, even during what was presumably one of the busiest weekends of the year. We stayed at the hotel with our 5 month old baby. We requested a crib for the room when we made our reservations. The hotel contacted us before our stay and asked us the name of our baby. When we arrived in our room, the hotel had spelled out our baby's name in colorful sponges around the bathtub. The hotel also gave us a gift for the baby upon our arrival. We were blown away by the attention to detail. The food at the resort is better than most other hotel food, and there are plenty of options. We also thought the food was reasonably priced, especially compared to other hotels of this class. The pool area was very crowded, but the staff still managed to help us quickly. The hotel is a little isolated, so a car is a necessity. But, the isolation also makes for scenic views of the golf course and the mountains. The hotel is in a beautiful setting -- much nicer than the Four Seasons. The staff consistently impressed us. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to help us. The concierge and bell man remembered our name after our first meeting.

The hotel made our children feel welcome at every turn beginning with a welcome gift from a treasure chest upon check in. We arrived at noon, well in advance of regular check in time and were escorted directly to our room.. The room is a nice size, had two queen size beds with very comfortable linens, pillows etc. The bathroom is quite large, two sinks, separate toilet area, shower stall, tub and small tv, which the kids loved as they had never watched tv during a bath before! The small balcony was unfurnished, but when I called down for some chairs, they brought up very nice cushy chairs and a table immediately. We had a golf course view which was lovely. Our room was so quiet, there was no need to sleep with earplugs. Complimentary coffee was available in the lobby each morning with mini muffins and fresh lemonade and cookies in the afternoon. If you miss the morning coffee, there is a gourmet coffee shop with excellent coffee right on the main floor. They also have bagels and yogurt for those who prefer a light casual breakfast. The lounges by the pool were very comfortable and the servers were all very pleasant. There are a few pools here, one is adults only and is quite large and a huge hot tub. They lit the fire pit for us at night so we could roast marshmallows. They also offer s'mores through in room dining for $20 per person if you like. We had lunch at the golf club which was nice and they thankfully had a children's menu. The resort is very luxurious and the service all around was excellent, particularly the concierge. They were very helpful and knowledgeable about everything we needed. The resort is in not within walking distance of a town/shops. You need a car. It is close to attractions like Sea World, Lego land and Downtown San Diego - maybe 20 minutes to each attraction. Very close to La Jolla as well and various shopping malls. This worked out great for us as we struggled with whether or not to stay at the Four Seasons in Carlsbad. We are thrilled that we chose the Grand as the location was much better for us than staying further north and the resort was certainly on par with Four Seasons in all aspects. The Four Seasons is however closer to the beach and offers a Beach Butler service. I am not sure if the Grand offers this yet. The spa looked beautiful, but the staff was not too eager to let me look around. Since we were with the kids, I didn't get a chance to use the spa, but would not hesitate if we came back alone. I used the gym twice. It was very well appointed with many different cardio machines - treadmills, elliptical, step mill, bikes etc. Lots of free weights and weight machines, bosu and gym balls. Personal tv's on most equipment, lots of water, fruit and towels. I went for a run and upon my return was greeted at the front door with a towel and cold bottle of water! How nice! My kids used the games room once ($15/ child per hour). It is supervised and they have video games like Xbox, ping pong, lots of crafts. They staff there were super nice to the kids. It would be an idea for them to open in the evenings so parents could have dinner on the property while the kids are being entertained. So far they are only open til 5pm. The resort provided us with tennis racquets and balls. There are 2 courts. We really loved our stay at the Grand and will return if the prices don't rise. I highly recommend this new resort.", "Date": "August 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Grand Del Mar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d781627-Reviews-The_Grand_Del_Mar-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$442 - $541*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5300 Grand Del Mar Court</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92130</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "781627", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b7/94/b7944b216a6bfc3bfd9faf52098d9ead5large.jpg"}}
