We had booked a weekend including a boat tour of the canal on Sunday but this was cancelled because the canal was frozen for the first time in 15 years. Far from being a disappointment, this really enhanced the weekend allowing us to walk through Amsterdam on top of the water, with people skating past us. Wonderful! The hotel was well appointed and the staff were friendly and helpful. We booked a canal suite and this was lovely, on two floors with the Zensation white theme which was very relaxing and had every amenity you could think of including a sophisticated AV centre with DVD, iPod docking etc which was more than enough for anyone. The bed was huge and the view of the frozen canal was spectacular. On Saturday we dined in the Vinckles restaurant which is widely regarded as the best in Amsterdam and we find it hard to disagree, with the most sumptuous menu and an excellent accompanying wine list. We would definitely go there again. On Sunday we tried the 'high wine' evening, which was also well chosen and very enjoyable. Throughout both evenings the staff were friendly and courteous. The limo transfer from the airport was well worth it, with a friendly driver giving us a historical tour of Amsterdam on the way to the hotel. The hotel is sited just on the edge of the nine streets so perfect for shopping and coffee houses, and was about 20 minutes by car from Schiphol, so great for the quick weekend getaway.

Great for shopping. We have mixed feelings about our stay. Staff is very friendly, breakfast is good and some of the rooms are nice. However we had a Duplex room with a tiny bed. So, if possible avoid this room (number 18). We had asked for two similar rooms next to each other, since we were travelling with our two daugthers. At the time of booking this was not possible, we had to upgrade to a Duplex room (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac500/night), whereas our daughters stayed in a double room on the same floor. Upon arrival we asked once more, whether is was possible to have two adjacent rooms, but those were not available. When we went to bed, we discovered that the bed in our room was very small. The two person bed was not longer than 1.85m, which is very uncomfortable if you are 1.95 m tall! I was not amused, so we called reception in the middle of the night. At first they said all beds were 2 meters long, which I denied. The manager on duty came up, and admitted the bed was quite short! The offered us another room (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac395/night), with a normal bed...next to our daugthers' room! It was very unpleasant to move rooms in the middle of the night, to finally end up in the room you had originally asked for! The next morning I asked to pay for the room we slept in, which was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac105 cheaper than the room we originally got. The hotel didn't accept this and instead offered us breakfast. I was quite amazed how this was handled. You move guests in the middle of the night to another (cheaper) room, and then make them pay for the other room?!? Disappointing.

I was given the websites address to choose a \"themed\" room, for our visit. They have themed rooms there. Oh boy..... (!) Well, I made a mistake and chose the \"Loft.\" On line, I thought it looked fun. And better to stay in an A- framed style wooden loft when in Holland, than an Asian style room! When in Rome... right? I cannot say that it was all bad, nor all pleasant. But not a hotel I would chose again, regardless of the room. If you go and are traveling with children (as I can be like, at times) this \"loft\" may serve one well. The living area is spacious. I chose to sleep there, instead of the bed. My friend kept hitting his head on the upper doorway when passing through certain walkways (like the steps down into the bathroom). I found this rather amusing, though! Beware... The bathroom was large, but had NO doors. Privacy is necessary for just about anyone who uses modern cutlery and walks upright. My companion was annoyed that he was too tall for he shower. My companion stands about five feet- nine inches. Not a basket ball player, nor a model! We both found it very drafty. When time to depart, I had called for assistance for the luggage twice. Nobody ever arrived. I began to depart this \"loft\" via the private staircase that was circular, uneven, and made of wood that was warped. I managed to get a piece of luggage tightly suspended between the walls, stick in mid- air. I was SO lucky that a neighbor had heard the sounds of my trouble, and came to aid me. Thankfully, he even helped me all the way through the long lobby and over to the front desk. A very long walk when with four cases! Incredibly kind! The lobby is lovely. The reception area is nice. The location is very good. Will I go back? No. Nor can I recommend this hotel to anyone I like! I wish I could say that they \"tried.\" But even so, this was not the case.

I specifically requested the Kimono ahead of time; recommend you look at the various room styles the Dylan offers and choose one in advance, since each is so vastly different. The room was fantastically designed - sliding doors between the bathroom and the rest of the room allowed you to have everything completely open. It was amazing to take a bath while looking outside at the houses lining the canals. Our room also had a cozy couch with plenty of great reading material on the side tables - design/travel books and magazines, amsterdam-specific, etc. Lots of attention to detail with superb little touches in general. The one thing the Dylan could improve in the rooms would be an update to the outdated CD Bose system. There was a jack for our iPod still though. STAFF: Really made this hotel stand out. Especially considering that service in Holland leaves a lot to be desired. Whatever we requested was brought to the room within mintutes, with a smile (extra towels, ironing board, etc). We had a very charming bartender who kicked off our NYE in style - thanks, Pascal! Also special thanks to Joost.

I read the previous review from the couple that had a terrible stay at The Dylan and am perplexed by their experience b/c our stay could not have been more perfect. Our flight arrived very early in the morning and we were pleasantly surprised to learn our room was ready. Two of the staff met us in the courtyard to assist us with our bags and the front desk was fully staffed and completely professional. They knew our names before we even sat down to check-in. We stayed in a Loft style suite that had windows overlooking the courtyard. It was a charming, Dutch style room with steep stairs leading up to the large sitting area. The ceilings were pitched with exposed beams lending to the charm. The room was bright, clean and airy. The large bathroom had a separate shower and large soaking tub. All of the bathroom amenities were from Molton Brown. There were two televisions in the room and complimentary Wi-Fi. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. For those people who have never visited Amsterdam, The Dylan is very centrally located unlike some of the larger chains like the Intercontinental Amstel. We used the tram system and walked everywhere and did not need to use taxis\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we have been to Amsterdam quite a few times so we are familiar with the transit system. For those who are first time visitors, The Dylan always asks if you need a taxi and are happy to arrange transportation to the airport, dinners, etc. The breakfast served at the hotel is exceptional especially for a continental buffet spread. We were expecting just a few rolls and some coffee but every morning there was yogurt, granola, cereal, cold cuts, cheese, breads, pastries, fruit, fresh squeezed juice & you can order eggs any way that you like. It is served in a room w/ exposed brick that served as a bakery complete with the original ovens. While the previous reviewer notes that Amsterdam is not a foodie city, every meal we had was solid. Unfortunately we were there only for 3 nights as we had a list of places to try like Marius. The concierge at the hotel booked every reservation for us and even managed to snag us a last minute booking at De Kas, which was a real treat. Unfortunately, we were not able to use bicycles available at the hotel (They are not free but available for a small fee) as it rained the day we had reserved them. They are limited so if you really want to use them on your stay, I would suggest emailing the hotel and booking them in advance. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a researcher by nature and have read all the reviews and while our room was light and airy it seems that some of the rooms are darker due to the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The common rooms at the hotel (restaurant, bar) are definitely dark due to the manner in which they are decorated (dark wood, etc.) but it is a boutique hotel and really no different than other trendy hotels. The style definitely mirrors our own (clean lines, more modern) but some people may prefer something else. No detail is overlooked at this hotel. We always had fresh apples & water in our room everyday. We had beautiful orchids decorating our room and throughout the hotel. There are blankets on the furniture in the courtyard so you can sit out even when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit chilly. And one last mention about the staff at The Dylan. Every correspondence that I had with the hotel prior to my trip and every interaction that we had with staff during our stay was extremely pleasant & professional. Every single time we walked in and out, we were greeted by no less than 4 people (front desk, bartenders, concierge, etc.), which is why my husband and I cannot understand the previous reviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience at the front desk. For 4 days, we never saw less than 2 people sitting at the front desk. Is this hotel for everyone? Perhaps not but if you, like us, enjoy not being an anonymous guest in a huge chain hotel then The Dylan is perfect for you.

We couldn't disagree more about this hotel. I requested an early check-in since we were due to arrive to the hotel by 8:00 a.m., and only had the one day/night in Amsterdam. I received a very courteous reply which stated that they'd try to accommodate my room preference and early arrival, but no guarantees. We arrived as scheduled, received a welcome juice and were told by the front desk staff that our room would be cleaned shortly. She asked us if we'd like to have breakfast while waiting. Well, so far so good. The hotel facade and lobby looked lovely, and it appeared that our room would be available shortly as well; good news since we hadn't slept all night and just wanted a good nap before setting off to explore the city. Although we weren't hungry, we decided to kill time at the limited breakfast buffet. We each had a cup of coffee. My husband had some cheese, and I had a roll. Little did we know the \"buffet\" was $50 USD/person! That's right...we paid $100 for two coffees, some cheese and a roll. Our mistake - I suppose we should have asked the price or looked at the menu. The buffet was very sparse; I can't imagine any of it being worth $50/person. After \"breakfast,\" we went to check on the room. It still wasn't ready, but the front desk assured us it would be cleaned soon. We sat down to wait in the lounge section of the hotel. To make a long story short, we wound up waiting three hours for a room to open because they kept telling us it would only be a few minutes. With only one day to explore the city, we wish they would have just told us when we checked in that a room would not be available earlier than noon. We could have spent that time seeing the city instead of the dark interior of their smoky lounge. Although the restaurant and lobby are stylish, the room was a disappointment. The view was of a roof and looked directly into other windows. The headboard was stained. The sheets were scratchy. The towels were cheap. The modern-styled glass bathroom doors squealed loudly when moved and didn't fit into their grooves. A complimentary evening snack was delivered to our room, which was a nice touch until we realized it was meant for someone else. The room service I ordered later that night arrived incomplete, cold and inedible.

There is a lot of staff, ranging in competence from very high to very low, generally coolly impersonal but always polite and attempting to accommodate clients' needs - from printing out documents to getting train information. Internet access is available in the rooms at no charge. There are nice towels, robes, slippers, and toiletries. The hotel is highly designed - actually, so highly designed as to be contrived. It has enough drawbacks that I'd advise booking a different hotel if the price to quality ratio matters. The hotel is in love with the colors terra cotta and black. Black works well in rooms that are large and get a fair amount of sunlight. It works badly in small rooms with little natural light. But the hotel uses the same palette regardless of size and light availability. I occupied 3 rooms over a 4-day period. Two of them were \"luxury singles\" (19 and 6); they should be avoided. At 325 euros, they are exceptionally poor value. One room was a double (41, in the new annex) and was excellent, with a few qualifications: no bedside reading lights, no tub, a soiled slipcover on a chair, a window very difficult to raise and lower, only a single small ledge in the shower enclosure. Those may sound like significant qualifications but they are minor compared to the problems with the luxury singles. Number 19 is on the small side; the walls are painted with deep horizontal bands of terra cotta and black and curtained with a heavy material using vertical terra cotta and black stripes. The curtains \"puddle\" on the floor but are so heavy that instead of puddling they drape in an ungainly fashion. The bed is a fourposter. The room is overpowered by the furniture, which also includes two rattan armoire-type cabinets flanking the bathroom. But the real problems with the room were a toilet that flushed very sluggishly, finding 3 squares of toilet paper a trial; flaking paint in the bathtub where the shower attached to the wall; a shower curtain that was dirty at the bottom; light switches that could only be reached by sliding one's hand between the wall and the armoire; a television that faced a bedside table instead of the bed; a door to the bathroom which could not be slid shut because it ran into one of the armoires. The staff apologized and courteously put me in another room - 41, a double - when I asked for one that was more comfortable. That room wore its black and white theme well, got copious sunshine, and was spacious. Because someone else had booked 41 I moved again to a luxury single, number 6. This room seemed even smaller than 19, appeared cheaply furnished, and was extremely depressing because of all the black and the absence of natural light. Here too the toilet labored. An odd feature of the tubs is a marble ledge which runs around them. The ledge is nice, because you can put things on it. But if you want to lie in the tub for a good soak, you have a problem with that ledge which juts out over the back of the tub. A doubled-over towel ameliorates but doesn't completely solve the problem. This is one of many small examples of overdesign that reduces comfort.

You won't be disappointed. The Dylan is listed among \"The Best Small Hotels of the World\" for good reason. I'm a regular business traveler who's stayed at some pretty amazing places, but this was right up there with my favorites. First, the location is perfect -- perfectly picturesque. The Dylan sits on a quiet street facing one of Amsterdam's flowing canals. You're just a short walk from most major attractions -- incredible museums (like the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum), the historic Anne Frank House and the famed Red Light District. The small alleyways nearby feature plenty of nice shops, pubs and cafes. My room at the Dylan was small but appointed beautifully. I walked in to a classical music serenade and immediately slipped under the sheets to rest up from the transatlantic fatigue. The room had many conveniences -- great bath products (I'm a sucker for Molton Brown), fluffy towels and a nice sound system. For about 40 more euros a night, my colleague enjoyed somewhat more lavish accommodations (her room was larger and looked out on a lovely courtyard), but there doesn't appear to be a subpar room in this hotel. We visited the city on business and benefitted from the free wireless Internet access throughout the hotel. The restaurant is lovely, but I hear the food doesn't measure up to the decor. So, skip the meal, plop down on one of the lounge's cushy sofas and enjoy a cocktail.

The front desk guy was so helpful and welcoming. Our room was large and gorgeous. I loved the decor - very Danish Modern. There was a bottle of Crystal Champagne and snacks and a note from the staff congratulating us on our marriage. The concierge was our lifeline for everything we did. So helpful with restaurants and where to go and how to get there. They gave us change, made dinner reservations, we rented bikes from them and rode them all around at night. Highly recommend doing that. It's located in the heart of town on a beautiful canal so we walked everywhere from The Dylan. They also called a cab for us to get back to the hotel. I found the service at the front desk excellent. There are some design flaws the other reviewers mentioned like the sink faucets the water kinda spills out in a weird way. We had to duck down to see ourselves in the mirror which would make shaving very hard. The plumbing is old and the pillows were a little hard. The breakfast spread is nice, but the service was realllly slow. I found that everywhere we went in Amsterdam. It's not a service oriented culture. So, The Dylan's breakfast staff was just about as slow as the rest of the city's. Overall, If you're an older tourist type of person, this hip hotel is probably not for you anyway.

There is so much more to a trendy boutique hotel than just a beautiful building and unfortunately this is the only thing going for the Dylan.

We had early check-in booked as we were on an early flight, however the room was not ready until almost 3pm, none of the staff offered an explaination or apologised for the inconvenience. Check-in to the room, only to have house keeping come in about 10min after arrival to re-stock the mini bar, explaining they had not had time to do it yet, but would do it now so we would not be charged for missing items. Unbelievable. The rooms whilst supposedly designer chic, are ridiculously over designed. We had the kimono/japanese inspired room which required you to bend over to see into the bathroom mirror, sit on your knees to have a shave, or use the small shaving mirror which was located on the adjacent wall, but the lighting cast a massive shadow which made this useless. The shower dribbled against the wall, so we got the maintenance person to put a new one in, only to find it was equally useless. The rooms have a table and chair at the end of the bed, or a couch, located directly under the plasma tv on the wall, again useless. Not really designer chic! We expressed our concerns to the hotel manager who advised we could not be moved on out first night, but he could change our room on the second. Not wanting the hassle we opted to stay in the existing room, and having spoken to other guests it sounds as though the other rooms are equally overdesigned, although we did not see them first hand.
